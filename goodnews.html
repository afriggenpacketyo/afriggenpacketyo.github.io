          <p>A new music collection, "Sunset Boulevard," documents the final creative burst of Elvis Presley's career between 1972 and 1975, recorded before his death in 1977. The article reflects on this period, highlighting his disappointment over losing a role in "A Star Is Born," which some friends believe marked a turning point in his decline. The set showcases Presley's evolution into an expressive ballad singer, featuring hits like "Burning Love" and capturing his studio sessions and rehearsals with his TCB Band, offering a poignant look at a music icon grappling with his place in a changing cultural landscape.</p>

          <p>Sunderland marked their return to the Premier League with a decisive 3-0 victory over West Ham, their first top-flight win in August in over a decade. After a significant summer spending spree of around £132 million on new talent, the team demonstrated strong cohesion and skill. Goals from Championship play-off heroes Eliezer Mayenda and Dan Ballard, along with a late addition by Wilson Isidor, secured the win. Pundits praised the team's organization and energy, suggesting the performance is a promising sign for their ability to remain in the top division.</p>

          <p>A rare subtropical wood stork, a species typically found in Gulf Coast states, was unexpectedly sighted in Columbia County, Wisconsin, approximately 1,000 miles from its home. The bird, listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, is believed to be a juvenile that got lost while exploring. This sighting highlights a positive trend for the species, whose population has grown from 5,000 nesting pairs in the 1970s to over 11,000 today due to protection efforts. However, experts note that climate change and habitat destruction continue to pose ongoing threats to their survival.</p>

          <p>Samsung is regaining ground against Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share increasing from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors compared to the standard iPhone design. While Apple still leads the market, Samsung's wider range of price points and new designs are creating renewed competition, with Apple expected to release its own foldable phone by 2026.

          <p>The Oval Invincibles cricket team shattered the record for the highest total in The Hundred's history, scoring an impressive 226-4 in an 83-run victory against Welsh Fire. The standout performance came from Jordan Cox, who scored 86 runs from just 29 balls, including a record-equaling 10 sixes. This dominant win places the two-time defending champions at the top of the league table, tied on points with two other teams but leading on net run-rate.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are strongly encouraging adults over the age of 60 to incorporate salmon into their diet to support heart health. Salmon is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower bad LDL cholesterol, raise good HDL cholesterol, and reduce inflammation. These benefits contribute to healthier blood vessels and a lower risk of heart attack and stroke. Since the heart is a muscle, consuming adequate protein is also vital for maintaining its strength and function as people age. Experts suggest eating omega-3-rich fish twice a week, prepared by baking or grilling.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is making a major comeback to the UK High Street, with plans to open new standalone stores for the first time since its collapse in 2020. The relaunch was kicked off with its first catwalk show in seven years, held in London's Trafalgar Square. Now owned by online retailer Asos, the brand aims to leverage nostalgia while also attracting a new generation of shoppers with its signature "London girl look." Industry experts note that while there is affection for the brand, its success will depend on navigating a competitive market and proving it can regain its former cultural relevance.</p>

          <p>A Phoenix-based startup, Steel + Spark, is repurposing old shipping containers to create rapidly deployable shelters for the city's unhoused population. Architect Brian Stark designed the "X-WING" units, each made of four containers providing five individual, air-conditioned rooms. The design is both cost-effective and environmentally friendly, as it utilizes existing materials and can be constructed in just one week. The project aims to provide a dignified, private space for residents to stabilize their lives, with plans to expand the concept to build an affordable apartment complex for low-income seniors.</p>
