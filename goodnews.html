          <p>The rise of techno-nationalism is transforming global strategies as countries prioritize technological sovereignty and competition. The EU, Japan, South Korea, and India are implementing policies to bolster domestic tech capabilities and diversify supply chains.

The US and China are engaged in a rivalry, with the US imposing restrictions on chip exports and China tightening controls on critical minerals.

          <p>China's recent military parade, marking 80 years since the end of World War II, received high praise from its allies, particularly those in Asia and the developing world. These countries view the parade as a demonstration of China's growing military strength and diplomatic influence. However, the reaction in the West was more subdued. President Xi Jinping used the event to present China as a stabilizing global power, emphasizing the choice between peace and war. </p>

          <p>A theft charge against a man accused of stealing flowers from tributes to Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham has been dropped. Prosecutors withdrew the charge after a court heard that a security guard had given Parviz Jafari permission to take the flowers. The charge was withdrawn because it could not be proven that the defendant had been dishonest when he took the flowers. The tributes were left near the Black Sabbath bench and mural following Osbourne's death in July. </p>

          <p>China is aiming to overtake the US as a global superpower, expanding its international role through economic and political dominance. President Xi Jinping's vision includes transforming China into a modern socialist country by 2049.

Concerns persist about labor rights and environmental protection in these projects. The "China model" is gaining support in the Global South, with some leaders calling on African countries to learn from it. </p>

          <p>With schools reopening after a record-breaking summer, districts face challenges in managing extreme heat, prompting discussions on modernizing HVAC systems, increasing shade, and rethinking school calendars. Rearranging the academic calendar has become a tactic for school districts to tackle the issue, with some considering replacing summer vacation with spring or fall breaks. Experts emphasize the need for governmental guidelines and data collection on school buildings to address the climate risk effectively. The health stakes are real, with children being especially vulnerable during heatwaves. </p>
