          <p>Despite a general slowdown in deal-making among single-family offices, artificial intelligence startups continue to attract significant investment. In April, AI-related ventures accounted for half of all direct deals made by these firms. Quantitative AI firm SandboxAQ, led by CEO Jack Hidary, recently closed a $450 million Series E round, backed by billionaires and their family offices, including Eric Schmidt's Hillspire, Ray Dalio's family office, Google, and Nvidia. Hidary notes that professionally managed family offices and large institutions have developed a greater appetite for deep-tech startups, recognizing their lower risk compared to consumer-oriented tech companies.</p>

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized that the aging system requires modernization to prevent similar incidents. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian expressed support for the upgrades, acknowledging the current system's limitations and the need for government investment.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering a home equity line of credit (HELOC) this May should be aware of minimum draw requirements that could impact borrowing costs. Lenders may require an upfront draw, ongoing minimum usage during the draw period, or both, potentially leading to interest charges on funds not immediately needed. These rules can complicate repayment strategies and increase the total cost of borrowing, especially with variable-rate HELOCs. Borrowers should inquire about these requirements and consider alternatives if the terms don't align with their borrowing plans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced a trade agreement framework with the United Kingdom, the first such deal since pausing "reciprocal" tariffs. The agreement maintains a 10% tariff on U.K. imports, adjusts tariffs on U.K. autos, and creates opportunities for new U.S. exports, especially in agriculture. The deal also includes commitments on intellectual property, labor, and the environment, as well as a secure supply chain for pharmaceutical products. Some experts downplayed the impact, noting that the U.S. has a trade surplus with the U.K., and this model may not be replicable with countries where the U.S. has a trade deficit.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to unveil a "most favored nation" plan to cut Medicare drug prices, sources told CBS News. This plan, previously attempted during his first term, would tie the price of some high-cost Medicare drugs to the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in other countries. The Biden administration abandoned the proposal in 2022, citing court orders and concerns that it could cut off some Medicare beneficiaries from drugs and strain providers. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hinted at the possibility of the policy returning, pointing to higher prices in Europe for the diabetes drug Ozempic.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a deal over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries. President Donald Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world remains in place and still applies to most UK goods entering the US. The deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium. Trump had placed import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US on top of the existing 2.5%. This has been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, which matches the number of cars the UK exported last year. The US has previously demanded the import tax be cut to 2.5%, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated she is open to such a cut.</p>
