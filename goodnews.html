          <p>China and Central Asian nations have expressed shared security concerns at a recent summit, signaling closer ties amidst global instability. While the Kremlin dismisses concerns about waning Russian influence, diplomatic observers note Moscow's limited capacity to counterbalance China's growing presence in the region. Beijing is careful not to directly challenge Russia's role as a security guarantor, but its economic and diplomatic clout is undeniably increasing. The summit highlights the shifting dynamics in Central Asia as Russia remains preoccupied with the conflict in Ukraine. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly hiring Daniel Gross, CEO of Safe Superintelligence, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman to work on AI products under Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang. This move follows a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI and reflects Meta's determination to compete with Google and OpenAI in developing advanced AI models.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank has kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged after cutting them last month, a decision influenced by a trade deal with the U.S. that eased some growth worries. The People's Bank of China held the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with market expectations. Trade war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade. Chinese authorities may explore alternative avenues to stimulate economic growth, placing less emphasis on interest rate cuts (not investment advice). The optimism score for this article is 65.</p>
