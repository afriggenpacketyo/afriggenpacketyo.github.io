Additionally, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Anne Tyler will discuss her new book, "Three Days in June," and the show will remember notable figures who have recently passed away, including actor George Wendt.</p>

          <h2>Study Shows Work Stress in Dog Owners Can Transfer to Their Pets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 22:10:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study finds that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may pass their anxiety on to their dogs. The research surveyed 85 working dog owners and found that those with higher job stress had dogs who exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This connection is attributed to "crossover," where stress spills over from one person to another, and "emotional contagion," where dogs pick up on human feelings through subtle cues. The article suggests that employed dog owners might benefit from avoiding work-related ruminations when at home to protect the well-being of their pets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough behind what they claim is the world's fastest electromagnetic coilgun. The coilgun is capable of firing at 3,000 rounds per minute. This greatly surpasses traditional firearms and US commercial models. The breakthrough centers on eliminating capacitors, the traditional Achilles' heel of electromagnetic weapons, and powering the coilgun directly with lithium batteries. This innovation is detailed in China's Journal of Gun Launch & Control.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's two-run double in the fourth inning proved decisive in the New York Mets' 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers' overworked bullpen forced them to rely heavily on starter Tony Gonsolin, who struggled with command after a strong start. Gonsolin's walks loaded the bases, setting up Soto's key hit, while Mets starter David Peterson pitched effectively for nearly eight innings. The game highlighted the Dodgers' pitching depth issues and Soto's potential impact for the Mets.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to improve working conditions for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions by increasing their annual salaries to over 6 million yen ($41,000). This is up from the current average of 4 to 4.5 million yen, due to intensifying competition for talent as Japanese cuisine grows in popularity worldwide. The chefs will also be allowed to opt for government-covered rented accommodation instead of serving as live-in chefs. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the significant role of chefs in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food.</p>
