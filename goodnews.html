          <p>England legend Wayne Rooney has defended his "golden generation" teammates, asserting they had a strong attitude and "tried" their best, despite never reaching a major tournament semi-final. His comments come after former captain Steven Gerrard suggested the team's lack of success was due to players being "egotistical losers" who weren't a cohesive unit. Rooney, who played 120 times for England, acknowledged the difficulty of forming strong relationships between rival club players at the time but insisted everyone worked hard. This article notes that he contrasts this with today's squad, highlighting improved media relations and different generational dynamics.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of Plaid Cymru, has announced his party's readiness to replace Welsh Labour at the upcoming Senedd election, promising a "new government, with new energy and new ideas." Labour has led Wales since devolution began in 1999, but recent polling suggests Plaid Cymru is now vying for leadership, alongside Reform UK. Ap Iorwerth aims to position Plaid as the leading anti-Reform party, focusing on "radical" policies like a payment to tackle child poverty, rather than independence. This article highlights the shifting political landscape and the challenge Plaid faces in broadening its appeal.</p>

          <p>Councils across London are set to receive £36.5 million in government funding to address the city's homelessness crisis this winter, targeting rough sleeping and families in temporary accommodation. With one in 50 Londoners homeless and record numbers of children in temporary housing, the funding is deemed "critical" by London Councils. The investment, part of a larger £84 million distribution across England, includes specific allocations for rough sleeping prevention, family support, and drug/alcohol treatment. This article highlights that while welcomed by Mayor Sadiq Khan and charities like Crisis, calls remain for a more comprehensive, long-term strategy to tackle the escalating issue.</p>

          <p>Prince William was visibly moved during a conversation with Rhian Mannings, who shared the devastating impact of her husband's suicide, which occurred five days after their one-year-old son's death. Mannings, who subsequently founded the bereavement charity 2wish, highlighted the persistent stigma around suicide. In response, Prince William's Royal Foundation is contributing £1 million to establish a National Suicide Prevention Network across the UK. This article notes that the initiative, launched on World Mental Health Day, aims to better understand suicide's root causes, offer comprehensive support, and foster greater collaboration among relevant agencies and charities to address this preventable tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have made a significant discovery: adding salt to ice enables it to generate electricity when bent. This breakthrough, building on earlier research into flexoelectricity in ice, reveals that salt-doped ice can produce an electrical response comparable to high-performance ceramic materials. This article highlights the potential for this technology to harness clean power in cold environments, offering a low-cost energy source. This innovative approach could open new avenues for sustainable energy generation in regions where traditional methods are less viable, demonstrating a novel application of material science.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) concerning Kendrick Lamar's song "Not Like Us," which accused Drake of being a "certified paedophile." The judge ruled Lamar's lyrics were "nonactionable opinion" within the context of a heated rap battle, rather than verifiable facts. Drake's legal team had accused UMG of promoting a "false and malicious narrative," but this article notes UMG expressed satisfaction with the ruling, calling the lawsuit an "affront to all artists and their creative expression." Drake plans to appeal this decision, which arose from "the most infamous rap battle in the genre's history."</p>

          <p>China's top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) have jointly published a policy paper outlining measures to limit intense, "disorderly" price competition within certain industries. This article notes that this initiative aims to prevent price wars and self-destructive cost-cutting practices that harm industry development, innovation, and product quality. Regulators will guide industry associations to evaluate production costs and help companies set reasonable prices, with warnings and interventions planned for violations of pricing laws.
