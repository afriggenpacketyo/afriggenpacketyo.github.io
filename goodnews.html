          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts, potentially reaching ¬£1,000, due to the scandal involving the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies will provide over ¬£70 million in compensation and financial support after a review by Ofgem revealed suppliers improperly switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent. Customers could receive payments ranging from ¬£40 to ¬£1,000, depending on their treatment, and some may have debts written off. A new code of practice is now in place to prevent future inappropriate installations, with stricter conditions for companies seeking to install prepayment meters without customer consent. The intervention seeks to correct mistreatment and prevent the recurrence of such practices.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors will not seek the death penalty against Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the son of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin "El Chapo," if he is convicted of multiple charges in Chicago.

Joaquin Guzman Lopez and his brother, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, allegedly ran a faction of the Sinaloa cartel known as the "Chapitos," which is identified as a main exporter of fentanyl to the U.S. Ovidio Guzman Lopez was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the United States and is scheduled to appear in court on July 9 to change his plea as part of a deal with prosecutors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to new research from Vanguard, having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing high income or asset levels. The survey of over 12,000 Vanguard investors found that those with emergency savings report greater financial well-being. Behavioral economist Paulo Costa noted that this initial $2,000 makes a significant difference, providing confidence in handling unexpected expenses. The median cost of an emergency is about $2,000, and having this cash readily available reduces financial anxiety and time spent worrying about finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesco's introduction of AI technology at self-checkouts, featuring overhead cameras and live-action replays, has been met with mixed reactions from shoppers. The supermarket aims to reduce shoplifting by identifying unscanned items, but customers have joked about the technology resembling VAR in football. While some mocked the tech, others expressed concerns about privacy and surveillance. The move follows a record high in shoplifting in the UK, with retailers reporting millions of thefts costing billions of pounds.</p>
