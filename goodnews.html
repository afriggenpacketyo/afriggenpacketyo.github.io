          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has firmly stated his commitment to running for re-election, rejecting reports that President Donald Trump's advisors proposed him for an ambassadorship to Saudi Arabia to exit the race. Adams, currently struggling in polls for the effectively four-way contest, angrily denounced former Governor Andrew Cuomo as a "snake and a liar," accusing him of trying to push Black candidates out of races. Trump had suggested Cuomo as the best challenger to frontrunner Zohran Mamdani. Adams asserted he is the only candidate capable of defeating Mamdani, pledging to serve another four years as mayor.</p>

Despite having aged out of the opportunity years ago, Broussard relearned the tuba and underwent a highly competitive audition process, making him the oldest member by 41 years. The LSU Marching Band director, Simon Holoweiko, confirmed no special treatment was given, emphasizing the rigorous selection. Broussard's inspiring story, ahead of his first game, highlights the importance of pursuing passions and stepping out of one's comfort zone, proving it's never too late to chase a dream.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has proposed a compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could elevate his net worth above $1 trillion if the company meets ambitious benchmarks over the next decade. This includes growing Tesla's value from $1.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion and achieving production goals like one million Robotaxis and humanoid robots. The proposal, which requires shareholder approval, aims to retain Musk and align his performance with Tesla's long-term financial success, as he currently lacks a long-term CEO performance award. This article notes the package arrives as Musk's previous $50 billion pay deal remains in legal limbo after being struck down by a Delaware judge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan and Haitian migrants is unlawful. This decision allows approximately 1.1 million individuals from these nations to continue living and working legally in the U.S., despite the Department of Homeland Security's intention to appeal. The judge argued that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's actions violated the law, as conditions in their home countries remain too dangerous for return. This article highlights the ongoing legal battle over immigration policies and the program designed to protect migrants from unstable regions.</p>

He emphasizes the significant tax implications, noting a lump sum in high-tax states could net only about $400 million.
