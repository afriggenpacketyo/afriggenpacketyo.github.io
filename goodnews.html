          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, a British couple detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months, have been released and are returning to the UK. Their son, Jonathan Reynolds, expressed immense gratitude for their release, which was secured through Qatar-brokered negotiations. The couple, who had lived in Afghanistan for nearly two decades running a charitable program, expressed a desire to return despite their detention for unspecified Afghan law violations. Their release follows months of family lobbying highlighting their deteriorating health during captivity.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses, boasting a record 31-match winning streak, are set to face France in the Rugby World Cup semi-final. Despite England's statistical dominance and France's 16 consecutive losses against them, the French team remains defiant, emphasizing that past statistics don't dictate a World Cup semi-final outcome. France, however, faces significant injury setbacks to key players. The match, if France wins, would mark their first Women's Rugby World Cup final appearance, creating a "waking nightmare" for England, who are determined to secure their spot.</p>

Minnesota, with the best regular-season record, swept their first round but were challenged. Phoenix, having upset the Liberty, is confident, noting they weren't fully healthy in prior matchups.
