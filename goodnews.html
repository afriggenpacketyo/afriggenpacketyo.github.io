          <p>Seven & i Holdings Co., the Japanese operator of the Seven-Eleven convenience store chain, has appointed Stephen Hayes Dacus as its first foreign CEO. This decision comes as the retail giant aims to enhance corporate value amidst a takeover bid by Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., the operator of Circle K convenience stores. Dacus stated his goal to achieve faster growth in the next decade by focusing on the convenience store business, which has experienced slowing growth in Japan and the United States. The company is currently examining both the buyout offer and the option of remaining independent, while also implementing restructuring plans such as selling its supermarket business and considering a U.S. listing for its U.S. 7-Eleven business unit.</p>

Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake reviews.
