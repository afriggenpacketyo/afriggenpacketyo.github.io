          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices surged to record highs following the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's election of Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, positioning her as a potential first female prime minister. Takaichi's pro-stimulus stance and expected continuation of accommodative monetary policy by the Bank of Japan fueled investor optimism. Gains were particularly strong in real estate, technology, and consumer cyclical stocks. This market reaction reflects confidence in her proposed economic strategy, which aims to expand investment and demand through public-private partnerships, signaling a potential shift in policy direction.

A significant surge in cross-border financial flows between Hong Kong and mainland China this year underscores the city's enduring advantage as a bridge for global ambitions and a proving ground for financial innovation. Hu highlighted examples like the first yuan-denominated dual listing in Astana, showcasing Hong Kong's unique capacity to facilitate China's economic initiatives on the international stage.

          <p>President Trump has urged negotiators to "move fast" on a Gaza peace deal, expressing optimism about "very positive discussions" and hopes for a hostage release within the week, two years after the initial Hamas attack. Delegations from Israel, Hamas, and the U.S. are convening in Cairo to discuss the proposed plan, which includes the release of remaining hostages and a potential disarmament of Hamas, though the latter remains a point of contention. While Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed hope for a quick hostage release, he signaled there would be no full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the immediate priority of hostage release and the long-term goal of building a Gaza free of terrorism.</p>

This "no-fault" system, funded by a tax on childhood vaccines, aims to compensate injured individuals without requiring proof of negligence, thereby encouraging vaccine development. The article also addresses the program's history, its criteria for compensation, and ongoing criticisms regarding significant court delays and the controversial exclusion of autism from its list of eligible injuries.</p>

          <p>China is significantly increasing its investment in artificial intelligence and high-end chip production, aiming to challenge the long-standing dominance of U.S. companies like Nvidia. Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba and Huawei, have recently unveiled new chips, with Huawei announcing a three-year plan to directly compete with Nvidia in the AI market. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledges China's rapid progress and vast talent pool, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to intensify its own competition. Despite China's state-led approach and ongoing reliance on some high-end American technology, experts believe the country is rapidly closing the gap, positioning these developments as a potential "bargaining chip" in trade negotiations.

          <p>Police have arrested Joseph Mayuyo, a 33-year-old Hawthorne man, in connection with a series of online threats directed at TikTok's Culver City headquarters. The threats, made on social media on Friday, prompted security to evacuate the Bristol Parkway location. Authorities traced the threats to Mayuyo's Hawthorne home, where he subsequently made further online threats and declared he would not be taken alive. After a 90-minute standoff with crisis negotiators, Mayuyo surrendered peacefully and was booked on a charge of making criminal threats, effectively neutralizing the immediate danger to TikTok employees and the facility.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent decision to raise H-1B visa fees to $100,000 has spurred Indian policymakers to actively encourage skilled professionals to return from the United States. This move is seen as an opportunity for India to engineer a "reverse brain drain," attracting talent in technology, medicine, and other innovative industries back home. While some Indians are already relocating due to a perceived hostile U.S. immigration environment, experts caution that achieving a large-scale return will be challenging. Factors such as growing opportunities in India's Global Capability Centres and competing "golden visa" programs from other countries will influence this complex migration trend.

          <p>The UK government has unveiled significant reforms aimed at streamlining the housing market, with the goal of cutting costs, reducing delays, and halving the number of failed property transactions. Key proposals include legally mandating that sellers and estate agents provide comprehensive upfront information about properties, such as condition and leasehold costs. Additionally, the government is considering introducing binding contracts to prevent parties from withdrawing late in the process, which currently costs the UK economy an estimated £1.5 billion annually. These changes are projected to save first-time buyers an average of £710 and shorten the typical transaction timeline by up to four weeks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that Mohamed Salah's reduced defensive contribution is becoming a "little problem" for Liverpool, especially when facing stronger opponents. This dynamic often leads to a 2v1 overload on the right flank, leaving Liverpool's right-back exposed due to insufficient cover from midfielders. While manager Arne Slot may be allowing Salah to conserve energy for attacking, the article notes that this strategy is exacerbated by Salah's current scoring slump, amplifying scrutiny on his defensive work. The piece also highlights Liverpool's overall perceived lack of game control compared to the previous season, despite the team remaining competitive in the league standings.</p>

          <p>Historian Martin Powers discusses his unique approach to studying imperial Chinese society and government through visual art, which he argues can reveal widespread political ideas more effectively than textual analysis alone. He explains that art "participates" in political debate by depicting how intergroup relations, such as those between rich and poor, were understood by audiences, offering valuable insights into social history. Powers highlights the concept of "honor" in aristocracies, characterized by arbitrary privilege and arbitrary power, as a pervasive idea seen in Chinese art from the 12th century into the 20th. He suggests that these historical Chinese political ideas continue to resonate with aspects of contemporary Western societies.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer argues that the current speculative bull market, characterized by parabolic moves in tech stocks, persists despite potential headwinds like government shutdowns, due to "circular reasoning" and a perceived "Trump put." He highlights the significant "post-'Liberation Day'" rally and the emergence of a new generation of buyers who chase high-growth, future-oriented companies, often ignoring profitability. Cramer attributes much of this market strength to Nvidia's exceptional performance and the broader artificial intelligence revolution, which he sees as driving a fourth industrial revolution. Despite this "magical investing" environment, Cramer advises investors to take some profits off the table. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece advocates for China to fundamentally shift its economic strategy from being the world's largest exporter to becoming the largest importer within the next five to ten years. This proposed new course, which is expected to be deliberated during the upcoming 15th five-year plan, aims to accelerate China's transition to a consumption-driven economy and address long-standing structural imbalances that have historically prioritized exports and investment. The author argues that this pivotal change would carry profound geopolitical and economic implications for China, its key trading partners, and the global economy, transforming China's role from the "world's factory" to a global consumption powerhouse.
