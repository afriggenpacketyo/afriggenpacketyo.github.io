          <p>Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for North Carolina's state Supreme Court, conceded to Democratic Justice Allison Riggs after a judge rejected his challenges to the election results. Griffin stated he respects the court's holding, ending his six-month effort to overturn the election. The ruling is a win for Democrats in the swing state, ensuring Riggs will serve an eight-year term on the GOP-majority court and boosting Democrats' chances of regaining the court majority in 2028. The judge who rejected Griffin's legal challenge was appointed by former Republican President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The White House withdrew Dr. Janette Nesheiwat's nomination for U.S. surgeon general after questions arose regarding her education and credentials. Concerns were raised about her public profile on LinkedIn listing an M.D. degree from the University of Arkansas, when she received her medical degree from American University of the Caribbean in St. Maarten. Conservative activist Laura Loomer opposed Nesheiwat's confirmation due to her support for COVID-19 vaccines. Nesheiwat previously served as a medical contributor for Fox News, and her brother-in-law is Mike Waltz, recently nominated as ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's shares experienced a 7% drop after Apple's Eddy Cue suggested that AI search engines could eventually replace traditional search engines like Google. Cue indicated Apple might integrate AI services from OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic into Safari. His comments were made during testimony in the Justice Department's lawsuit against Alphabet, which accuses Google of illegally dominating advertising technology markets. Google pays Apple billions annually to be the default search engine on iPhones, but Cue's statements cast doubt on the future stability of this arrangement.</p>

          <p>The article praises Republican judge Richard E. Myers, appointed by Trump, for ruling against an attempt to subvert the outcome of a North Carolina Supreme Court election. Judge Myers held that the attempt to throw out ballots violated due process and equal protection rights, as it changed election rules retroactively. The author argues that principled judges on both the right and left are essential to protecting free and fair elections and resisting attacks on democracy. The piece highlights the importance of upholding the rule of law in the face of election subversion efforts.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a climb on a report that the Trump administration plans to revise chip trade restrictions called the "AI diffusion" rule.

Chipmakers, including Nvidia and AMD, have opposed the rule, with Nvidia's CEO stating that being locked out of the Chinese AI market would be a "tremendous loss." AMD CEO Lisa Su stated the U.S. should strike a balance between restricting access to chips for national security and providing access, which will boost the American chip industry.</p>
