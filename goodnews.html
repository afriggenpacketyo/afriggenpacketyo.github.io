          <p>For the second time in eight days, a U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman was lost in the Red Sea; the pilots sustained minor injuries. The incident occurred during an attempted landing when the arrestment mechanism failed, causing the aircraft to go overboard, and both aviators safely ejected and were rescued by a helicopter. This follows a previous incident where a Super Hornet was lost overboard due to crews losing control while it was being towed in the hangar bay. President Trump also disclosed that the Iranian-backed Houthis had agreed to halt attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea, marking a potential de-escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter results revealed earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations, but revenue fell short of anticipated growth, leading to a drop in share value. Despite a 14% increase in revenue compared to the previous year, the company reported a net income of $1.78 billion, a significant turnaround from the net loss in the first quarter of 2024. Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, expressed optimism about autonomous vehicles, viewing them as the single greatest opportunity for Uber, noting the annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips. The company is also facing a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission regarding deceptive billing practices related to its Uber One subscription service.</p>

          <p>Real ID requirements for domestic air travel in the United States have officially begun after nearly 20 years of delays, prompting long lines at government offices as people rushed to obtain compliant identification. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is warning travelers without Real ID-compliant documents to arrive early for additional screening, though Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem assured that people will still be allowed to fly. The Real ID Act, a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, aims to enhance security by better validating individuals at checkpoints, and those without compliant identification may be diverted to a different line or undergo an extra step in the screening process.</p>

          <p>This article examines Senator Susan Collins's response to President Trump's policies, particularly those affecting her home state of Maine. Despite her position as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Collins has been criticized for not fully utilizing her power to challenge Trump's actions, including budget cuts and legal attacks on Maine. The article suggests Collins could leverage her committee to call hearings, pass legislation, and block funds for Trump's favored programs, but her aversion to confrontation and fear of political retribution have kept her on the sidelines. The article also notes Collins's history of only opposing Trump when her vote is not essential and her declining poll numbers ahead of the 2026 election.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a networked 1-bit jammer system designed to create the illusion of multiple warships on radar, effectively luring enemy missiles away from actual vessels. The technology, detailed in a peer-reviewed paper, involves four electronic warfare devices circling a ship, sending signals to deceive advanced radar systems. This "ghost fleet" tactic aims to protect real warships by diverting incoming missiles, representing a significant advancement in electronic warfare capabilities, according to the team from the Beijing Research Institute of Telemetry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsene Wenger has proposed a change to the offside rule in football to benefit the attacking player, similar to a change implemented after the 1990 World Cup. The suggested adjustment would mean a player is only considered offside if they are clearly ahead of the last defender, rather than being offside if any part of their body is beyond the defender. Wenger believes that VAR has removed the advantage previously given to the attacker in marginal situations, and this change would restore that balance, potentially increasing goal-scoring opportunities.</p>

The company's CEO, Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen, attributed this positive outlook to the FDA's decision to end a drug shortage ruling, which had allowed compounding pharmacies to create legal copies of Wegovy and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk expects sales of these compounded alternatives to decrease and plans to pursue companies that continue to unlawfully distribute them, while also launching new direct-to-consumer online pharmacies and partnerships with telehealth providers.</p>
