        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After weekend talks in Geneva, the United States and China have agreed to temporarily suspend most tariffs imposed on each other, signaling a de-escalation in their trade war. The agreement involves reducing the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China will lower its import duty on American goods to 10% from 125%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that both sides have a shared interest in balanced trade and neither side desires a decoupling of the two economies. Global markets responded positively to the announcement, with stocks surging and the U.S. dollar strengthening. This article provides an overview of the tariff reductions and the context of the trade negotiations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kurdish group PKK, which has waged a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced it is laying down its arms and disbanding. This move follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who stated that the armed struggle has outlived its purpose and that further progress can be achieved through politics. The decision could reshape Turkish politics and influence other Kurdish militias in the region, potentially leading to greater Kurdish rights and a terror-free Turkey. President Erdogan needs the support of pro Kurdish political parties if he is to be able to run again in Turkey's next presidential election, due in 2028.</p>

          <p>Royal experts suggest that Kate Middleton's success as a modern royal comes from adhering to royal rules and traditions, unlike Princess Diana. Edward White, author of "Dianaworld: An Obsession," notes that Kate was more mature when she married Prince William, and she learned from Diana's experiences to avoid rushing into royal life. Kate receives strong support from the palace and her family, which Diana lacked, and she maintains a focus on duty. The article emphasizes that Kate's approach, along with a supportive spouse, has allowed her to navigate royal life with ease, ensuring a bright future for the monarchy.</p>
