          <p>The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the primary commuter rail system in the San Francisco Bay Area, was forced to shut down all trains for several hours on Friday morning due to a "computer networking" problem.

The article notes that BART has struggled to attract passengers since the pandemic, with ridership remaining less than half of pre-pandemic levels.
