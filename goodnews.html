          <h2>Examining the Rules Governing Presidential Gifts in the US</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reports of Donald Trump's administration potentially accepting a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family have sparked ethical concerns, prompting a review of the rules surrounding presidential gifts. US presidents have a history of accepting gifts from foreign powers, ranging from Queen Victoria's Resolute Desk to animals. The US Constitution's emoluments clause prohibits government officeholders from accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional approval. Gifts valued over $480 are considered gifts to the United States and must be logged and disposed of by the White House Gift Unit, often transferred to the National Archives or presidential libraries.</p>

          <p>The United States and China concluded trade talks in Geneva, with both sides reporting "substantial progress" but offering limited details. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer described the outcome as a "deal," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted an "important consensus" and the establishment of a "consultation mechanism." The negotiations aimed to ease tensions following President Trump's imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports, which prompted retaliatory duties from China, disrupting trade and impacting the global economy. Markets reacted positively to the news, but analysts cautioned against premature optimism, emphasizing the need for significant tariff reductions.</p>

          <p>China's President Xi Jinping is hosting Brazil's President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva and other Latin American officials in Beijing, signaling China's intent to maintain a strong presence in the region. This move is seen as a counterweight to the U.S. under President Trump, who seeks to bring Latin American countries closer into Washington's orbit. Lula views China as a partner in rebalancing global power, seeking to diversify Brazil's alliances and reduce dependency on the U.S. Discussions are expected to cover trade, investment, and technological cooperation, with China aiming to increase purchases of minerals and other resources from Latin America.</p>

          <p>A student-led movement in Serbia is challenging the increasingly autocratic government of President Aleksandar Vucic, sparked by outrage over corruption following a train station collapse that killed 16 people. The protests have grown into the largest and most extensive movement in the country, drawing support from diverse segments of society. Despite government attempts to quell the unrest, including resignations and financial incentives, demonstrations have persisted, with hundreds of thousands taking to the streets. The government's response has included intimidation tactics and attacks on universities, but protesters remain determined to bring about change.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to a Japanese temple, resolving a dispute that strained bilateral relations. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over in South Korea and transported back to Japan. The return follows a South Korean Supreme Court ruling in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, after Buseoksa Temple claimed it had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. The artifact is expected to be stored at a museum after a ceremony at the temple.</p>

The government aims to seize the narrative from Reform UK, with Sir Keir Starmer emphasizing that new immigrants must earn the "privilege, not right" to settle. The Daily Express reports that migrants must wait ten years to become British under the new "crackdown."

Barrow will receive ¬£200 million in government funding over the next decade, with BAE Systems teaming up with local and national governments to rejuvenate the town.

Despite efforts by successive governments to reduce net migration, numbers have remained historically high. Brexit, while intended to provide greater control over immigration, has not led to a decrease in net migration figures. The latest data is expected to show a significant fall in 2024, but the overall trend of rising legal migration remains a challenge for policymakers.</p>

          <p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad argues that President Trump's tariffs will harm Americans more than targeted countries, increasing the US cost of living. He stated that American products cannot compete with cheaper alternatives, leading to economic suffering in the US. Mahathir suggests items like Apple iPhones produced in China and India will become more expensive due to tariffs. ASEAN can weather the impact with intergroup trade and business with countries other than the United States, according to Mahathir.</p>
