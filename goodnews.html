        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year forecast, citing increased sales among home professionals as a counterweight to reduced demand from do-it-yourself customers. CEO Marvin Ellison noted that investments in stores, technology, and customer service have helped navigate the current market uncertainties. While first-quarter sales fell slightly short of expectations, earnings surpassed estimates, leading to a rise in Lowe's shares in premarket trading. This announcement follows a similar reaffirmation from competitor Home Depot, both companies focusing on attracting professional clients to offset softer consumer sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK health officials have confirmed the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, though the risk to the public remains very low, with no evidence of spread within the UK. Fragments of the virus were found in mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire. This discovery aligns with the virus's increasing prevalence in Europe due to climate change, which is pushing mosquito populations northward. While most infections result in minor or no symptoms, a small percentage can lead to severe neurological illnesses, and there are currently no specific treatments or vaccines available for humans.</p>

          <p>Canada Goose reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' estimates, leading to an increase in the company's shares. However, due to "macroeconomic uncertainty" and unpredictable global trade environment, the company has withdrawn its financial outlook for fiscal year 2026. Despite the lack of specific guidance, Canada Goose expressed confidence in the strength of its brand and its ability to adapt to changing conditions. The luxury sector as a whole has shown signs of weakness, with other major players reporting a slowdown in sales.</p>

          <p>Large language models (LLMs) like GPT and Claude are becoming increasingly sophisticated, raising questions about how they work and what they "believe" about their users. Recent advancements in AI interpretability are allowing researchers to peek inside these "black boxes" and uncover the models' assumptions and stereotypes. Researchers are finding that LLMs make assumptions about users' gender, socioeconomic status, and other characteristics, which influence the model's responses. This raises concerns about potential biases and the need for greater transparency and control over how LLMs are used.</p>

          <p>Fast food is becoming less affordable in major U.S. cities, with the average meal costing $11.56, according to a new report. Prices are highest in San Francisco and Seattle, while Columbus, Ohio, offers the most affordable options. Increased costs and inflation are impacting consumers' ability to afford fast food, with average prices rising significantly over the past decade. The trend affects lower-income employees, who must work over two times longer than someone on an average wage to afford a typical fast-food meal, while factoring in the cost of other living expenses.</p>

          <p>Four British former special forces soldiers have set a record by climbing Mount Everest in under five days without acclimatizing on the mountain, using xenon gas to pre-acclimatize to low oxygen levels. The team, including a UK government minister, summited the peak early Wednesday. Xenon's use remains disputed, with many in mountaineering criticizing the method. The team spent six weeks in special tents before traveling to Nepal, and used supplemental oxygen during the ascent. While this is a record ascent without acclimatizing in the Himalayas, the fastest Everest time remains with Lhakpa Gelu Sherpa, who acclimatized.</p>
