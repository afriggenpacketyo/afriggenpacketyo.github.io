          <h2>Canadian Prime Minister Carney Assures Trump That Canada Will Never Be Part of the U.S.</h2>

          <p>In a high-stakes meeting at the White House, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly told President Trump that Canada would not become the 51st U.S. state, addressing Trump's repeated suggestions of acquiring Canada. Carney employed a real estate analogy, stating some places are 'not for sale,' a sentiment Trump countered with 'never say never.' Despite the tensions stemming from Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods, both leaders struck a conciliatory tone, with Trump praising Carney's recent electoral victory and both committing to further discussions on trade and security, although Trump indicated no immediate policy changes regarding tariffs. The meeting aimed to reset relations strained since Trump's re-election and his ongoing trade disputes with Canada.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, driven by a 36% surge in overall sales. The company's data center segment, fueled by demand for Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs, saw a 57% increase, while client revenue from laptop and PC chips jumped 68% due to strong demand for Zen 5 chips. Despite a 30% decline in gaming sales due to lower console chip revenue, AMD provided a robust forecast for the current quarter, anticipating approximately $7.4 billion in sales. The company also addressed the impact of U.S. export controls on AI chips, projecting $800 million in related costs.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly stated that Canada is 'not for sale' in response to Trump's repeated musings about the U.S. acquiring Canada. Trump romanticized the idea of merging the two countries, describing the border as 'artificial,' while Carney used a real estate analogy to emphasize Canada's independence. Despite Carney's stance, Trump insisted the rejection wouldn't hinder trade negotiations, though he didn't entirely dismiss the possibility of future discussions. Carney also requested Trump to cease referring to Canada as the 51st state, emphasizing ongoing complex negotiations on a wide range of issues.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction halting President Trump's attempt to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), which provides federal funding to libraries and museums across the country. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by attorneys general from 21 states, arguing that Trump's executive order violated the Administrative Procedure Act and disregarded the constitutional role of Congress in making laws and appropriating funds. The IMLS is the primary source of federal funding for public libraries, particularly benefiting small and rural libraries, and its dismantling would have had a significant impact on library services nationwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that the Chav√≠n people of the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals, potentially to establish social and political hierarchies. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including snuff tubes, at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with traces of DMT and tobacco plants. The small, hidden galleries where these artifacts were found suggest that only certain members of Chav√≠n society were invited to partake in these rituals, indicating controlled access and management of ritual activities. The use of hallucinogens may have played a role in shaping the culture and power structures of this ancient civilization.</p>
