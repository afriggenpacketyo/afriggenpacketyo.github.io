          <p>Recent satellite photos showcase the dramatic transformation of California's landscape, with mountain peaks blanketed in snow and reservoirs replenished by the season's first major atmospheric river. This much-needed precipitation has elevated most of the state's largest reservoirs to or above historical levels, significantly delaying the fire season in Southern California. Experts emphasize that such storms are crucial for drought recovery, with this event marking a favorable start to the water year. The article highlights the profound environmental impact and relief brought by the recent weather.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that growing concerns over sour bank loans, highlighted by recent bankruptcies and disclosed losses, will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner. He argues that credit losses are a definitive sign of economic downturn, which motivates the Fed to act swiftly without excessive inflation worries. While lower rates stimulate the economy and prevent defaults, Cramer believes these credit issues will be contained to banks and not harm the broader market. This article offers an expert's perspective on how banking sector health influences monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

The team held Norris accountable for running into Max Verstappen and damaging his front wing, which then led to contact with Piastri. While McLaren took no in-race action, the team emphasizes a core principle of not crashing with teammates to maintain trust and strength.
