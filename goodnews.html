          <p>The U.S. Treasury is exploring the creation of new one-dollar coins for the nation's 250th anniversary, potentially featuring an image of President Donald Trump. A draft design reportedly shows Trump's face on one side and him pumping his fist after a near-assassination on the other, with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight" engraved. This initiative is possible under the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, signed by Trump. However, existing provisions generally prohibit living persons, especially presidents, from appearing on U.S. currency, though Congress could provide an exception, as it did in 1926 for President Calvin Coolidge.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced its agreement to significant parts of the ceasefire deal proposed by President Trump, including the release of all hostages and the handover of Gaza's administration to a Palestinian technocratic body. The group indicated that other deal components would require further negotiation within an "inclusive Palestinian national framework." Following this, President Trump urged Israel to cease bombing Gaza immediately to facilitate safe hostage release, believing Hamas is "ready for a lasting PEACE." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed readiness to implement the first phase of the plan, marking a crucial, albeit complex, step towards potentially ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>China's biopharmaceutical sector is experiencing a renaissance, attracting global notice for its increasing drug-creation prowess and innovative developments. A Guangzhou biotech firm's cancer drug, ivonescimab, has notably shown superior efficacy in clinical trials compared to a global bestseller, delaying non-small-cell lung cancer progression by five months. This achievement, highlighted by a leading Chinese cancer hospital doctor, underscores China's rapid development, which now holds the world's second-highest number of novel drugs in development. While analysts question the sustainability of truly novel breakthroughs, the sector's rapid advancements are undeniable and promise significant medical contributions.</p>

          <p>Researchers are making significant strides in biocomputing, aiming to create computers from living cells, specifically lab-grown human brain organoids. Swiss scientists at FinalSpark are developing "wetware" by culturing stem cells into neuron clusters attached to electrodes, hoping to replicate AI learning with a fraction of current energy consumption. While these mini-brains are far from human complexity, they can respond to simple electrical commands, though much about their behavior remains unknown. Challenges include sustaining organoids without natural blood vessels, but the immense potential for drug development for neurological conditions like Alzheimer's and complementing silicon AI is driving this cutting-edge research forward.</p>

          <p>An article offers a personal perspective on the dramatic transformation of China's education system, contrasting the author's rural upbringing with their children's experiences in Beijing. The author's parents viewed education as an escape route, making immense sacrifices for a prestigious university degree, while the author now faces intense competition and soaring costs for their granddaughter's schooling in top urban districts. This generational shift highlights how education, once a clear path to upward mobility, has become increasingly complex and costly, with urban families navigating fierce competition for elite school access and significant financial burdens in pursuit of a better future.</p>

          <p>London's Soho Square hosted a "performative male" contest, a humorous event where men showcased exaggerated traits associated with the online trope of empathetic, socially conscious masculinity. Participants like Aiman Kaiden, complete with feminist literature and a ukulele, competed in trials ranging from explaining their choice of book to performing romantic songs. The event, largely attended by women, sparked discussions on how young men navigate social expectations and reject misogynistic ideologies, though some noted the trend can be performative for "female gaze." This cultural phenomenon highlights evolving gender dynamics and the influence of social media on identity and attraction in contemporary society.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) sales in the UK reached a record high in September, with pure battery electric vehicles growing by almost a third and plug-in hybrids even faster. Electrified vehicles now account for over half of all new car registrations, boosted by carmaker discounts, wider model choices, and the government's £3,750 grant scheme. While businesses and fleets comprise the majority of buyers, private purchases of fully electric cars are also increasing, with zero-emission vehicles making up over one in five new cars registered in 2025. Industry leaders view this growth as a positive return on investment, though they note consumer demand still "trails ambition," emphasizing the importance of incentives to accelerate the transition from petrol and diesel.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent anti-China protests in South Korea have not deterred Chinese tourists, with scheduled flights operating normally and South Korea remaining a top destination. Analysts suggest that because both governments oppose the rallies and public safety is maintained, tourists are largely unaffected. The Chinese embassy "regretfully noted" the demonstrations in areas frequented by Chinese travelers, yet no official travel advisories have been issued, indicating a stable situation despite underlying tensions. This suggests that while political friction exists, it has not translated into a significant disruption for the tourism sector or broader economic relations between the two nations, at least for now.</p>

          <p>Amazon is closing four more Fresh supermarkets in Southern California, continuing to shift its grocery strategy towards Whole Foods and online delivery. These closures follow others in the U.S. and UK, as the company re-evaluates which locations are most effective and aligns with CEO Andy Jassy's cost-cutting efforts. Amazon, which launched Fresh in 2020 to target mass-market shoppers, has faced challenges and previously halted expansion plans. While scaling back Fresh stores, Amazon affirms its commitment to grocery, innovating with new "price-conscious" brands and expanding same-day delivery. This indicates a strategic refinement rather than a retreat from the market, aiming for greater efficiency and customer reach.</p>

          <p>An analysis underscores the significance of Hamas's conditional agreement to key elements of President Trump's Gaza peace proposal, offering hope for Israeli hostage families. Hamas agreed to release all hostages, living and dead, subject to negotiations and "field conditions," and to transfer Gaza governance to Palestinian technocrats. However, the proposal's crucial requirement for Hamas to disarm remains notably absent from their response. This partial acceptance, following Trump's ultimatum, puts pressure on Israel to halt bombing, creating a complex path forward where the Israeli government will scrutinize Hamas's true intent amidst cautious optimism for a lasting peace, but with many details still to be resolved.</p>

This result, only their second draw against Chelsea in 12 league encounters, signals a tightening race in the WSL.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom signed a landmark California law allowing Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize and collectively bargain while retaining their independent contractor status. This compromise, a result of years of battles between labor and tech, marks one of the largest expansions of private-sector union rights, contrasting with the Trump administration's stance on worker protections. The law outlines a process for drivers to form unions by collecting signatures, enabling negotiations on pay, benefits, and working conditions. In exchange, Uber and Lyft will see significantly reduced insurance requirements, aiming to lower costs for the companies and potentially riders.</p>
