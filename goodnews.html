          <p>Nike announced that it anticipates an incremental cost of approximately $1 billion in the current fiscal year due to U.S. tariffs, a new challenge in its ongoing business turnaround. Despite beating diminished Wall Street expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings, the company's profits fell 86% as it cleared out old inventory. To mitigate the tariff impact, Nike plans to shift more of its supply chain out of China, work with partners, and implement price increases, signaling that while the worst of its reset may be over, significant headwinds remain.

          <p>A large, bright meteorite, also known as a fireball, was witnessed across Georgia and South Carolina during daylight hours. According to NASA, the space rock was approximately three feet in diameter and weighed over a ton before it exploded 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia. The explosion released energy equivalent to about 20 tons of TNT, creating a pressure wave that resulted in sonic booms heard by many residents on the ground.

          <p>A neighborhood in Chelsea, Massachusetts, is experimenting with innovative solutions to combat the Urban Heat Island effect, where dense urban areas become significantly hotter than surrounding green spaces. The "cool block" project, led by the environmental group GreenRoots, involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with lighter, heat-reflective colors, and painting rooftops white. This urban laboratory is being studied by researchers and provides a potential template for other cities to adapt to the increasing threat of extreme heat waves caused by climate change.</p>
