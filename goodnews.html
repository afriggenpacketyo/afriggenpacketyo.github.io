          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone call described as highly productive, focusing on potential paths to peace in the ongoing war with Russia. Zelenskyy urged Trump to apply his Middle East peace-brokering experience to the Ukrainian conflict and discussed the need for enhanced air defense following recent Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid. This conversation signals a significant warming of relations between the two leaders, who had a publicly contentious meeting earlier in the year but have since found more common ground.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is being credited with facilitating a potential landmark peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, which could end the war in Gaza. According to analysis from a panel on Washington Week With The Atlantic, Trump's direct pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a critical factor in bringing the deal together. Panelists argued that Netanyahu, who has built his career on understanding American politics, recognized his fundamental need for U.S. support, making him susceptible to Trump's influence as American sentiment on the conflict has shifted.</p>

          <p>Independent movie theaters are adapting to a changing entertainment landscape by transforming into community hubs to compete with streaming services and high ticket prices. Theaters like Kevin Smith's Smodcastle Cinemas in New Jersey and Vidiots in Los Angeles operate as non-profits, focusing on special events, film festivals, and creating a social experience to draw audiences. Others, such as New York's Metrograph, have found for-profit success by offering a boutique experience with a bookstore, restaurant, and curated programming, proving that a love for communal film-watching persists.</p>

          <p>Plaid Cymru, a political party in Wales, has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers incentive payments of up to £30,000 if the party wins the next Senedd election. The proposal aims to address a teacher recruitment crisis by matching financial incentives offered in England, thereby encouraging educators to remain in Wales. The payments would be focused on priority areas such as Welsh-medium teaching and subjects like math and science, with the condition that recipients work in Wales for at least five years after qualifying.</p>
