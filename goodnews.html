          <p>Nearly 50 years after the sexual assault and murder of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, authorities have arrested Willie Eugene Sims, 69, in Jefferson, Ohio. Ralston, a young mother, was found strangled in her car in 1977, and the case went cold due to a lack of leads. The break came when an upgraded F.B.I. fingerprint search algorithm matched Sims' thumbprint on a cigarette carton found at the crime scene. Sims, an Army private stationed nearby in 1977, had a prior conviction for assault to commit murder, and DNA evidence from Ralston's fingernails and the murder weapon further linked him to the crime. Ralston's son expressed gratitude for the renewed investigation that finally brought closure.</p>

          <p>Fulham Football Club has opened its new Riverside Stand, featuring high-end hospitality including Michelin star menus and a rooftop swimming pool, though the pool does not offer views of the pitch. The design of the stand, by architect Phillip Johnson, focuses on the River Thames rather than the field, drawing inspiration from rowing and boat houses. Fulham aims to create a private members' club on non-matchdays, appealing to wealthy locals. Chief executive Alistair Mackintosh emphasizes the club's commitment to sustainability and remaining at Craven Cottage, noting owner Shahid Khan's amplified vision for the project.</p>

          <p>The family of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, "V.M.L," who was deported to Honduras with her undocumented mother and sister, has voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the Trump administration. The family's attorney cited the traumatizing experiences as the reason for needing time to consider all options. Despite a federal judge's suspicion that the deportation occurred without due process, the Department of Justice argued it was in the child's best interest to remain with her mother. The ACLU accused DHS of falsely claiming it deported a U.S. citizen, but the DHS stated the mother chose to bring her child with her.</p>
