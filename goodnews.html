The company raised $1.37 billion, with existing shareholders offering a significant portion of the shares. Klarna's CEO views the IPO as a milestone and emphasizes the company's move into banking with debit cards and personal deposit accounts. The IPO is testing Wall Street's excitement about Klarna's business direction amid regulatory headwinds and competition with other BNPL providers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.9% in August, matching economists' forecasts, indicating a slight increase in inflation. The CPI tracks the change in prices on everyday items, and inflation has remained at or below 3% this year. Some economists attribute the rise to the Trump administration's tariffs, as businesses pass on import duties to consumers. The Federal Reserve is considering potential rate cuts amid signs of strain in the labor market, while balancing the need to keep inflation in check. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NPR has appointed Thomas Evans, a CNN veteran, as its new news chief, succeeding Edith Chapin on September 15, as the network faces financial challenges due to the end of federal funding. Evans aims to maintain NPR's journalistic mission and innovate in how it shares its journalism, emphasizing the network's strengths in subject knowledge, international coverage, and storytelling. The appointment comes after public and political outcry over an essay critical of NPR's news coverage, and amid broader concerns about the future of public media funding. NPR is navigating potential budget cuts and strategic shifts in response to these challenges. </p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to keep interest rates unchanged, amidst lingering economic uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's tariff policies. The ECB's key deposit facility rate remains at 2%, following a rate cut in June, with the central bank citing inflation near its 2% target. The ECB will adopt a data-dependent approach to future decisions, refraining from committing to a specific rate path. The focus now shifts to ECB President Christine Lagarde's press conference and updated projections for inflation and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry expressed skepticism about allegations that L.A. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer attempted to circumvent the NBA's salary cap by working with a third-party company to pay Kawhi Leonard. Lasry stated that he believes Ballmer and his partner are honorable and follow the rules, despite the pressure to win in the NBA. The allegations involve a $28 million sponsorship deal between Leonard and a company Ballmer invested in, which is now under investigation by the NBA. Lasry believes the situation is likely overblown. </p>

          <p>The article discusses the decline of teen babysitting and its potential impact on both teenagers and younger children. Babysitting provides teens with valuable skills like responsibility and critical thinking, while younger children benefit from the unique energy and perspective of a teen caregiver. The rise of professionalized babysitting services and increased expectations from parents have contributed to the shift away from teen sitters. Experts suggest that resurrecting the culture of teen babysitting could help strengthen community ties and provide teens with important independence challenges. </p>
