          <p>Bumble's stock price increased by 15% after the dating app company announced plans to cut 30% of its workforce, which equates to approximately 240 roles.

Bumble anticipates that these reductions will yield annual savings of around $40 million, which the company intends to reinvest into product and technology development. Despite this positive market reaction, Bumble's shares have significantly declined since its initial public offering in 2021, reflecting a substantial decrease in its market capitalization.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation impacting savings, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn higher returns and safeguard buying power. CDs allow investors to lock in current high rates for the term, providing a safe investment option insured by the FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000. The national average CD yields as of June 24, 2025, are 2.02% APY for 1-year CDs, 1.71% APY for 3-year CDs, and 1.72% APY for 5-year CDs. Online banks often provide the most competitive CD rates due to lower overhead costs, and investors may consider short-term CDs or laddering strategies to maximize returns.

          <p>Navigating the housing market requires awareness of current mortgage and refinance rates, with national averages as of June 24, 2025, showing 15-year mortgages at 6.09% and 30-year mortgages at 6.89%. Refinance rates average 6.22% for 15-year and 6.94% for 30-year terms, but these rates can vary based on credit, location, and loan type. Strengthening credit profiles by paying bills on time and comparing different lenders are crucial steps to secure better rates. While the Federal Reserve's potential pause in rate hikes may offer relief, borrowers should also consider shorter loan terms and lock in rates to avoid future increases. (not investment advice)</p>

Spencer highlighted the U.S. operation as historic, emphasizing its limited nature and focus on preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The ceasefire is seen as an "off-ramp" for both sides, with Spencer describing it as establishing a new doctrine based on Israel's air dominance and the U.S. response to nuclear proliferation threats.</p>

Sales fell by 27.9% year-on-year to 13,863 units, resulting in a drop in Tesla's European market share from 1.8% to 1.2%. This trend is attributed to increased competition from traditional automakers and cheaper Chinese electric vehicles, such as those from BYD. The decline comes despite Tesla's revamped Model Y compact SUV, which had previously contributed to a rebound in new car sales in Norway, and Tesla's shares have decreased by over 15% year-to-date.</p>

          <p>Joshua Zahl, a celebrated mathematician known for solving the century-old three-dimensional Kakeya conjecture, is leaving the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada to accept a full-time position as a chair professor at Nankai University's Chern Institute of Mathematics (CIM) in China. Zahl's milestone proof, co-authored with Wang Hong from New York University, was hailed by UCLA mathematician Terence Tao. Tao, who mentored Zahl, described the achievement as "some spectacular progress in geometric measure theory," confirming the resolution of the three-dimensional case of the Kakeya set conjecture.</p>

          <p>Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stressed the importance of the ceasefire in the Israel-Iran conflict and the resumption of dialogue during a meeting with his Group of Seven counterparts. Iwaya stated that Japan would continue to make "all necessary diplomatic efforts" on the Middle East issue in coordination with other partners and the international community. The meeting followed an agreement between Israel and Iran after U.S. strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities. Japan has traditionally maintained friendly ties with Iran while maintaining a strong security alliance with the United States.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump will make a full state visit to the UK later this year after King Charles and the US president's schedules meant they would be unable to meet informally over the summer. Buckingham Palace confirmed an invitation signed by the King, called the "Manu Regia", was taken to the White House by representatives from the British Embassy in Washington last week. The dates of Trump's visit are yet to be confirmed but September is said to be the most likely. It is also understood that there will not be a private meeting between Trump and King Charles this summer before the state visit.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates and demand are currently in a holding pattern, showing little movement despite economic uncertainty and overseas military conflicts. Last week, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased slightly to 6.88%, with little change in points. Applications for a mortgage to buy a home dropped slightly, while refinance applications rose, but overall demand remains historically low. The housing market continues to face challenges from overinflated house prices and a limited supply of options for sale.</p>

          <p>An initiative to make central Berlin largely car-free has been declared legal by the Berlin Constitutional Court, paving the way for organizers to collect signatures for a referendum. The initiative aims to reduce traffic in districts within the S-Bahn train service ring, with almost all streets declared "car-reduced roads" after a four-year transitional period. Private car journeys would be limited to 12 times per year, with exceptions for people with disabilities, emergency services, and commercial traffic. The court emphasized that the decision to become car-free remains with the people of Berlin.</p>

          <p>Wraps, often considered a less desirable alternative to sandwiches, are experiencing a resurgence in popularity, driven by shifting diet trends and a renewed focus on lower-calorie options. Once a fad in the 1990s, wraps are now being marketed as high-protein, low-calorie alternatives, aligning with current wellness trends. Social media platforms like TikTok are showcasing wrap recipes and highlighting their nutritional benefits. This comeback reflects a cyclical return to aesthetic values of the past, with a renewed emphasis on thinness and functional eating.</p>

          <p>An independent commission has been established in the UK to address the underlying causes of community divisions that contributed to last summer's riots. The cross-party body, led by Sir Sajid Javid and Jon Cruddas, aims to develop evidence-based recommendations for strengthening community cohesion. The commission's formation follows the riots triggered by the Southport stabbings, fueled by false information spread on social media. Members of the commission include Caroline Lucas, Sir Andy Street, and Dame Sara Khan, with the goal of promoting a more connected and resilient society.</p>
