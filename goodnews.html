          <p>Grant Hardin, a former Arkansas police chief who escaped prison while serving a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual assault, has been recaptured after nearly two weeks. He was found approximately 1.5 miles west of the prison he escaped from, and his identity was confirmed through fingerprint analysis. Hardin escaped by impersonating a corrections officer, and the search involved helicopters, drones, and K9 units, with assistance from a U.S. Border Patrol tactical unit. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders thanked law enforcement for their work in bringing the search to a peaceful conclusion and for the assistance of the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Mykale Baker, an 18-year-old from Dacula, Georgia, helped his Burger King coworkers on his graduation night, leading to an outpouring of donations. Baker, still wearing his graduation sash and medals, jumped on the line to assist his overwhelmed colleagues, and a customer, Maria Mendoza, captured the act on video and started a crowdfunding campaign. The campaign has raised over $200,000, which Baker plans to use for trade school to become a master auto mechanic, and the Burger King Foundation also awarded him and Mendoza's daughter $10,000 each. Baker's mother taught him to work hard, even when no one is watching, because you never know who is.</p>

          <p>The rabbit-like plush toy "Labubu," created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, has become a global hit for Chinese maker Pop Mart, drawing long lines and even fights among fans. Its popularity is fueled by celebrity endorsements and a savvy marketing strategy involving "blind boxes." Celebrities like Lisa from Blackpink, Rihanna, and Dua Lipa have expressed their fondness for Labubu on social media, driving up prices for limited-edition items to nearly $3,000 online. The success of Labubu reflects China's transformation in the toy market, from subcontractor to creator of original products, with Pop Mart's shares valued significantly higher than Sanrio, the company behind Hello Kitty.</p>

          <p>Liam Dawson's recent performance for England has highlighted what the team had been missing, despite his absence from the squad for two and a half years. County fans have long questioned why the leading English spinner in the County Championship was consistently overlooked, with England's managing director previously stating Dawson was not someone who wanted to be a 15th or 16th man. Under new captain Harry Brook, England has finally realized that Dawson's dependable nature is a strength, not a criticism. Dawson's comeback came for Brook's first T20 series in charge, signaling a potential shift in team strategy.</p>
