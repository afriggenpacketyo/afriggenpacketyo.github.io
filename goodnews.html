          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz affirmed Germany's commitment to European defense, emphasizing that Russia only understands the language of force. Speaking before a NATO summit in The Hague, Merz stated that Berlin would contribute its "fair share" to defend Europe, aiming to ensure peace for future generations. The summit, attended by US President Donald Trump, focuses on defense spending commitments and support for Ukraine, overshadowed by the Israel-Iran conflict. NATO members are expected to approve a major investment plan, potentially raising the benchmark for defense investment to 5% of GDP, with Germany planning to meet the 3.5% target by 2029, demonstrating their conviction in safeguarding Euro-Atlantic security. The current geopolitical landscape necessitates a unified and robust approach to defense. The optimism score for this article is relatively high due to the commitment to defense and security in the face of global uncertainty.</p>

          <p>With rising natural-gas prices and other factors, Americans can expect to pay more for air conditioning this summer, potentially around $200 a month. Experts recommend several strategies to save on cooling costs, including sealing windows and doors to prevent leaks, using fans to reduce thermostat temperatures, and managing sunlight by closing blinds. Homeowners can also use heat-producing appliances wisely, prioritize regular maintenance of AC systems, and consider upgrading to more efficient units. Taking these steps can help homeowners stay cool while minimizing their energy bills. (not investment advice)</p>

Online banks and online divisions of larger banks have fewer overhead costs, which enables them to offer more competitive CD rates. Considering short-term CDs can also be a way to secure a top rate.
