          <p>Disney has agreed to pay Comcast $438.7 million for its remaining stake in Hulu, ending a lengthy valuation process. This finalizes Disney's acquisition of full ownership of the streaming service, paving the way for deeper integration of Hulu and Disney+ content. Disney CEO Bob Iger expressed satisfaction with the resolution and highlighted the potential for a more seamless streaming experience, including the upcoming ESPN direct-to-consumer app. Comcast's NBCUniversal, which has been focused on building its own streaming service, Peacock, noted that Hulu generated nearly $10 billion in proceeds for Comcast.

The judge ruled that Baldoni failed to adequately allege that Lively's threats were wrongful extortion and did not prove defamation.

The strategy will have four pillars: investing more in soldiers and equipment, expanding the military's capability, strengthening the domestic defence industry, and diversifying Canada's defence partnerships.</p>
