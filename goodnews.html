          <h2>Gold Price Forecast for Fall 2025 Indicates Potential Rise Amid Economic Factors</h2>

          <p>Gold prices, after experiencing record highs earlier this year and a more recent pullback, are broadly expected to remain steady or potentially increase in the fall of 2025, according to leading financial experts. Key factors such as anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, a potential softening of the U.S. dollar, and ongoing geopolitical tensions are identified as primary drivers that could push gold values higher. Some analysts project the precious metal could reach $4,000 per ounce by the second quarter of 2026. Conversely, a robust economic strengthening, coupled with cooling inflation, could lead to a downward pressure on prices, advising investors to carefully consider their personal goals and liquidity needs when incorporating gold into their portfolios.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a slowdown in sales growth for its namesake brand, which fell 5% in the fiscal second quarter. However, the company's overall sales climbed 7% due to a robust 19% surge from its teen-focused Hollister brand, marking its best-ever second-quarter net sales growth. Despite narrowly beating Wall Street expectations and raising its full-year revenue outlook, shares declined on a weaker profit forecast for the current quarter, partly due to increased tariff costs. The company is pursuing strategies like expanding into new categories and international markets, alongside a new NFL partnership, to stimulate future growth amid rising competition.

          <p>A CBS News analysis of Washington D.C. crime data indicates a nearly 50% reduction in violent crime during the three weeks following President Trump's deployment of federal troops and law enforcement agents. Beyond violent offenses, reported burglaries also decreased by 48% and car thefts fell by 36% during the same period. The analysis revealed that federal deployments were largely concentrated in areas with historically higher rates of crime, violent crime, and gun crime, compared to the citywide average. However, identifying the specific causes of changes in criminal activity is complex, as local police data had already shown a downward trend in reported crimes prior to the president's intervention.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Mortgage Rates and Demand Show Little Movement, Despite Political Developments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 08:42:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. mortgage demand remained largely unchanged last week, with total application volume falling slightly by 0.5%, while the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages edged up to 6.69%. Refinance applications decreased by 4% for the week, but applications for a mortgage to purchase a home saw a modest 2% rise, marking the strongest week for purchase demand in a month. This small gain is attributed to more housing inventory and cooling home-price growth in various parts of the country. Despite President Trump's recent action regarding Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, which some interpret as a push for lower interest rates, mortgage rates have not yet reacted significantly.

          <p>New York-listed shares of Canada Goose surged over 15% in premarket trading after CNBC reported that the winter-clothing maker's controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, has received bids to take the company private. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International have reportedly made verbal offers, valuing Canada Goose at approximately $1.35 billion, based on its 12-month average earnings. Bain Capital is reportedly holding off on a decision, awaiting more offers, with due diligence expected to take less than two months once a buyer is selected. This development, if successful, could significantly alter the company's ownership structure and market trajectory, representing outsized returns for Bain Capital from its initial investment in 2013.

          <p>Workers at the BlueOval SK battery park in Glendale, Kentucky, a nearly $6 billion joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and its South Korean partner, SK On, are currently voting on whether to join the United Auto Workers union. This pivotal decision follows a series of recent union victories in the traditionally anti-union American South, as organized labor seeks to expand its influence in the burgeoning electric vehicle industry. Pro-union employees, like Kumari Logan, cite job security and on-the-job safety as key motivations for seeking union representation and a guaranteed contract. The outcome is highly significant for Kentucky's governor, Andy Beshear, a potential White House contender in 2028, who champions pro-union credentials and views the plant as a major economic investment for the state.</p>

Despite internal challenges and past election losses, there's a perceived energy shift towards unity and a renewed focus on core issues like affordability and fighting Republican overreach.

          <p>Kohl's shares jumped over 20% on Wednesday after the retailer significantly surpassed Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, despite experiencing a decline in overall sales. The company narrowed its full-year sales guidance to reflect the higher part of its previous range and revised its earnings per share outlook upwards. This positive financial performance comes amidst recent leadership turmoil, with Kohl's having three chief executives in as many years, and earlier concerns over changes to vendor payment terms. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed the results to substantial progress against the company's 2025 initiatives, including reduced inventory and improved customer engagement, as Kohl's continues efforts to revitalize sales through new categories and strategic partnerships like Sephora.

          <p>Following Taylor Swift's engagement to Travis Kelce, music experts and fans are actively speculating on how this significant personal milestone will influence her future musical creations, given her reputation for weaving intricate personal stories into her lyrics. While some artists fear that "contentment is a creativity killer," the article highlights how female artists like Madonna and Beyoncé have successfully channeled major life changes into critically acclaimed and transformative work. Swift has already penned two songs about Kelce, and her forthcoming 12th album, "The Life of a Showgirl," is described by her as "infectiously joyful." This new chapter in her life could potentially lead to a different kind of storytelling, expanding her artistic range beyond past narratives of love and heartbreak and opening up a whole new realm of material for her career.</p>

          <p>After an earlier pullback in commercial real estate (CRE) activity due to broad economic uncertainty, a key indicator for transaction volume, JLL's global Bid Intensity Index, showed its first improvement in July this year. This index, which measures bidding activity and competitiveness in private real estate capital markets, signals stabilizing "bidder dynamics" and increasing capital flows. The improvement is attributed to resilient property sector performance fundamentals and generally firm asset valuations, despite weaker investor sentiment earlier in the year. The "living" sector, encompassing multifamily apartments, senior living, and student housing, shows the most significant improvement, while the industrial sector lags due to supply chain uncertainty and tariffs. Investors appear to be re-entering the market, accepting higher risk, and expecting gradual momentum to pick up through the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NPR revives its "Science of Siblings" series to explore unique family customs, focusing on Pakistan's "chiro bash" or "junior right" inheritance practice, where the youngest son inherits the family home in its entirety. This centuries-old tradition, prevalent in the mountainous and remote Chitral district, ensures that parents are cared for in their old age and promotes family continuity by keeping the youngest sibling rooted in the home village. This practice stands in stark contrast to Western primogeniture, which favors the eldest son. While older siblings typically establish their own lives, the "chiro bash" custom can occasionally cause friction and is increasingly challenged by the growing influence of Islamic inheritance laws and modern aspirations among younger generations. The article examines the logic, historical roots, and evolving dynamics of this fascinating cultural custom.</p>
