          <p>UCLA football emphatically defeated Michigan State 38-13, showcasing a dramatic and sustained turnaround under their interim coaching staff, following an earlier upset victory against Penn State. The Bruins' offense, masterfully led by playcaller Jerry Neuheisel, scored 38 consecutive points, while their disciplined defense forced crucial turnovers and effectively stifled the Spartans. Interim coach Tim Skipper has clearly revitalized the team, positioning himself as a strong candidate for the permanent coaching vacancy. Running back Jalen Berger starred with three touchdowns, and quarterback Nico Iamaleava delivered a nearly flawless passing performance, solidifying UCLA's surprising transformation into a formidable team.</p>

While minor road flooding and some flash flood risk in burn scar areas are possible, the storm is not expected to conclusively end the wildfire season.

          <p>Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva is meticulously preparing to receive the first group of twenty Israeli hostages released by Hamas, pioneering a specialized field they call "captivity medicine." Medical staff have gained crucial insights from previous releases, understanding that physical and psychological symptoms may emerge weeks later, necessitating a "medical detective" approach. The unit is designed to provide a calm, private environment for emotional reunions and recuperation, allowing ample time for both physical healing and the complex process of addressing profound trauma. Social workers are also integral in supporting the closest relatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England has maintained its unbeaten record in the Women's World Cup after securing a commanding 89-run victory over Sri Lanka in Colombo, largely thanks to exceptional performances from Nat Sciver-Brunt and Sophie Ecclestone. Sciver-Brunt scored a magnificent run-a-ball 117, recovering from an early drop, while Ecclestone delivered a remarkable and unplayable spell, taking 4-17. Despite a promising recovery attempt by Sri Lanka, their lack of batting depth ultimately proved insufficient. England's third consecutive win places them at the top of the eight-team table, positioning them strongly for upcoming crucial matches against India and Australia.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old British army horse, has been deservedly retired to The Horse Trust sanctuary after sustaining a broken bone and serious bleeding during a chaotic runaway incident in London last year. The horse was one of five spooked by construction noise, leading to a five-mile chase through the city streets and causing injuries to four pedestrians and five soldiers. Major Thomas Stewart confirmed that Quaker was unable to return to his ceremonial duties, making retirement the most humane option for his welfare. The incident underscored the unpredictable nature of working with animals in urban environments.</p>

          <p>Sam's Club, the membership-based warehouse chain boasting nearly 600 locations across the US and Puerto Rico, is revealed to be owned by Walmart Inc. The concept was developed by Walmart founder Sam Walton as the company's strategic response to the booming warehouse club market of the late 1970s and 1980s. Both retailers prioritize affordability and accessibility, leveraging shared distribution facilities to reduce costs and maintain competitive pricing. While Sam's Club features its Member's Mark private label and Walmart has Great Value, the article highlights their intertwined infrastructure and a long-standing rivalry with Costco.</p>

          <p>Scottish National Party (SNP) members have overwhelmingly backed First Minister John Swinney's strategic plan to declare a mandate for a second independence referendum, should the party secure a majority of seats in next year's Holyrood election. Swinney asserted that this approach represents the most realistic path forward, drawing on the historical precedent set for the 2014 referendum. Although a proposed amendment for a de-facto independence vote was rejected, the conference also accepted amendments supporting Scotland joining the European Union post-independence and fostering constructive inter-party working. This vote solidifies Swinney's leadership and the party's continued focus on independence.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Gen Z consumers are actively pushing back against the "fast furniture" trend, which involves cheap, mass-produced decor contributing to immense waste, by enthusiastically embracing secondhand and refurbished items.

Social media platforms show a significant surge in searches for secondhand decor, driven by sustainability concerns, tighter budgets, and a desire for emotional connection with unique pieces.
