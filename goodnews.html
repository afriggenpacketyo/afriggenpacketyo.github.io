          <p>Free agent wide receiver Isaiah Bond is set to sign with the Cleveland Browns after a grand jury in Collin County, Texas, declined to indict him in a sexual assault case. The "no bill" decision concludes the criminal proceedings against Bond, who had maintained his innocence since the allegations arose. Bond, who went undrafted after turning himself in to police in April, expressed gratitude to the Browns for the opportunity to continue his NFL career. He stated he will learn from the experience while reaffirming his innocence but will not discuss case details on his attorney's advice.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy demonstrated surprising resilience by expanding 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, outperforming economists' forecasts despite trade pressures from the United States. The growth was primarily driven by strong net exports, which helped offset the impact of a 15% blanket tariff on all U.S.-bound exports. On an annualized basis, the country's GDP grew 1%, also beating expectations. However, the Bank of Japan remains cautious, warning that global trade policies could lead to a slowdown in overseas economies and affect domestic corporate profits in the future.

          <p>The city of Youngstown, Ohio, once a symbol of industrial decline after the collapse of its steel industry, is undergoing a steady economic revitalization. Local entrepreneurs are breathing new life into the city by transforming abandoned factories and mills into new businesses, such as a brewery and a bustling flea market. This grassroots effort is contributing to a stabilized population and an unemployment rate that is now only slightly above the national average. The city's comeback is not characterized by a single major project but by a resilient, incremental process of forging a new identity beyond its steel-producing history.</p>

          <p>The British government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to raise awareness about the dangers associated with traveling abroad for cosmetic surgery. This campaign addresses growing concerns over "medical tourism," where individuals seek cheaper procedures like hair implants or dental work overseas, sometimes with devastating results. The initiative will feature content creators urging their followers to consult with UK doctors, secure proper travel insurance, and avoid package deals that include surgical procedures. The goal is to protect patients from life-altering injuries and reduce the burden on the NHS, which often has to correct botched overseas treatments.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Venus Williams will make history at this month's U.S. Open as the oldest competitor in the singles tournament since 1981. At 45 years old, Williams received a wild card invitation for her 25th appearance at the championship, a testament to her enduring career. This milestone follows her recent victory at the DC Open, where she became the oldest player to win a WTA singles match since 2004. Williams' longevity is part of a broader trend in tennis, where many athletes have achieved major successes well into their 30s and 40s, challenging traditional notions of peak performance years in professional sports.</p>

          <p>The earliest known recordings of Dame Vera Lynn, captured during auditions 90 years ago, are set to be released for the first time. The three aluminum audition discs were discovered by her daughter among the late singer's collection, which was donated to the British Library's Sound Archive. The release will include the single "What A Difference A Day Makes" to commemorate the 80th anniversary of VJ Day. These previously unheard tracks offer a rare glimpse into the beginning of the career of the "Forces' Sweetheart," who became a symbol of hope during World War Two with iconic songs like "We'll Meet Again."</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team has become the first UK sports team to partner with Barbie, in a collaboration aimed at inspiring the next generation of female athletes. The deal, launched ahead of the Rugby World Cup, will initially feature co-branded apparel and equipment rather than player dolls. As part of the partnership, toy maker Mattel will donate £20,000 to the Rugby Football Union to support grassroots initiatives and increase girls' access to the sport. The collaboration seeks to leverage Barbie's brand power to promote visibility for women's rugby and encourage more young girls to participate.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors against exiting the stock market, even though he acknowledges that some areas appear "frothy." He argues that unlike the dot-com bubble, the current market has enough rational, strong-performing companies to outweigh the speculative hype surrounding some recent IPOs and niche tech stocks. Cramer pointed to substantive business developments at companies like Amazon and Eli Lilly as examples of rational market drivers. He suggests that while irrational exuberance exists, it coexists with legitimate growth stories, and investors should not abandon solid positions because of it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Facing an existential threat from affordable, high-tech Chinese electric vehicles, Ford is fundamentally overhauling its manufacturing process. CEO Jim Farley announced plans for a new, purpose-built $30,000 electric pickup truck and a retooled assembly line designed to be faster and use fewer parts. This move is a direct response to Chinese automakers like Xiaomi, whose advanced and inexpensive EVs are already challenging traditional carmakers globally. Ford's strategy represents a critical attempt by a legacy American automaker to adapt and survive in a rapidly changing global market dominated by new, highly efficient competitors.</p>

          <p>As economic growth slows and consumers in major Chinese cities tighten their budgets, a new engine of consumption is emerging from the country's smaller, lower-tier markets. Residents in these county-level cities and towns are displaying stronger purchasing power and greater willingness to spend, fueled by faster income growth and lighter financial burdens. This expanding middle class is increasingly buying goods like imported foods and electric vehicles, signaling a significant "consumption upgrade" is underway outside of the traditional metropolitan hubs. Experts believe this untapped potential could be crucial for China's goal of shifting towards a more consumption-driven economy.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Brentford has reached an agreement to sign forward Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth in a deal that could be worth a club-record £42.5 million.

Ouattara made a significant impact last season, scoring nine goals in 37 appearances for the Cherries.

          <p>A U.S. district judge has struck down two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in schools and universities by threatening to withhold federal funding. The ruling found that the Department of Education violated procedural law when it issued memos that ordered an end to all "race-based decision-making." The judge stated the guidance initiated a "sea change" in regulation, causing educators to fear punishment for lawful speech and activities. This decision is a significant victory for civil rights and education groups that had challenged the anti-DEI campaign as illegal government overreach.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has backed down from an attempt to rapidly deport a woman who has lived in the country for nearly 30 years without an immigration court hearing. After her lawyers filed a lawsuit, the government agreed to move Mirta Amarilis Co Tupul into regular deportation proceedings, where she will have the chance to plead her case before a judge. Her attorneys had argued that placing a longtime resident in "expedited removal" was an illegal stretch of immigration law. The case raised concerns that the administration was testing a new policy to accelerate deportations of a broader group of immigrants.</p>

The move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing, buying into fundamentally strong companies during periods of negative sentiment.

A significant driver of this growth has been lucrative government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. While its U.S. commercial business is also growing rapidly, investors are paying a significant premium for the stock, with its valuation metrics far exceeding those of tech giants with much larger revenues.
