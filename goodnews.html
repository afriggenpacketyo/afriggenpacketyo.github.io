        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic frontrunner for New York City mayor, announced he was withdrawing from a scheduled WABC-TV town hall to protest the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" Mamdani stated that it is not the government's role to bully talk show hosts off the air, referencing the pressure from the FCC that contributed to the show being pulled. The move drew criticism from political opponents, who accused him of avoiding difficult questions from local reporters under the guise of defending free speech. Kimmel's show has since been reinstated by the network.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Walt Disney Company announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air, less than a week after it was suspended indefinitely. The company stated it initially pulled the show to avoid inflaming tensions following Kimmel's monologue about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk but decided to reinstate it after "thoughtful conversations" with the host. The suspension had sparked significant backlash from free speech advocates, Hollywood figures, and politicians who viewed it as an act of censorship prompted by pressure from the FCC and major affiliate station owners.</p>

They join NASA at a critical time, with goals of returning to the Moon under the Artemis program and eventual missions to Mars, all while facing budget uncertainties and a growing space race with China.</p>

          <p>England's National Health Service is implementing a new guideline called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their condition has not improved after three visits. The initiative is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid over five months and more than 20 contacts with her GP. The rule aims to improve patient safety and ensure serious conditions, particularly in younger patients, are not overlooked, preventing similar preventable tragedies.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials have begun drafting the country's 15th five-year plan, which will set economic and social policy priorities for the period from 2026 to 2030. This strategic blueprint is considered essential for achieving President Xi Jinping's goal of reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As China navigates domestic economic challenges and rising global tensions, experts suggest the new plan may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over the rigid quantitative targets of the past.

          <p>Police in Menlo-Atherton, California, successfully prevented a potential school shooting after receiving a tip through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system. The tip line, created by the Sandy Hook Promise organization, alerted authorities to concerning online posts by a former student, leading to a swift lockdown, the student's detainment, and the recovery of weapons. This incident marks the 19th credible planned school attack that the nationwide system has helped to prevent since its launch in 2018, highlighting the effectiveness of community reporting in ensuring school safety.</p>

This amicable tone contrasts sharply with the intense on-course rivalry and the pressure on Europe to secure its first away victory since 2012, with Donald even providing his players with VR headsets to prepare for the crowd.</p>
