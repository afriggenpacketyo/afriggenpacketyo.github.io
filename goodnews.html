Novogratz highlighted the high auditing costs for crypto companies due to regulatory scrutiny, but expects those fees to decrease now that Galaxy is listed on the Nasdaq.

          <p>MPs in England and Wales have voted to allow health staff to opt out of the assisted dying process. The bill, which is under consideration by Parliament, would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life. The approved change ensures no one would be forced to help with assisted dying against their wishes, giving protections to social care workers and pharmacists. The debate included concerns about coercion and the vulnerability of certain individuals, while supporters emphasized the bill had been strengthened by earlier changes.</p>
