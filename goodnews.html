          <p>India has initiated diplomatic contact with Syria's new interim government, sending its first official delegation to Damascus since the fall of the Assad regime. The meetings focused on understanding the new leadership's priorities and exploring cooperation in health, education, and future reconstruction efforts. Analysts suggest this pragmatic outreach is driven by India's strategic interests in regional stability, secure trade routes, and a desire to not be sidelined in post-war Syria. The move reflects India's non-aligned foreign policy approach as it navigates a shifting West Asian geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>The NFL Players Association has clarified that players are still permitted to use smelling salts on gamedays, resolving confusion that arose from a league-wide memo. The NFL's new policy only prohibits teams and their staff from distributing ammonia inhalants, but it does not ban players from possessing and using their own. The initial memo, which cited FDA warnings and the potential for masking concussion symptoms, prompted concern from players who use the substance for a pre-game boost. The union's clarification ensures that players can continue their personal gameday routines as long as they provide the smelling salts themselves.</p>

The move comes just a week after the city implemented a new legal framework for stablecoins, signaling a push into regulated digital assets. Ant Digital is positioning Jovay, a self-developed Layer 2 public blockchain, as a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized Web3 ecosystem. The platform is designed specifically for real-world asset tokenization in overseas markets and is slated for an official launch in September, when it will be capable of handling real-money transactions.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has raised its full-year 2025 financial outlook after reporting second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates. The strong performance was driven by surging demand for its popular diabetes and weight loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, which generated nearly $5.2 billion and $3.38 billion in revenue, respectively. The company now projects sales between $60 billion and $62 billion for the fiscal year. However, shares fell after late-stage trial data for its experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, did not meet the high expectations of some investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peloton announced a surprise profit for its fiscal fourth quarter, signaling that its turnaround efforts under new CEO Peter Stern are gaining traction. The connected fitness company reported a net income of $21.6 million, beating analyst expectations, due to strong sales and significant cost-cutting measures. However, the company also revealed plans for another round of layoffs, affecting 6% of its staff, as part of a new strategy to reduce annual expenses by an additional $100 million. While the company's path to sustained profitability remains challenging, the results show progress in stabilizing the business after its post-pandemic struggles.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has narrowly voted 5-4 to cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point, from 4.25% to 4%. This decision continues the central bank's "gradual and careful" approach to easing monetary policy amid conflicting economic signals. Policymakers are balancing persistent inflation, which rose to 3.6% in June, against a cooling labor market and a slight economic contraction in May. The close vote, which required a second round to reach a majority, highlights the deep division and uncertainty among officials about the correct path forward for the UK economy.

          <h2>Explainer: How the Bank of England's Interest Rate Cut Affects Mortgages, Savings, and Prices</h2>

          <p>The Bank of England's recent decision to cut its main interest rate to 4% has direct consequences for household finances across the UK. For homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, this will likely lead to lower monthly payments, though those on fixed-rate deals will see no immediate change. Conversely, savers will probably see the interest earned on their deposits decrease further. The central bank uses rate changes to manage inflation, with lower rates intended to encourage spending and stimulate the economy. However, with UK inflation at 3.6%, well above the 2% target, the move reflects a difficult balancing act.</p>

          <p>India's government and markets have shown a defiant response to the U.S. announcement of a potential 50% tariff on its goods, a move linked to India's continued oil trade with Russia. Despite the threat, there is a consensus in India that the move is a pressure tactic for trade negotiations, and the country's opposition has unified behind the government's stance. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed not to compromise the interests of India's farmers, a key sticking point in trade talks. Analysts note that while the tariffs would be significant, India's economy is bolstered by strong domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The well-preserved body of a man who went missing in 1997 has been discovered on a melting glacier in Pakistan, bringing a sense of relief to his family after 28 years. Nasiruddin, a 31-year-old father of two, disappeared after falling into a crevasse while fleeing a village dispute. His body, with his identity card still intact, was found by a local shepherd near the edge of the shrinking Lady Meadows glacier. The discovery is one of an increasing number of similar cases worldwide, where receding glaciers due to climate change are revealing the remains of hikers and climbers who vanished decades ago.</p>

          <p>A fabricated story claiming that Russian special forces captured three senior British military officers in Ukraine has been debunked as disinformation. The narrative, which spread on social media and was amplified by some former UK politicians, used poorly generated AI images and featured names of officers who do not exist in British military records. Experts identify the story as a typical Russian disinformation campaign, designed to be seeded on fringe websites and laundered through various media channels. The primary goal of such propaganda is often to bolster domestic Russian morale by portraying the military as mighty and framing the West as covertly directing the war.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 years after the crime, authorities have arrested and charged the former live-in boyfriend for the 1995 murder of D.C. police officer Denna Fredericka Campbell. The suspect, now named Amir Jalil Ali, was initially charged shortly after the killing, but prosecutors dropped the case. Campbell, 24, was found shot five times in her Maryland apartment, and Ali had claimed it was a burglary. Colleagues told investigators at the time that Campbell feared Ali and had ominously warned that if she went missing, "you'll know he killed me." The cold case was reopened, bringing a long-awaited development for the victim's family.</p>
