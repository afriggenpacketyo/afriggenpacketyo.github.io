          <p>Palmer Luckey, founder of defense tech company Anduril, argues that AI-powered autonomous weapons represent the future of warfare, aiming to replace outdated military technology. He contends these "smart weapons," like the Roadrunner drone interceptor and Fury fighter jet, can analyze, move assets, and execute missions faster than humans, ultimately saving American lives by reducing the need for human deployment. Despite concerns from international groups who label them "killer robots," Luckey asserts all Anduril weapons have a "kill switch" and promote peace through deterrence. His company, which has secured over $6 billion in government contracts, seeks to disrupt the traditional defense industry by developing products with private capital before seeking government procurement.</p>

          <p>Lourdes, France, is a renowned Catholic sanctuary where over 70 medical miracles have been recognized by the Church in 163 years, drawing millions of pilgrims annually. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, conducts decade-long investigations into claims of cures. Cases are deemed miraculous if they involve severe diseases, sudden, complete, and lasting cures with no possible medical explanation. Despite initial skepticism about historical rigor, independent analyses, like Dr. Esther Sternberg's, have found the office's conclusions credible, based on increasingly rigorous medical documentation and long-term patient follow-up.</p>

          <p>A homeowner faced a warning from their Homeowners Association (HOA) for charging a Tesla in their driveway, not due to the vehicle itself, but because the extension cord was deemed unsightly. The HOA letter cited "Electrical chords running along the ground" as prohibited, referencing NEC 625, which governs EV charging. However, many online commenters and experts, including a renewable energy engineer, argued that Level 1 charging with manufacturer-supplied equipment is generally permissible under NEC 625. The article highlights HOAs' reputation for micromanaging aesthetics and potentially misinterpreting regulations.</p>
