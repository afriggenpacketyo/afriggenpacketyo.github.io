          <p>The United States has returned 25 smuggled artifacts to Egypt, including sarcophagus lids, a Greco-Roman portrait, and fragments believed to be from Queen Hatshepsut's temple, after a three-year recovery effort. The collection also includes jewelry, a granite foot fragment, ivory figurines, and a rare gold coin dating back to Ptolemy I's reign. The artifacts were seized in separate investigations beginning in 2022 and held at Egypt's consulate in New York. Egyptian authorities have recovered nearly 30,000 artifacts in the past decade, highlighting ongoing efforts to combat looting and the illicit antiquities trade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite government initiatives aimed at revitalizing American manufacturing, companies are struggling to fill nearly half a million open positions due to a skills gap and an aging workforce. The Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte project a need for 3.8 million additional workers by 2033, with a potential shortfall of 1.9 million if workforce challenges are not addressed. While some positions require college degrees, many in-demand roles, such as maintenance technicians and machine operators, do not. Some experts suggest higher pay and improved perceptions of manufacturing jobs are needed to attract more workers, while others advocate for increased investment in apprenticeship programs to develop necessary skills.</p>

          <p>Luce Allen, a senior transgender girl, won a 200-meter race at a Pennsylvania high school track meet, defeating a biological female freshman by a narrow margin. Allen's victory has reignited the debate over transgender athletes' participation in sports, with supporters emphasizing inclusivity and opponents raising concerns about fairness. Allen's lawyer previously stated that preventing transgender individuals from competing with their gender identity would hinder their development, while Allen's mother affirmed her child's female identity.

          <p>President Trump has directed the US health secretary to implement sweeping cuts to prescription drug prices, aiming to align them with those in other developed countries, impacting Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance. The order instructs the health secretary to negotiate price reductions with pharmaceutical companies and enforce a "most favored nation" pricing model if talks fail, potentially including slimming drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic. Experts anticipate strong pushback from the pharmaceutical industry, while analysts estimate significant profit hits for both US and European drugmakers if the policy is implemented. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhMRA) warns of jeopardized investments in the US.</p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial board has sharply criticized President Donald Trump's recent trade agreement with China, calling it "more surrender than Trump victory." The board argues that Trump's tariff policies have been repudiated and have hurt America's ability to rally a united front against China's mercantilism. The newspaper suggests that markets have forced Trump to retreat from his vision of high tariff walls ushering in a new "golden age," which it describes as short-lived and "more leaden than golden."</p>

          <p>California labor leaders grilled Democratic gubernatorial candidates on issues such as AI regulation, benefits for striking workers, and support for unionized labor on housing and infrastructure projects. While most candidates aligned with pro-labor stances, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa dissented on providing state unemployment benefits to striking workers. The California Labor Federation and the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California hosted the event, showcasing the candidates' views on critical labor concerns. The California Labor Federation will likely spend as much as $40 million in the next election.</p>
