          <p>Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, described the nearly four-year process of taking his crypto firm public in the United States as "unfair, infuriating," costing over $25 million. The process, which should have taken 45 to 90 days, stretched to 1,320 days and involved nine rounds of comments with the SEC. Novogratz noted that Galaxy's auditing costs were significantly higher due to regulatory scrutiny. Galaxy Digital recently began trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker GLXY after a direct listing.</p>

Hedge fund icon David Einhorn echoed this sentiment, stating that he thinks gold could reach $5,000 in 2026. Schaasler also called for the price of gold to hit $5,000 next year.
