The ship reportedly damaged a heating pipe in Helberg's cabin, but the homeowner considers himself lucky that it didn't hit the rocky cliff next to it.

          <p>Investing in gold can be a smart move, especially during economic uncertainty, as it serves as a tangible asset that preserves value. Gold prices have recently seen impressive gains, making it an attractive option for investors.

It's crucial to view gold as a long-term hedge rather than a quick profit opportunity and to be wary of scams and high premiums. (not investment advice)</p>
