          <p>A Nigerian Doctor Who fan, Adesoji Kukoyi, shares his excitement about the show's first episode set in Nigeria, a significant milestone for the series. Growing up in the 1980s, Kukoyi was captivated by the time-traveling Doctor, viewing him as a guiding figure. The episode, set in Lagos, marks the first time the show is primarily set in Africa and features a vibrant barber shop, a bustling market, and potentially Anansi, a West African folklore character. The article also touches on why it has taken 62 years for the Doctor to visit Africa, suggesting a lack of confidence in telling authentic African stories and the Doctor's need to blend in, which is now changing with the casting of Ncuti Gatwa, an actor of African descent.</p>

          <p>As formal trade talks resume between China and the United States, analysts predict a wide range of outcomes, from a deal that reduces tariffs to a complete breakdown. The best-case scenario would be a pause in tariffs similar to what the US offered other countries, while the worst-case would involve either party walking out without an agreement, causing market instability. Since President Trump's return to the White House, tariffs on Chinese imports have increased significantly, prompting retaliatory measures from China. The article highlights the high stakes of these negotiations for the global economy.</p>

          <p>Billy Evans, the partner of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, has raised millions of dollars for a new AI-driven biotech startup called Haemanthus. Holmes, currently serving an 11-year sentence for fraud, has reportedly been advising Evans on the startup, which focuses on medical testing using light detection technology and Raman spectroscopy. The company aims to make medical tests more accessible and affordable, despite Holmes's history in the field. Holmes also intends to resume her career in biotech after her release, having written patents for new inventions while incarcerated.</p>

          <h2>US and Chinese Officials Meet in Geneva to Discuss Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 01:02:14 EDT</div>

          <p>Top economic officials from the U.S. and China met in Geneva to de-escalate a trade dispute involving tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. President Trump hinted at lowering tariffs to 80%, but a breakthrough is uncertain. Trump's administration has imposed a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, leading to a trade war. This meeting is the first between He and Bessent and aims to find a way to reduce the financial strain on both countries.</p>

          <h2>UK-US Trade Deal a Platform for Future Agreements, Says Mandelson</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 00:49:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, hailed the recent UK-US trade deal as a "platform for going further" in opening up more trade opportunities. The deal has reduced or removed tariffs imposed by President Trump on some UK imports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. Mandelson noted that discussions with the US are ongoing regarding the UK's Digital Services Tax, but abolishing the tax was not part of the trade deal. He described the relationship between Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump as one of mutual respect and defense of national interests.</p>
