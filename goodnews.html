          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Manhattan-based court stated that the US Constitution gave Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, a power not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration lodged an appeal within minutes of the ruling. Global markets responded positively, with stock markets in Asia rising and the US dollar making gains against safe-haven peers.
