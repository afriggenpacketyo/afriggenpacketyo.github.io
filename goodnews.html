          <p>Jewish organizers are increasingly confronting the Trump administration's policies, arguing that the exploitation of antisemitism charges is being used to justify repressive measures. These Jewish students, faculty, and alumni are pushing back against what they see as the systematic exclusion of Jewish perspectives critical of Israel from the national conversation over antisemitism. They are organizing protests, writing letters, and lobbying legislators to denounce the administration's actions. As the US universities have become political battlefields, much Jewish organizing is happening on campuses and academic spaces.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's tough stance on drug dealers and the U.S. drug war, he has pardoned several convicted drug offenders, including Larry Hoover, a leader of the Gangster Disciples. These pardons have drawn criticism, with some experts pointing out the mixed messages being sent by the White House. While Trump has called for harsher penalties, he has also granted clemency to individuals with extensive criminal records. Some critics view these pardons as transactional, influenced by powerful figures, while others cautiously praise the decisions as a step toward addressing the harms of drug criminalization.</p>

She argues that parenting is about accepting a loss of control and embracing dependence on others, a lesson she learned through her disability.

          <p>Jonathan Kennedy writes in *The Guardian* that a recent study suggests the world‚Äôs population could be hundreds of millions or even billions higher than the UN estimates. He argues that anxieties about overpopulation are often rooted in power struggles and reflect concerns about who matters and what the future should look like. While acknowledging the stress on resources, he emphasizes that responsible consumption, sustainable technologies, and women's empowerment are key to managing population growth. He also challenges ethnonationalist views on birthrates and migration, highlighting the need for newcomers in aging societies.</p>

          <p>An NPR producer has been recreating the reality TV show 'Survivor' with friends every year, complete with challenges, alliances, and tribal councils. What started as a pandemic binge-watching activity has evolved into a three-day weekend event with friends from across the country. Each year, two new players plan the challenges and twists, while others serve as producers to record and update their loyal Instagram fanbase. Participants strategize, blindside each other, and brutally vote each other off for bragging rights.</p>

          <p>Memory cafes offer camaraderie and fun for people with dementia and their caregivers, providing a supportive environment to socialize and cope with the challenges of memory loss. These gatherings are relatively inexpensive and easy to run, making them an important resource as state and local health departments face potential funding cuts. Memory cafes distinguish themselves by including caregivers, addressing social isolation and distress for both patients and their families. Studies have indicated that even online memory cafes provide social support during difficult times.</p>

          <p>The UK government is expected to unveil its strategic defence review, outlining priorities for military and security spending in the coming years. Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates that UK defence spending will rise to 3% of GDP by 2034, with the review based on this assumption. The review will warn of a new era of threat, including drones and artificial intelligence, and recommend deploying new digital experts alongside troops. The independent budget watchdog estimates that meeting the 3% target would cost an additional ¬£17.3 billion in 2029-30.</p>
