          <p>A tractor-trailer crash on Interstate 83 in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, resulted in a massive spill of hot dogs across the highway during Friday's morning rush hour. State police reported that the truck experienced a mechanical issue, causing it to strike another vehicle and rip open its trailer against a concrete divider. The spill led to significant traffic delays as cleanup crews dealt with the slippery franks covering the road. Four people sustained non-life-threatening injuries in the incident, and the spilled hot dogs were deemed unusable.</p>

          <p>A clinic in Buffalo, New York, named La Bodega, is achieving remarkable success in combating the U.S. hepatitis C epidemic, which affects millions. By providing treatment in a single visit using new FDA-approved testing machines, the clinic has cured about 98% of its more than 7,000 patients. This model offers a stark contrast to the national situation, where less than a third of those with the disease have been treated despite available cures. The clinic's success is now influencing bipartisan legislative efforts to create a national plan to eliminate the disease.</p>

          <p>ESPN has reportedly reached a deal to acquire several NFL media properties, including the popular NFL Network and RedZone channel. In exchange, the NFL will receive an equity stake in ESPN that could be worth billions of dollars and potentially reach as high as 10%. The agreement, expected to be announced next week, would also grant ESPN access to more regular-season games and the league's fantasy football operations. This major consolidation of sports media assets will require regulatory approval, a process that could take up to a year.</p>

          <p>After five years of tense relations following a deadly border clash, India and China are taking steps to normalize ties. New Delhi recently resumed issuing visas to Chinese citizens, a move that followed China's decision to allow Indian pilgrims back into Tibet. Direct flights, suspended during the pandemic, are also expected to resume soon. Experts believe these measures, driven by shifting global trade dynamics and strategic alliances, could pave the way for deeper cooperation, although the unresolved Himalayan border dispute remains a significant obstacle.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves at the trade deadline, acquiring right-handed relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase, along with versatile outfielder Alex Call. Manager Dave Roberts stated that the additions raise the team's overall floor as they head into the final months of the season. Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage reliever, while Call provides a right-handed bat and solid on-base skills. The front office hopes these moves will complement improvements from the team's existing core of star players.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has outlined his expectations for a significant week of corporate earnings, highlighting reports from companies like Palantir, Disney, Eli Lilly, and McDonald's. He anticipates a strong quarter for Palantir following a major government contract and suggests McDonald's is a buy at its current levels. Cramer also noted the importance of Eli Lilly's results, especially after its competitor Novo Nordisk posted a disappointing quarter, questioning if it signals a peak for popular weight-loss drugs.

          <p>Social media giant ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok and Douyin, disclosed at an internal meeting that the median service length for its current employees is 2.9 years. According to sources briefed on the meeting, about half of the firm's 120,000 employees have been with the company for over three years. The disclosure appears to counter online speculation of high turnover rates and suggests ByteDance is a relatively attractive employer within China's competitive tech industry, especially after it abandoned the infamous "996" work culture in 2021.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who have been living and working legally in the U.S. for years. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the administration's decision was motivated by racial animus and did not fully consider the current conditions in those countries, postponing the terminations until at least November.</p>

          <p>Veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen is scheduled to meet with the Los Angeles Chargers to discuss a potential reunion with his former team. Allen, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, was traded from the Chargers in 2024 as a salary-cap casualty after 11 seasons with the franchise. The Chargers are reportedly in need of a veteran receiving option following the recent retirement of Mike Williams. A return would reunite Allen with quarterback Justin Herbert, with whom he had significant success during their time together.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has signaled strong skepticism toward the Trump administration's executive order aimed at restricting birthright citizenship. During a hearing, judges on the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sharply questioned the Justice Department's argument that the 14th Amendment does not grant citizenship to U.S.-born children of undocumented parents. This follows a similar ruling from the Ninth Circuit and multiple lower courts, suggesting the policy is likely to be declared unconstitutional, with its ultimate fate to be decided by the Supreme Court.</p>
