          <p>Students across Scotland are receiving their exam results, but the process has been complicated by the recent Storm Floris. While electronic results via email and text are unaffected, postal deliveries of certificates are delayed in island areas like the Outer Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland. The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) has advised affected students to contact their schools for their results. Education officials and support helplines are available to provide guidance to the more than 147,000 candidates receiving their marks for various national qualifications.</p>

          <p>Following a narrow series loss to India, analysis of England's cricket team points to a heavy reliance on captain Ben Stokes for success. The article posits that England's upcoming Ashes tour in Australia presents their best chance of victory in over a decade, but this potential rests almost entirely on Stokes's shoulders. With Stokes recovering from a shoulder injury and the team having a poor recent record in Australia, his ability to perform as an all-rounder and leader is deemed critical. The piece assesses the strengths and weaknesses of both the English and Australian squads ahead of the highly anticipated series.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers fell to the St. Louis Cardinals in a 3-2 loss, despite a strong seven-inning performance from starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Both Glasnow and Cardinals' starter Sonny Gray dominated, each allowing only one run, but the game was ultimately decided by the bullpens. A go-ahead home run in the eighth for the Cardinals was answered by the Dodgers, but a two-out single in the ninth inning secured the victory for St. Louis. Freddie Freeman hit a solo home run for the Dodgers, continuing his recent hot streak at the plate.</p>

          <p>Representatives from over 170 nations are meeting at a UN conference in Geneva to negotiate a legally binding global treaty to address the escalating plastic crisis. With plastic production soaring and an estimated 200 trillion pieces of plastic in the oceans, the goal is to curb waste and the harmful chemicals used in some plastics. Key points of contention include setting targets for cutting single-use plastic production and establishing universal design standards for recycling. While nearly 100 countries support ambitious production limits, oil-producing nations are pushing back, favoring a focus on recycling instead.</p>

The policy, introduced by the nation's top economic planner, includes measures to increase production and implement a quality-grading system for local beef. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to strengthen key agricultural sectors and enhance the appeal of domestic products. Officials noted that there is significant room for growth in consumption as the average Chinese diet is still lacking in high-quality proteins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order creating a federal task force to oversee preparations for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. According to the White House, the task force will coordinate security, transportation, and visa processing for the major international event. The LA Olympics organizing committee expressed appreciation for the administration's support, highlighting the need for federal leadership in hosting the games. This move follows a similar federal task force created to oversee the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host with Canada and Mexico.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) will pay $1.7 million to settle a lawsuit brought by 45 California counties alleging the company illegally disposed of hazardous waste. The lawsuit claimed that UPS sent corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials from its facilities to local landfills not equipped to handle such waste. According to the Riverside County District Attorney's office, UPS was cooperative with the investigation and has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs. The settlement includes civil penalties, cost reimbursement, and funding for supplemental environmental projects.</p>

          <p>It is currently tarantula mating season in California, a period from August to December when the large, fuzzy spiders are more commonly seen. During this time, male tarantulas leave their burrows in search of mates, sometimes traveling long distances. Experts note that sightings are common in desert, chaparral, and mountain areas, including popular hiking spots in the Greater Los Angeles region like Griffith Park and Malibu Creek State Park. While their appearance can be intimidating, tarantulas are generally harmless to humans and reluctant to bite unless provoked.</p>

          <p>The remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, have been found by archaeologists in a cave near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The discovery was part of a broader project surveying caverns in the area, which also uncovered evidence of the caves being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. The findings, made in partnership with local cave explorers, provide new insights into the prehistoric life and farming practices of the region. The project is part of a larger initiative to preserve upland commons and their history.</p>

          <h2>Increased Screenings Lead to More Early-Stage Colon Cancer Diagnoses in People Aged 45-49</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 20:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49, which is linked to a rise in screening rates for this age group. Following recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45, screening uptake grew by 62% from 2019 to 2023. This has resulted in more cancers being caught at a more treatable stage, which researchers call promising news. However, the study also highlights that screening rates remain suboptimal and inequitable, particularly based on education and insurance status.</p>
