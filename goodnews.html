          <p>Global music superstar Bad Bunny began his three-month residency in Puerto Rico with a concert in San Juan that celebrated the island's culture and folklore. The performance featured a wide range of musical styles and included tracks that address social injustices in the U.S. territory, such as gentrification. The show was described as an ode to Puerto Rican resistance, pride, and joy, reflecting the artist's recent focus on creating music about and for his home. The event underscored his return to his roots after achieving international fame.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy shot a four-under-par 66 in the third round of the Scottish Open, moving him into a shared lead with American Chris Gotterup at 11 under par. Starting the day four shots behind, McIlroy's impressive performance, which included five birdies, puts him in a strong position to win the tournament for the second time in three years. The world number two stated he feels he is returning to his best form after a "lull" following his Masters victory in April. The duo holds a two-shot lead heading into the final day of competition at the Renaissance Club.</p>

          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have made tennis history by becoming the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 89 years. They secured a straight-sets victory over Rinky Hijikata and David Pel in the final. This victory marks the first time two Britons have won a men's doubles Grand Slam since 1936. The achievement is a significant milestone for British tennis and represents the culmination of a successful partnership for Cash and Glasspool, who teamed up less than a year ago.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek has won her first Wimbledon championship, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a stunningly one-sided final with a 6-0 6-0 score. The victory, achieved in just 57 minutes, marked the first "double bagel" in a Wimbledon women's final since 1911. For the 24-year-old Swiatek, this is her sixth Grand Slam title and her first on a grass court, demonstrating her mastery across all surfaces. Anisimova, playing in her first major final after returning from a break for mental health, was unable to find her form against the dominant world number eight.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market has shown resilience, holding near record highs despite President Trump's renewal of a global tariff campaign, including a 30% levy on the EU and Mexico. Unlike the panic seen in April, investors appear more accustomed to the president's negotiating style, leading to a more measured market reaction. Analysts suggest that while the rhetoric is disruptive, the market's focus remains on strong corporate earnings potential, particularly driven by deregulation and advancements in artificial intelligence. This outlook has so far outweighed concerns about the economic impact of the escalating trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two fathers are seeking a judicial review of UK government guidance on mobile phones in schools, aiming to implement a complete ban on smartphones for students. They argue the current policy, which lets headteachers decide, is unlawful and fails to protect children from harms like cyberbullying and exposure to violent or sexual content. The campaigners, Will Orr-Ewing and Pete Montgomery, have sent a formal letter to the Education Secretary, warning of legal action. The Department for Education responded that schools already have the power to ban phones and that the Online Safety Act provides wider protections.</p>

The festival's concerts, introduced by celebrated conductor Leonard Slatkin (son of the original group's founders), feature repertory from the earlier quartet's classic recordings. The event highlights a rich legacy of genre-busting musical excellence that continues to thrive in Los Angeles today.</p>
