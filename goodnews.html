          <p>Home Depot has announced its acquisition of GMS, a distributor of building products, in a deal valued at around $4.3 billion. This strategic move is part of Home Depot's effort to increase its market share among professional contractors, such as electricians and renovators, who represent a steady and lucrative customer base. The acquisition, which is expected to close by early 2026, also concludes a potential bidding war with billionaire Brad Jacobs' company, QXO. The deal aims to accelerate Home Depot's strategy of catering to home professionals for sustained growth and market expansion.</p>

          <p>A new report from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) reveals steady growth in cosmetic procedures, with body contouring and minimally invasive treatments showing notable increases in 2024. Liposuction and breast augmentation remained the most popular surgical procedures, while neuromodulator injections like Botox were the top minimally invasive treatment. Surgeons suggest the rise in body lift procedures may be linked to the increased use of GLP-1 weight-loss medications, which can result in sagging skin. The report also highlights the normalization of aesthetic procedures, driven by social media and a growing view of them as part of holistic self-care.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order officially lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move intended to support the country's path toward stability under its new government. The action follows a promise made in May during a meeting with Syria's new president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former insurgent. While the order dismantles the broad sanctions architecture, it maintains targeted restrictions on former president Bashar Al Assad and his collaborators. Administration officials stated the goal is to give Syria's interim government an opportunity to stabilize and normalize relations with its neighbors, including Israel, without the U.S. dictating its political framework.</p>

          <p>Tinder is testing a mandatory facial recognition feature for new users in California as part of an effort to enhance safety and combat fraud on the dating platform. The "Face Check" feature requires users to take a short video of themselves, which is then scanned to confirm they are a real person and that their face matches their profile photos. This pilot program aims to address the rise of romance scams and build trust by verifying user authenticity, awarding a blue checkmark to confirmed profiles. While photo verification was previously optional, this new test makes it a requirement for account setup in the state.</p>

          <p>After a significant price surge over the last 18 months, gold's performance in July is expected to be influenced by several key economic indicators. Analysts suggest the price may remain relatively stable, with minor fluctuations, if inflation continues to hold steady around its current low rate. The Federal Reserve's likely decision to keep interest rates paused until a potential cut in September is also expected to contribute to this stability. However, unpredictable geopolitical tensions remain a significant variable that could cause sudden shifts in the precious metal's value. (not investment advice)</p>

After Trump threatened to raise tariffs and called off trade deal negotiations in response to the tax, Canada announced it would halt collection and introduce legislation to scrap it. The 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Google, and Apple. The reversal marks a significant development in the ongoing trade disputes between the two neighboring countries.</p>
