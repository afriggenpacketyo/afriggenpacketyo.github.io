          <p>Tokyo is bolstering its defenses against extreme flooding with the Metropolitan Outer Area Underground Discharge Channel, one of the world's largest stormwater discharge mechanisms. This subterranean channel protects Tokyo and surrounding areas from heavy rain inundation. The facility is open for tours, offering visitors a glimpse into a cavernous space reminiscent of an ancient Roman temple. The channel plays a vital role in mitigating flood damage, especially as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of severe weather events in the region.</p>

          <p>Cognac producers in France are facing challenges from climate change, tariffs, and the loss of the Russian market. Winemakers are grappling with sweeter grapes due to climate change, which affects the quality of cognac. Tariffs imposed by the United States and China have significantly impacted exports, leading to financial losses. Despite these challenges, family-run businesses are adapting by diversifying and tapping into new markets, such as organic cognac and cocktail mixes, while maintaining traditional production methods.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles, whose numbers have declined by 90% in the past 30 years. The glitter is mixed with the voles' food, and the sparkle in their droppings helps researchers track their movements and territories. This innovative approach aims to understand the voles' habitat use, enabling targeted conservation efforts such as removing invasive species and protecting riverbanks. The team is testing this method on captive-bred water voles before applying it in the wild.</p>
