          <p>A recent article explores the potential dangers associated with vaping, highlighting concerns from health professionals about the lack of long-term studies. Rare but serious cases of lung damage, such as "popcorn lung," have been reported, and researchers are finding inflammation and irritation in the lungs of vapers. The article notes that vaping liquids contain various chemicals that, when heated and inhaled, could cause prolonged damage to lung tissue. While vaping is sometimes presented as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes for adult smokers, the article emphasizes that it carries risks, especially for teenagers whose brains and lungs are still developing. The article also points out that the WHO reports children worldwide aged 13 to 15 use vapes at higher rates than adults.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced that he will donate virtually all of his wealth to the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years, with the foundation scheduled to close in 2045. Inspired by Andrew Carnegie's "The Gospel of Wealth," Gates aims to distribute $200 billion to causes focused on saving and improving lives, particularly in global health and education. The article highlights the foundation's goals of stopping preventable deaths of mothers and children, eradicating infectious diseases, and improving education in developing countries. Gates expressed concern about potential setbacks due to cuts in U.S. foreign aid and hopes to persuade President Trump and Congress to restore funding. The article emphasizes that the Gates Foundation's efforts cannot fully replace U.S. foreign aid, which significantly exceeds the foundation's spending.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article reports that the U.K. and the U.S. are set to announce a trade deal, providing a win for the British government amidst global trade uncertainty. The article suggests that the agreement could boost confidence among consumers and businesses in Britain and benefit sectors like the auto industry. However, it also notes that the deal's impact on the overall British economy may be limited, as trade flows are heavily skewed toward services. The article further explains that the deal is unlikely to be a full-blown free-trade agreement and that the greater threat to Britain is the global trade uncertainty created by President Trump's policies.</p>
