          <p>David Brooks challenges the populist narrative that America's economic decline is due to neoliberal globalization, arguing that this story is historically inaccurate. He contends that median wages have grown since NAFTA and the WTO, and that the decline in manufacturing jobs is primarily due to increased productivity, not foreign competition. Brooks points out that American economic output per capita significantly exceeds that of many other developed nations. He suggests that the forces driving populism are more about cultural values, immigration, and distrust in leading institutions than economic decline. ()</p>

Women treated with GLP-1s had a lower risk of obesity-related cancer and all-cause mortality compared to those treated with DDP-4 inhibitors.

          <p>Brian Williams, a former deputy mayor of Los Angeles, has struck a plea deal with federal prosecutors, admitting he made a fake bomb threat to City Hall that was blamed on anti-Israel sentiment. Williams agreed to plead guilty to threats regarding fire and explosives, carrying a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. The plea agreement reveals that Williams sent a text message to Mayor Bass and other officials about receiving the threat, which he fabricated. The FBI investigated the case after detectives from the LAPD identified Williams as the suspect. ()</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has continued its rally, reaching a new record high near $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. Positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers have been key factors in the rise. The price increase is occurring despite a drop in U.S. equities, potentially due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. President Trump and his artificial intelligence and crypto czar David Sacks have pushed forward a pro-crypto agenda in the U.S., which has helped support the market. (not investment advice) ()</p>

          <p>An article from *The Atlantic* defends academic freedom, even when the ideas in question are wrongheaded or harmful, using a 1953 letter by Joseph Alsop as its starting point. Referencing current events including the Trump administration canceling visas of foreign students for viewpoints deemed ‚Äúbad,‚Äù the article argues that restrictions on academic freedom are a threat to the pursuit of knowledge. The article cites examples of infringements on academic freedom, arguing that there should be a defense for people's rights, no matter how abhorrent one may find a given opinion. ()</p>
