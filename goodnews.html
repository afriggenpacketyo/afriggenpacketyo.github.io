        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China Telecom Quantum Group has launched what it claims is the world's first commercial cryptography system resistant to quantum computer hacking. The system integrates Quantum Key Distribution, which uses quantum mechanics for secure key transmission, and Post-Quantum Cryptography, which relies on complex mathematical problems for data protection. The company also completed the first cross-regional quantum-encrypted phone call between Beijing and Hefei using this integrated system. As quantum computing advances, traditional cybersecurity frameworks face increasing threats, making this new system a potential game-changer for data security and communication.</p>

Pence cited national security concerns, stating that Qatar has a history of playing both sides and that accepting such a gift would be inconsistent with U.S. security and intelligence needs. He suggested that if Qatar wants to make a gift to the United States, they should invest the $400 million in infrastructure on a U.S. military base.

The Air Jordan shoe, released 40 years ago, revolutionized the sneaker industry and has since become a cultural phenomenon.

          <p>UK strawberry growers are anticipating a successful season due to warm days and cooler nights, which are known to make strawberries sweeter. According to growers, this spring's dry weather has contributed to a really good crop, with strawberries being a good size and possessing exceptional sweetness. Despite drought warnings, farmers have irrigation systems in place, though some rain would still be welcome. This year's season contrasts with the wet winter of 2024, which delayed ripening, and climate change is contributing to more frequent spells of hot weather.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government collected $850.2 billion in receipts while spending $591.8 billion in April 2025, resulting in a monthly budget surplus of $258.4 billion, driven by large individual tax deposits. The surplus is the first of fiscal year 2025 and the second-largest monthly surplus in U.S. history. Despite the surplus, the national debt continues to soar, and one strong month is not enough to reverse the broader fiscal trend. The largest outlay for the month was Social Security at $132 billion, followed by $89 billion in net interest and $82 billion for Medicare.</p>
