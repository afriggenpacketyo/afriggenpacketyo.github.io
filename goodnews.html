          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is in last-minute negotiations with the Treasury regarding her department's budget before Wednesday's Spending Review, despite receiving an offer of above-inflation increases to police funding. The impasse raises the possibility that the Treasury may impose a settlement on the Home Office prior to the review. Other government departments are also vying for increased funding, including the NHS, schools, and scientific research. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warns that modest growth rates necessitate sharp trade-offs in spending decisions, and Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp criticizes the government's spending priorities (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports of rare earth elements experienced a significant drop in value last month, decreasing by nearly half compared to the previous year, reflecting Beijing's capacity to leverage its dominance in the critical mineral supply chain. The official data coincides with analysts suggesting that China's export controls over large quantities of critical minerals serve as a key bargaining chip in trade negotiations with the United States. May's value also represented a 13.7 percent monthly decline, from US$21.7 million in April. Despite this recent decrease, the cumulative amount of exported rare earths in the first five months of the year remains slightly higher than the same period last year (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing to extend a ban on ocean bottom trawling, a fishing method that drags large nets along the seafloor, across a larger area of English waters. The proposed expansion would increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2, covering 41 of England's 181 Marine Protected Areas. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, with Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasizing the need for urgent action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The proposal coincides with a UN Ocean Conference in France, where countries are urged to ratify a treaty to protect a third of international waters by 2030.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes that artificial intelligence is a "great equalizer" because it allows anyone to program using everyday language, making computing more accessible. Speaking at London Tech Week, Huang explained that AI programming now involves simply asking the computer to perform tasks, such as writing a poem or generating images, in a conversational manner. He highlighted that this new approach eliminates the need for specialized programming knowledge, as users can interact with AI systems in a way that mimics training a person. Huang's remarks underscore the transformative potential of AI in democratizing technology and empowering individuals to create and innovate.</p>

          <p>Faced with water scarcity, population growth, and climate change, St. George, Utah, is exploring an unconventional solution: reusing sewage. The city plans to build a wastewater reclamation plant to clean effluent from local kitchens and bathrooms, using it for irrigation and eventually incorporating it into the drinking supply. This initiative is part of a broader effort to stretch the area's water supply and address the challenges facing cities across the Western U.S. as the Colorado River faces increasing strain. St. George is also implementing conservation measures, such as eliminating grass on new developments and incentivizing residents to remove irrigated lawns.</p>

          <p>As the federal government reduces its responsibilities, states are increasingly pooling their resources to address challenges, such as setting up interstate academic programs and recreating public-health and meteorology forecasting centers. This collaboration allows states to spread costs over a wider number of taxpayers, compensating for the federal shortfall, with the courts insisting such approval is necessary only when states threaten federal supremacy. The Trump administration's actions have created an opportunity for beneficial "races to the top" in regulatory matters, as states that commit to making up for federal shortfalls will attract residents and businesses. Interstate collaboration offers a chance to demonstrate resourceful, resilient, and good-faith public service (not investment advice).</p>

This has prompted calls for more candid conversations about what works and what doesn't, as well as concerns that some turnout operations may inadvertently boost support for opposing candidates. While conventional turnout methods can still be effective in low-turnout races, the parties have seen diminishing returns on each individual mobilization tactic in presidential elections.
