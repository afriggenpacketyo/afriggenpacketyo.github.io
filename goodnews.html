          <p>Jelena Ostapenko has issued an apology for comments made to her opponent, Taylor Townsend, during a US Open match, where she was accused of saying Townsend had "no education." The incident, which escalated after a contentious net cord point, drew criticism, with some interpreting the remarks as racially insensitive. Ostapenko clarified on Instagram that her comment was related to tennis etiquette and not a broader insult, stating that English is not her native language. The confrontation occurred during the post-match handshake, adding to a tense atmosphere on the court.</p>

          <p>Pop singer Sabrina Carpenter's new album, "Man’s Best Friend," explores the frustrations of her love life following her rise to superstardom. The article reviews the album as a tangy and shrewd follow-up to her breakout hit "Short n’ Sweet," continuing her lyrical focus on dealing with disappointing men. Produced with Jack Antonoff, the album's sound is noted for its blend of '70s-era AM radio pop, disco, and country influences. While not every line is considered as sharp as her previous work, the review highlights it as a strong, entertaining, and winking commentary on modern dating dynamics.</p>

          <p>Recent Premier League matches were dominated by controversial Video Assistant Referee (VAR) decisions, reigniting debate over the technology's impact on football. A highly contentious late penalty awarded to Manchester United against Burnley and a disallowed goal for Fulham against Chelsea were among the key incidents. Burnley manager Scott Parker expressed frustration, stating that constant reviews are making football "the most sterile game there is." Critics and pundits argue that the forensic application of VAR is detracting from the sport's enjoyment and leading to bizarre interpretations of the rules.</p>

          <p>Manchester United secured a dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley thanks to a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes, providing a moment of relief for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the narrow win against a newly promoted team failed to mask significant underlying issues, particularly in goal. Goalkeeper Altay Bayindir made a critical error leading to Burnley's second goal, continuing a pattern of costly mistakes from United's keepers this season. The article suggests these persistent problems may force the club to seek a new goalkeeper before the transfer deadline closes.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Guidance on Safe Screen Time Limits for Children's Development</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article synthesizes recommendations from pediatricians and psychologists regarding healthy screen time for children, emphasizing that there is no single international standard. Experts generally agree on a precautionary principle: less is better, especially in the early years, with a "screen-free until three" approach being ideal. Excessive screen time can displace crucial developmental activities like physical play, social interaction, and language acquisition. For older children and adolescents, the focus shifts from time limits to content quality and maintaining open communication to navigate the digital world safely and avoid potential online dangers.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish is experiencing a career revival since joining Everton on a season-long loan, earning man-of-the-match honors after providing two assists in a 3-2 win at Wolves.

          <p>Donald Trump made his first public appearance after unfounded rumors of his death circulated widely on social media, causing "Trump Is Dead" to trend on X. The speculation was sparked by recent comments from Vice President J.D. Vance about being prepared to step in should a tragedy occur. Trump was photographed in Washington, D.C., with his grandchildren before heading to his Virginia golf course for a family outing. This appearance quelled the online rumors and also came after recent public concern over visible bruising on his hands.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared an end to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem, as no new cases have been identified in three weeks. The outbreak resulted in 114 confirmed cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. An investigation traced the source of the legionella bacteria to cooling towers at the city-run Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site. In response, the Adams administration has proposed new measures to enhance detection and prevention, including more frequent testing of cooling tower systems across the city.</p>

          <p>Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy recently claimed that while it took him a decade to earn his first million dollars, he can now make $5 million in a single week. Speaking on a podcast, he described a tipping point where, "once you get over the hump, it just comes to you." This principle of accelerating growth reflects his recent business moves since reacquiring Barstool from Penn Entertainment for $1. The company has since secured a content deal with Fox Sports, expanding its national visibility and programming reach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence could be a "real game-changer" for diagnosing heart conditions, according to UK researchers. In a study involving over 200 GP surgeries, the device was found to detect heart failure, heart valve disease, and abnormal heart rhythms in seconds with significantly higher accuracy than traditional methods. The AI stethoscope analyzes subtle heart sounds and blood flow patterns that are undetectable by the human ear, allowing for earlier diagnosis and treatment. There are now plans to roll out the technology more widely across the UK.</p>

          <p>The new remake of "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair and starring Peter Dinklage, is reviewed as a well-made and diverting homage to the 1984 Troma cult classic. While the original was known for its extreme tackiness and cheap production, this version is more polished and features a star-studded cast including Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood. The film retains the gratuitous gore and blunt parody of the original but anchors them with a more sincere emotional story and a stronger environmental message, creating a version of the antihero that even mainstream audiences might enjoy.</p>
