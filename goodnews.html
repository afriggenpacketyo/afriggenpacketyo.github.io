          <p>Twenty companies in Japan have applied to purchase 110,000 tons of government stockpiled rice following Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Shinjiro Koizumi's announcement of direct contracts to stabilize prices. The total amount requested represents over 30% of the 300,000 tons planned for release through these direct sales contracts, bypassing the auction system. Retailers such as Don Quijote and Rakuten Group Inc. are among the applicants, with Aeon Co. planning to sell the rice at around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms starting in early June. This initiative aims to address the doubling of supermarket rice prices compared to the previous year despite previous government efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that rice plants can pass on adaptive traits acquired through environmental stress without DNA changes. The research, published in Cell, showed that rice plants exposed to cold stress developed tolerance to low temperatures that was passed down through five generations. This finding supports the 19th-century theory of Lamarckism, which posits that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The study identifies heritable DNA methylation changes as the mechanism driving cold adaptation, suggesting a potential reconciliation of epigenetics with evolutionary principles.</p>
