          <p>The 81st anniversary of D-Day was commemorated at the American cemetery in Normandy, with reflections on the courage and sacrifices made by American and Allied forces during World War II. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized the importance of alliances in both D-Day and current times, noting that "America first" does not mean "America alone." World War II veterans shared their thoughts on the lessons learned from the war, with some expressing concern that the message of peace has not fully resonated. Despite the somber reflections, large crowds attended the commemoration, signaling that the sacrifices made have been remembered. </p>

The image, taken on May 2, focuses on Arsia Mons, which is twice as tall as Earth's largest volcano, Mauna Loa. The angle of the camera allows scientists to observe dust and water ice cloud layers, providing new clues to how Mars' atmosphere evolves over time. </p>

          <p>A cardiologist, Dr. Andrew Freeman, recommends oatmeal as a go-to breakfast for maintaining a healthy heart. He advises preparing oatmeal with water and adding berries, flax seeds, and walnuts for added fiber and health benefits, and recommends avoiding instant oatmeal due to processing and added sugars. Oatmeal is rich in minerals, vitamins, and beta-glucan, which helps maintain healthy cholesterol and blood glucose levels. Eating oatmeal can also reduce hunger and promote healthy gut bacteria. </p>

The comments came after Musk lambasted Trump‚Äôs tax cuts and spending bill and made unsubstantiated claims about Trump‚Äôs association with Jeffrey Epstein. </p>

          <p>Mentorship programs are working to bring young audiences, creatives, and performers to Broadway, enriching the theater community. The Theater Development Fund's Wendy Wasserstein Project connects mentors to students, providing access to Broadway shows and fostering discussions about their experiences. Similarly, Susan Stroman mentors future playwrights through a writing fellowship at the University of Delaware, exposing them to various aspects of theater production. These programs aim to inspire and involve more young people in the theater world. </p>
