          <p>Experts are urging parents to engage in open conversations with their children about the use of generative artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT. While AI can be a helpful learning aid for tasks like homework, it also presents significant risks, including providing misinformation or unsafe responses to mental health queries. The article suggests that parents should learn about AI alongside their children, co-create household rules for its use, and prioritize real-world activities to ensure a balanced development. This proactive approach helps children navigate the technology responsibly.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small colleges like Roanoke College are reintroducing football programs after decades-long absences in an effort to increase overall enrollment, particularly among male students. Administrators believe the sport fosters a sense of belonging and school spirit that attracts more applicants, helping to balance the gender ratio on campus. However, research indicates that while adding football may cause a brief, initial spike in male enrollment, it does not typically lead to sustained, long-term gains. These institutions are betting that the added campus vibrancy will outweigh the significant investment and uncertain results.</p>

          <p>A strong earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 occurred early Saturday off the eastern coast of Russia's Kamchatka region. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the epicenter was located approximately 112 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a depth of 39 kilometers. Initially, the Pacific Tsunami Warning System issued a threat, but it was later rescinded. There have been no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries from the powerful seismic event, and Japanese authorities noted only a minimal chance of sea level changes.</p>

          <p>Colombia's highest court has ruled that Meta violated the freedom of expression of adult film actress Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court found that the company removed her account without a clear justification and applied its policies on nudity inconsistently, as other similar accounts remained active. The ruling orders Meta to review and clarify its moderation policies to ensure transparency and due process for users. This decision underscores the protection of social media posts under Colombian constitutional law.</p>

          <p>As England and Scotland face off in the Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final, the historical context of their rivalry looms large, with Scotland not having defeated England in over 25 years. The article reflects on Scotland's last victory in 1999, contrasting the era's dismissive attitude towards women's rugby with the professional sport it is today. While England has consistently dominated, Scotland has shown significant improvement, rising in world rankings. The piece highlights the gap created by England's early investment and professional pathways but notes a sense of belief within the improving Scottish squad.</p>

          <p>Experts are divided on the outcome of the highly anticipated boxing match between Canelo Álvarez and Terence Crawford. Proponents of Crawford believe his superior technical skill, adaptability, and reach advantage will allow him to outbox Álvarez, despite moving up two weight classes. Conversely, those favoring Álvarez argue that his significant size, power, and experience at super-middleweight will be too much for Crawford to overcome, predicting he will eventually wear down the smaller fighter. The fight is seen as a classic matchup of a master boxer against a powerful, intelligent brawler.</p>

          <p>Following days of intense, youth-led "GenZ" protests against government corruption that toppled the previous administration, Nepal has sworn in its first female prime minister, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki. The demonstrations, which turned violent after a social media ban, led to the dissolution of parliament and new elections scheduled for March. Karki, known for her strong anti-graft stance, was reportedly selected after negotiations involving the army, the president, and protest representatives, bringing a tense calm back to the capital, Kathmandu.</p>

The dance style's appeal lies in its low-impact exercise, social community aspect, and accessibility, as it doesn't require a partner, breaking down stereotypes and attracting a new, broader audience.</p>
