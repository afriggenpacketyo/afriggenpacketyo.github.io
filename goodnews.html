          <h2>Former Obama Speechwriter Advocates for 'Neutral Ground' to Bridge Political Divides</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:29:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a commentary adapted from his new book, former Obama speechwriter David Litt suggests that overcoming political division requires finding "neutral ground" rather than common ground. He uses his personal experience of learning to surf with his politically different brother-in-law to illustrate his point. Litt argues that shared activities, which focus on something other than political differences, can foster friendships and create space for genuine discussion. This approach allows people to connect on a human level, even when they disagree on major issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A heated verbal altercation occurred between New York Yankees star Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Atlanta Braves third base coach Eddie Perez during a game on Saturday night. The confrontation, captured by television cameras, appeared to stem from Perez's belief that Chisholm was stealing signs and relaying them to a teammate at bat. Both individuals exchanged words from across the field, with Yankees manager Aaron Boone stating the incident should be reviewed. The Yankees went on to win the game 12-9 after a dramatic late-inning comeback.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Identifies 'Self-Connection' as a Crucial Skill for Children's Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:04:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection, which is the ability to tune into their own emotions and needs. The article argues that when parents dismiss a child's feelings by saying things like "you're okay," it can erode the child's self-trust. Instead, validating their emotions, welcoming their full selves, and allowing them autonomy helps build emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. This fosters better mental health and a stronger sense of self-worth into adulthood.</p>

          <p>Sources suggest that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea is the most probable venue for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this year. The potential meeting, which could also occur as a separate visit to China beforehand, follows recent high-level talks between the two nations aimed at stabilizing relations. Tensions have been high since Trump's return to office and threats of heavy tariffs, but both sides have since worked towards de-escalation, including a preliminary trade deal.</p>

          <p>The small desert community of Newberry Springs, California, is banking on a revival as the historic Route 66 approaches its 100th anniversary in 2026. Once a bustling stop, the town declined after being bypassed by Interstate 40 in the 1970s. Now, local business owners and residents are planning events and seeking grants to capitalize on the expected influx of tourists and caravan tours for the centennial. They hope the anniversary will bring renewed attention and economic vitality to their 'frozen in time' slice of Americana.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that traditional metrics for the U.S. labor market, such as job creation numbers, are becoming increasingly irrelevant in the modern economy. The author points to the rise of the "over-employed," remote work, and the gig economy as factors that official data fails to capture accurately. Instead of focusing on jobs, the article proposes a shift to measuring income, suggesting that tracking how many people earn above a certain threshold would provide a more relevant and accurate picture of the nation's economic health.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that personality is not a fixed trait and can be intentionally redesigned through conscious effort. This article highlights the work of author Olga Khazan and professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala, whose studies show that individuals can alter ingrained traits like neuroticism or introversion by consistently practicing behaviors associated with the desired personality. By forcing oneself out of comfort zones, such as an anxious person taking an improv class, it is possible to create lasting changes in one's characteristic ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving.</p>

          <p>A team of archaeologists believes they have identified the wreck of the 'Nossa Senhora do Cabo,' a Portuguese warship captured in 1721 by the notorious French pirate Olivier Levasseur, also known as 'La Buse.'

The report suggests that as Western aid declines, Beijing is well-positioned to fill the development finance vacuum and enhance its strategic dominance in the region. (not investment advice)</p>
