          <p>Industrial conglomerate Honeywell announced it is exploring strategic alternatives for its productivity solutions and warehouse workflow segments. This move, which could lead to a sale valued at an estimated $3.8 billion, aims to streamline its automation portfolio before a planned three-way company split. The decision follows pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management and is seen as part of a broader strategy to focus on higher-growth areas, with shares reaching a record high following the news.

          <p>A New York Federal Reserve survey indicates that consumer expectations for inflation have returned to levels seen before the implementation of recent trade tariffs. The median expectation for inflation in the next 12 months dropped to 3%, matching the January level and down from a peak of 3.6% in March and April. While the headline outlook has eased, respondents still anticipate price increases in specific areas like medical care, college education, and rent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a 2-1 loss to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final, U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino views the tournament as a strategic success. By fielding a younger, less experienced squad due to the absence of several starters, the team was tested for determination and heart ahead of the World Cup. The article suggests that while the U.S. was outplayed, the experience revealed new talent and redefined the commitment required to play for the national team, building a foundation for the future.</p>

          <p>In an advice column for The Atlantic, writer James Parker responds to a 19-year-old reader expressing a fear of dying alone. Parker validates the reader's anxiety as appropriate for their age in the modern world, before reframing the human condition as one of profound connection rather than isolation. He encourages the reader to embrace their autonomy, engage with life, and trust that connections will form, concluding with the advice to "Be strong, mate. Be happy."</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Taliban Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The court found "reasonable grounds" to believe they have committed crimes against humanity through the systematic persecution of women and girls in Afghanistan since their 2021 takeover. The Taliban, which does not recognize the ICC's authority, has called the warrants an "insult," while human rights groups have praised the move as a step toward justice.</p>

The identification, confirmed by DNA, brings a measure of closure to his older sister and highlights the ongoing search for nearly 300 other stolen children.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey shows many Americans, particularly younger generations, are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," adjusting their finances based on feelings of economic anxiety. This has led to a trend of "revenge saving," a shift from post-pandemic splurging to building up emergency funds. Financial experts advise that while saving is positive, it should be intentional rather than emotional, recommending strategies like reverse budgeting, using separate accounts for goals, and periodically increasing savings rates to build financial security.
