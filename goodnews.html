          <p>Romania is holding a presidential runoff election after the previous election in November was annulled by the constitutional court due to irregularities in campaign financing and organization. The annulled election saw far-right, pro-Russian candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly win the first round, but he was later banned from standing in the rerun. The alleged electoral violations included the use of social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messaging as part of a "Russian hybrid attack", which Moscow denies. Public prosecutors opened an investigation into Georgescu in February, preventing his participation in the current election.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to delay the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and impose a monthly fee on current beneficiaries with ‚Äúunsatisfactory immigration status‚Äù due to budget deficits. The changes aim to address a $12 billion state budget shortfall, partly attributed to President Donald Trump's tariffs and rising healthcare costs. Under the plan, access to comprehensive Medi-Cal services for undocumented adults over 19 would be suspended starting January 1, although limited services like pregnancy and emergency care would remain available. Adults with ‚Äúunsatisfactory‚Äù immigration status would be charged $100 per month starting in 2027.</p>

          <p>Chris Smith, an Illinois man, survived a gunshot to the brain during a first date in 2021, a case covered by "48 Hours". Smith was found with a bullet lodged in his brain and his date, Leslie Reeves, was dead; he was placed in a medically induced coma. Doctors initially gave him a poor prognosis, stating he would likely not walk again, but Smith has made a remarkable recovery through intense physical therapy. Though he has no memory of the shooting, Smith has regained his strength, sings in his rock band, and is engaged to be married, now working as a motivational speaker.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings for "dangerous, life-threatening" conditions. The storm, driven by winds up to 70 mph from thunderstorms in central Illinois, lifted dust from exceptionally dry farmland. This event marked the first dust storm warning for Chicago from the Romeoville Weather Service office, reminiscent of conditions during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. The storm's formation was attributed to exceptionally dry soil conditions and strong winds.</p>

While Europe is investing in high-speed rail and promoting eco-friendly travel, America is focused on cars, planes, and niche transportation projects. Richards argues that America's car-dependent culture has led to unhappiness and congestion, and that investing in rail networks could offer a more sustainable and community-oriented alternative.

She lost her tent and sleeping bags but was able to use her skills as a nutritionist and forager to survive until she was found in a cabin by the owner of Vermilion Valley Resort. This article demonstrates the will to live and the ability to use skills to survive.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who had been living in eastern Congo since the 1994 genocide, returned home after Rwandan-backed rebels seized key parts of the region. The repatriation, facilitated by the UNHCR, aims to bring back 2,000 refugees, mostly women and children. These refugees had fled Rwanda after the genocide and some were born in Congo, never having seen their ancestral homeland. The returnees will receive assistance and support for reintegration as they return to Rwanda.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Foreign Policy Shifts Leave Israel Sidelined in Middle East Diplomacy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic moves in the Middle East, including engaging with Syria and pursuing deals with Gulf states, indicate a shift in U.S. foreign policy that has sidelined Israel. Trump's actions, such as lifting sanctions on Syria and pursuing a cease-fire in Yemen without Israel's involvement, signal a departure from the traditional U.S. approach of prioritizing Israeli interests. This shift has caused concern in Israel, as Trump's focus on economic deals and regional stability appears to take precedence over long-standing alliances.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's only female combat pilot, Lieutenant Kateryna, flies helicopter missions against Russian troops, facing both the dangers of war and sexism within the military. While the Ukrainian military is working to recruit more women due to the ongoing conflict, stereotypes and marginalization persist. Despite the challenges, Kateryna inspires other women to pursue careers in aviation and demonstrates her competence in combat. This article highlights the ongoing struggle for gender equality within the Ukrainian military and the determination of women to serve their country.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a fibre-optic gyroscope with improved stability across a wide temperature range, potentially revolutionizing navigation for aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. This gyroscope, which is a key component in inertial navigation systems, offers precise orientation measurement without relying on external signals like satellites. The technology is expected to be particularly valuable for military and security applications due to its immunity to interference. This article is about a piece of scientific innovation.</p>

          <p>Popular concerts and music festivals in China are driving a trend of "ticket tourism", with fans traveling across the country and to Hong Kong to attend live performances. Local governments are capitalizing on this trend by bundling concert tickets with discounted hotel stays, dining, and tourist attractions to boost domestic consumption. This article discusses the use of incentives to encourage tourism.</p>

          <p>Officials have attributed the collision of the Mexican Navy training ship Cuauht√©moc with the Brooklyn Bridge to mechanical issues that caused the vessel to lose power. The incident, which injured 19 of the 277 people onboard, prompted a search-and-rescue operation and a structural assessment of the bridge. Preliminary assessments indicated no major damage to the bridge, but the ship sustained damage to its masts. The ship was en route to Iceland when the incident occurred.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is reportedly considering plans to have convicted criminals perform unpaid work such as filling potholes and cleaning bins. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood believes current community sentences are too lenient and wants to expand unpaid work opportunities, partnering with local councils and private companies. Offenders would not receive wages; instead, the money earned would go to a fund for victim support. This initiative aims to address prison overcrowding and provide more meaningful punishment, while also benefiting local communities.</p>
