          <p>Alice Cole, a primary school teacher, returned to work part-time after having her first child, highlighting the importance of flexible working arrangements for teachers. Cole says that working full-time would have made family time "non-existent", and that she wouldn't change the time she has with her son for the world. The article explores the challenges of teacher recruitment and retention, and how flexible working options can help address these issues. It also touches on the government's efforts to recruit new teachers and the debate over teacher pay and working conditions.</p>
