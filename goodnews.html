          <p>Members of Parliament have voted to decriminalize abortion for women in England and Wales, amending the Crime and Policing Bill to remove the threat of prosecution for ending a pregnancy. The amendment, led by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, addresses the 1% of abortions that occur after 24 weeks, emphasizing compassion over criminalization for women in desperate circumstances. Stella Creasy proposed a further amendment to enshrine abortion access as a human right, though it did not go to a vote, while a Conservative amendment seeking in-person consultations before medication abortions was defeated. The current law permits abortion up to 24 weeks and beyond under certain conditions, such as when the woman's life is in danger.</p>

          <p>Despite claims that the Trump Organization's newly announced T1 smartphone will be manufactured in the United States, experts believe it will likely be made in China. The company stated the phone, which will retail for $499 and run on Android, would be "built in the United States," but industry analysts suggest it was likely designed and will be manufactured by a Chinese firm. Experts cite the lack of readily available local manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. and the impracticality of designing a phone from scratch domestically as reasons for their skepticism. This comes after President Trump previously urged Apple to manufacture its iPhones in the U.S., a move experts deem nearly impossible and costly.</p>

Salonen's vision included transforming the orchestra into a vehicle for social and technological good, but the symphony did not fully invest in his vision, unlike the Los Angeles Philharmonic during his tenure there.</p>

          <p>Baltimore Pride is commemorating 50 years of advocating for the LGBTQ+ community, marked by a rally near the Washington Monument in Mount Vernon. The Pride Center of Maryland CEO, Cleo Manago, reflected on the community's struggles and evolution, noting the initial focus on white gay men and the later inclusion of women, leading to the Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Baltimore. The organization shifted its focus to provide resources during the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and has since advocated for same-sex marriage and other issues, with ongoing efforts to ensure inclusivity for people of color. The center continues to fill gaps in the pursuit of justice, ensuring everyone feels seen and safe.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have proposed a tax break for tipped workers as part of a broader tax cut package, similar to a plan passed by House Republicans. Both versions offer a deduction on qualified tips, defined as those paid in cash or received as part of a tip-sharing arrangement, available from 2025 through 2028. However, the Senate proposal caps the deduction at $25,000 per year, unlike the uncapped House bill, and features different income limits for eligibility. The Senate bill would gradually reduce the value of the tax deduction once an individual's income exceeds $150,000, while the House bill makes the tax deduction completely unavailable once an individual's income hits $160,000 per year.</p>
