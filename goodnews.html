          <p>All 260 employees at the Kloof gold mine near Johannesburg have been safely accounted for and provided with food after a 'shaft incident' at Sibanye Stillwater's sub-shaft. The company implemented safety and shaft examination procedures, deciding to keep employees at the sub-shaft station to avoid long distances until it was safe to proceed to the surface. Initial investigations indicate that a rock winder skip door opened at the loading point, impacting levels below, causing some damage which has been addressed. The workers were not trapped, and the company expected all affected employees to be brought to the surface on Friday afternoon.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following the Department of Homeland Security's decision to revoke its ability to enroll international students under the F-1 visa program.

Harvard accuses the administration of retaliation for exercising its First Amendment rights and refusing to comply with demands to control the university's governance, curriculum, and faculty ideology.

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal, pro-European mayor of Bucharest, won the Romanian presidential election, defeating the hard-right candidate George Simion, with significant support from ethnic Hungarians and Moldovan citizens holding Romanian passports.

The Hungarian minority defied Viktor Orban's support for Simion, while Moldovans rejected Simion's pro-reunification stance.

The investment will be used to accelerate subscriber growth, which surged after Intuit shut down its budgeting tool, Mint, in early 2024. Monarch aims to provide an all-in-one mobile app for tracking spending, investments, and financial goals, differentiating itself from Mint by relying on paying subscribers rather than advertising or selling user data.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields decreased as President Trump escalated trade tensions by proposing a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. The moves prompted investors to seek safety in bonds, driving yields down. The decline follows a volatile week for bonds, with yields initially rising due to concerns over Trump's budget bill and a credit rating downgrade by Moody's.

          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are embracing 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study by Mynavi Career Research Lab found that 45% of workers admit to doing the bare minimum in their jobs, motivated primarily by a desire for more personal time. This shift reflects a change in attitudes towards work, with younger generations rejecting the sacrifices made by their parents and seeking a more balanced lifestyle.

The object is estimated to be about 700 kilometers across, meeting the size requirements for a dwarf planet. Its highly elliptical orbit, extending as far as 1,600 astronomical units from the Sun, suggests that there is no large Planet Nine influencing the orbits of other trans-Neptunian objects.

          <p>The Atlantic examines the 'Wages for Housework' movement, a radical feminist campaign from the 1970s that advocated for government pay for unpaid care work. This movement sought to provide economic freedom for women, in contrast to more reactionary approaches that simply glorify motherhood. The article reflects on the movement's goals of creating communal social structures and facilities to alleviate the burden of housework, allowing women to pursue their own interests. The author argues that understanding the campaign's vision is crucial, especially when governments are reducing support for families.</p>
