          <p>The Royal Family is prioritizing the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day, hoping to maintain focus on honoring veterans and the significance of the end of World War Two. This comes shortly after Prince Harry's candid BBC interview, where he discussed his strained relationship with his father, King Charles, and his security concerns in the UK after losing a court battle. Commemorations will include events at the Cenotaph, a military procession, and a Buckingham Palace balcony appearance, with King Charles and Queen Camilla leading the nation in remembrance. The Palace hopes nothing detracts from celebrating the wartime generation, especially given Prince Harry's recent comments about his father's health and their estrangement.</p>

          <h2>Egg Freezing Offers Women Increased Reproductive Options and Flexibility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 19:04:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Egg freezing is increasingly viewed as a way for women to extend their reproductive years, allowing them to pursue education, careers, and personal goals without the pressure of a ticking biological clock. Dr. Tomer Singer notes the rise in younger women freezing their eggs, highlighting its revolutionary potential similar to the birth control pill. Women are freezing their eggs to increase their chances of having a baby when they're older, allowing them not to rush to find partners, and not obsess over the ticking of their biological clocks. Success rates depend on the age at which eggs are frozen and the number of eggs stored, and there is a growing call for gynecologists to discuss egg freezing as a routine option with younger women.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More women are turning to egg freezing to preserve their fertility, a process that involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen. The process can cost between $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus annual storage fees, and thawing and fertilization adds another $10,000. Dr. Lucky Sekhon emphasizes that egg quality decreases with age, making the 20s the optimal time to freeze eggs, while Dr. Tomer Singer sees egg freezing as revolutionary as the pill, giving women more control over their reproductive timelines. While some companies are starting to cover the costs, many women still pay out of pocket, viewing it as an investment in their future reproductive options.</p>
