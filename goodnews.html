          <p>A JetBlue flight arriving from Chicago O'Hare International Airport rolled into a grass area off the runway after landing at Boston Logan International Airport on Thursday. No injuries were reported among the passengers, who were seen exiting the Airbus A220 using stairs. The Massachusetts Port Authority stated that the runway was temporarily closed while the aircraft was assessed and passengers were bussed to the terminal.

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China During Neolithic Period</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeological research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China as early as 8,000 years ago, challenging the conventional view that domestication first occurred in the Near East. The study, analyzing early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, found evidence that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste. This suggests that the domestication of wild boars coincided with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient Chinese society. The findings provide new insights into the origins of pig domestication and its relationship to early agricultural practices.</p>

          <p>Patrick Reed achieved a rare albatross, also known as a double eagle, during the first round of the US Open at Oakmont, holing out with a 3-wood from 286 yards on the par-5 fourth hole. Despite the exceptional shot, Reed finished the round at 3-over 73 after a triple bogey on the 18th hole. This marks only the fourth albatross in US Open history since records began being kept in 1983. Reed said the best one he hit came at a tournament in Germany, when he came out in the morning to finish the last four holes after getting rained out the night before.</p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has commenced, drawing attention as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race. With no party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, the focus is on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party can retain its seats. Major issues at stake include support for households facing rising living costs, political funding scandals, child-rearing, and measures against heat. Around 300 candidates are running in the assembly election, marking the highest number in over 30 years.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are continuing their overseas expansion to ensure survival amid ongoing trade tensions and tariffs from the United States. Despite a temporary truce in the tariff war, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain subject to high tariffs. Companies are diversifying their production bases, with a shift towards the Middle East and Africa for planned capacity expansion. Executives at the SNEC PV+ Photovoltaic Power Conference and Exhibition in Shanghai emphasized the necessity of localizing production abroad due to the tariff situation.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will be the first to offer a novel "Trojan horse" therapy for myeloma, a type of blood cancer. This treatment, belantamab mafodotin, delivers chemotherapy drugs directly into cancer cells, prolonging remission periods compared to existing therapies. Clinical trials have shown that it can halt the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with current treatments. One of the first patients to receive the therapy reported it to be "life-changing", allowing him to resume a normal life.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi is spearheading an initiative to lower rice prices amid rising household burdens, drawing comparisons to his father, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. This move has put Koizumi back in the spotlight after his third-place finish in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership race. Koizumi's actions include releasing government stockpiled rice at reduced prices to retailers, addressing controversial issues in the agricultural sector. Some analysts suggest that his reformist approach could benefit the LDP in the upcoming national election.</p>
