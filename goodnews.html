          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to assist eligible students with private school tuition. The new law allocates $10,000 per year for most private school students, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 annually for homeschooled students. Supporters of the bill, including President Trump, hailed it as a victory for students and parents, granting them greater educational freedom. Conversely, Texas Democrats argue that the legislation will harm public schools by diverting crucial funding to private institutions.</p>
