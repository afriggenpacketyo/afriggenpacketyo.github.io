          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to television on Tuesday, nearly a week after it was indefinitely suspended. The show was pulled following comments Kimmel made regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which Disney described as "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The company stated the suspension was intended to de-escalate a tense national situation and that the decision to reinstate the show came after thoughtful conversations with Kimmel. The controversy had drawn criticism from conservatives and prompted several major station owners to preemptively pull the show.</p>

The plan is designed to address national security concerns that the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could be influenced by Beijing.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners looking to borrow $50,000 against their home equity have slightly cheaper options, but key differences remain between home equity loans and HELOCs. Currently, a HELOC is marginally less expensive per month, but its variable interest rate introduces long-term uncertainty, as payments could rise if market rates increase. In contrast, a home equity loan offers a fixed rate, providing predictable monthly payments over the life of the loan. Homeowners are advised to weigh the stability of a fixed-rate loan against the immediate, but potentially temporary, savings of a variable-rate HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to stop construction on the Revolution Wind farm, a major offshore project being developed by Danish company Orsted. The judge granted a temporary injunction, allowing Orsted to resume work on the nearly completed project off the coast of New England, which is set to power over 350,000 homes. The Interior Department had issued a stop-work order in August, reflecting President Trump's broader policy goal of shutting down the U.S. offshore wind industry. The ruling is a significant victory for renewable energy proponents and a setback for the administration's anti-wind agenda.</p>

It argues that efforts by political leaders to retaliate against artists and journalists for their speech strike at the core of American freedoms.
