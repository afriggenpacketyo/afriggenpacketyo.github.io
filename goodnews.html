          <p>Intel's shares surged over 30% after Nvidia announced a $5 billion investment in the chipmaker, aiming to co-develop data center and PC chips. This historic collaboration seeks to integrate Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing with Intel's CPUs and the x86 ecosystem, fostering the next era of computing. The investment, pending regulatory approvals, specifically excludes manufacturing Nvidia chips with Intel's foundry. This positive development follows Intel's recent acquisition of a 10% investment from the U.S. government, contributing to a significant rebound for the company's stock after hitting a decade low earlier this year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Patients and doctors are increasingly turning to AI chatbots like ChatGPT for medical advice, revealing both promising capabilities and significant risks. One instance saw ChatGPT accurately diagnose a rare condition, while another led to a patient ingesting a toxic substance based on the AI's suggestion. Experts warn that AI's conversational nature, unlike traditional search engines, can be misleading, especially given its tendency to "hallucinate" information. While beneficial for preparing patient questions or deciphering medical jargon, privacy is a major concern as chatbots are not HIPAA-compliant. The article emphasizes that human medical expertise remains paramount, urging caution and open communication with doctors regarding AI use.</p>

          <p>Darden Restaurants reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results, with its Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse brands performing well, but its fine-dining business showing weakness. The company missed earnings per share estimates but matched revenue expectations, with net sales climbing 10.4% to $3.04 billion, aided by the acquisition of Chuy's Tex Mex. Despite an initial 6% dip in premarket shares, Darden raised its full-year revenue growth forecast to 7.5%-8.5%, although it reiterated its earnings per share projections. This indicates a strategic focus on growth through acquisitions and strong casual dining performance, even amidst some sector-specific challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Zealand is spearheading an ambitious conservation effort, leveraging AI and genetic research to protect its unique, flightless birds like the kākāpō and takahē from invasive predators. These rare species, once believed extinct, are highly vulnerable to introduced mammals. The country aims for a complete eradication of invasive predators by 2050, a project demanding significant resources and innovative solutions. Automated, AI-powered traps are being deployed, and genetic research is exploring methods like gene drives to prevent predator breeding. Despite the immense scale and potential risks of genetic modification, the initiative seeks to restore native wildlife populations and develop globally applicable conservation tools.</p>

During a state banquet, King Charles III underscored the "special relationship" between the US and UK, celebrating their shared values and an irreplaceable bond, despite the ongoing international challenges.</p>

          <p>Leonardo DiCaprio's new film, "One Battle After Another," a project two decades in the making by director Paul Thomas Anderson, delves into themes of cultural divisiveness and extremism. DiCaprio portrays a paranoid ex-revolutionary who must confront an old nemesis after his daughter goes missing. The actor characterized the film as reflecting society's growing polarization, describing it as "political without making it feel like medicine" and highlighting its underlying exploration of extremism. Co-star Benicio del Toro lauded the article for its entertainment, heart, and timely relevance. Critics have widely praised the movie, with several awarding five stars and calling it a "ferocious American masterpiece" for its compelling themes and powerful acting.</p>

          <p>The UK government announced securing £150 billion in US investment, projected to create 7,600 jobs, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. This includes significant commitments from tech giants like Microsoft (£22bn) and Google (£5bn), with Blackstone pledging a massive £90 billion over the next decade. Prime Minister Keir Starmer lauded these investments as evidence of Britain's economic strength and its openness for business. However, this positive news is tempered by a concurrent slowdown in domestic business investment due to rising operational costs. Furthermore, major pharmaceutical companies, including Merck and AstraZeneca, have recently paused or redirected substantial UK investment plans, citing an "increasingly challenging" business environment.

          <p>China's National Immigration Administration reported a significant increase in international travel, with 15.89 million visa-free entries recorded from January to August, constituting approximately two-thirds of all international arrivals. This growth is largely fueled by visitors from Southeast Asia, particularly after a reciprocal visa-free agreement with Malaysia commenced in July. Since its implementation, Malaysian passport holders alone have made 150,000 visa-free trips to China. The article also anticipates Russia becoming another substantial source of visa-free arrivals. This trend highlights China's successful efforts to stimulate tourism and enhance international engagement through strategic adjustments to its entry policies.</p>

          <p>Phasmagorica," an immersive séance experience conceptualized by BC Smith, is consistently selling out at L.A.'s Heritage Square Museum, providing a unique exploration of communing with the deceased. Described as "a séance reimagined as art," the event delves into the modern Western history of spiritualism, deliberately excluding a medium or overt magical illusions. Smith, a self-professed "hopeful skeptic" and magician, crafted the experience for both believers and nonbelievers, aiming to foster personal exploration of the unknown and spark conversation.

          <p>California is resolutely advancing its ambitious offshore wind energy initiatives, despite the Trump administration's cancellation of nearly half a billion dollars in federal funding for the state's largest project. The state targets 25 gigawatts of floating offshore wind by 2045, crucial for its carbon neutrality goal. While the Trump administration, backed by fossil fuel donations, cut renewable energy funding, California secured $475 million via a climate bond. State officials and industry experts remain committed, prioritizing port upgrades and transmission infrastructure. They contend the federal setback only strengthens their resolve to lead in clean energy, despite concerns about the potential chilling effect on private investment and ongoing federal reviews of existing leases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>West Hollywood is poised to become the first city in Los Angeles County to implement a broad ban on the sale of most live animals in pet stores, effective May 1, 2026. This ordinance expands upon a 2010 law prohibiting dog and cat sales, now encompassing rabbits, amphibians, arachnids, birds, fish, reptiles, and hermit crabs. Animals sourced from shelters, animal control facilities, humane societies, and rescue organizations will remain exempt. Animal welfare organizations, including SPCA LA and PETA, commend the decision as a significant advancement against cruel breeding mills. Conversely, the Pet Advocacy Network warns that such bans can inadvertently fuel black market sales and undermine legitimate retailers, referencing problems encountered with California's statewide dog sales ban.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Renaming Department of Defense to 'Department of War' Offers Honest Reckoning</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece contends that President Trump's proposal to rename the Department of Defense to the "Department of War" could force a more honest confrontation with America's use of military power. The author suggests the term "Defense" has long served as a euphemism, obscuring continuous warfare and making exorbitant military budgets appear non-negotiable, whereas "War" conveys greater cost and demands stronger justification. The article delves into the historical context of the original Department of War, noting its involvement in colonization and brutal campaigns. Ultimately, it argues that Trump's rebrand, despite potentially romanticizing past conflicts, strips away the deceptive veneer of military policy as solely peacekeeping, thereby fostering a more transparent public discourse on the funding and global deployment of U.S. military force.</p>
