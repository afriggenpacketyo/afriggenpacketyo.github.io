          <p>Marcus Ericsson and Kyle Kirkwood of Andretti Global were moved to the rear of the Indy 500 field after their cars failed post-race technical inspection.

While manufacturing activity slowed, industrial output expanded, with exports to the U.S. declining but overall exports surging due to increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations.

          <p>The ultra-wealthy are increasingly storing their gold in Singapore due to rising economic and geopolitical uncertainty, according to industry watchers. A storage facility called "The Reserve" has seen an 88% increase in orders to store gold and silver from the start of the year to April, compared to the same period in 2024. Singapore is viewed as a safe jurisdiction with political and economic stability, leading the wealthy to opt for physical gold bars over paper to limit price exposure. The shift reflects concerns about tariffs, geopolitical instability, and a lack of trust in some domestic banking systems.</p>

The new policy will restrict funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, to those under 21, requiring employers to fully fund older students. The government aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults by increasing a charge paid by employers recruiting from outside the UK.

          <p>King Charles's visit to Canada is interpreted as a subtle rebuke to President Trump, who has previously threatened the country's sovereignty. Invited by Prime Minister Mark Carney, the visit and the King's address to Parliament are seen as emphasizing Canada's distinct heritage and independence from the United States. While the King stays out of direct politics, his presence reinforces Canada's unique identity and historical ties to Britain, and serves as a show of diplomatic support.</p>

          <p>Charles Rangel, a prominent figure in New York politics and the last surviving member of Harlem's "Gang of Four," has died at the age of 94. Rangel served as a Democratic member of the House of Representatives for 46 years, representing New York's 13th Congressional District and advocating for affordable housing, urban revitalization, and equal opportunities. A Korean War veteran and the first Black chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rangel's legacy includes significant contributions to Harlem's economic development, though his career was also marked by ethics controversies.</p>
