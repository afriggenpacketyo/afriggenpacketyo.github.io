          <p>New architectural renderings have provided further details on the White House ballroom currently under construction in the East Wing. The 90,000-square-foot facility, designed to seat 650 people, will be significantly larger than the main White House building. The project is reportedly funded by private donors and President Trump, with nearly $200 million already pledged from various corporate and individual sources. Construction began earlier this month on the South Lawn, with McCrery Architects PLLC leading the design. This expansion aims to enhance the White House's capacity for large-scale events.</p>

          <p>Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) interest rates have fallen to an average of 7.88%, a 17-basis-point drop in one week, following recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. This decline presents homeowners with a more affordable borrowing option, especially given record-high cumulative home equity levels. HELOCs are now among the cheapest ways to borrow, with rates lower than home equity loans, personal loans, and credit cards. Their variable rate structure also means potential further savings if the Fed continues to cut rates, without requiring refinancing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing, as major health agencies move to phase out live animal research. This shift is driven by an unusual coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan lawmakers, who advocate for alternatives like AI modeling and lab testing. While animal experiments have been crucial for developing many life-saving drugs and vaccines, the move sparks uncertainty for patients who benefit from ongoing research. The debate highlights a tension between ethical concerns, scientific progress, and the pace of alternative technology development.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh made MLB history by hitting his 60th home run of the season, joining an elite group of players. In a heartwarming moment, the fan who caught the historic ball reportedly gave it to a young boy nearby, a gesture that resonated positively amidst recent viral incidents involving fan behavior. Raleigh's achievement, which also helped the Mariners clinch their first AL West title since 2001, places him close to breaking Aaron Judge's AL record. The act of kindness contrasted with past controversies over valuable sports memorabilia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, the monthly cost of a $40,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable. For a 10-year term at 7.88%, payments would be around $482.78, and for a 15-year term, approximately $379.49. These figures represent a noticeable reduction compared to earlier in the year and last fall. The article emphasizes that HELOCs offer the flexibility of interest-only payments during the initial draw period, potentially making them even cheaper. Future rate cuts could further decrease these monthly expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, the United Nations General Assembly has included dementia in a new declaration addressing mental health challenges and non-communicable diseases. This inclusion is a historic "watershed moment" for advocacy groups like Alzheimer's Disease International, particularly for lower-income countries where the condition often faces denial. While the World Health Organization previously had a dementia action plan, its omission from broader policy frameworks highlighted a persistent stigma. This recognition is a crucial step toward integrating dementia into global health agendas, though implementation across countries is expected to take years.</p>
