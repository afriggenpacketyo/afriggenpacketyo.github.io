          <p>Lando Norris emerged victorious at the Monaco Grand Prix, converting his pole position into a lead at the first corner and maintaining it throughout the race. The race saw minimal intervention from the safety car, leading to relatively straightforward strategies for the front-runners, including Leclerc and Piastri, who finished second and third, respectively. Verstappen faced a disadvantage due to limited tire availability, leading Red Bull to adopt an inverted strategy, hoping for a crash and red flag to maintain his lead. Ultimately, Verstappen had to pit with one lap to go, dropping to fourth place.</p>

          <p>Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, a move seen as a statement of sovereignty and independence against threats from US President Donald Trump. This is a rare occasion, as a British monarch has not delivered Canada's throne speech since 1977, and not opened a brand new session of parliament since 1957. Carney campaigned heavily on standing up to Trump, after the US president spent months undermining Canada's sovereignty by suggesting it would be better off as a US state. The visit is also a way for Prime Minister Carney to improve the relationship with Trump, who is famously a fan of the British monarchy and its history.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Anne Tyler discusses her writing process, stating that her "selfish motive" is to explore other lives. She describes her latest book, "Three Days in June," which details a long weekend in the life of a school administrator, bookended by the loss of her job and her daughter's wedding. Tyler finds inspiration in the lives of "humdrum" characters, and strives to create "an extremely believable lie."

          <p>Conservationists are debating whether to shift from protecting individual species to protecting entire ecosystems. While the Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been effective, it focuses on saving the most imperiled species rather than preventing populations from crashing. An ecosystem-protection act could categorize lands and fresh water into ecosystem types and ensure that each type has sufficient area protected. The challenge lies in defining and categorizing ecosystems, but a robust network of protected ecosystems would support most of America‚Äôs species. The article suggests this could be a unifying cause, as love for American landscapes is bipartisan.</p>

This approach focuses on building emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without rushing to fix or dismiss them, responding without shaming and viewing "bad" behavior as stress signals. The key elements include inner work, empathy, and creating an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves authentically.</p>
