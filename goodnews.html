          <p>Three brothers from Scotland—Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan Maclean—have set a new world record by completing the fastest unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean in 139 days. They journeyed over 9,000 miles from Peru to Cairns, Australia, becoming the first team to row the full distance from South America to Australia without stopping. Throughout their arduous journey, which included storms and injuries, the brothers raised over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar through their charity, the Maclean Foundation. Their achievement surpasses the previous record of 160 days set by a solo rower in 2014.</p>

          <p>A growing trend, fueled by social media and increasingly extravagant wedding seasons, sees brides purchasing numerous outfits for a series of pre-wedding events like bachelorette parties and bridal showers. Experts note that brides now buy an average of 12 looks, a significant increase from just a few years ago, with some spending thousands of dollars on their bridal wardrobes. This shift is driven by the desire for unique, photo-ready moments for each celebration, pressure from family and friends, and the rise of multi-day destination weddings. Retailers are capitalizing on this demand by offering extensive collections of "little white dresses" and accessories for every occasion.</p>

          <p>As Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) marks a decade in power, his leadership has brought profound and rapid changes to the Kingdom's society and economy. Key reforms include significantly advancing women's rights, such as permitting driving and easing guardianship laws, which has boosted female workforce participation to 36%. Socially, the religious police have been sidelined, and a new entertainment industry has emerged with cinemas, concerts, and international sporting events. Economically, MBS has pushed to diversify from oil by launching mega-projects like NEOM and expanding the Public Investment Fund, alongside implementing fiscal reforms and modernizing legal systems to attract foreign investment.</p>

The Welsh team, needing a win to keep their progression hopes alive, now faces likely elimination from the tournament. Canada established control early, securing a bonus point in the first half with tries from McKinley Hunt, Alysha Corrigan, and Asia Hogan-Rochester. Despite a resilient effort from Wales in the closing stages, they were unable to score, highlighting the gap in class and power between the two sides. Wales' fate now depends on the outcome of the Fiji versus Scotland match.</p>

          <p>A new ranking from The Princeton Review has identified the private colleges in the U.S. that offer the best return on investment (ROI), with Princeton University topping the list. The analysis considered factors like financial aid, academic rigor, and post-graduation earnings. Despite high sticker prices, elite private institutions often provide generous financial aid, making them more affordable than some public schools and leading to high median incomes for graduates. For instance, Princeton students on financial aid pay an average of just $10,555 annually and earn a median income over $110,000 a decade later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, a prominent activist firm, has announced a significant investment in Rexford Industrial Realty, a REIT focused on the Southern California industrial market. Rexford's stock has underperformed, trading at a substantial discount to its net asset value, which is attributed to issues like bloated expenses, poor corporate governance, and excessive executive compensation. Elliott is expected to push for changes to improve governance and capital allocation to restore shareholder value. Given Rexford's premium assets and discounted valuation, speculation about a potential acquisition has intensified, a scenario Elliott has catalyzed at other REITs in the past.

After his family performed life-saving CPR, Reid spent weeks unconscious and on life support before undergoing successful heart and kidney transplants. His doctors had to advocate for him to receive the dual transplant due to his age and the severity of his condition. Eighteen months later, Reid has returned to his pulpit, significantly reduced his medication, and recently completed a 5K run alongside the hospital staff who cared for him.</p>

The article argues that decades of research on programs like Social Security and tax credits show that giving money to those in need is a proven anti-poverty tool. The lackluster results of recent pilots may be attributed to their small scale and the unique economic context of the pandemic and subsequent inflation. While cash is not a panacea for systemic issues like the high cost of housing and healthcare, it remains a powerful and efficient tool for alleviating material hardship. (not investment advice)</p>
