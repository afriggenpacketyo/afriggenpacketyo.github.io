          <p>Portugal's anti-immigration Chega party has become the main opposition party after securing the second-most seats in parliament, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. This rise coincides with similar gains by far-right forces in other European countries. Chega, meaning "Enough," won 60 of the 230 National Assembly seats, campaigning on a hardline stance against immigration. The party's leader, Andre Ventura, hailed this as a profound change, challenging the traditional dominance of center-right and center-left parties in Portugal. </p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Court of International Trade stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce with other nations. The ruling gave the White House 10 days to halt the tariffs, but the Trump administration immediately lodged an appeal. The court also blocked levies imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada related to drug and illegal immigration flows. </p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand in anticipation of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also rose by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. The increase comes as the company braces for the impact of additional tariffs imposed by the U.S. The company anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year due to the tariffs and a stronger yen. </p>

Japan is seeking the removal of higher tariffs on cars, car parts, steel, and aluminum imposed by the U.S. to reduce its trade deficits.
