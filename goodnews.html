          <p>President Trump announced that his administration will inform other nations of the tariff rates the U.S. will impose on imports, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick sending the letters. These tariffs, which are intended to encourage businesses to relocate manufacturing to the U.S., have raised concerns among retailers like Walmart, who warn of potential price hikes for consumers. Goldman Sachs analysts anticipate that the U.S.'s effective tariff rate will significantly increase, reaching levels not seen since the 1930s. The article discusses the potential economic impact of these tariffs on both businesses and consumers.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is offering to unbundle its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites from its Teams communication app to address competition concerns raised by European regulators. The European Commission has stated that Microsoft made a series of commitments to address concerns over the tying of Teams to its widely-used productivity tools, such as Word and Outlook. Microsoft has said it will make versions of Office 365 and Microsoft 365 available without Teams at a reduced price, as well as allow customers to switch to the tools without Teams, including under existing contracts.</p>
