          <p>In an interview with The New York Times, Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan discusses the Democratic Party's challenges in appealing to working-class voters and emphasizes the need for a clearer economic vision. She argues that Democrats have become too coastal and lack a strong leadership figure, or "alpha energy," that resonates with voters. Slotkin suggests that the party needs to prioritize economic issues over social issues and offer authentic, relatable solutions to the challenges faced by everyday Americans. She also highlights the importance of national security and border control, advocating for policies that align with public opinion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the historical shift of the word 'pride' from a negative connotation, associated with the seven deadly sins, to a symbol of LGBTQ+ empowerment. The term gained prominence in the LGBTQ+ community following the Stonewall Uprising in 1969, with organizers choosing 'pride' over 'gay power' for its unifying and self-affirming message. Despite progress, the LGBTQ+ community continues to face challenges, including anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and corporate backlash, making 'pride' a relevant and powerful symbol today. The article highlights the complex history and ongoing significance of the word in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights and acceptance.</p>
