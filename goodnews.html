          <p>Autonomous vehicles promise to be much safer than human drivers, who are prone to distractions, fatigue, anger, and impairment, leading to millions of road crash deaths globally each year. A Waymo study comparing its self-driving cars' performance over 56.7 million miles to human drivers found an 81% reduction in airbag-deploying crashes and an 85% reduction in crashes with serious injuries. The study suggests that widespread adoption of self-driving cars could save tens of thousands of lives annually, although challenges remain in expanding the technology to diverse conditions and addressing public apprehension.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's policies indirectly influenced the Australian election, contributing to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's re-election. Voters were wary of Mr. Dutton, who was likened to Mr. Trump, and they were concerned about economic instability and the cost of living, which were impacted by Trump's trade policies. While Albanese did not directly campaign against Trump, the global tumult caused by his policies made him a factor in the election. The result demonstrates a rejection of Trump-style politics and a preference for sensible, centrist policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Native American women, particularly from south-eastern Indigenous nations, are reclaiming the tradition of facial tattoos as a form of cultural revitalization and personal commitment. The Inchunwa Project, a community collective, supports this movement through research, education, and tattooing sessions. The practice, which was once common but faded due to colonization, now represents a connection to ancestors, a commitment to community, and a pathway for future generations. The traditional process differs from western tattooing, often involving hand-poked designs without stencils, emphasizing a deeper connection between the tattooer and the person receiving the tattoo.</p>
