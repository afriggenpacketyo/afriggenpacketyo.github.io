          <p>According to The New York Times, the UK is on track to be the first country to finalize a trade agreement with the U.S. after President Trump hinted at an upcoming announcement. While the U.S. imposed tariffs on various nations, the UK was spared the higher duties. A UK spokesperson noted ongoing talks with the U.S., emphasizing a commitment to finding solutions for UK businesses and consumers. The article notes uncertainty around whether the agreement will be a finalized deal or a framework for future negotiations, with Trump recently expressing that other nations must agree to deals with the U.S. rather than the other way around.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk reported a stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit but revised its global container market volume growth forecast downward due to macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. The company's underlying EBITDA rose 70% compared to the previous year, but it now expects global container market volume growth to be between -1% and 4%. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc cited rising trade tensions and uncertainty as factors impacting global supply chains, while disruption in the Red Sea is expected to continue throughout the year. The shipping industry continues to navigate a complex tariff landscape, including U.S. tariffs on products from China and retaliatory measures from Beijing.</p>

          <p>Prisons Minister James Timpson has indicated that more criminals could be tagged instead of being incarcerated, though he insists he is "not soft on crime." The government is exploring how technology can better monitor offenders and reduce violence in prisons, with over 30 companies, including Microsoft and Google, participating in discussions. Timpson, known for hiring ex-offenders, acknowledges the prison system is in a state of "crisis" with limited spare capacity. A recent study suggests that curfew-monitoring tags can reduce reoffending by 20%, but the government acknowledges that the contract with Serco for managing tagging has been "far from perfect.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's has postponed its auction of sacred jewels linked to the Buddha's remains in Hong Kong following a threat of legal action by the Indian government. The sale of the Piprahwa Gems, described as a significant archaeological find, drew criticism from Buddhist academics and monastic leaders who deemed it offensive to the global Buddhist community. India argued that the relics constituted "inalienable religious and cultural heritage" and that their sale violated Indian and international laws. Sotheby's cited ongoing discussions between the parties as the reason for the postponement, with further updates to be shared as appropriate.</p>

          <p>The article suggests that Nigel Farage's opposition to net zero policies resonates with voters who prioritize cutting the cost of living. A recent poll indicated that nearly 60% of voters believe cutting the cost of living is more important than achieving net zero, while only 13% prioritize net zero. The author argues that this result shows voters do not genuinely believe in net zero, as they would prioritize it above all other issues if they did. The situation is compared to Jeremy Corbyn's policies, which polled well in isolation but failed to resonate with voters when weighed against other priorities.</p>

The specifics remain unclear, with uncertainty about whether it will require Congressional approval.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has resisted reducing food production standards to allow more trade of U.S. agricultural products.

The creators emphasize that the AI is only used to create her likeness, not to write the course or invent her views.
