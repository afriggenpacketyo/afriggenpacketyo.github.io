          <h2>China Implements Rate Cuts and Policy Measures to Shield Economy from US Tariffs</h2>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced plans to cut key interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio in an effort to bolster economic growth amidst trade tensions with the United States. The People's Bank of China will reduce the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points, leading to a decrease in the loan prime rate, while also lowering the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, injecting significant liquidity into the market. This move comes as Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng is set to hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland to discuss tariff and trade matters, signaling a potential turning point in the ongoing trade war. The measures aim to stabilize markets, support exporters, aid small businesses, and boost domestic consumption amid escalating tariffs imposed by both countries.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a more conciliatory tone towards Canada during a meeting with the new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, despite previously making disparaging remarks about the country. Trump expressed his affection for Canada and its people, a stark contrast to his earlier rhetoric about potentially acquiring Canada as the 51st state. Carney firmly asserted that Canada is not for sale and emphasized the importance of partnership between the two nations. The meeting covered a range of topics, including trade, and aimed to address tensions that have strained U.S.-Canada relations.</p>

It was the first appearance for both at what is widely considered fashion‚Äôs most iconic red carpet. The mood for some quickly dampened when it became clear that the South Asian superstars were not receiving the level of respect that their fans felt they deserved, especially because both Mr. Khan and Diljit have cultivated international followings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China, a major aluminum producer and consumer, relies heavily on imported aluminum ore due to a lack of high-quality bauxite. However, a plant in Shanxi province is being upgraded with French technology that will enable it to produce aluminum from China's low-grade ore, previously unusable. The technology, developed by Yves Ocello from IB2, neutralizes silica and sulfur, allowing high-silica bauxite to be refined using the Bayer method. This development could significantly reduce China's dependence on imported aluminum ore from Guinea and Australia.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly stated that Canada is "not for sale" during a meeting with President Trump, who had previously romanticized the idea of the U.S. acquiring Canada. Despite Trump's repeated suggestions of a "wonderful marriage" between the two countries, Carney emphasized Canada's independence and the importance of partnership. Carney also requested that Trump refrain from referring to Canada as the 51st state. The two leaders discussed trade and global issues, with Carney emphasizing the need for Canada to reimagine its economy in light of Trump's tariff regime.</p>

The move comes after the statue has been targeted by demonstrators in recent years, including those protesting against various issues. The law aims to ensure that the statue is treated with the respect it deserves, alongside other sacred war memorials around the country.</p>
