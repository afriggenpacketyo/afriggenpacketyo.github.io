          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist who was arrested by ICE agents in New York City in March. Judge Michael Farbiarz stated that the government failed to prove Khalil's release would cause irreparable harm or that he posed a flight risk. Khalil's attorney, Alina Das, argued that his detention was retaliatory for his protected speech during the Columbia encampment protests against the war in Gaza. The judge's order supersedes an immigration judge's denial of Khalil's asylum request and an order for his continued detention. The ruling came after previous legal battles regarding the grounds for his detention. Optimism score is independent of the summary.</p>

The lava flows are confined to the Halema ªuma ªu crater and the southwest side of Kaluapele within Kƒ´lauea's summit caldera. The USGS issued a volcano watch (code orange), warning of potential hazards like volcanic gas emissions and tephra, as well as Pele's hair, crater wall instability, ground cracking, and rockfalls. The caldera rim surrounding Halema ªuma ªu crater has been closed to the public since 2007 due to these hazards. Optimism score is independent of the summary.</p>

          <p>City commissioners in Miami, Florida, voted to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) through a 287(g) agreement. This agreement allows local police officers to assist with federal immigration enforcement, contrasting with sanctuary policies in other major cities. An ICE spokesperson stated the partnership would enhance public safety and national security. Governor Ron DeSantis previously issued an executive order encouraging state-level law enforcement to collaborate with ICE. However, groups like the ACLU and the Florida Immigrant Coalition opposed the agreement, arguing it would spread fear and isolate immigrant communities. The White House supported Miami's decision, emphasizing the administration's commitment to deporting illegal immigrants and ensuring public safety. Optimism score is independent of the summary.</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with initial rides in the Model Y. Access to the vehicles will be by invitation only, and rides will occur within a geofenced area, monitored by remote drivers as a backup. Elon Musk stated that robotaxis will operate only in the safest parts of Austin, with remote operations centers overseeing the cars. Analysts believe robotaxis could significantly increase Tesla's market capitalization, but the company is trying to catch up to competitors like Waymo in the autonomous driving technology sector. Waymo already operates a fleet of commercial robotaxis across the U.S. Optimism score is independent of the summary.</p>

While she hasn't issued any absolute deal-breakers, she's communicated her reservations about the proposed Medicaid cuts. Murkowski emphasized that she cannot support cuts that would harm Alaskan beneficiaries, given the state's high healthcare costs and reliance on Medicaid. She acknowledged the need to address entitlement spending but stressed that the most vulnerable should not bear the brunt of the cuts.
