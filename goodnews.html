          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 15:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the history and cultural significance of cumbia music in Ecuador, beginning with its origins in the 1960s. Polibio Mayorga pioneered the genre by blending traditional Andean rhythms with Colombian cumbia, creating a new sound for provincial migrants in urban centers. The article highlights key figures like Medardo Luzuriaga, who nationalized the genre, and contemporary groups like Tierra Canela, which represent the mass-market "tecnocumbia" style. It also touches on the demanding careers and personal sacrifices of the female artists who sustain this vibrant musical tradition.</p>

          <p>Darts world champion Luke Littler suffered a surprising 6-5 defeat to Beau Greaves in the semi-finals of the World Youth Championship. With this victory, Greaves becomes the first woman to ever reach the final of the tournament. The 18-year-old Littler, who recently won the World Grand Prix, was unable to overcome the three-time WDF women's world champion in a tense deciding leg. Greaves, 21, showcased exceptional skill, including an 11-dart leg to seal the win, and will now face defending champion Gian van Veen in the final next month.</p>

          <p>This article addresses a surge of false and misleading claims on social media following the recent Gaza ceasefire and hostage exchange. The DW Fact Check team debunks several viral pieces of disinformation, including the false claim that all female Israeli hostages had died. They also verify that widely circulated footage of celebrating Hamas fighters and a luxury car in Gaza are old and unrelated to the current events. The report highlights how old content is being repurposed to fuel confusion and polarization, and it clarifies the context behind other misleading claims about the conflict.</p>

          <h2>Oracle CEO Expresses Confidence in OpenAI's Ability to Afford Massive Cloud Infrastructure Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 14:49:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oracle's new co-CEO, Clay Magouyrk, stated he is confident that OpenAI can afford its substantial cloud infrastructure expenses, which could reach $60 billion annually. This statement comes after OpenAI signed a five-year deal with Oracle valued at over $300 billion to utilize its cloud services for running AI models. Magouyrk pointed to OpenAI's rapid growth to nearly a billion users as evidence of its financial viability, despite the company reporting a significant net loss in 2024. The partnership also involves integrating OpenAI's AI models into Oracle's health record systems.</p>

          <h2>Gaza Peace Deal Hailed as a Political Victory for Trump but Signals a Potential End for Netanyahu's Leadership</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 14:35:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article analyzes the political ramifications of the Gaza peace deal, framing it as a "victory lap" for former President Donald Trump but a potential political dead end for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The author argues that Trump's aggressive diplomacy succeeded where others failed, forcing Netanyahu into a deal he likely would have avoided to prolong his political career. The deal has left Israel more dependent on the U.S. and has alienated Netanyahu from his own public, who jeered his name in Hostages Square. The outcome is portrayed as a strategic win for U.S. interests, potentially at the expense of Netanyahu's political future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article revisits Orson Welles' infamous 1938 radio broadcast of "The War of the Worlds," which simulated a Martian invasion and reportedly caused widespread panic. It explores the context of the broadcast, which played on public anxieties of the time, and notes that the extent of the panic was likely exaggerated by newspapers seeking to discredit the new medium of radio. The piece draws parallels to the modern era of "fake news" and AI-generated deepfakes, highlighting the enduring relevance of Welles' goal. Welles himself later stated the broadcast was an "assault on the credibility" of radio, meant to teach listeners not to blindly trust everything they hear.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millie Bright, a key defender for England's Lionesses, has announced her retirement from international football, ending a nine-year career with 88 caps. Bright was instrumental in England's Euro 2022 victory and captained the team to the World Cup final in 2023. Her retirement reflects a changing of the guard under manager Sarina Wiegman, as younger defenders have emerged and competition for places has increased. While she will continue her club career as captain of Chelsea, her leadership, experience, and influence on and off the pitch will be a significant loss for the national team.</p>

          <p>Veteran investor Howard Marks, co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management, stated that while enthusiasm for artificial intelligence stocks is high, it has not yet reached the level of a speculative bubble. He believes the main ingredient of a bubble is "psychological excess" or mania, where investors believe no price is too high, which he does not currently detect in the AI sector. Drawing a parallel to the dot-com boom, Marks cautioned that while the technology may be transformative, it doesn't guarantee success for all companies involved. He described current AI valuations as high but not yet "crazy." (not investment advice)</p>
