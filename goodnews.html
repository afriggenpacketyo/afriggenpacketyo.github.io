        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has officially approved the $8 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media. The approval followed Skydance's commitments to the agency, which included ensuring unbiased journalism at CBS and ending diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. This decision has drawn criticism, particularly from the FCC's sole Democratic commissioner, who suggested the deal was linked to Paramount's recent legal settlement with Donald Trump and would erode press freedom. The merger places iconic media brands like CBS, Paramount Pictures, and MTV under new ownership.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and Australia have agreed to a 50-year treaty to deepen their collaboration under the AUKUS security pact, which also includes the United States. This long-term commitment focuses on developing nuclear-powered submarine programs and is expected to generate significant economic benefits, including up to £20 billion in British exports. The move reinforces the trilateral alliance amid growing concerns over China's military activities in the Indo-Pacific and signals a strengthened partnership as the U.S. reviews its own long-term role in the agreement.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Observe Quantum Friction Effect for the First Time</h2>

          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has made a scientific breakthrough by becoming the first to directly observe quantum friction between solid materials. Using folded graphene, they discovered that friction did not uniformly increase with thickness and, in some cases, thicker layers slid more easily. This unexpected finding is attributed to how bending the material altered electron movement, restricting energy conversion into heat. The discovery could have significant implications for designing ultra-efficient, low-wear nanodevices and advanced quantum materials.</p>

          <p>Princeton, Texas, has been identified by the Census Bureau as the fastest-growing city in the nation, with its population more than doubling in just a few years. This explosive growth is driven by affordable housing, attracting thousands of new residents to the area north of Dallas. However, the rapid expansion has created significant growing pains, forcing the city to temporarily halt new construction to allow infrastructure like roads, water, and sewer lines to catch up. Officials estimate they are five years behind and are now racing to manage the city's projected growth to 100,000 people.</p>

          <p>According to a political analysis, the 2028 presidential race is unofficially underway as several potential Democratic candidates are making strategic media appearances. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom have recently appeared on non-traditional platforms, including podcasts popular with conservative or non-political audiences. This shift in media strategy is seen as an attempt to reach new voters and signal a move toward the political center following the party's 2024 loss. The appearances also serve as an early audition for party elites and donors in a developing leadership vacuum.</p>
