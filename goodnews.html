          <p>Former President Joe Biden criticized "ongoing efforts to erase history" during a Juneteenth celebration in Galveston, Texas, appearing to reference President Trump. Biden highlighted the importance of Juneteenth as a federal holiday and chided attempts to remove historical events from textbooks and classrooms. He also pointed to his administration's efforts to rename military bases named after Confederate officers, contrasting it with the current administration's reported push to restore the old names. Several speakers recognized Biden for his role in making Juneteenth a national holiday.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold transportation grant funding from states refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. The judge granted a preliminary injunction in a case filed by 20 states, stating that "large-scale irreparable harm would occur without the preliminary injunction." The ruling prevents the Department of Transportation from imposing conditions on funding that require adherence to immigration enforcement. The judge found no plausible connection between cooperating with ICE enforcement and the congressionally approved purposes of the Department of Transportation.</p>
