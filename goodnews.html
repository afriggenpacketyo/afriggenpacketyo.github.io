          <p>This article discusses how many young people in China are putting their retirement plans on hold due to rising job uncertainty, stagnant wages, and housing pressures. They are too focused on their present circumstances to prioritize planning for old age. The Chinese government has urged young people to start planning early for retirement due to the country's rapidly aging population and strained pension system. However, many young employees feel it is out of touch with their current realities.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence to navigate the complexities of global trade turbulence caused by tariffs. AI tools help visualize supply chains, understand the impact of tariffs, and make faster decisions on adjustments. Salesforce has developed an AI agent to process changes in the U.S. customs system, while Kinaxis uses machine learning to assess products and materials affected by tariffs. These AI systems enable companies to dynamically adjust supplier strategies and manage duty exposure, enhancing trade policy strategy, but the quality of the data remains crucial for the success of any AI solution.

          <p>This article commemorates Jayant Narlikar, an Indian astrophysicist who passed away, known for his contributions to science education and his alternative to the Big Bang Theory. Narlikar, in collaboration with physicist Sir Fred Hoyle, proposed the continuous creation of new matter in an infinite universe, known as the quasi-steady state model. Despite his theory not gaining as much popularity as the Big Bang, Narlikar's work has been valuable, and he also founded the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune, India. Narlikar's legacy extends to his science fiction writing and his dedication to challenging pseudoscience, leaving a significant impact on Indian science and education.</p>

          <p>This article examines the trend of "quiet quitting" among Japan's Gen Z, who prioritize work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike previous generations, these young workers are choosing to do the bare minimum at their jobs to have more "me time." This shift in attitude is attributed to factors such as witnessing their parents sacrifice personal lives for companies, stagnant wages, and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Experts view this change as a positive step towards reducing overwork and improving overall well-being, addressing issues like 'karoshi' (death by overwork).</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets 7-5 in 13 innings after a rain delay and a blown save by closer Tanner Scott, but the game highlighted the team's pitching depth issues. Starter Clayton Kershaw was limited to two innings due to the rain delay, and the bullpen had to cover 11 innings, stretching the staff thin. Despite holding a lead, Scott's struggles allowed the Mets to tie the game, but Teoscar Hern√°ndez's RBI double in the 13th inning secured the win for the Dodgers.

Koizumi is also exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution and has engaged with Rakuten Group Inc. for potential collaboration. While the plan aims to cool the abnormal surge in prices, analysts remain uncertain whether it will lead to an overall price drop due to limited reserves compared to national demand.</p>

          <p>Japanese supermarket operators are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to offer consumers an alternative amid rising prices and concerns about shortages of domestic rice. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a lower price compared to Japanese-grown rice, reflecting consumer interest in affordable options. Other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen solid demand for foreign rice. The move aims to increase overall rice consumption by providing customers with more choices, as the average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets has reached record levels.</p>
