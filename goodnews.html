          <h2>Analysts Suggest China Can Counter U.S. Tech Restrictions by Collaborating on AI with Global South Nations</h2>

          <p>Chinese policy analysts propose that China can effectively respond to U.S. technology restrictions by fostering AI innovation and cooperation with countries in the Global South. This strategy involves promoting collaborative development, ensuring equitable access to advanced technologies, and co-creating ethical AI frameworks tailored to diverse regional needs. By partnering on inclusive AI infrastructure and data sharing, China could build an alternative to the U.S. "small yard, high fence" strategy, moving beyond direct rivalry. This approach aims to create a more inclusive global tech environment.</p>

          <p>Sparked by recent commentary from Elon Musk, this article examines the growing American disillusionment with the two-party political system. While polls show a majority of Americans desire more political options, the single-winner electoral system creates significant barriers for third parties, often relegating them to "spoiler" roles. The article discusses the history of third-party candidates and explores potential solutions, such as proportional representation with multi-member districts. This reform could make elections more competitive, reduce gerrymandering, and better reflect the country's diverse political views.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has announced a plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 2030, calling it a "water revolution." The plan includes tougher measures against water company executives, potentially including prison sentences for failing to meet standards, and a ban on wet wipes containing plastic. This marks the first time a clear numerical target has been set for reducing pollution spills, following public outrage over the state of UK rivers and coasts. However, the plan rules out nationalizing the water industry due to high costs.</p>

          <p>China and Vietnam are scheduled to conduct their first-ever joint army training exercise, a move that signals deepening military and political cooperation between the two nations. The drill, themed around joint border patrols, will take place in China's Guangxi region, which shares a border with Vietnam. This development occurs as the countries mark 75 years of diplomatic relations and strengthen their economic partnership. The closer ties are seen partly as a response to ongoing trade tensions with the United States, with both nations seeking to enhance regional stability and cooperation.</p>

          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in Italy last year, has been successfully moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The relocation follows extensive legal battles and protests from animal rights groups that prevented the bear from being euthanized as originally ordered by provincial authorities. The bear, now in a secure one-hectare enclosure, is reported to be calm and in good condition. The case highlights the growing challenges and debates surrounding human-wildlife conflict in regions where animal populations are being reintroduced.</p>

          <h2>Fossil Discovery in China Suggests Some Flying Reptiles Were Herbivores</h2>

          <p>A significant fossil discovery in northeastern China is challenging previous beliefs about the diet of ancient flying reptiles. Researchers found the stomach contents of a Sinopterus atavismus, a type of pterosaur, which contained phytoliths—microscopic mineral deposits from plants. The fossil also included small quartz crystals, likely ingested as gastroliths to help grind down tough plant material, a behavior seen in many modern birds and lizards. This finding, published in Science Bulletin, provides the first direct evidence of herbivory in this group of pterosaurs, renewing scientific debate on the topic.</p>

          <p>This opinion article delves into the "mom guilt" and societal pressures associated with children's summer activities, arguing that for most families, decisions about camp are driven by financial necessity rather than parenting philosophy. The author, a teacher, contrasts her unscheduled summer with her children against the stress faced by full-time working mothers who must navigate the high cost and complex logistics of summer camps. The piece suggests that the recent media trend of discussing "wild" or "rotting" summers misses the point that the underlying issue is a societal structure that fails to adequately support working parents.</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope and the ALMA array, astronomers have captured the first-ever direct glimpse of rocky planet formation around a very young, sun-like star. The observations of the star HOPS-315, located 1,370 light-years away, revealed the presence of silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing in its surrounding disk. These are the fundamental building blocks of terrestrial planets like Earth. This groundbreaking discovery provides unprecedented insight into the dawn of our own solar system and suggests that the processes that formed Earth could be common throughout the universe.</p>
