        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS is calling for 200,000 new blood donors to address critically low supplies, particularly for O negative blood, which can be used for a majority of patients. The health service has faced challenges in maintaining blood stocks, even issuing an "amber alert" last year due to shortages impacting patient treatment. Officials emphasize the need to avoid a "red alert," which would severely compromise patient safety and potentially delay operations. There is a particular need for more black donors to help treat sickle cell disease, and the NHS is working to make donating more accessible. A successful recruitment drive would greatly stabilize blood supplies for patients in need.</p>

          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed reports of a physical altercation between Elon Musk and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, characterizing it as a "disagreement" rather than a "fist fight."

Leavitt downplayed the event, emphasizing the ability of cabinet members and Musk to have "robust disagreements and then still come together to do what‚Äôs right for the people they are serving." The incident has drawn attention due to Musk's past criticisms of the administration.</p>

The announcement coincides with a UN Ocean Conference in France and follows warnings about the destructive impact of bottom trawling.
