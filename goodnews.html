        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Citizens of Zurich, Switzerland, are participating in a referendum to decide on severely restricting the use of leaf blowers and vacuums within the city. The proposal, if passed, would completely ban gas-powered models and limit the use of electric devices to a three-month period from October to December. Proponents of the measure argue it will reduce noise and air pollution, as well as protect microorganisms, suggesting rakes as an alternative. Opponents, however, contend that the ban is an example of an unnecessary and restrictive "culture of prohibition" that would complicate maintenance work.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour party has committed to starting construction on three new towns in England before the next general election, as part of its strategy to boost economic growth and address the housing crisis. A taskforce has identified 12 potential locations, with sites in Bedfordshire, Leeds, and north London being the most promising initial candidates. The plan aims to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029, with at least 40% of the new town developments designated as affordable housing. The initiative draws inspiration from the post-World War II new towns program, utilizing development corporations with special planning powers to deliver the projects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposal by the Trump administration to significantly increase H-1B visa fees could inadvertently benefit Middle Eastern countries, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia. As these nations invest heavily in becoming global AI hubs, they are offering attractive compensation packages, tax-friendly environments, and long-term "golden visas" to attract skilled professionals. The article suggests that the uncertainty and rising costs associated with US immigration policy may push top tech talent to seek opportunities in the Gulf region. This shift could intensify the global competition for skilled workers, with the Middle East emerging as a more appealing destination. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Switzerland is holding a second national referendum on the introduction of electronic identity cards, after a similar proposal was rejected in 2021 due to data privacy concerns. The revised plan makes the e-ID system entirely optional and state-run, with data stored on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue the system will streamline many online bureaucratic processes, from signing contracts to age verification. Recent polls suggest that voters, now more familiar with digital credentials after the pandemic's COVID ID, may be more inclined to approve the measure this time.</p>

          <p>This article examines Newcastle United's efforts to improve their performance from set-pieces, a key tactical area where they have struggled to convert opportunities into goals this season. Despite having a physically imposing team and hiring a new set-piece coach, the results have not yet materialized. The analysis notes a shift in strategy, including a significant increase in the use of long throws, but highlights that the team's execution is not yet clicking. The piece contrasts Newcastle's struggles with the success of their upcoming opponents, Arsenal, who have been highly effective from dead-ball situations.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece challenges Donald Trump's negative characterization of autism by highlighting several traits often associated with autistic people that stand in stark contrast to the former president's behavior.

The article suggests that while society often misunderstands these traits, they represent valuable human qualities. It concludes by celebrating the pure joy and love expressed by autistic individuals as fundamentally human experiences.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, is taking a significant step to acknowledge a violent, anti-immigrant chapter in its history by unveiling a new monument. The statue commemorates the 1885 Rock Springs Massacre, where a mob of European miners killed 28 Chinese laborers and burned down their community. This public act of remembrance, supported by the mayor and local institutions, coincides with an archaeological dig at the site of the former Chinatown. The effort to shed light on this dark past is occurring even as the surrounding county enforces stricter immigration policies.</p>
