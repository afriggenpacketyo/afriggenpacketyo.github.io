          <p>The Co-op grocery chain expects its shelves to return to normal stock levels this weekend after resolving issues stemming from a recent cyberattack. The attack, attributed to the DragonForce group, compromised payment systems and supply chains, leading to widespread shortages. The company is gradually restoring its systems and working with suppliers to replenish stock both in-store and online, and all payment systems are now operational. Experts caution that the reputational and financial repercussions of the attack may linger, potentially affecting customer trust and requiring long-term investments in security upgrades.</p>

          <p>Rupert Lowe, a former Reform UK MP, will not face criminal charges related to allegations of threats made against the party's chairman. The Crown Prosecution Service cited insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction after reviewing witness statements. Lowe, who was suspended by Reform UK in March and now sits as an independent MP, claimed the allegations were part of a smear campaign following his questions about the party's direction and leadership. He also strongly criticized Reform's leader, Nigel Farage, calling him a coward and a viper.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry plans to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, possibly starting in April 2026, to address the country's declining birthrate. The proposed policy would fully cover normal delivery expenses under the public medical insurance system, which currently excludes normal childbirth. While the government provides a lump-sum payment of 500,000 yen per birth, delivery costs often exceed that amount, and the unified pricing under the new system aims to alleviate financial burdens on families, though obstetricians have expressed concerns about potential financial strain on medical institutions.</p>

          <p>Recent market volatility has impacted 529 college savings plans, causing concern for families saving for future education costs. Experts advise checking asset allocation and risk appetite, with age-based portfolios typically becoming more conservative as college nears. Despite shifting education choices, college savings accounts remain vital, and recent changes allow rolling over unused funds to a Roth IRA and using them for continuing education and student loans. Financial experts caution against shifting entire 529 balances to cash, suggesting using outside income to cover immediate expenses and requesting reimbursement later.</p>

Despite concerns about the volatility of U.S. policymaking, Waldron said that investors still have demand for access to Chinese equities and fixed income products.</p>
