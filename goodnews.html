          <p>A significant portion of Americans' rent payments, totaling $1.4 trillion annually, goes unreported to credit bureaus, hindering their ability to build credit.

Companies like Esusu are working to change this by partnering with landlords and providing direct rent reporting services for tenants. By reporting on-time rent payments, individuals can significantly boost their credit scores and improve their financial standing. (not investment advice)</p>
