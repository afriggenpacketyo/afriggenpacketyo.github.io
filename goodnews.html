          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Action Against Iran's Nuclear Program</h2>

          <p>An analysis discusses Donald Trump's decision to bomb three Iranian nuclear sites, calling it a decisive action against Iran's nuclear program. The article argues that a nuclear-armed Iran could have used a nuclear weapon against Israel, and Trump was right to use limited force while holding more in reserve. The author suggests that Iran is a weak state with penetrated security and hostile citizens, and its leaders do not want to confront the United States directly. The author concludes that the world is better off because of Trump's action. </p>

Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, while Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed down slightly. Bahrain, home to the U.S. Central Command, issued a "work from home mandate." Egypt's benchmark EGX30 was the major gainer in the region. Analysts suggest the Gulf has distanced itself from the conflict, supporting a peaceful resolution. </p>

          <p>After years of studying over 200 parent-child relationships, the author has noticed that parents who rarely deal with defiance don't make threats, bribes or harsh consequences. Instead, they use language that makes children actually want to cooperate. Traditional parenting phrases often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, activating the part of the brain focused on survival rather than learning. The article provides five phrases to avoid and what to say instead, emphasizing the importance of respecting a child's autonomy while holding boundaries. </p>
