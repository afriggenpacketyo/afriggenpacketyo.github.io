          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery revealed its plan to divide into two separate public entities by the following year, a move driven by the evolving media landscape and the shift from cable to streaming services. The company will split into a streaming and studios division, encompassing movie properties and HBO Max, and a global networks division, which will include CNN, TNT Sports, and Discovery. David Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company, while Gunnar Wiedenfels will become CEO of the global networks business. The split is expected to be completed by mid-2026, aiming to provide each division with sharper focus and strategic flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Norges Bank Investment Management, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, is advocating for a unified capital markets regulator within the European Union to enhance market efficiency. In a letter to the European Commission, NBIM emphasized that better and simpler regulation is essential for EU market reforms, which are currently lagging behind in dynamism and investment opportunities. The fund manages a substantial portfolio of EU securities and highlighted the need to address regional fragmentation in securities law, corporate law, insolvency, and tax regimes. The call for a single regulator aims to reduce legal uncertainty, operational complexity, and inconsistent interpretations.</p>

The mayors urge the Legislature to fully fund HHAP at $1 billion, emphasizing that the economic and human costs of inaction far outweigh the investment.
