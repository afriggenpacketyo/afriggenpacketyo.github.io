          <p>China has rapidly transformed from a nation dependent on foreign bridge-building expertise to a global leader in civil engineering, constructing record-breaking structures across diverse terrains. Chinese engineers are employing precision survey methods, advanced modeling, and innovative engineering techniques, including breakthroughs in materials science, to build these mega-bridges. The rapid development of artificial intelligence and automated construction equipment is expected to further enhance the safety and efficiency of bridge construction. By 2030, Chinese civil engineers are projected to have constructed the world's longest suspension spans, tallest crossings, and record-holding cable-stayed megastructures.</p>

          <p>Phil Robertson, the founder of Duck Commander and patriarch of the Robertson family, known for the reality show "Duck Dynasty," has passed away at the age of 79. His death was confirmed by his son, Jase Robertson, who mentioned his father's early-stage Alzheimer's and other health problems last year. Robertson gained fame through the A&E series that revolved around his family's duck hunting gear business. The show faced controversy in 2013 when Robertson was briefly suspended for comments deemed offensive to gay people, but he was later reinstated.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to reduce soaring prices, aiming to bring them down to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This move bypasses the auction system, allowing major retailers to purchase rice directly and increase the government's influence over prices. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi emphasized the urgency in addressing public concerns about rising rice prices, which have reached record levels due to a poor harvest. The government will also cover transportation costs to regional areas and consider online sales to broaden distribution.</p>

This increase is attributed to both a rise in submissions and a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews. Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged approach involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake reviews. The company is continuously improving its technology to detect patterns and abnormalities, such as submission spikes and IP address masking, in order to combat fake reviews.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a delay in the implementation of 50% tariffs on goods from the European Union until July, providing additional time for negotiations with the bloc. The decision followed a conversation with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a desire for serious negotiations. Trump had previously threatened to impose the tariffs, citing difficulties in trade negotiations with the EU. Von der Leyen affirmed the importance of the trade relationship between the EU and the U.S. and expressed readiness to advance talks swiftly.</p>
