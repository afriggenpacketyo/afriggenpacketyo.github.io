          <h2>Psychologists Offer Strategies for Managing Draining Friendships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 20:36:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of "energy vampires," referring to friends who leave others feeling drained, and offers advice on how to manage these relationships. Psychologists identify common signs of such individuals, including a constant need for attention and a tendency to dominate conversations without showing interest in others. To cope, experts suggest setting clear boundaries, such as limiting the time spent together or the topics of conversation. Other strategies include communicating feelings directly to the friend or changing shared activities to something less conversation-focused, like exercising together, to protect one's own well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For Hong Kong to achieve its ambitions as a green maritime fuel hub, it must establish a reliable supply chain for green methanol, according to Wang Yongxin, president of CM Energy. While the city has made progress with LNG and biodiesel fueling, developing infrastructure for methanol will be critical. The statement was made during a ceremony for the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of running on methanol. The vessel's current fuel mix is one-quarter green methanol, which costs about four times more than traditional fuel, but usage is expected to increase by 2027.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European party, led by President Maia Sandu, is set to win a majority in parliamentary elections, a result seen as crucial for the nation's path toward EU membership. With most votes counted, Sandu's Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) secured nearly 50% of the vote, significantly ahead of the pro-Russian opposition. The election was tense, marked by claims of Russian interference and bomb scares at polling stations. The outcome reinforces Sandu's mandate to pursue closer ties with the West, despite ongoing challenges from pro-Moscow factions and the breakaway region of Transnistria.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region displayed mixed results as the Reserve Bank of Australia commenced its two-day policy meeting. While South Korea's Kospi saw gains, Japan's Nikkei 225 experienced a decline. Analysts anticipate the RBA will maintain its current cash rate of 3.6%, although conflicting economic data, such as rising inflation risks and softening employment figures, presents a complex situation for policymakers. This follows a positive end to the week for U.S. markets, which rallied after the release of new inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams receiver Tutu Atwell, who had a quiet start to the season, made a decisive impact with an 88-yard touchdown catch in the final minutes to secure a 27-20 victory against the Indianapolis Colts. The play, which came on one of only two targets for Atwell in the game, highlighted his readiness to contribute when called upon. Quarterback Matthew Stafford also threw touchdown passes to Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, helping the Rams improve to a 3-1 record. The win demonstrated the team's resilience as they rebounded from a previous loss and look ahead to a matchup with the San Francisco 49ers.</p>

Tyrrell Hatton secured the decisive half-point that guaranteed the victory for the European side. The win marks Europe's first Ryder Cup victory on American soil since 2012 and continues their recent dominance in the event.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, famous for its historic windmills, plans to introduce a €17.50 entrance fee for non-local visitors starting next spring. The measure aims to control the overwhelming number of tourists, which reached 2.6 million last year, compared to a resident population of just 100. Local officials say visitors often disrupt residents' privacy by entering their gardens and homes. While the fee is intended to fund maintenance and new infrastructure, local shop and restaurant owners worry it will deter customers and harm their businesses.</p>

He defends the varied interpretations of great literary works, asserting that their magic lies in this diversity.
