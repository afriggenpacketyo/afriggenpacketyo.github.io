          <p>British heavyweight boxer Fabio Wardley is preparing for a challenging fight against undefeated Australian contender Justis Huni at Ipswich Town Football Club. Wardley is also anticipating the birth of his first child, which is due just a week after the fight. At 30 years old, Wardley started boxing relatively late, having worked in recruitment until the age of 19, but a victory over Huni could propel him closer to a world-title shot as early as 2026. Wardley's dedication and determination in boxing reflect the mindset he hopes to bring to fatherhood, embracing the journey with a hunger to learn and adapt to the new challenges.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Plane Radar Tracks Moving Targets Without Radio Silence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 04:26:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new radar technology that allows aircraft to track moving targets without emitting radio signals. The innovation, called a ‚Äúspace-time decoupling two-channel clutter cancellation method,‚Äù was unveiled in China‚Äôs Journal of Radars and enables silent detection of moving vehicles even in cluttered environments. This technology uses a bistatic airborne radar system where one aircraft emits radar signals while another passively gathers echoes, enabling the silent aircraft to detect moving targets with clarity. The advancement addresses the challenge of detecting moving targets due to clutter caused by reflections from land, sea, or buildings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce regulations mandating that most new build homes in England must be fitted with solar panels. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated that the move is "just common sense" and could save households an average of ¬£500 annually on energy bills. The Home Builders Federation supports the initiative but cautions against overly burdensome paperwork that could hinder the government's goal of building 1.5 million new homes by 2029. The rules will be part of the Future Homes Standard, detailing plans for energy efficiency and reduced carbon emissions, with the government aiming for near-universal solar panel installation to meet its net-zero target by 2050.</p>

          <p>India's central bank delivered a larger-than-expected rate cut, lowering its benchmark policy rate to 5.5% from 6%, the lowest since August 2022. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and lower-than-expected growth amidst global uncertainty as reasons for the move. While the decision followed better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. The RBI also shifted its monetary policy stance from "accommodative" to "neutral," indicating limited room for further monetary policy support (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The UK government has banned six water companies from paying bonuses to senior executives due to their failure to meet environmental and consumer standards. The measures apply to firms that do not demonstrate financial resilience or have been convicted of a criminal offense, addressing public concern over sewage spills and rising bills. The ban, backdated to April 2024, allows regulator Ofwat to claw back bonuses or take enforcement action, and Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized that the era of profiting from pollution is over. The affected companies include Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector, coupled with weak domestic demand, is leading to steep discounts on exports, potentially triggering another 'China shock' in global markets. While steep tariffs are deterring Chinese exports to the U.S., the production overdrive is rippling through global markets, causing anxiety in Asia about a flood of cheap imports squeezing local industries. However, economists suggest that the influx of low-cost Chinese goods could ease inflationary pressures for inflation-worn economies. This could pave the way for more rate cuts across Asia as central banks seek to revive growth amidst rising trade tensions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>North Korea has successfully refloated a new destroyer that capsized during its launch last month, according to state media. The damaged vessel will be moved to a dry dock in a different shipyard for repairs, with leader Kim Jong Un calling for swift action to repair the ship before the late-June plenary session of the ruling Workers‚Äô Party. Analysts were surprised by the quick refloating, which apparently involved using aerostatic balloons attached to the ship‚Äôs hull. If North Korea can devote the same effort to internal repairs, the warship could be ready for sea trials sooner than expected.</p>

The order was the latest attempt to prevent the university from enrolling international students, who account for a significant portion of Harvard's research and scholarship. The judge stated that Harvard demonstrated it would sustain "immediate and irreparable injury" before the court could hear from all parties in the lawsuit. Harvard has attracted a growing number of international students, making the university uniquely vulnerable to the administration's crackdown on foreign students.</p>
