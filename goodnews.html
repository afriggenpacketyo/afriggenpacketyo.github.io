        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With one in three adults reporting insomnia, this article outlines scientifically-backed methods for improving sleep, particularly during disruptive summer heatwaves. Key recommendations include daily exercise to increase melatonin production and reduce stress, avoiding caffeine within eight hours of bedtime, and reducing screen time before sleep in favor of reading. The article also discusses the anecdotal benefits of deep breathing exercises like the '4-7-8' method for calming anxiety, noting that while scientific evidence is limited, it is a low-risk technique that many find effective for falling asleep more quickly.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools by threatening to withdraw federal funding. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the Education Department violated procedural requirements when it issued memos ordering an end to all "race-based decision-making." The judge, a Trump appointee, clarified that her ruling was based on the unlawful implementation of the guidance, not its policy merits, stating it created a "sea change" that caused educators to fear punishment for lawful speech and activities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After winning the Premier League title, Liverpool has embarked on a massive spending spree, potentially exceeding £300 million, which significantly raises the pressure on manager Arne Slot to secure more trophies. The club has made several high-profile signings, including Florian Wirtz for £116 million and striker Hugo Ekitike, fundamentally changing expectations for the upcoming season. This aggressive investment transforms Liverpool from challengers into the team to beat, meaning that anything less than a major title and a strong Champions League run would be viewed as a disappointment.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has weighed in on the transfer saga surrounding Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, stating that it will be very difficult for the player to remain at the club. Amid strong interest from Liverpool, Rooney suggested that Isak has a huge opportunity to join the Premier League champions. He also noted that due to financial regulations, it might benefit Newcastle to sell the star player to free up funds and strengthen the overall squad, making a move potentially advantageous for all parties involved in the high-stakes transfer.</p>

This development comes despite the fact that SpaceX's massive Starship rocket, which is essential for Mars missions, has faced a series of test flight failures and is not yet rated for human flight. CEO Elon Musk has recently adjusted timelines, suggesting an uncrewed flight is more likely in about 3.5 years.</p>

          <p>A children's park in Wooler, Northumberland, has reopened following the removal of 177 World War II-era practice bombs discovered buried just beneath the surface. The first device was found by a contractor installing new playground equipment, leading to a specialized survey that uncovered the entire cache, which had been carefully stacked in rows. It is believed the site was a military ordnance depot during the war, and the bombs were likely buried after the conflict. The discovery shocked local residents, many of whom, including a town councillor, had played in the park for years unaware of the danger.</p>

          <p>The high-stakes meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a large military installation in Anchorage, Alaska. White House officials selected the venue for its ability to meet the stringent security requirements for hosting two world leaders. The location is also historically significant, as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867 and the base was a key air defense site during the Cold War. The hastily arranged summit is being held during Alaska's peak tourist season, leaving few other suitable options available.</p>

          <p>The federal building at 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan, which houses offices for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, was evacuated after five letters containing an unknown white powder were found. The FDNY and hazmat units responded quickly to the mailroom on the ninth floor, and officials stated the situation was brought under control almost immediately. At least two people were exposed to the substance, but authorities reported that no ongoing threat remains to employees or the public. The powder is being tested, and the letters will be sent to FBI headquarters for further analysis.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing analysts' forecasts despite facing new trade tariffs from the United States. The better-than-expected performance was primarily driven by resilient exports, which added significantly to GDP growth and helped narrow the country's trade deficit. While the result shows the economy is coping with trade headwinds, some economists remain cautious, predicting a potential slowdown in the coming quarters as investment spending may soften and the full impact of tariffs is felt.

          <p>A 50-year-old man in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, was arrested after tormenting his neighbors for two months by repeatedly sounding a powerful train horn he had attached to a palm tree in his yard. The window-rattling blasts, which occurred at irregular intervals, prompted numerous complaints to the police. In an interview before his arrest, the man, Gary Boyadzhyan, described the situation as a "cry for help" stemming from personal issues that cost him his job. He was arrested for interfering with a peace officer and disturbing the peace after sounding the horn again shortly after promising police he would stop.</p>
