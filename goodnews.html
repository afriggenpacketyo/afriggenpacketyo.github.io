          <p>Ahead of their boxing match, both Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. and Jake Paul are insisting the fight is not a staged spectacle, with significant career implications for both men. For Ch√°vez Jr., the son of a boxing legend, a victory could revitalize his career after personal struggles, and he dismisses the idea he is merely a stepping stone for his opponent. For Paul, a win against a former world champion would be a crucial step toward gaining legitimacy in the boxing world and silencing critics who claim he only faces weaker opponents. Both fighters have expressed confidence in their preparation and are promising a genuine contest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A leading economist from China International Capital Corporation argues that China possesses a "comparative advantage" in the global stablecoin race due to its mature third-party payment platforms like WeChat Pay and Alipay. According to the research note, these platforms already function similarly to stablecoins by being pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and are supported by a well-developed regulatory framework. The economist suggests these systems are extensions of legal tender, with customer funds backed by central bank money, providing a stable foundation as policymakers worldwide increasingly focus on digital currency regulation.

          <p>Harvard University and the University of Toronto have established a contingency plan to allow certain international graduate students to study in Canada if they are barred from the United States. This arrangement comes in response to potential U.S. visa restrictions and a legal battle between Harvard and the Department of Homeland Security over student data. The program at the University of Toronto's Munk School would enable affected Harvard Kennedy School students to continue their education, ensuring they can complete their studies even if unable to be on the Cambridge campus. This move aims to provide stability for students amid uncertainty over U.S. immigration policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels, a method that avoids open-skull surgery. The minimally invasive procedure involved guiding a stent electrode through a neck vein to a blood vessel in the brain of a paralyzed patient. This technique reportedly helped the 67-year-old patient regain some limb movement, offering a potentially safer alternative with a shorter recovery time compared to more invasive methods like those being developed by Elon Musk's Neuralink. The breakthrough highlights significant advancements in China's neurotechnology sector.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, extending their winning streak to five games and taking sole possession of the best record in the majors. Despite the victory, the team's performance was flawed, with starter Dustin May struggling and defensive errors contributing to the Royals' runs. The offense was powered by a Shohei Ohtani leadoff home run and a two-run homer from Max Muncy, with Ohtani later adding a game-tying triple. The game was ultimately decided by a ninth-inning double play, showcasing the team's ability to win even when not playing at its best.</p>

Sources close to the player have also refuted suggestions that Acheampong is unhappy at the club, noting he signed a new five-year contract last year. A loan move would only be considered if all parties agree it is the best step for his development.</p>

          <p>A new study from the Japan Institute for Health Security indicates a potential link between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age people. The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, found that individuals who regularly ate foods like rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and seaweed were less likely to exhibit such symptoms. Researchers suggest that specific nutrients in the diet, such as omega-3 fatty acids from fish and folic acid from vegetables, may contribute to better mental well-being. The findings suggest a promising area for further research into dietary interventions for depression prevention.</p>

Massey was arrested peacefully at a residence in New Orleans and will be transferred to a secure state facility. The May 16 escape, which went unnoticed for hours, has been called the worst in recent Louisiana history and has drawn criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility. With Massey's capture, only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, and authorities are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.</p>
