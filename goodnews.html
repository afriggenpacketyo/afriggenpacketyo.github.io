          <p>The South China Morning Post reports that Chinese mathematicians have purportedly resolved the 65-year-old Kervaire invariant problem. This feat was made possible through major computational methods which could be applied to further problems in the field. As a result of the breakthrough, the mathematical world finally has proof that manifolds of Kervaire invariant one do exist in dimension 126, ending a decades-long mystery. The paper, which has not undergone peer review, was written by Wang Guozhen and Lin Weinan from the Fudan University Shanghai Centre for Mathematical Sciences and Xu Zhouli from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA).</p>
