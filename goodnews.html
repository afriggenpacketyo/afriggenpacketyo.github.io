          <p>A UK government minister confirms that negotiations are underway to secure a deal allowing British passport holders to use EU e-gates at European airports. This initiative aims to reduce border queues and improve travel efficiency for UK citizens post-Brexit. However, concerns have been raised by Conservative MP Alex Burghart regarding potential compromises on UK sovereignty and regulatory alignment with the EU. The European relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds also indicated efforts to reduce red tape to lower food prices, emphasizing that discussions are in the final stages.</p>

          <p>Two volumes of the 2,300-year-old Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, considered the earliest known in China, have been repatriated to Beijing from the National Museum of Asian Art in the United States.

          <p>Atmos Space Cargo, a European startup, has achieved a significant milestone by successfully completing the first orbital test flight of its Phoenix 1 re-entry space capsule. Launched from Cape Canaveral as part of a SpaceX mission, the capsule demonstrated Europe's ability to develop independent space return capabilities. The Phoenix 1 deployed an inflatable heat shield during reentry and transmitted critical data before splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean. This success marks a new chapter in global space logistics and opens doors for greater collaboration and competition in the commercial space sector.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in Southern California have successfully performed the first human bladder transplant, marking a significant advancement in treating debilitating bladder conditions. The procedure was conducted on a 41-year-old man who had lost bladder capacity due to cancer treatments. While traditional bladder removal often involves repurposing a portion of the intestine, this new approach aims to reduce complications associated with bowel tissue. The patient has shown promising results, and doctors plan to conduct further trials to assess the long-term outcomes of bladder transplantation.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay reflects on the legacy of Desi Arnaz and his impact on diversity and inclusion in Hollywood. It recounts how Arnaz, a Cuban immigrant, overcame racial prejudice to star in "I Love Lucy" and revolutionize television production. His success challenged preconceived notions about who could be a successful star and paved the way for more Latino stories in popular culture. The article argues that Arnaz's example of embracing his identity and pushing for inclusion remains relevant today, especially as institutions grapple with diversity efforts.</p>
