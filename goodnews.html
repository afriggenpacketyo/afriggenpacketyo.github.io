          <p>Oasis initiated their highly anticipated reunion tour in Cardiff, delivering a powerful performance that largely won over critics and fans after a 16-year absence. The band played a setlist of their classic 1990s hits, with Liam Gallagher’s vocals noted as being particularly strong and rejuvenated. While the infamous brotherly feud was still palpable through their lack of on-stage interaction, the emotional weight of their music and a brief hug at the end resonated with the 70,000-strong audience. The reviewer praised the show as the band's best since 1995, highlighting the enduring relevance of their anthems.</p>

          <p>At the Chester Zoo in the U.K., a same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins named Scampi and Flounder are successfully raising a chick. Zookeepers strategically placed an egg from another penguin couple into their care to improve the chick's chances of survival, part of a highly successful breeding season for the zoo. This heartwarming event highlights a natural behavior in penguins while also contributing to vital conservation efforts for the Humboldt species, which is listed as vulnerable to extinction. The zoo is now home to 63 penguins, bolstering the genetically healthy population in European conservation programs.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart attacks outlines five food categories he avoids giving his own children to promote long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to bag linings and flavorings, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats because of sodium and nitrates. The doctor also warns against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can lead to blood sugar crashes and inflammation. He advocates for healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and air-fried foods.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns reflects on the American Revolution, describing it as the most important event in world history for creating the concept of a "citizen." He argues that America is held together by the words of its founding documents, like the Declaration of Independence, which distilled a century of enlightenment thinking. Burns emphasizes the importance of understanding the founders as flawed, complex individuals, stating that heroism is not perfection but a negotiation between strengths and weaknesses. He believes that embracing this complexity makes history richer and more accessible, providing a necessary lifeline in today's divided times.</p>

          <p>The technology IPO market is showing signs of life after a prolonged downturn, with crypto company Circle's stock surging over 500% since its June debut. This success, along with the strong performance of AI firm CoreWeave, has provided much-needed returns for venture capital firms that have faced a liquidity drought since early 2022. While the market is not fully recovered, with many large private companies still on the sidelines, the increase in public offerings has sparked cautious optimism among investors. The industry hopes this momentum signals a sustained trend, ending the "zombie company" risk for many startups. (not investment advice)</p>
