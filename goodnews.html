          <p>Actress Barbara Stock, who played Liz Adams on the hit 1980s series "Dallas," shared her experience of being written off the show without prior warning. She only realized it was her last day when a crew member mentioned it in the makeup room, noting in hindsight that a scene where her character packed a suitcase should have been a clear clue. Stock expressed that while the news was heartbreaking at the time, she holds no hard feelings and has fond memories of the cast, including stars Larry Hagman and Patrick Duffy. She later transitioned from acting to a career in interior design.</p>

          <p>In an interview about his new memoir, former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy shared his concerns about the current state of the nation's highest court. The 89-year-old, who served as a pivotal "swing justice," stated that some opinions from the current court have become "a little bit too personal and confrontational." Kennedy reflected on his career, his role in landmark cases like those concerning abortion rights and same-sex marriage, and his worry that a lack of civility in public discourse is endangering democracy.

          <h2>Employers, Not Technology, Blamed for Rise of Low-Quality AI-Generated 'Workslop'</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study highlights the growing issue of "workslop"—AI-generated content that appears complete but lacks substance—which is reportedly harming productivity. This article argues that the responsibility for this phenomenon lies not with the AI technology itself, but with employers who fail to properly implement it. The author contends that many businesses are swayed by hype and do not invest in necessary training, policies, or strategic planning for using AI effectively. True productivity gains require a thoughtful approach, including standardized tools and clear metrics, rather than leaving employees to figure it all out themselves.</p>

Cooper reflects on overcoming imposter syndrome and never picturing a career in baseball after aging out of Little League as a child.

          <p>This article explores why the United States has historically been a leader in modern invention, from Thomas Edison's light bulb to the internet and AI. It credits figures like Edison not as lone geniuses but as creators of collaborative "invention factories" that fostered a systems-based approach to innovation. Investors from the show "Shark Tank" attribute this spirit to a culture of risk-taking, often brought by immigrants, and a financial ecosystem that supports new ideas through venture capital. The American ability to treat failure as a learning experience rather than a final judgment is also highlighted as a key factor.</p>

          <p>A conscious parenting expert outlines seven common habits that can undermine a child's mental strength and resilience. These include rescuing children from every struggle, modeling perfection instead of accountability, and silencing their big emotions. The article advises that instead of prizing achievement above all else, parents should praise effort and teach kids that their worth is unconditional. Fostering mental fortitude involves allowing children to face age-appropriate challenges, repairing trust after parental mistakes, and teaching them that difficult feelings are manageable and not emergencies.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's Mayor Gong Zheng announced that the city will eliminate all limits on foreign investment in its manufacturing sector as part of a broader effort to open its market. The reforms have already granted overseas companies greater access in fields such as electric vehicles, biotechnology, and value-added telecommunications. Gong emphasized that openness is Shanghai's greatest advantage and assured that foreign-funded manufacturers will be treated equally in government procurement processes. The move is designed to support their integration into both upstream and downstream supply chains, signaling a significant step in deepening the city's economic reforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of enjoying the Harry Potter universe while disagreeing with creator J.K. Rowling's views on transgender issues. The author argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that many classic works were created by flawed individuals. Instead of simple boycotts or "offsetting" purchases with donations, the article suggests a more meaningful approach: engaging with the material critically and in community with others. By discussing the work's flaws and its positive core messages about rejecting supremacy, fans can generate social good and transform their relationship with the canon, much like religious communities have done with sacred texts for centuries.</p>
