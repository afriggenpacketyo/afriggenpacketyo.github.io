Despite having already lost the series, England's dominant performance provided a significant morale boost, setting their highest ODI total in three years and delivering their largest-ever winning margin in men's ODIs by runs.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis of government data by LendingTree shows significant disparities in lottery spending across the United States, with Massachusetts residents spending the most at an average of $915 per year. Following Massachusetts, Rhode Island residents spend an average of $573 annually on lottery tickets. At the other end of the spectrum, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 per year. The report also highlights that lottery sales can be a substantial source of state revenue, accounting for up to 3% of the general fund in some states. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investors are closely watching two major events in the upcoming week: key inflation reports and Apple's annual product launch. The Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) data will be critical in shaping expectations for a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in September. Meanwhile, Apple is expected to unveil its iPhone 17 lineup, with analysts watching for any price increases that could boost the company's revenue amid sluggish growth. These events will provide important signals about the state of the economy and consumer demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ethan Guo, a 20-year-old American pilot and influencer, has been released after being detained for two months at a Chilean air base in Antarctica.

As part of his release, Guo has been ordered to pay a $30,000 donation to a childhood cancer charity and is banned from entering Chilean territory for three years.

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by a controversial team order from McLaren. The team instructed Oscar Piastri to cede second place to his teammate Lando Norris after a slow pit stop had reversed their on-track positions. While Norris had been running ahead for most of the race, the faulty pit stop was seen by some as a normal part of racing fortunes. The incident has sparked debate and cuts Piastri's championship lead over Norris to 31 points with eight races remaining in the season.</p>

The 51-year-old man was tracked to his home after the red, Ferrari-liveried car was spotted again on the D4 motorway. Police had previously questioned the owner in 2019 but could not press charges because the helmeted driver could not be identified. The vehicle is believed to be a Dallara GP2 car, and the owner now faces fines for driving an unroadworthy vehicle.</p>

Her appointment came after her Green Party lost its position in the German government. Known for her strong criticism of Russia's war in Ukraine, Baerbock's election to the UN post was conducted via a secret ballot at Russia's request, rather than by unanimous approval. In her new capacity, she has pledged to serve as a unifier and an honest broker for all 193 member states.</p>

The vessel was made from mycelium, the root-like network of fungi, cultivated on a hemp substrate inside a kayak-shaped mold. The 12-hour journey marks the world's longest open-water crossing in such a boat and aims to highlight the potential of fungal materials as a biodegradable and sustainable alternative to plastics used in marine recreation.

          <p>An analysis suggests that concerns about the negative impact of tariffs on small businesses, particularly the end of the "de minimis" exemption for purchases under $800, may be overstated. The article argues that this specific policy change affects only a small minority of the 33 million small businesses in the U.S., most of which are service-based and do not import goods. The author contends that the more critical economic indicators to watch are consumer income and wealth, which determine whether people can absorb the resulting price increases from tariffs.
