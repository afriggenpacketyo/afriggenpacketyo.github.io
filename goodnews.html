          <p>Hurricane Humberto, now a Category 2 storm, is weakening over the Atlantic but is still expected to generate dangerous conditions along the U.S. East Coast. The National Hurricane Center has warned that the storm will likely cause hazardous surf and life-threatening rip currents for several days, affecting beaches from the northern Caribbean to Bermuda. While the storm's center is projected to pass west of Bermuda and is not expected to make landfall, coastal communities are advised to remain cautious.</p>

          <p>Hamas and other Palestinian factions are reportedly leaning toward accepting a U.S.-proposed plan to end the war in Gaza, with a formal response expected soon. The comprehensive proposal, presented by President Trump, calls for a ceasefire, the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and an increase in humanitarian aid. The plan also outlines a post-war governance structure for Gaza managed by an international board, which has garnered support from several key Middle Eastern nations and the Palestinian Authority.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author describes a journey from identifying as a "cultural Jew" with little knowledge of the tradition to discovering its rich intellectual and spiritual depth. The author argues that a superficial understanding of Judaism is often shaped by centuries of anti-Semitism and assimilationist pressures, leading to an identity stripped of its core tenets. By studying Jewish texts and history, the author found a more empowering and resilient identity, which is crucial for navigating and responding to the current rise in anti-Semitism.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a deal that will create a new U.S.-based entity to manage TikTok's operations in the country, avoiding a full ban. The arrangement involves a group of American investors, including Oracle, Larry Ellison, and Rupert Murdoch, who will control a new U.S. algorithm and hold a majority on the board of directors. While Chinese parent company ByteDance will retain a minority stake, the deal is designed to address national security concerns by placing control of U.S. user data and content moderation in American hands.</p>

          <p>Several Western nations, including Britain, Canada, and Australia, have officially recognized the state of Palestine, a move that challenges Israel's long-term strategy of using settlements to prevent a two-state solution. While the recognition is largely symbolic and does not change the immediate reality on the ground, it represents a significant assertion of international political will. This article argues that by affirming Palestine's right to exist, the global community is rejecting the idea that "facts on the ground" can unilaterally foreclose the possibility of Palestinian sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Princeton's president, in this opinion article, contends that the popular narrative of college students being fragile and intolerant of opposing views is largely a myth. Based on his experience, most students are committed to constructive dialogue, and instances of genuine censorship are rare and often sensationalized. He argues that public perception is skewed by misleading polls, media incentives that favor stories of "cancel culture," and a failure to distinguish between protest, which is a form of free speech, and disruption, which is not.</p>
