          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high of $112,052.24, driven by a broader rally in technology stocks led by Nvidia. Despite significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, the cryptocurrency had been trading in a narrow range recently, but its status as a risk asset means it often rises with growth-oriented stocks. Analysts suggest that increased corporate buying and potential U.S. crypto legislation could fuel further upward momentum, with some predicting prices could reach $120,000 soon.
