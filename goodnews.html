          <p>Nvidia clarified that it is not sending GPU designs to China for modification to comply with U.S. export controls, following reports of a potential research and development center in Shanghai. The company spokesperson stated that while CEO Jensen Huang discussed the possibility of a new center with Shanghai's mayor, production and design would remain outside China. The center would assess ways to meet U.S. restrictions while catering to the local market. The Financial Times initially reported that Nvidia was working on the R&D center to navigate recent U.S. export curbs. </p>

          <p>An Indian PhD graduate, Priya Saxena, who was facing deportation by the Trump administration, was granted an injunction by a federal judge, allowing her to remain in the country after receiving her degree. Saxena's student visa was terminated due to a minor traffic violation, which her attorney argued was not a deportable offense. The judge ruled that the Department of Homeland Security's actions appeared unlawful and were likely to cause Saxena irreparable harm. The Trump administration has been pursuing international students throughout the country, targeting them for minor infractions or pro-Palestinian activism.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing a surge in popularity of lantern festivals, but due to fire risks and environmental concerns, organizers are opting for safer alternatives to traditional sky lanterns. Instead of releasing thousands of flammable lanterns into the sky, events like the OC Japan Fair are using tethered, helium-filled balloons lit by LEDs. These events offer a way for people to release emotions, send messages to loved ones, or cast prayers in a visually spectacular and peaceful manner. Several lantern events are scheduled throughout the year, including water lantern festivals and cultural celebrations. </p>

          <p>African countries are intensifying efforts to hold tech giants like Meta accountable for data privacy violations, potentially marking a turning point in the continent's digital sovereignty. Meta is facing significant fines in Nigeria for regulatory breaches and a lawsuit in Ghana over content moderation practices. The lawsuits highlight the need for stronger regulatory frameworks in Africa, where lax enforcement of data protection laws complicates efforts to hold tech companies accountable. Some experts believe these lawsuits could set a precedent for other countries on the continent and lead to the development of similar regulatory frameworks for tech platforms. </p>
