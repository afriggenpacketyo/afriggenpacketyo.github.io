          <p>Pope Leo XIV has criticized individuals who oppose abortion but support the death penalty or inhumane treatment of immigrants, asserting such views are "not really pro-life." His remarks, made during a discussion about honoring a senator who supports abortion rights, underscored the Catholic Church's comprehensive teaching on the sanctity of life. The Pope urged greater respect and a collective search for a way forward on ethical issues, highlighting the need to welcome strangers and protect human dignity at all stages. This article details the Pope's first foray into US politics since his election, emphasizing a call for consistency in moral positions.</p>

          <p>A boiler room explosion caused a significant partial collapse of a 20-story New York City Housing Authority building in the Bronx, leaving a large section of its side destroyed. Despite the extensive damage and debris scattered below, officials, including Mayor Eric Adams, confirmed that no injuries or fatalities were reported, deeming it an avoided major disaster. Initial investigations suggest the blast traveled up a chimney shaft connected to the boiler, leading to the structural failure. Residents of affected apartments were evacuated, and gas services were shut off for the complex, with ongoing inspections revealing prior unsafe facade violations.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "The President and the Dragon," spotlights former President Jimmy Carter's heroic, decades-long mission to eradicate Guinea worm disease, a debilitating parasite spread through contaminated water. Inspired by his former drug czar, Carter made the fight against the worm his life's work after leaving office, dramatically reducing cases from 3.5 million in 1986 to a mere 14 by his death in 2024. The film, directed by Waleed Eltayeb, emphasizes the power of collective human effort and education, rather than vaccines, in achieving this near-eradication. This article details how the documentary also weaves in Carter's role in ending civil wars in Sudan, showcasing hope amidst conflict.</p>

          <p>Dame Jane Goodall, the renowned conservationist and chimpanzee expert, has died at 91, leaving an extraordinary legacy that revolutionized our understanding of primates. Her groundbreaking observations in Tanzania in 1960, particularly witnessing a chimpanzee using a tool, challenged the long-held belief that only humans made and used tools. Goodall faced cynicism and sexism for her informal, empathetic approach, yet her work revealed complex chimp behaviors like strong family bonds and territorial warfare. Later in life, she tirelessly advocated for nature protection and climate change action, inspiring countless scientists and conservationists to continue her mission.</p>

          <p>Major automakers like GM, Ford, and Hyundai reported robust third-quarter U.S. auto sales, driven by record electric vehicle (EV) sales as consumers rushed to purchase before $7,500 federal incentives expired. GM and Ford saw overall sales increases of roughly 8%, with EV sales more than doubling for GM and rising 30% for Ford. Hyundai also recorded a 13% sales increase, led by its EVs. Despite the incentives ending, some automakers are extending their own cash incentives to maintain momentum. This article notes that the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" stripped the old EV enticement, but included some perks for buying a U.S.-assembled vehicle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FIFA is likely to schedule 2026 World Cup matches involving major European nations after midnight UK time to combat heat issues experienced during the recent Club World Cup. Concacaf president Victor Montagliani indicated that kick-off times are a major concern for the tournament hosted in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, where summer temperatures are high. While earlier times suit European broadcasters, they would result in midday kick-offs locally, which proved problematic for player welfare. This article details how FIFA is negotiating with media and considering stadium features like roofs to mitigate heat, aiming to finalize the schedule after the draw.</p>

          <p>Stocks unexpectedly closed higher on Wednesday, the first day of the government shutdown, defying fears of economic risk from a prolonged impasse. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all saw increases, with the Dow and S&P 500 reaching record highs. This resilient market performance occurred despite a recent hiring slowdown and persistent inflation concerns, further deepened by new data showing a decline in private sector employment. This article highlights how analysts suggest the market's reaction indicates a belief that the shutdown's economic damage might be modest, though a prolonged interruption could still strain the economy and hinder policymaking.

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a $20 billion loan to Argentina to stabilize its currency, a move seen as supporting President Javier Milei's free-market reforms amidst high inflation and economic challenges. Despite political opposition and "America First" rhetoric, this article argues that the bailout is a wise risk, crucial for reviving economic and political liberalism in Latin America. Milei has made significant progress in reducing inflation and reviving housing markets by cutting spending and liberalizing trade. The loan aims to give Argentina time to devalue the peso to market levels and eliminate capital controls, with funds from a Federal Reserve line of credit. (not investment advice)</p>

This potential deal would be a significant victory for Intel's foundry, signaling confidence in its manufacturing capabilities and attracting other major customers. Such a partnership would also be notable given AMD's direct competition with Intel in x86-based chips for PCs and servers, as AMD currently relies on TSMC for its chip production.

The series, supported by the National Geographic Explorer Program, documents how cumbia's simple, contagious rhythm has absorbed local styles, morphed, and spread globally, symbolizing Latin American identity. Originating from a blend of African, Indigenous, and European influences on the Colombian coast, cumbia has historically accompanied migrants and become one of the most listened-to genres in the Americas.

          <p>Colombia's Caribbean coast is identified as the birthplace of cumbia, a vibrant musical genre born from a rich blend of African, Indigenous, and European influences during colonial times.

This article highlights key figures like Emilia Reyes Salgado and Petrona Martínez, who preserve the genre's African roots through their singing and drumming. San Jacinto is noted as a gaita music epicenter, where the instrument, made from a cactus heart and duck feather, became a symbol of peace amidst civil war.</p>
