          <p>The rising popularity and cost of new weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro are creating a two-tier health system, making obesity management increasingly a wealth issue. While some are prescribed on the NHS, access is restricted by a "postcode lottery" and tougher eligibility criteria, leading thousands to pay privately at significant monthly costs. Experts and patients express concerns that this disparity could worsen existing health inequalities, particularly as pharmaceutical companies may increase prices. This article highlights a complex societal and health challenge, where access to effective treatments is becoming stratified by economic means.</p>

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer contends that the current AI boom's massive spending on data center buildouts is fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble of 2000. He argues that today's investments are by well-capitalized tech giants like Meta, Tesla, Google, and Microsoft, not speculative, debt-laden startups. Cramer acknowledges skepticism about AI's immediate tangible benefits but believes its long-term potential, driven by innovations from companies like Nvidia, makes it a necessity rather than a bubble.
