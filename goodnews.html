        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration, deeming it unconstitutional to mandate state cooperation with immigration enforcement as a condition for receiving certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants. This legal victory for 20 predominantly Democratic states challenges the administration's push to defund "sanctuary" jurisdictions. U.S. District Judge William Smith found the Department of Homeland Security's policy "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," citing the "irreparable harm" states would suffer from losing critical emergency funds. The ruling underscores ongoing tensions between federal immigration policies and state autonomy, as the administration had previously sought to restrict grants to jurisdictions limiting cooperation with ICE.</p>

          <p>Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska has officially launched its 2025 Fat Bear Week, an annual online competition showcasing the largest brown bears as they prepare for hibernation. Twelve contenders from Brooks River, some gaining up to 700 pounds to exceed 1,400 pounds, are competing for votes. This event, which started in 2014, utilizes livestreams to make the remote park accessible, educating a global audience about the vital role of fat accumulation for bears' winter survival. The true "prize" for the winning bear is successfully enduring another challenging winter season, underscoring the natural significance of their impressive weight gain.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An inexpensive, off-label drug, leucovorin, derived from folic acid, is showing significant promise in helping children with autism overcome speech delays. Pediatric neurologist Dr. Richard Frye's decades of research indicate that leucovorin may bypass a cerebral folate transport blockage, a potential contributor to some autism spectrum disorders. Despite the absence of large-scale phase 3 clinical trials, the Food and Drug Administration has initiated the approval process, driven by consistent positive findings from multiple smaller studies. Key challenges remain, including securing further research funding and ensuring a reliable, high-quality supply of this generic drug, which currently lacks strong financial incentives for major pharmaceutical investment.</p>

          <p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake has been reported in western and northern Venezuela, according to the US Geological Survey. The epicenter was situated approximately 24 kilometers from Mene Grande, an oil town in the state of Zulia, at a relatively shallow depth of 7.8 kilometers. Despite the significant magnitude, initial reports indicated no immediate casualties or serious damage. Venezuela is notable for possessing the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, estimated at around 303 billion barrels. Authorities are continuing to assess the situation and any potential long-term impacts on the region, though immediate stability seems to have been maintained.</p>

Al-Sharaa asserted Syria's return to the international community, condemning Israel's military actions as a threat to regional stability and a risk to US alliances. He also pledged accountability for past brutalities, announced progress in combating the Captagon drug trade, and urged Western nations to lift sanctions imposed under the previous regime. His speech, observed by cheering crowds in Syria and dueling demonstrations in New York, signifies a complex new era for the nation.</p>

          <p>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers has urged "realism" concerning the club's European aspirations after their 1-1 draw against Red Star Belgrade in the Europa League opener. Following a Champions League play-off defeat, Rodgers acknowledged the squad's current limitations, attributing them to a "scant summer of transfer activity" and the departure of star players. Despite fan protests over perceived underinvestment, Rodgers framed the away draw in a challenging atmosphere as a "good point" and a foundational step. This pragmatic stance highlights a notable shift in Celtic's European expectations, moving from elite competition aspirations to a more grounded approach in the second-tier tournament.</p>

          <p>A house fire erupted in Shreveport's Southern Trace neighborhood, with a lightning strike believed to be the cause. Fire units rapidly responded to the Longfellow Trace address, quickly escalating to a second alarm due to the home's size and the neighborhood's recent history of fires. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries, as the residence was unoccupied at the time of the incident. The Shreveport Fire Department, supported by Caddo Parish Fire District 5, successfully brought the fire under control within 34 minutes. Although the home sustained moderate to heavy damage, it is not a complete loss, and the investigation into the precise cause is ongoing.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald emphasized that his team is "fuelled by something money can’t buy," in what appeared to be a subtle dig at their American counterparts. This year, for the first time in the tournament's 98-year history, all 12 American players and their captain are receiving $500,000 stipends, with a significant portion allocated to charity, a practice not adopted by the European team. Donald asserted that the Ryder Cup's essence lies in "pride, representing your flag, your shirt and the legacy you leave behind." This payment structure has generated considerable negative attention and criticism, with many arguing it conflicts with the spirit of the biennial tournament.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Manchester, has stated that Labour MPs have privately urged him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the party's leadership. Burnham, a two-time former leadership contender, refrained from ruling out another bid, affirming he is "ready to play any role" to confront what he perceives as an "existential" threat to Labour. His comments emerge amidst internal party pressures on Starmer, exacerbated by recent resignations and dismissals, with Burnham criticizing a "climate of fear" within Number 10. Allies suggest his statements aim to advocate for a wider range of voices and a clear strategy to counter the Reform party's growing influence.</p>

          <p>A 23-year-old employee of the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Ibrahim El-Hakim, has been charged with fraud, unauthorized computer use, and identity theft for allegedly accessing the account of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Police also suspect he accessed former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's account. RBC confirmed it independently detected the unauthorized system access and collaborated with law enforcement, noting El-Hakim's termination. Court affidavits suggest his actions might be linked to organized crime, with allegations he was paid to create fraudulent bank profiles. El-Hakim is set to appear in court in October, while authorities have assured the public there is no threat to national security.</p>
