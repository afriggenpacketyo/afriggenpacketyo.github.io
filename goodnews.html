          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, has upheld a temporary injunction against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants, sending the case back to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court found that the government failed to provide the migrants with adequate time or information to contest their removals, emphasizing the importance of due process. The justices did not rule on the overall lawfulness of the deportations under the Act, but urged lower courts to address these cases expeditiously, balancing national security interests with constitutional rights. Lee Gelernt of the ACLU praised the decision as preventing hurried deportations to potentially dangerous situations.</p>

Trump himself called the post "a terrible thing" and Comey a "dirty cop," alleging it meant assassination. The term "86" can mean "remove" or "eject."</p>
