One passenger described the experience as terrifying, noting the plane shook significantly before the captain announced the diversion. The airline confirmed the incident was due to an "aircraft malfunction" and praised the crew for handling the situation smoothly, ensuring all passengers were safe and accommodated.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal prosecutors have charged eleven individuals in connection with a sophisticated, Russia-based scheme that attempted to defraud Medicare of $10.6 billion. The transnational criminal organization allegedly stole the personal information of over a million Medicare recipients to file fraudulent claims for expensive medical equipment that was never provided. The scheme was uncovered after numerous beneficiaries reported receiving explanation of benefit forms for equipment they never ordered or received. The group laundered the illicit proceeds through shell companies and cryptocurrency, according to the indictment.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, despite what their manager described as a flawed performance. The game featured a leadoff home run by Shohei Ohtani and a game-winning RBI single from Mookie Betts. Starting pitcher Dustin May struggled, lasting only four innings, but the bullpen managed to hold the lead by delivering five scoreless frames. Although manager Dave Roberts believes the team has not yet played its best baseball, the win moved the Dodgers into sole possession of the best record in Major League Baseball at 52-31.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has stated that the club has no plans to sell 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong this summer, despite interest from other clubs in England and Europe. Maresca expressed his admiration for the young player, viewing him as a potential top defender for the club in the long term. Acheampong, a Chelsea academy product, signed a new five-year contract last year and had a breakthrough season under Maresca. The manager clarified that a loan would only be considered if it were deemed best for the player's development.</p>

Their departure leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, who are also scheduled to return to China next year.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has significantly limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block presidential policies across the country. The 6-3 ruling, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, stemmed from challenges to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. While the decision narrows the scope of judicial orders, it does not rule on the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship policy itself. The majority opinion argued that such broad injunctions exceed the authority granted to courts, a move praised by the Trump administration as a major victory.</p>

          <p>A study by the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The research assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. Among a cohort of nearly 12,500 employees, those who adhered to a Japanese diet were less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms. Researchers suggest that nutrients like folic acid in vegetables and omega-3 fatty acids in fish may contribute to improved mental well-being by aiding neurotransmitter release and reducing inflammation.</p>

Sadler says the new series is influenced by the "bleak" modern dating scene she observes online and their own upbringing in an all-woman household.

A BBC correspondent participated in a project where a phage collected from his home toilet was able to kill a patient's recurring urinary tract infection in a lab setting.

          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked one of President Trump's executive orders aimed at punishing an elite law firm, in this case, Susman Godfrey. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled that the order, which sought to impose punitive measures like suspending security clearances and government contracts, was unconstitutional. This decision marks another significant legal defeat for the administration's campaign against law firms that have represented clients or causes opposed by the president. In all four lawsuits brought by different firms, judges have found the executive orders to be an unconstitutional assault on the legal system.</p>

          <p>The 1975 returned to the stage to headline Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, delivering a slick and crowd-pleasing performance in their only scheduled show of the year. Frontman Matty Healy, known for his on-stage antics, offered a more subdued but musically tight set filled with the band's biggest hits like "Chocolate" and "If You're Too Shy (Let Me Know)."
