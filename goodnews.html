          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is projected to strengthen into a hurricane but is forecast to move away from the southeastern United States, according to the National Hurricane Center. As of Monday, the storm was bringing heavy rain to the northwestern Bahamas, with its path expected to turn east-northeastward toward Bermuda later in the week. While a tropical storm watch for Florida's coast was canceled, swells from Imelda are still expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast. The storm formed shortly after Hurricane Humberto, another major Atlantic hurricane that is not expected to make landfall.</p>

The news fulfills a deal the couple made at the 75th Emmy Awards, where Culkin, upon winning for lead actor, publicly reminded Charton she had said "maybe" to having more children if he won. The couple, who married in 2013, already have two children, Kinsey Sioux and Wilder Wolf. Charton shared that her due date is approaching soon, continuing her tradition of cheeky pregnancy announcements.</p>

          <p>DuPont has announced the acquisition of Sinochem RO Memtech to expand its reverse osmosis manufacturing presence in the Asia Pacific region, aligning with its strategy to produce closer to customers. This move is part of a broader plan for DuPont to focus on secular growth in its Healthcare and Water markets ahead of its planned split. The company is set to spin off its electronics business, to be named Qnity, on November 1. Analysts suggest this separation could unlock significant shareholder value, as Qnity's peers trade at higher multiples. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched a new feature called Instant Checkout, allowing U.S. users to purchase products directly through its ChatGPT chatbot. The functionality is initially available for single-item purchases from Etsy sellers, with plans to integrate over one million Shopify merchants, including major brands like Skims and Glossier, in the near future. This move could create a significant new revenue stream for OpenAI, which will collect a transaction fee from merchants. The announcement caused a surge in stock prices for both Etsy and Shopify, signaling investor confidence in the new e-commerce integration.</p>

          <p>Individuals aged 55 are generally able to purchase annuities, which can provide a guaranteed income stream for retirement. At this age, most people opt for deferred annuities, allowing their investment to grow tax-deferred while they are still employed. While buying an annuity earlier can lock in favorable rates and provide peace of mind, it also involves risks, such as tying up funds in an illiquid investment during a period where financial flexibility may still be needed. The decision should be based on an individual's overall financial portfolio, risk tolerance, and existing retirement plans, such as pensions or Social Security.</p>

          <h2>Homebuyers Face Opportunities and Risks as Mortgage Rates Fluctuate in October</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 13:55:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen to a three-year low, offering a potential window of opportunity for prospective homebuyers this October. The average rate for a 30-year mortgage is now significantly lower than at the start of the year, creating more affordable borrowing conditions. However, the market remains volatile, with factors like inflation and Treasury yields potentially causing rates to spike again. While another Federal Reserve rate cut is anticipated at the end of the month, which could further lower rates, the challenges of a less active fall housing market present additional considerations for buyers.

          <p>OpenAI is rolling out enhanced safety features for teenage users of its ChatGPT service, automatically directing them to a version with more restrictive content policies. These safeguards include blocking sexually explicit material and, in extreme cases of distress, mechanisms to alert law enforcement. The company is also introducing parental controls that allow parents to link accounts, manage chat history, and set usage limits. This move follows increased scrutiny from regulators like the FTC and a lawsuit from the family of a teenager who died by suicide, allegedly influenced by the chatbot.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced that legal migrants will need to demonstrate their contribution to society to be granted indefinite leave to remain. Under the proposed Labour policy, applicants would have to achieve a high standard of English, maintain a clean criminal record, and participate in community volunteering. The plan is part of Labour's strategy to reform the immigration system and draw a contrast with the Reform UK party, which advocates for abolishing permanent settlement status entirely. Mahmood framed the policy as essential for maintaining a tolerant and cohesive society.</p>
