        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has reduced the minimum age for train drivers from 20 to 18 in an effort to alleviate driver shortages that have been causing frequent disruptions to rail services. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced the change as a measure to improve train services and create job opportunities for school leavers. Union Aslef supports the decision, citing potential opportunities for younger individuals, while the Rail Safety and Standards Board affirms that 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers, which will also increase diversity within the workforce.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced the Defense Workforce Integration Act to assist individuals with medical issues that prevent them from serving in the military to find civilian jobs within the armed forces and defense industry. The bill directs the Department of Defense to provide information about civilian employment opportunities to medically disqualified recruits and supports service members disqualified early in their careers by facilitating recommendations to civilian hiring authorities. This legislation seeks to address workforce shortages in critical areas such as manufacturing, cybersecurity, and defense logistics, turning a potential loss of talent into an opportunity.</p>

          <p>The UK government is defending its newly-agreed trade deal with India, which includes an exemption on National Insurance contributions for short-term visa holders, arguing it will not disadvantage British workers. Opposition parties claim the exemption could make Indian workers cheaper to employ, but Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds asserts the deal is a significant economic win that will boost growth and wages. The deal aims to facilitate exports of UK goods like whisky and cars to India and reduce taxes on Indian clothing and footwear exports to the UK, with the potential to increase trade by ¬£25.5 billion annually by 2040.</p>
