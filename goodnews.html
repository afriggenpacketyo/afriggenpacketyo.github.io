          <p>A robotic Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 and intended for Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for over half a century and is now slowly spiraling back to Earth. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur within a specific window, but the exact location remains unknown. Despite the spacecraft's heat shield, some parts may survive the atmospheric entry, but the risk of injury on the ground is considered low.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington, D.C., coinciding with the release of documents related to Adams' previously dropped federal corruption case. The mayor's office stated the purpose of the meeting was to discuss city priorities, including infrastructure, but Trump suggested Adams came to thank him for past support. The released documents revealed an F.B.I. investigation into potential witness tampering by Adams, although he was never charged with that crime. The Justice Department's decision to drop the case against Adams had previously led to resignations within the department.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested a possible reduction in tariffs on Chinese goods, stating that an '80% Tariff on China seems right!' prior to trade negotiations in Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators, marking the first public meeting since the trade war escalated. Wall Street analysts anticipate tariffs could be cut further, potentially to 50%-60%, to resolve the trade tensions and reduce market volatility.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual quarantine on sport-harvested mussels due to the risk of naturally occurring toxins. The quarantine, effective through October 31, warns against consuming mussels harvested along the California coastline due to the potential for paralytic shellfish poisoning and amnesic shellfish poisoning. These toxins, produced by algae blooms, can accumulate in shellfish and cause severe illness or death. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine due to regular testing.</p>
