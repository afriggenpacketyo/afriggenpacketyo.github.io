Given the company's stable business model and the potential for a strategic or financial acquisition, Irenic's plan will likely follow the latter. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Over half of female business leaders in Japan doubt the country will achieve its target of having women occupy 30% of top corporate roles by 2030. A survey of 41 senior women cited slow shifts in views among male-dominated executive classes and the need to change company culture as key obstacles. The government has asked firms listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Prime Market to increase female executives to 30% or more by 2030. Respondents pointed to traditional gendered divisions of labor and work-life balance issues as reasons for the imbalance. </p>
