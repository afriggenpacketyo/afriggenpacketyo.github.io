          <p>Former President Donald Trump visited the 45th Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black on Long Island to support the U.S. golf team in their match against Europe. His arrival was met with tight security for the thousands of spectators attending the prestigious biennial tournament. Top American golfer Scottie Scheffler stated that the president's presence would provide a boost to the team during a challenging time for the country. Trump, an avid golfer and owner of several courses, has remained deeply involved in the sport, including negotiations for the PGA Tour and LIV Golf merger.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new digital reconstruction of a crushed, million-year-old skull found in China suggests a significant revision to the timeline of human evolution. The study proposes that the divergence of our ancient ancestors may have occurred 400,000 years earlier than previously believed and potentially originated in Asia rather than Africa. The skull, known as Yunxian 2, displays a mix of features from both early hominins like Homo erectus and later species like Homo sapiens. While the findings could resolve long-standing debates, some experts urge caution, emphasizing the need for more evidence before overturning established evolutionary models.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has seized more than $220 million worth of cocaine in a series of recent drug interceptions in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The crew of the Cutter Midgett confiscated over 21,000 pounds of the narcotic from four separate smuggling vessels off the coasts of Mexico and Central and South America. In a separate operation, the Cutter Diligence seized another 8,700 pounds of cocaine north of Panama. The agency released images showing the offloaded drugs and one of the alleged smuggling boats engulfed in flames, highlighting its ongoing efforts to combat maritime narcotics trafficking.</p>

          <h2>August Inflation Rate Remains Steady, Aligning with Federal Reserve Expectations</h2>

          <p>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, held steady at an annual rate of 2.9% in August. This figure, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, matched economists' forecasts and the previous month's reading. The data suggests that inflation is stabilizing, which will likely keep the central bank on its current path toward potential interest rate reductions later in the year. The report also indicated that consumer spending and personal income grew slightly more than expected, showing resilience despite ongoing economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Cannstatter Wasen, considered the world's second-largest folk and beer festival after Oktoberfest, has officially opened in Stuttgart, Germany. The event began with the traditional tapping of a beer keg by Stuttgart's mayor, kicking off a three-week celebration that is expected to attract millions of visitors. The festival, which originated in 1818 as a harvest celebration, features large fairground rides, parades, and numerous beer tents. Organizers hope to match last year's attendance of 4.6 million people, though some innkeepers have noted a slight decline in table bookings amid tougher economic conditions.</p>

          <p>Shares of Paccar, the parent company of truck manufacturers Peterbilt and Kenworth, increased by approximately 5% following President Trump's announcement of a new 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks. The tariff, set to begin on October 1, is intended to protect domestic manufacturers from what the administration calls unfair foreign competition. According to Bank of America analysts, Paccar, which produces over 90% of its U.S. trucks domestically, was previously at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors in Mexico. The new tariff is expected to level the playing field and benefit the company's market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration will now permit Boeing to issue its own airworthiness certificates for some of its 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, reversing restrictions put in place after years of safety crises. The FAA had taken over the certification process for the 737 MAX in 2019 following two fatal crashes and for the 787 in 2022 due to production flaws. The agency stated the decision reflects confidence in Boeing's improved production quality and will allow FAA inspectors to focus on other areas of surveillance.

          <p>HSBC announced it has successfully used quantum computing in a trial to improve the optimization of bond trading, marking a potential world-first for the technology in financial services. In collaboration with IBM, the bank utilized a hybrid approach combining classical computers with IBM's Heron quantum processor. This method resulted in a 34% improvement in the accuracy of algorithmic bond price predictions, which can lead to increased margins and greater market liquidity. The trial provides empirical evidence that quantum computing can solve practical, complex problems in finance, signaling a new frontier for the industry.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill advancing in Congress, the Claiming Age Clarity Act, aims to change the terminology used by the Social Security Administration to help Americans better understand their retirement benefit options. The proposal would rename "early eligibility age" (62) to "minimum benefit age" and "full retirement age" (67) to "standard benefit age" to more clearly communicate the financial trade-offs of claiming at different times. This legislative effort seeks to improve financial literacy as debates continue around the long-term solvency of the program and whether the retirement age itself might be raised in the future.

          <p>This article explains crucial details often overlooked in standard hurricane forecasts, providing context for better understanding storm risks. It clarifies that maximum sustained winds are confined to a small area within the eyewall and that the forecast "cone of uncertainty" only predicts the path of the storm's center, not the extent of its impacts like storm surge and rain. The report also emphasizes that forecasts can change, storms that stall are harder to predict, and significant dangers like flooding and tornadoes can occur far inland, long after a hurricane has made landfall.</p>
