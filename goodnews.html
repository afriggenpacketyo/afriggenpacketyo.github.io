          <p>A significant power outage in Spain, Portugal, and southern France has ignited a debate about the role of renewable energy in ensuring energy security. The blackout, which affected the entire Iberian Peninsula, disrupted services and stranded thousands. While Spanish authorities are investigating the cause, some observers have suggested that the region's reliance on wind and solar power may have contributed to the issue. However, the Spanish Prime Minister and grid operator maintain that record levels of renewable energy were not responsible for the blackout, sparking further discussion on the stability of green energy sources.</p>

          <p>Nina Mohanty, a millennial entrepreneur, has raised $2 million to develop Bloom Money, a financial app tailored to the traditional money-saving methods used by immigrant communities in the U.K. The app supports collaborative savings practices, such as 'money circles,' which are often overlooked by mainstream banks. Mohanty aims to address discrimination faced by immigrant communities within the financial system and facilitate wealth-building through culturally relevant tools. Bloom Money allows users to create savings circles and invite participants, ensuring transparency and reducing the risk of mismanagement, while mainstream banks may flag these behaviors as suspicious.</p>

          <p>The recent trade talks between China and the US are seen as politically significant for both countries, offering interim relief without appearing weak. Negotiators agreed to establish a 'trade consultation mechanism' after tariffs skyrocketed in early April. Analysts suggest the US is under pressure to show wins, while China views negotiations as a strategic process for managing bilateral competition and economic resilience. Beijing's approach emphasizes strategic patience and economic self-preservation, aiming to insulate the domestic economy from external shocks while engaging global markets selectively.</p>

          <p>Reports that Donald Trump's administration may accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family have sparked controversy due to constitutional rules guarding against bribery and corruption. U.S. presidents have a long history of accepting gifts from foreign powers, which are typically managed through a complex bureaucratic process. Under U.S. law, gifts valued over $480 are considered gifts to the 'people of the United States' and are logged and disposed of by the White House Gift Unit.

The negotiations aim to ease tensions following President Trump's imposition of heavy tariffs on Chinese imports, which China retaliated against, leading to a halt in trade and a drag on the global economy. While financial markets responded positively, Nomura Securities cautioned against disappointment if tariffs are not significantly reduced.</p>

The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured funding to conduct feasibility studies into their return, considering elk a 'keystone' species that can enhance habitats for other wildlife. Challenges include gaining public acceptance and conducting disease risk assessments. The successful reintroduction of beavers in parts of the UK could serve as a guide for this project, with initial plans to keep elk and beavers in the same enclosure.</p>
