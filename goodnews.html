          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have secured their 13th consecutive playoff berth following a victory over the San Francisco Giants. The game was particularly significant as it marked the final regular-season home appearance for veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw, who recently announced his retirement. While the team has guaranteed a postseason spot, tying the second-longest streak in MLB history, they still need to clinch the NL West division title. Kershaw, a future Hall of Famer, expressed excitement for the team's championship prospects, regardless of his role in the playoff rotation.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after an exceptionally disruptive qualifying session that was halted by a record six red flags. Williams' Carlos Sainz will start second, while championship rivals Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris of McLaren qualified in seventh and ninth respectively after both encountered issues. The session, which lasted two hours, was marred by numerous crashes, including from Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in the final segment. Light rain added to the treacherous conditions, making it one of the most unpredictable qualifying events in recent memory.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated communities in the Appalachian Mountains, North Carolina resident John Saunby is building a new home using salvaged materials from the storm's wreckage. Realizing that much of the debris destined for landfills was still valuable, he has collected items like porch posts and old mill floorboards to construct his unique house. The project features creative elements such as Black Locust bark siding and tree trunk supports, fulfilling a long-held creative vision for the homebuilder. Aided by his partner, musician Jenny Kimmel, Saunby is turning the remnants of destruction into a testament to resilience and resourcefulness.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, has secured a place in their seventh consecutive World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France. Full-back Ellie Kildunne, returning from a concussion, was instrumental in the win, scoring two crucial tries that showcased her speed and agility. Despite a strong challenge from France, who trailed by only two points at halftime, England's powerful forward pack and strategic play in the second half proved decisive. The Red Roses will now face Canada in the final at a sold-out Twickenham's Allianz Stadium next Saturday.</p>

She resides in the Chiba Prefecture in a one-bedroom apartment that costs just 35,000 yen, or about $238, per month, with her employer covering additional costs like key money and insurance. Smith decided to move abroad to escape the pressures of the U.S. school system and her salary constraints, embracing a simpler lifestyle surrounded by rice fields. While she plans to return to the U.S. after her one-year contract, she is documenting her journey on social media to showcase an authentic, non-Tokyo perspective of life in Japan.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for wartime and national emergencies, to address the country's significant asylum application backlog. Home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart announced the plan, which would involve setting up temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of caseworkers to expedite claims. The party argues this decisive action is necessary to end the costly use of hotels for housing asylum seekers and to create a more efficient and humane system. This proposal is a central focus of the party's annual conference, emphasizing their stance on law and order.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to stop U.S. Steel from closing its Granite City, Illinois, plant, utilizing new powers gained from the company's recent acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel. After the steelmaker notified nearly 800 workers of the impending closure, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned the company that the administration would not permit it. This marks the first use of a "golden share" right, a condition of the takeover deal that grants the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. U.S. Steel subsequently reversed its decision, ensuring the facility will remain operational. (not investment advice)</p>

She explained that a pivotal moment came with the death of Tyler Clementi, which motivated her to use her experience to help others facing public humiliation. Lewinsky emphasized the importance of telling her own story to counteract the politically motivated narrative created about her, and she expressed gratitude to younger generations who viewed her situation with more empathy. Now an anti-bullying activist and producer, she focuses on helping others reclaim their stories and insists on finding a different, more positive ending.</p>

          <p>A nearly two-hour phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked hopes for increased stability in the relationship between the two nations. Following what both sides described as a productive conversation, Trump announced plans for a face-to-face meeting at the upcoming APEC summit and a potential visit to China early next year. However, analysts remain cautious, pointing to significant points of friction such as tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. Potential U.S. tariffs related to China's purchase of Russian oil also pose a risk to the positive momentum.</p>

          <p>The United States has become noticeably quieter about sending its warships through the sensitive Taiwan Strait since President Trump returned to office, with only three known operations occurring compared to the regular announcements under the previous administration. Beijing has historically criticized the "public hype" surrounding these freedom-of-navigation exercises. While the U.S. has confirmed the recent transits when asked by the media, the shift away from proactive announcements is seen by some Chinese observers as a tactical change rather than a substantive shift in U.S. policy. The People's Liberation Army continues to condemn the operations as undermining regional stability.</p>

          <p>A leading dermatologist is highlighting a common misconception about sun protection, warning that significant exposure to harmful UV rays can occur even while indoors. Dr. Adam Friedman explains that while windows may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays. These UVA rays penetrate deeper into the skin, accelerating aging and contributing to skin cancer risk without any visible burning sensation. He recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, especially for those who spend extended time near windows, to protect against this "silent" form of skin damage.</p>
