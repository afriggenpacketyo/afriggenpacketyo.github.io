          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially declared that she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the upcoming election. In a public statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection on her public service career, she has decided her leadership will not be in elected office for now. This decision follows her 2024 presidential campaign and keeps the door open for a potential White House run in 2028. Sources close to Harris indicated that while she considered leading her home state, she believes she can have a greater impact on the national stage and plans to support Democratic candidates. </p>

          <p>The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) has established a $1.3 million legal defense fund to support Christians and churches in Europe facing legal challenges over their beliefs. The fund was created using money from court settlements BGEA won in the U.K. after its events were canceled, with an additional contribution from Samaritan’s Purse. Franklin Graham stated the initiative aims to help those who are "threatened or intimidated into silence" for expressing their faith. Cissie Graham Lynch, his daughter, emphasized that the effort is also meant to encourage believers in the U.S. to stand firm against what they see as growing hostility toward public expressions of faith.</p>

          <p>As the Major League Baseball trade deadline approached, the Philadelphia Phillies made a significant move by acquiring star closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins. In exchange for the hard-throwing right-hander, the Phillies sent two of their top prospects to Minnesota. The trade was part of a flurry of activity, with other contending teams also strengthening their bullpens. The New York Mets acquired relievers Tyler Rogers and Ryan Helsley in separate deals, while the Cincinnati Reds added Gold Glove third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes from the Pittsburgh Pirates, signaling a heated market for key players ahead of the deadline.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a trade agreement that imposes a 15% tariff on South Korean imports, avoiding a threatened 25% levy. President Trump announced the deal, which also includes a commitment from Seoul to invest $350 billion in the U.S., including in the shipbuilding sector. This arrangement aligns South Korea's tariff rate with that of other partners like Japan and the European Union, covering key exports such as cars and semiconductors. South Korean leaders praised the deal for securing favorable terms while successfully protecting their sensitive agricultural markets, like rice and beef, from further U.S. imports.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Benchmark copper prices reacted strongly to the Trump administration's newly imposed tariffs, which were less severe than the market had anticipated. The U.S. will apply a 50% tariff on finished copper products like pipes and wiring, but crucially, it excluded raw materials such as ores and cathodes. This surprise move caused U.S. copper prices on the Comex exchange to drop significantly, narrowing the large price premium that had built up over the London benchmark in anticipation of sweeping restrictions. The targeted nature of the tariffs has led to a market correction as traders adjust to the new, less disruptive trade landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the costly and disruptive process of rerouting the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would be less expensive, reduce risk, and could be fully operational by 2035. This marks the first time a competing bid has been formally considered for the long-debated expansion project, introducing a new dynamic as the UK government reviews its options for increasing airport capacity.</p>

          <p>Trading platform Robinhood announced strong second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, with revenue climbing 45% year-over-year to $989 million. The company's net income more than doubled, and it saw significant growth in funded customer accounts and total platform assets, which nearly doubled to $279 billion. This performance was driven by strong net deposits and higher valuations in equity and cryptocurrency markets. Despite the positive report, shares dipped slightly after the company projected higher future operating costs related to its acquisition of the crypto exchange Bitstamp, signaling continued aggressive investment in its growth.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani had to leave his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning, creating a moment of concern for the team and its fans. The team later announced the two-way phenom was only suffering from cramping, a relief given the initial worry. Ohtani was able to remain in the game as the designated hitter, though the Dodgers ultimately lost the contest 5-2. The early exit occurred on a hot and humid night, and while the injury appears minor, it highlights the physical demands on the unique player as he continues his return to pitching after surgery.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, maintaining the current range despite public pressure from President Donald Trump for a rate cut. While the decision was expected, it was marked by an unusual dissent from two board members who favored lowering rates, signaling a potential shift in sentiment. The Fed's cautious approach comes as policymakers weigh the uncertain effects of new tariffs and tax cuts on the economy. Recent data showed moderate economic growth, but underlying indicators suggest a potential loss of momentum, leaving the central bank to navigate a complex and politically charged environment.

          <p>Following the recent major earthquake off Russia's coast, this article provides a detailed explanation of the science behind tsunamis. A tsunami is typically generated by a strong underwater earthquake, usually magnitude 6.5 or higher, that causes a vertical shift of the seafloor. The resulting waves travel at speeds comparable to a jet airplane in the deep ocean but slow down and increase dramatically in height as they approach shallower coastal waters. Experts emphasize that a tsunami is a series of powerful waves, not a single event, and urge the public to heed all official warnings and evacuate to higher ground immediately.</p>

Using a human-occupied submersible, a Chinese-led team observed and photographed vast fields of tube worms, beds of clams, and mats of bacteria. These lifeforms exist in total darkness and under immense pressure, fueled by chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the Earth's crust. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life and suggest that these chemosynthetic ecosystems may be widespread in the planet's deepest, unexplored regions.</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's coast did not cause a global catastrophe, and scientists have explained why. A key factor was the tsunami's directionality; much of its energy was projected into the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate before reaching populated coastlines. Additionally, the most heavily impacted areas near the epicenter were sparsely populated. While the event triggered extensive alerts, the combination of its location, the direction of energy, and effective warning systems meant that the world "dodged a bullet" from a potentially devastating event.</p>
