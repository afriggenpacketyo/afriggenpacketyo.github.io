          <p>The Trump administration secured a temporary pause in a court decision that deemed the president's tariff regime illegal. A US trade court had ruled that the tariffs exceeded presidential authority, but an appeals court has temporarily suspended the ruling pending an appeal hearing. The administration is expected to pursue the case to the Supreme Court if necessary. The initial ruling stated that Trump's tariff orders exceeded any authority granted to the president to regulate importation by means of tariffs, as tariffs typically require Congressional approval, which Trump bypassed by claiming trade deficits constitute a national emergency.</p>

          <p>The euro has made significant gains against the dollar amidst uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies, leading to discussions about its potential to become a global reserve currency. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde suggested the shifting geopolitical landscape offers an opportunity to elevate the euro's status. Lagarde outlined three key foundations for the euro to gain greater global influence: a solid geopolitical foundation, a reinforced economic foundation, and a bolstered legal foundation. While market watchers are divided, some analysts suggest investors may diversify away from the dollar, potentially benefiting the euro. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A neuroscientist challenges the traditional definition of animal instinct, arguing that the term is confusing and unhelpful. He proposes using the phrase 'species-typical' behavior instead, which avoids assumptions about the behavior's origin or control. He emphasizes that behaviors grow up in bodies under environmental experiences and explicit learning, all of which shape them. The neuroscientist uses the example of a tailorbird building a nest to illustrate the complexity of behaviors and the interplay of genetics, environment, and learning, stating that the only way you know that instinct exists is because those materials exist in the world for it to manipulate.</p>

          <p>A review of Jonathan Parks-Ramage's new novel, "It's Not the End of the World," describes it as a maximalist, campy, and ambitious work set in a future Los Angeles. The novel follows Mason Daunt, a wealthy gay artist, as his life is disrupted by a mysterious pink fog that turns people into zombie-like figures. The review praises the novel's absurdities and its exploration of themes such as wealth, inequality, climate change, and the question of why we have children. Ultimately, the reviewer finds that the book's ridiculous moments are deliberate and that there is something true and painful running beneath the humor.</p>

Raised in the Soviet Union with ingrained notions of marriage, she navigates the tension between those traditions and her aspirations as a writer in liberal Los Angeles. She recounts her experiences with love, dating, and ultimately finding a partner who supports her creative pursuits. The essay concludes with her decision to embrace marriage on her own terms, seeing it as a symbol of hope and a sacred pact, challenging the notion that it diminishes an artist's identity.</p>
