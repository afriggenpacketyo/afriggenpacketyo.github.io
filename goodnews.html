          <p>Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton achieved a rare feat in baseball by hitting for the cycle during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The accomplishment was made even more special as it occurred on the day the team was giving away his bobblehead to fans. Buxton completed the cycle with a dramatic home run in the seventh inning, marking the first cycle ever hit at Target Field. His performance highlights a strong, healthy season for the two-time All-Star, who has historically struggled with injuries.</p>

          <p>Global superstar Bad Bunny's latest album and concert series are galvanizing conversations about Puerto Rico's pressing issues, including its colonial status, gentrification, and economic struggles. His music directly addresses the challenges forcing residents to leave, resonating deeply with locals who see him as a powerful voice for change. The residency has also revived interest in the island's traditional music and culture, such as bomba and plena. Many Puerto Ricans are optimistic that the artist's immense platform will bring global attention to their fight for a better future.</p>

          <p>A recent segment on "The Ramsey Show" is being called the shortest in the show's history after a listener's straightforward financial question received an immediate answer. A 20-year listener named Chad, who had $211,000 in cash, asked if he should pay off his remaining $95,000 mortgage. Host Dave Ramsey responded without hesitation, telling him to "Pay it off today."

          <p>England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, has defended his team's use of delay tactics at the end of the third day's play in the Test match against India. Opener Zak Crawley repeatedly delayed the game, ensuring England only had to face one over before the close, which angered the Indian team. Southee pointed out that India had used similar time-wasting tactics earlier in the match, suggesting their complaints were unfounded. The incident added a layer of drama to the tightly contested match at Lord's, highlighting the strategic gamesmanship present in Test cricket.</p>

The RAF confirmed that the crew, who were uninjured, are well-trained for such incidents and safely landed the plane at RAF Coningsby. An investigation has been launched into the cause of the engine issue on one of only two airworthy Lancasters in the world.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump renewing his tariff campaign against major U.S. trading partners, the stock market has remained resilient, with major indices near all-time highs. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiation style and are less prone to panic than they were previously. The market's focus appears to be on the pro-growth implications of the administration's other policies, such as deregulation and a permissive stance on AI development. These factors are seen as driving corporate earnings, outweighing the immediate uncertainty caused by the trade rhetoric. (not investment advice)</p>
