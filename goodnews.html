          <p>Former President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semi-annual earnings reports to encourage a greater focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits. This idea, which would require SEC approval, mirrors practices in the U.K. and European Union and has been previously supported by figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon. Supporters of the current quarterly system argue it provides essential transparency and timely information for investors, highlighting that U.S. reporting standards are considered among the world's most reliable. The proposal aims to align corporate management with a longer-term vision, similar to what Trump inaccurately attributes to Chinese corporate planning. (not investment advice)</p>

The couple, who first met in 1991 but only began their romance in 2020, confirmed the news ahead of the Primetime Emmy Awards. McEntire had previously expressed that while she had lost some faith in the institution of marriage after two divorces, she was deeply committed to Linn and would be open to marrying him. Their relationship deepened through remote communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, which they credit for building a strong, intimate foundation.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that a 'framework' deal has been reached concerning the future of TikTok, with commercial terms agreed upon between the private parties involved. The agreement, which could shift the popular social media platform to U.S.-controlled ownership, is set to be finalized in a discussion between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. This development comes amid a looming deadline for parent company ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations due to national security concerns raised by Congress. The deal aims to resolve a protracted standoff that has seen Trump issue multiple extensions to avoid a shutdown of the app in the United States.</p>

This trend comes more than two years after strict COVID-19 policies led to a significant departure of foreigners from the country. Many young professionals and students view China as a hub of rapid growth and potential, particularly in fields like technology and entrepreneurship. The article suggests an age divide in perception, with the younger generation being more curious and drawn to the country's dynamic economic landscape, such as the growth seen in cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following widespread, violent protests led by Gen Z against corruption that resulted in the prime minister's resignation, former chief justice Sushila Karki has been appointed as Nepal's first female interim prime minister. The 73-year-old is known for her integrity and strong anti-corruption stance, making her a consensus choice among protest leaders and civil society. Her immediate challenges include overseeing the rebuilding of government infrastructure destroyed during the unrest and ensuring fresh elections are held on schedule in 2026. Her appointment is seen as a pivotal moment for Nepal, reflecting growing trust in female leadership and a societal demand for better governance.</p>

          <p>Following an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut, mortgage experts advise prospective homebuyers to act promptly but with discipline to capitalize on improved market conditions. Key recommendations include getting a fresh pre-approval to reflect increased buying power, comparing offers from various lenders, and strategically locking in the best rate quickly. Experts caution against assuming rates will continue to fall or overextending one's budget, as a lower rate might qualify a buyer for a larger loan than they can comfortably afford. The article stresses that while a rate cut often spurs a competitive market, thorough financial assessment and property review remain crucial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price saw a significant jump after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his first open-market purchase of the company's shares since 2020, acquiring approximately $1 billion worth of stock. This substantial insider buy was interpreted by the market as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle maker's future. The purchase comes as Tesla's stock has faced headwinds this year due to slumping sales and concerns over Musk's political activities affecting the brand. Analysts suggest the move signals Musk is doubling down on his vision for Tesla's transformation into an AI and robotics-focused company.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by Natixis Investment Managers found that 21% of Americans feel it will take a "miracle" for them to achieve a secure retirement, citing concerns like insufficient savings and inflation. Despite this pessimism, financial experts emphasize that what most people truly need is not a miracle, but a concrete financial plan. Creating and consistently reviewing a retirement plan can provide clarity on goals, savings strategies, and investment choices. Experts suggest that a well-thought-out plan helps individuals navigate market volatility and economic uncertainty without making emotional decisions, ultimately building confidence in their ability to retire securely.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a majority of job seekers now use AI in their application process, career experts caution against over-reliance on these tools, which could harm their chances. A significant issue is that AI tools can "hallucinate" or fabricate information to align a resume with a job description, leading to inaccuracies that candidates cannot defend in an interview. Additionally, AI-generated applications often lack authenticity and share a uniform structure, making them less likely to stand out to recruiters. Experts recommend using AI to polish a self-written draft rather than for initial generation, and always proofreading carefully to avoid embarrassing and costly errors.</p>

Hall is positioning himself as a candidate focused on accountability and effective governance, criticizing Mejia for prioritizing "social media theatrics" over the core duties of the office. The race is shaping up to be a contest between L.A.'s political establishment, represented by Hall, and the city's ascendant left, which propelled the younger, activist-oriented Mejia to a surprise victory in 2022.

          <p>Manchester City secured a decisive 3-0 victory over Manchester United by tactically exploiting weaknesses in their rival's defensive system. City manager Pep Guardiola focused attacks down the left flank, using clever positioning and player rotations to create a midfield overload that United's defense struggled to contain. The analysis highlights how City's players 'pinned' United's defenders, creating space for attackers like Jeremy Doku to drive forward and create scoring opportunities. The article explores whether United's struggles are due to personnel or a flawed system, concluding that while better players always help, opponents have found consistent ways to unpick manager Ruben Amorim's tactics.</p>

          <p>A data analysis shows that African nations are increasingly vital to the global supply of critical minerals like cobalt, platinum, and manganese, which are essential for green energy and technology. The International Monetary Fund estimates this resource wealth could boost sub-Saharan Africa's GDP by 12% over the next 25 years. However, the continent faces significant challenges in capitalizing on this boom, including fragile governance, environmental degradation, and inequitable revenue sharing. To fully benefit, experts argue that African countries must move beyond raw material extraction and develop domestic refining capabilities to capture more value.</p>
