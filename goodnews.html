          <p>Taiwan's military has reclassified Chiang Kai-shek's mausoleum in Taoyuan as a 'camp area,' marking a symbolic downgrading of the former Kuomintang leader's legacy. The mausoleum of his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, was also reclassified. This move reflects the island's independence-leaning authorities' efforts to redefine historical narratives and update administrative designations, as Taoyuan was reclassified as a metropolitan area in 2014. The sites will no longer be referred to as 'mausoleums' or 'spirit-worship facilities.'</p>

          <h2>Rogoff Argues Trump's Plan to Weaken the Dollar is Based on Flawed Economic Analysis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 01:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former IMF chief economist, critiques Stephen Miran's plan to weaken the dollar, arguing that it oversimplifies the causes of America's trade deficits. Rogoff acknowledges that the dollar's reserve-currency status can inflate its value, but contends that other factors, such as fiscal deficits and the strength of the American economy, also play significant roles. He points out that the US ran current account surpluses when the dollar was already the reserve currency. Rogoff suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more effective solution than initiating a trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to eliminate $1.15 billion in debt and focus on its transition into a telehealth services provider. The company has secured the support of most of its debt holders and expects to emerge from bankruptcy within 45 days. This move comes as WeightWatchers shifts its business model towards prescription drug weight loss, particularly through its acquisition of Sequence, now WeightWatchers Clinic. Despite a decline in overall revenue, the company has seen significant growth in its clinical subscription revenue related to weight-loss medications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Times article discusses how Morocco's position as a trade connector between China and Europe is becoming increasingly precarious due to the ongoing trade war and geopolitical tensions. Chinese companies are investing heavily in Morocco to bypass tariffs for exports to Europe, leveraging Morocco's free-trade agreement with the European Union. However, Morocco faces a difficult balancing act between maintaining economic ties with China and avoiding alienating the United States and Europe, which could lead to pressure from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Five top Venezuelan opposition figures, who had been sheltering in the Argentine diplomatic residence in Caracas for over a year, have left the country and are now in the United States. The announcement comes as Venezuela seeks to ease tensions with the Trump administration, which has threatened to reimpose oil sanctions. The opposition activists had been running a presidential campaign from the embassy, but the Maduro government has continued to suppress dissent and detain political prisoners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New legislation is being introduced in England and Wales that would allow judges to impose an additional two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. The bill aims to ensure that offenders cannot evade justice and must face the consequences of their actions. The families of victims who have been affected by offenders' absence from sentencing have campaigned for this change in the law. The new measures could apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those who are removed from court for disruptive behavior.</p>

          <p>The fire-ravaged Tahitian Terrace mobile home park in Pacific Palisades is now eligible for federal debris removal, a decision that brings residents one step closer to returning home. The announcement follows weeks of uncertainty for the community, where all but one of the 158 homes were destroyed in a January fire. The federal assistance will help clear the properties, addressing public health concerns and paving the way for potential rebuilding efforts, though the owners have not yet made a decision on whether to rebuild.</p>

          <p>CNBC reports that tourism is surging in China, defying a broader slowdown in consumption. The May Labor Day holiday saw a significant increase in domestic tourist trips, with travelers favoring smaller cities and cultural activities. The trend is driven by improved transportation infrastructure and a growing interest in history and culture. While retail sales remain tepid, the services sector, including tourism, is experiencing faster growth, indicating a shift in consumer priorities towards experiences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney engaged in light sparring with President Donald Trump over the possibility of the US purchasing Canada. Carney jokingly stated that Canada was 'not for sale' after meeting with the owners of Canada during the campaign, to which Trump responded, 'Never say never.' The exchange occurred as Trump considered a 100% tariff on foreign-made movies and said he would consult with the industry. This article is a brief summary of events.</p>
