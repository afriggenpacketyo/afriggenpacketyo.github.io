          <p>Cloud security provider Netskope has raised its planned price range for its initial public offering, now targeting a valuation of up to $7.3 billion. The company plans to sell nearly 48 million shares at between $17 and $19 each, an increase from its previous range. This move reflects strong investor appetite and comes amid a resurgence in the tech IPO market and a series of major acquisitions in the cybersecurity sector. Netskope's upcoming debut on the Nasdaq exchange is seen as another test of the hot streak for technology and security-focused companies going public.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A detailed analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewable sources are the most affordable option. According to a report from investment bank Lazard using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) metric, onshore wind and utility-scale solar are more cost-competitive to generate than coal, natural gas, or nuclear power. While renewables have high upfront capital costs, their operational expenses are significantly lower, and they are not subject to volatile fuel prices. The article also discusses how government policies, such as tax incentives and tariffs, impact these costs, concluding that a diverse energy portfolio is crucial for grid stability.

          <p>Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B sat down for an interview to discuss her upcoming album, titled "Am I the Drama?" She spoke about her long-standing reputation for being outspoken and dramatic, which she feels makes her an easy target for public scrutiny and conflict. The Bronx-born artist, whose real name is Belcalis Almánzar, explained that while she does not enjoy the stress that comes with drama, she believes her big personality naturally attracts it. The new album's title directly plays on this public perception, which has followed her since she was voted "most dramatic" in her high school yearbook.</p>

This development comes after extended negotiations and concerns from U.S. lawmakers about data security under Chinese ownership. The new structure aims to address these national security concerns while allowing the popular app to continue operating in the United States.</p>

          <p>In The Atlantic's "Dear James" advice column, a reader who is a military veteran and retired federal employee describes feeling lost, pointless, and ungrateful despite achieving a comfortable early retirement. The letter writer struggles with navigating a new life of leisure while witnessing turmoil in the world, a feeling the columnist identifies as a form of survivor's guilt. The advice given is to embrace idleness, be gentle with oneself, and recognize the value of savoring existence in a chaotic world. The columnist suggests that this period of rest is necessary before the shape of a new life can reveal itself.</p>

          <h2>The 6-Month Reverse Mortgage Rule for Heirs Explained</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 12:55:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details a crucial but often overlooked aspect of reverse mortgages: the 6-month rule. This guideline stipulates that once the borrower passes away or permanently leaves the home, their heirs have a six-month window to either repay the full loan balance or sell the property to settle the debt. This rule applies to the most common type of reverse mortgage, the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). Understanding this timeline is critical for homeowners and their families to properly plan their estates and avoid the stress of a tight deadline or potential foreclosure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced the lifting of travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens, citing that the country has addressed key security vulnerabilities. The move reverses limitations imposed in 2021 by the Biden administration, which had reduced the validity of travel authorizations under the Visa Waiver Program due to concerns over Hungary's simplified naturalization process. Effective September 30, the validity period for Hungarian passport holders will be restored to two years, allowing for multiple entries. This decision signals a warming of diplomatic ties between Washington and Budapest under the current administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two years after its historic strike, the actors' union SAG-AFTRA has officially established a new fund to distribute a portion of streaming profits more broadly among its members. Dubbed the "Robin Hood" fund, it will collect 25% of the bonuses generated when a high-budget streaming show becomes highly successful. This money will then be distributed to a wider pool of performers, including background actors, stunt riggers, and others who work on the project but previously did not share in its success. The fund represents a key gain from the 2023 contract negotiations, creating a new secondary income stream for many working actors.</p>

An 11-member deep-sea diving team retrieved items including the ship's bell, a navigation light, and silver-plated trays from the vessel, which lies nearly 400 feet deep in the Aegean Sea. The Britannic was serving as a hospital ship when it struck a mine in 1916. The recovered artifacts will undergo conservation and are set to become a centerpiece of a new Museum of Underwater Antiquities in Greece.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Donald Trump's credible willingness to let TikTok "go dark" in the U.S. was the key factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent stated that the commercial terms had been largely settled for months, but the Chinese side paused negotiations after Trump's tariff announcements. The President's firm stance on prioritizing national security over the deal itself reportedly broke the stalemate, leading to the current agreement that will restructure the app's U.S. operations. This provides insight into the administration's hardline negotiation tactics in its dealings with China.</p>

          <p>This article provides a retrospective on the 1995 Ryder Cup, one of the most dramatic comeback victories in the event's history. Captain Bernard Gallacher's European team, considered underdogs, traveled to Oak Hill in New York and overcame a 9-7 deficit heading into the final day's singles matches. Key performances from players like Nick Faldo and a crucial final point secured by rookie Philip Walton led Europe to a stunning 14½ to 13½ victory. The win was Europe's first on American soil since 1987 and is remembered as a classic moment of Ryder Cup resilience and drama.</p>
