          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," features Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, explores the personal crisis Kerr faced after his first professional loss, which triggered struggles with substance abuse and relationship anxieties. Johnson's performance is central to the film, which also co-stars Emily Blunt as Kerr's girlfriend, Dawn. While the article praises moments of vulnerability, it notes the film focuses heavily on the fighting aspect, not fully exploring the emotional depth of Kerr's life outside the ring.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has confirmed the departure of two of its forwards, with Rasmus Hojlund joining Italian champions Napoli on a season-long loan and Antony completing a permanent move to Real Betis for £21.65 million. Hojlund's deal includes a £38 million obligation-to-buy clause for next summer. Antony, who joined United for £81.3 million in 2022, struggled to find form at Old Trafford and has signed a five-year contract with the Spanish club. Both players were deemed surplus to requirements by manager Ruben Amorim as the club revamps its attack.</p>

Brand experts describe Buc-ee's as the "Disneyland of the convenience store industry," creating a joyful and experiential pit stop.

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has announced his six wildcard selections, confirming a team that includes 11 of the 12 players who secured victory in Rome two years ago. Shane Lowry, Viktor Hovland, and Jon Rahm are among those chosen to join the six automatic qualifiers, including Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose. Despite the team's continuity, Donald warned against expecting a "rinse and repeat" strategy, emphasizing that playing away at Bethpage in New York presents a different challenge. He stressed that the team will need to adapt its pairings and lineup to counter the U.S. team and a raucous home crowd.</p>

          <h2>Author Margaret Atwood Pens Satirical Story to Protest Alberta's School Book Ban</h2>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has released a satirical short story criticizing a new policy in Alberta that requires school libraries to remove books with "explicit sexual content." The move comes after her celebrated novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," was among over 200 books pulled from Edmonton Public School Board shelves. Atwood's new story sarcastically describes two perfect children who marry and reproduce without ever having sex, taking aim at the provincial government's stance. The author has been a vocal critic of the ban, which reflects a trend of book challenges that have become prominent in the U.S. in recent years.</p>

          <p>European stock markets saw gains, largely driven by the aerospace and defense sectors following a major U.K.-Norway warship deal. BAE Systems shares rose after Norway placed a £10 billion order for British-made frigates, set to support thousands of jobs. Additionally, the health-care sector was buoyed by positive trial data from Novo Nordisk for its weight-loss drug Wegovy, which showed superior performance in reducing heart disease risk compared to rivals. These corporate developments provided a positive start to the month for regional investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones in southern France reveals a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domestic species starting in the Middle Ages. Researchers found that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild species like foxes and deer became smaller. In contrast, domesticated animals such as sheep, cattle, and chickens grew larger due to increased human control, selective breeding, and specialized management practices. The findings highlight the profound and lasting impact of human activities on the natural world over the last millennium.</p>

Investors will closely watch several jobs reports, including Friday's nonfarm payroll data, for signs of softening that could influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rate cuts. Additionally, earnings from Salesforce and AI chipmaker Broadcom will provide further insight into the health of the enterprise software and semiconductor sectors. A recent appeals court ruling against President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs is also expected to be a significant topic of discussion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in China, signaling deepening ties between the two nations. The meeting is particularly significant as it comes days after the U.S. imposed steep tariffs on Indian imports in response to New Delhi's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. Both leaders hailed their countries' long-standing partnership, with Putin calling Modi a "dear friend." Analysts suggest that recent U.S. trade policies are pushing India to work more closely with China and Russia against perceived economic unilateralism.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, the publicly-owned railway operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, making all tickets off-peak in an effort to attract more passengers. The move follows a trial period and reflects changes in travel patterns since the pandemic, with commuter rush hours being less congested. An anytime day return from Glasgow to Edinburgh has been reduced from £32.60 to £16.80. The initiative raises questions about whether the rest of the UK could adopt a similar model, though experts are divided on the potential impacts, citing risks of overcrowding on busy routes and the need for fare adjustments to maintain revenue.</p>

In an interview, he reflects on his journey from a teenage fan to the lead singer of his favorite band and his experiences as a songwriter for major pop artists. His new music, including the single "Slow & Easy," aims for a feel-good, summertime vibe inspired by artists like Bob Marley and Van Morrison.</p>
