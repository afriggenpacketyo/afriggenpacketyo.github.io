        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo defended owner Evangelos Marinakis' post-match intervention following a draw against Leicester, attributing it to "confusion" over the substitution of striker Taiwo Awoniyi. Nuno explained that Marinakis was frustrated when Awoniyi signaled he was fine to continue, but then couldn't, leading to a substitution issue. Nuno emphasized that Marinakis' passion drives the club's growth and desire to improve. He praised the owner's commitment, stating that the club owes a lot to the Marinakis family.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby expressed optimism about fixing the FAA after recent air traffic control outages, citing commitment from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and bipartisan support. Kirby highlighted that the administration will ask for all the money up front, which "lets you plan the entire project and get the entire project done." Despite the outages, Kirby stressed that air travel is safe, outlining backup procedures and training within the industry. He acknowledged that the system is deliberately slowed down during outages, causing disruptions, but emphasized that safety is the top priority.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the Qatari royal family as a gift, intended for use as Air Force One and later to be transferred to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. Legal analyses from the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice suggest the gift is permissible, not violating bribery laws or the Constitution's emoluments clause. The aircraft, valued around $400 million, would first be modified by the U.S. Air Force to meet military specifications before being transferred to the library foundation by January 1, 2029.</p>

          <p>The United States has concluded trade negotiations with China in Geneva, Switzerland, with U.S. officials expressing optimism and citing "progress." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted "a great deal of productivity" and promised a briefing on the outcome. The talks follow Trump's imposition of tariffs on China, which Beijing responded to with tariffs on US goods. The talks also come amid complaints filed at the World Trade Organization against Trump's approach, arguing his tariffs violate WTO rules.</p>
