          <p>President Trump is attending a NATO summit in the Netherlands shortly after announcing a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. Despite initial violations of the ceasefire, Trump claimed that Israel would cease bombing Iran. The summit's focus includes securing commitments from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense, a goal seemingly achieved due to Trump's leadership. The President also received praise from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte for his actions in Iran and on defense spending levels. The success in securing defense spending commitments and the potential for de-escalation in the Middle East contribute to a sense of cautious optimism.</p>
