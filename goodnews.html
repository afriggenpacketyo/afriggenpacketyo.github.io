          <p>Fintech firm Klarna saw its shares climb 15% on its New York Stock Exchange debut, closing at $45.82 after pricing its IPO above the expected range and raising $1.37 billion. This successful listing, which valued the company at approximately $17.3 billion, is part of a trend of high-profile tech offerings indicating growing Wall Street interest. Klarna's expansion into banking with debit cards and deposit accounts aims to differentiate it from competitors like Affirm, though it faces potential regulatory scrutiny in markets such as the U.K. The IPO generated significant returns for early investors like Sequoia, despite SoftBank's earlier higher valuation.</p>

          <p>A Morgan Stanley report indicates that over 90% of US investors are willing to increase their exposure to Chinese stocks, marking the highest interest in five years. This shift reflects a reversal of a multi-year retreat, driven by China's sector leadership, efforts to stabilize its economy and equity market, improved liquidity, and a desire for diversification from US assets. Investors are particularly keen on areas like humanoid robotics, biotech, and new consumer companies, with interest extending to onshore markets through A-share ETFs and index-future products. Morgan Stanley suggests this capital inflow is just "starting" and likely to grow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers swept the Colorado Rockies with a 9-0 victory, extending their National League West lead to three and a half games, but faced a new injury setback with catcher Will Smith. Smith was a late scratch due to swelling from a bone bruise in his right hand, delaying the team's hope for a fully healthy lineup. Despite this, Mookie Betts delivered a stellar performance with five RBIs, including a grand slam, supporting Blake Snell's dominant six-inning, 11-strikeout start. The team remains focused on managing injuries while solidifying its position atop the division.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under manager David Moyes, Everton has undergone a remarkable transformation, moving from near-relegation to fifth in the Premier League, bolstered by a record-breaking summer recruitment drive. The club's net spend of £97 million, its highest in Premier League history, marks a significant shift after years of financial struggles and points deductions. This financial health is attributed to new ownership, debt restructuring, and strategic timing of transfers post-financial year-end. The move to the new Hill Dickinson Stadium is also expected to boost revenues, as the club aims for its first trophy since 1995.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver stated that clear evidence is required to discipline Clippers owner Steve Ballmer amidst allegations of circumventing the salary cap through a secret endorsement deal for Kawhi Leonard. The league is investigating claims that Leonard received $28 million from a fraudulent sustainability firm, Aspiration, which had a significant sponsorship deal with the Clippers. Silver emphasized the league's burden to prove wrongdoing and has engaged a specialized law firm for the probe, which will examine whether Ballmer directed the deal. Potential penalties for the Clippers could include forfeited draft picks and heavy fines.</p>

          <p>Facing an industry slump and consumer sticker shock, luxury brands like Louis Vuitton are diversifying their product lines to include more accessible items such as $160 lipsticks and $1,400 accessories. This strategy, aimed at attracting new and younger consumers without diluting core brand exclusivity, sees companies expanding into cosmetics and extravagant bag charms. Experts suggest this approach, previously successful during market downturns, helps engage aspirational consumers and build long-term brand loyalty. However, brands must carefully balance broader appeal with maintaining their high-end image to avoid the pitfalls of excessive discounting.</p>

          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index achieved a new record high of 44,396.95, mirroring Wall Street gains, fueled by hopes for Fed rate cuts and positive inflation data. A major contributor was tech investment firm SoftBank Group, which surged over 10% following reports of a substantial cloud-computing deal between OpenAI and Oracle. SoftBank's connection to Oracle, stemming from their joint role in the US Stargate program, amplified investor confidence. This strong performance, led by energy and utilities stocks, reflects a broader positive sentiment in Asian markets despite mixed movements elsewhere. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has invested nearly 450 billion yuan (US$63.2 billion) over the past five years in a strategic initiative to explore for critical minerals, yielding significant discoveries in oil, gas, copper, lithium, and uranium. This massive effort, part of the country's 14th five-year plan, aims to enhance energy security and reduce reliance on imports amid geopolitical tensions and booming demand from new tech development. Geologists have mapped 163 mineral types and found over 500 large and medium-sized deposits, supporting stable domestic production of oil and natural gas and optimizing resource structures.</p>

Both Buckingham Palace and Harry's team maintained a unified silence on the details, indicating a delicate process. While this reunion is crucial for rebuilding their bond, a full family reconciliation, particularly with Prince William, remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A Redfin report suggests San Francisco's housing costs have returned to "normal," specifically to July 2018 levels, when measured by a mortgage payment-to-income ratio. This indicates a stabilization in the tech-driven market, where wage growth has outpaced home price increases. While Oakland is projected to follow suit, this "normalcy" does not equate to affordability, as San Francisco households still spend a significantly higher percentage of income on mortgages than the national average. The article notes that the AI boom is simultaneously spiking rents and displacing lower-wage tenants.</p>

          <p>NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered compelling evidence of potential ancient microscopic life in reddish, clay-rich mudstones within the Neretva Vallis river channel on Mars. Scientists, including lead researcher Joel Hurowitz, stress that in-depth Earth-based analysis is crucial before definitive conclusions, acknowledging non-biological processes could also be responsible. The 25th sample collected revealed organic carbon and minuscule specks enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide, compounds associated with microbial activity on Earth. This "exciting discovery" represents the strongest candidate yet in the rover's quest, though the ambitious sample return mission remains on hold.</p>

          <p>China has inaugurated the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge in Jiangsu province, now the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, stretching 10.3 kilometers with a main span of 1,208 meters. This engineering marvel is the first river crossing to integrate an expressway, regular road, and intercity railway on a single structure, drastically cutting travel time. A distinctive feature is its asymmetrical lower deck, accommodating a high-speed railway on one side and a road on the other—a pioneering design for large-span bridges.
