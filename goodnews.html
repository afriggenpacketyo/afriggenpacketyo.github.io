          <p>A coalition of over 20 environmental organizations, cities, and tribes has filed a first-of-its-kind class-action lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency and its administrator. The suit alleges the Trump administration illegally terminated approximately $3 billion in environmental and climate justice grants that had been previously awarded. These grants were intended to fund local projects addressing pollution, public health, and climate resilience in vulnerable communities across the nation. The plaintiffs, including groups like Air Alliance Houston, are seeking to restore the funding, arguing the cancellations violate administrative law and destabilize crucial community-led environmental initiatives.</p>

The team opted to pull him from the game early, preserving the opportunity for him to achieve the milestone in front of a home crowd at Dodger Stadium.

          <p>The White House issued a clarification regarding U.S.-China trade relations after President Donald Trump unexpectedly announced that a trade agreement had been signed. An official later stated that the two nations had reached an "additional understanding for a framework" to implement a previous agreement from talks in Geneva. Trump's initial, undetailed comment was made during an event promoting a government spending bill. The clarification suggests that while progress has been made, a final, comprehensive deal has not yet been formalized, highlighting the ongoing complexity of trade negotiations between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has successfully captured its first direct evidence of a planet outside our solar system, a significant milestone for the observatory. The exoplanet, named TWA 7b, is believed to be a gas giant with a mass similar to Saturn, orbiting a young star. Scientists used a specialized coronagraph to block the star's bright light, allowing the faint planet to be imaged directly. While there is a small possibility the object is a background galaxy, researchers state that the evidence strongly suggests it is a newly discovered planet, potentially offering new insights into planetary formation.</p>

          <p>A California appeals court has dismissed the remaining criminal charges against Diana Teran, a former top advisor to ex-L.A. County District Attorney George Gasc√≥n, in a sharp rebuke to the state attorney general's prosecution. Teran was accused of improperly downloading and using confidential police records, but she maintained they were public court documents used for a legitimate database tracking officer misconduct. The court ruled that her actions were not criminal, as the information was publicly available. The case had been a focal point for critics of Gasc√≥n's progressive policies, and the ruling marks a significant legal victory for Teran.</p>

It recommends three key steps: first, honestly assess if the service is truly necessary, considering the potential damage to one's credit score. Second, thoroughly explore all alternatives, such as debt management plans or consolidation loans, which may be more suitable. Finally, if forgiveness is the chosen path, it is crucial to shop around for a legitimate and cost-effective servicer, as fees and eligibility criteria can vary widely among different companies.

The piece advises practicing "exposure therapy" by feeling happiness for others in love rather than jealousy.

The review praises director Gerard Johnstone's shaggy sense of humor and ability to create surprising comedic beats beyond the central robot-on-robot action.
