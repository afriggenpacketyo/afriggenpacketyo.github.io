He believes a deal is likely, with a potential rollback to the original 34% tariff level. Yao Yang notes that the US might demand China buy more American goods as part of negotiations. He highlights China's economic challenges, including overcapacity and the need for technological innovation, and also stresses the importance of institutional economics for China's development.</p>

          <p>Japan's universal health care system, known for its affordability and support for a long-lived population, is under strain due to a shrinking workforce and aging demographics. The system's future is becoming entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections, raising concerns about its stability and public trust. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government is seeking funds for child-rearing steps, partly from medical system savings, but faced backlash for proposing increased burdens on high medical cost patients. Analysts emphasize the need for measured, long-term debate rather than rushed reforms driven by electoral pressures.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have halted all imports of live cattle, horses, and bison from Mexico due to concerns over the spread of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized the decision is about food and animal safety, not politics. The screwworm, eradicated in the U.S. and Mexico in the 1960s and '70s, has resurged in parts of Central America and is now detected in remote farms in Mexico. The ban will continue on a month-by-month basis until containment is achieved.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark will stop offering Zepbound in favor of Wegovy for weight loss, citing lower drug prices as the reason, despite research indicating Zepbound results in more weight loss. This decision exemplifies how secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) can restrict patient access to treatments. Patients will be forced to switch medications against their will, with one patient describing it as having the rug pulled out from under her feet. While both drugs are effective, doctors prefer Zepbound for most patients, but now they will have less ability to tailor prescriptions to individuals.</p>

The trial, funded by Mounjaro's manufacturer Eli Lilly, involved 750 obese individuals and found that Mounjaro led to better blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. While both drugs have a role, Mounjaro may be more beneficial for those with significant weight to lose.

This comes as the coalition government prepares an economic package ahead of the House of Councillors election this summer.
