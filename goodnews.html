          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts immigration enforcement from conducting raids based on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish in the Los Angeles area. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that such factors do not constitute reasonable suspicion for detaining individuals, a practice that advocates argued was unconstitutional racial profiling. The decision stems from controversial raids by the Trump administration that targeted workplaces and public areas, causing widespread fear. While the administration argues these operations target individuals in the country illegally, pro-immigrant groups hailed the ruling as a victory for civil rights.</p>

          <p>Luka Dončić has officially signed a contract extension with the Los Angeles Lakers, solidifying his role as a cornerstone of the franchise for the foreseeable future. The 26-year-old superstar, who was acquired in a trade from the Dallas Mavericks last season, announced the deal himself, expressing his commitment to bringing championships to the team. While the exact terms were not disclosed, the extension ends speculation about his potential departure and signals the Lakers' strategy for the post-LeBron James era. In a related announcement, Dončić pledged a $5 million donation to support 77 young athletes globally.</p>

In an unconventional move, the party has been launched without an official name, with the founders inviting supporters to help choose one. This initiative aims to build a grassroots movement and define the party's platform collaboratively before registering with the Electoral Commission. The move marks a significant development on the British left, creating a formal political vehicle for Corbyn's brand of politics outside the Labour Party.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have formally committed to Luka Dončić as the future face of the franchise by signing him to a three-year, $165-million contract extension. This move, celebrated with a major press conference, firmly places the 26-year-old star at the center of the team's universe. However, this strategic decision intensifies questions about the role of LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season. With Dončić now established as the team's primary focus, the dynamic shifts, leaving uncertainty about how the 40-year-old James will adapt to no longer being the undisputed focal point of the organization.</p>

          <p>British comedian Harry Hill has shared that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was the catalyst for his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Hill, who qualified as a physician in 1988, felt unsuited for medicine and was deeply affected by his stepfather's inability to enjoy retirement after a lifetime of work. He recalled feeling emotionally overwhelmed when breaking bad news to patients, which solidified his belief that he was not in the right profession. The pivotal moment set him on a new path, leading to a successful and long-lasting career in entertainment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has indicated it will adopt a more careful strategy regarding future open-source releases. This shift in approach contrasts sharply with China, where a highly competitive ecosystem is driving rapid advancements in open-source AI. Experts like Andrew Ng have noted that while top proprietary models are still American, the best open models are increasingly coming from Chinese companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI. This trend suggests China's vibrant, 'Darwinian' open-source environment could be its path to surpassing the U.S. in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia to the UK in 1943. The platypus, named Winston, was a secret diplomatic gift meant to curry favor with the British Prime Minister during World War II. While long-standing rumors claimed the animal died from shock due to a nearby German U-boat attack, newly analyzed records suggest a different cause. Archival logs of water and air temperatures on the ship indicate that the platypus was exposed to prolonged heat as it crossed the equator, leading researchers to conclude it likely died from heatstroke.</p>

According to the global association for the theme park industry, these attractions serve as significant economic drivers for local economies, creating a ripple effect that extends far beyond ticket sales.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong performance in his first start since returning from a shoulder injury, striking out eight batters over five innings. However, his promising return was spoiled by two home runs from Tampa Bay Rays slugger Yandy Díaz, who capitalized on the short right-field wall at the team's temporary ballpark. Snell gave up three runs in the Dodgers' 4-0 loss, but his command and ability to generate swings and misses were positive signs for the team's rotation. Despite the loss, the outing provided a hopeful glimpse of the dominance the two-time Cy Young winner could bring to the Dodgers' championship defense.</p>
