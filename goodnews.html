          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell expressed skepticism about the recent changes to Formula 1's swearing rules, noting a lack of communication from senior FIA officials and labeling the situation "a bit suspect." Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton echoed this sentiment, calling the situation "ridiculous" and advocating for necessary changes. Russell also endorsed rally legend Carlos Sainz Sr's potential bid for FIA president, believing his combined motorsport knowledge would benefit the sport. He dismissed conflict of interest concerns due to Sainz's son being a driver, emphasizing the technical people's role in rule-making, while McLaren's Oscar Piastri supported the changes, highlighting the FIA's increased control and fairness regarding abusing officials.</p>

          <p>Walmart cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on Chinese goods, the company may have to raise prices on some products. CEO Doug McMillon stated that tariffs create cost pressures, particularly on goods from China, impacting categories like electronics and toys. While Walmart aims to control costs and avoid passing them onto consumers, CFO John David Rainey warned that a return to higher tariffs could significantly affect the company's financials. Economist Tuan Nguyen noted that consumers are already reducing spending due to tariffs, and further price increases could put additional pressure on demand.</p>

          <p>Despite temporarily pausing export restrictions on 28 American companies following a trade agreement, China continues to block exports of seven rare earth metals crucial to U.S. industries. These metals, including Samarium and Yttrium, are vital for defense, energy, and automotive sectors. While China removed some companies from its export control list, it emphasized the need for comprehensive government control of strategic minerals for national security. China views rare earth elements as leverage in trade negotiations with the U.S., hinting at their importance through state-linked media.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, has cautioned investors about imminent price increases on various items due to tariffs, despite a temporary reduction in duties on Chinese imports. The retail giant is attempting to navigate the situation, but the speed and magnitude of price increases are unprecedented. While Walmart will absorb some of the tariff costs, consumers will likely see increases by the end of May and more in June. CEO Doug McMillon noted that tariffs on goods from countries like Costa Rica and Columbia, including bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses, are also contributing to the price pressures.</p>

The proposed legislation is likely to change as it moves through the legislative process, with Democrats opposing cuts to Medicaid and food stamps.

          <p>Alibaba shares fell sharply after the Chinese e-commerce giant missed earnings expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter. Revenue was up 7% year-on-year, but analysts were hoping for stronger performance due to investments in artificial intelligence and e-commerce. The company is grappling with macroeconomic volatility and an intense price war with rivals in China. Alibaba is investing "aggressively" in its "instant commerce" model to drive more engagement on the Taobao app.</p>
