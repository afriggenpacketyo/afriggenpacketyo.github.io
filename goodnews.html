          <p>The Japanese government has announced a 100 billion yen policy package aimed at attracting foreign researchers, particularly those who may have left the United States due to research funding cuts. The initiative seeks to establish an elite research environment in Japan, as global competition for talent intensifies in fields like artificial intelligence and semiconductors. The government also plans to utilize profits from a 10 trillion yen investment fund to support universities in producing internationally competitive research. The policy package will fund existing programs, raise salaries for researchers, and reduce their administrative burden, with the goal of making Japan the most attractive country in the world for researchers.</p>

          <h2>Letters of Credit Help Chinese Exporters Focus on Domestic Market Amid Trade War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 02:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the United States imposing reciprocal tariffs on imports from China, Beijing has taken measures to help Chinese exporters shift their focus to the domestic market. One of these measures is encouraging the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs) to ensure payment security and enhance credit for businesses. Domestic L/Cs function similarly to international L/Cs, guaranteeing payment to the seller, but can also be used in the trade of services, unlike international L/Cs which are limited to physical goods. This strategy aims to mitigate the impact of trade tensions and support Chinese businesses.</p>

          <h2>India Aims to Develop Rare Earth Reserves as Alternative to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 01:26:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is seeking to develop its domestic rare earth supplies in response to China's restrictions on rare earth exports. Experts suggest that India could become an important alternative to China for partners like the U.S., but it will require more public and private investment in the sector. Indian officials are evaluating how Indian Rare Earths (IREL), a government-owned company, can be leveraged to increase rare earth magnet production. This move comes after China's pause in exports of rare earth elements was called a "wake-up call" for the world and an opportunity for India to provide an alternative.</p>
