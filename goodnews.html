          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle is preparing for its IPO, but unlike most tech IPOs, existing shareholders are selling more shares (60%) than the company itself (40%). This mirrors Facebook's 2012 IPO where 57% of shares were sold by stakeholders, which is unusual. While Circle is profitable and has substantial cash reserves, one likely reason for the high insider sales is that venture capital firms are seeking liquidity after a period of meager returns and a multiyear drought in IPOs.

The study, published in the Journal of Railway Science and Engineering, found that track irregularities and electromagnetic resonance can trigger violent vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h. Researchers say they have found a way to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making rides more comfortable.</p>
