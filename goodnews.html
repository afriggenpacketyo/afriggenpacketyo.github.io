          <p>President Trump has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes a 15% tariff on Japanese goods imported into the U.S. According to the president, the agreement also involves a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States. Furthermore, the deal reportedly requires Japan to open its markets to more American products, specifically mentioning cars, trucks, and various agricultural goods. This announcement is part of a broader administration strategy to finalize numerous trade deals by threatening higher tariff rates on key trading partners if new agreements are not reached.</p>

          <p>England's advancement to the Euro 2025 final is being credited in large part to the performance of substitutes Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang. This article draws parallels between their impact and that of Alessia Russo and Ella Toone in the victorious Euro 2022 campaign. Both Kelly and Agyemang were instrumental in the dramatic quarter-final comeback against Sweden and the semi-final win over Italy, scoring crucial late goals after coming off the bench. Their performances have sparked debate among fans and pundits about whether they should be included in the starting lineup for the final.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new trade deals with both the Philippines and Indonesia, establishing a 19% tariff rate for goods imported into the U.S. from both nations. President Trump stated that the Philippines will become an "open market" with zero tariffs on U.S. goods. Similarly, the agreement with Indonesia will reportedly eliminate tariff barriers for 99% of its trade with the U.S., opening its market to American industrial, tech, and agricultural products. These deals were finalized ahead of an August 1 deadline set by the administration for countries to reach new agreements or face higher tariffs.</p>

Supporters in the stadium chanted Carter's name and applauded in the 16th minute, a gesture she said was incredible and allowed her to feel able to support her team.</p>

          <p>A shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century vessel with a history as both a warship and a whaling ship. The identification was made through a combination of high-tech analysis, such as dendrochronology, and community-led historical research. Originally the HMS Hind, the ship served in the Royal Navy during the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed for whaling in the Arctic. The wreck was discovered after a storm in 2024, and its timbers are now being preserved by the local community.</p>

          <p>Capital One's stock saw a notable increase in after-hours trading following its second-quarter earnings report, despite complex results due to its recent acquisition of Discover.

CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized the transformative opportunity of owning a payments network, one of only two banks in the world to do so. Investors responded positively to the long-term strategic vision, even as the company signaled that integration costs might be higher than initially projected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos at the White House last week for a private conversation that lasted over an hour. The meeting signals a potential warming of relations between the two, who were often at odds during Trump's first term, largely due to Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post. Recently, Bezos has reportedly sought to improve his relationship with the administration, especially as his company Blue Origin competes with Elon Musk's SpaceX for government contracts. The nature of the discussion was not disclosed, but it occurs amid a public falling-out between Trump and Musk.</p>
