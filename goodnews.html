          <p>Delta Air Lines surpassed Wall Street's second-quarter expectations, buoyed by robust sales of premium seats and its lucrative American Express partnership. Despite this strong performance, the carrier has lowered its full-year profit forecast for 2025, acknowledging weaker-than-anticipated overall demand and an industry-wide oversupply of flights. CEO Ed Bastian stated that while consumer travel continues, booking patterns have shifted to be closer to travel dates, prompting the airline to strategically reduce flight capacity after the summer peak. The airline's reliance on higher-spending travelers is helping to counteract the decline in main cabin revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer, Darcy Deefholts, has been rescued after he went missing while surfing and spent a night stranded on North Solitary Island, a small, uninhabited island located miles offshore. A large-scale search was initiated after he failed to return home, with his father making an emotional plea on social media for assistance. Deefholts was found the following day and was receiving medical treatment. His father described the successful rescue as a "one in a million miracle," expressing immense relief after fearing the worst had happened to his son.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is bracing for its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures forecast to climb as high as 34°C (93°F) over the weekend. In response, the UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat-health alerts for all regions of England, warning of potential significant impacts on health and social care services. While the heat will be widespread, it is unlikely to surpass the year's current high of 35.8°C. Climate scientists emphasize that such heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, posing long-term threats to wildlife and ecosystems.</p>

          <p>This opinion article examines how implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) in California could fundamentally alter its political dynamics, drawing comparisons to its recent use in New York City. Proponents argue RCV saves money by eliminating runoffs, increases diversity, and discourages negative campaigning. In California's top-two primary system, RCV could give underrepresented parties a better chance in competitive races and might reduce the incentive for candidates to strategically switch parties. The system could also lead to more centrist outcomes through crossover voting or, conversely, push candidates to extremes to capture second-choice votes, presenting a complex but potentially beneficial reform.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Health Savings Account Expansion is a Positive Step in New Federal Spending Bill</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column argues that while the recently signed federal spending bill has many flaws, it gets one thing right by expanding Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). The author praises HSAs as a rare, bipartisan policy that promotes individual responsibility and can help reduce healthcare costs. The new bill makes several positive changes, including allowing individuals with certain Affordable Care Act plans to contribute to HSAs and permitting HSA funds to be used for direct primary care memberships. While more reforms are needed, the article views these expansions as a significant and popular policy achievement.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's recent tour of South Carolina is widely interpreted as an early exploration of a 2028 presidential campaign. While officially framed as an effort to support the Democratic party in a rural Southern state, his presence in the crucial early primary state has not gone unnoticed. Newsom presented himself as a leader of the resistance against the Trump administration, touting California's legal challenges and progressive policies. However, he faces skepticism from some who view him as too liberal and out of touch with working-class voters, highlighting the challenges a California politician faces on the national stage.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Kashana Cauley's new novel, "The Payback," a satirical take on the student loan crisis in America. The book follows a woman who, after losing her dream job, navigates a world with "debt police" and earns money through food-centric internet videos. The review praises the novel's dark humor and its ability to address the horrifying reality of debt, which disproportionately affects Black women, without being preachy. By creating a funny and engaging narrative around a deeply flawed but relatable protagonist, Cauley effectively critiques a system that indebts millions while keeping the story entertaining.</p>

          <p>The release of the new "Superman" film, directed by DC Studios co-head James Gunn, is being positioned as a crucial revival for the Warner Bros. superhero franchise. After a series of box office disappointments, DC is banking on the iconic hero to reset its cinematic universe and compete more effectively with Marvel. The film faces the challenge of making the traditionally earnest character relevant to modern audiences, a task that has proven difficult in previous iterations. With a budget of around $225 million, the movie's performance is seen as a critical test for Gunn's new, more cohesive vision for DC's future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The medical community is beginning to formally address the significant pain many patients experience during IUD insertion, a procedure long downplayed as causing only minor discomfort. Spurred by patient advocacy on social media, professional organizations like ACOG have updated their guidelines to recommend that clinicians offer pain management options, including local anesthetics. This shift marks a significant change in a field where women's pain has historically been dismissed. The article explores the history of IUDs, the science of pain management, and the importance of a patient-centered approach that takes individual concerns and trauma histories seriously.</p>

          <p>In a fortunate outcome, all 31 workers trapped after a tunnel collapse in a Los Angeles industrial complex were rescued safely on Wednesday evening. The collapse occurred in an 18-foot diameter wastewater management tunnel under construction, leaving the workers stranded behind a large pile of soil and debris. The crew was able to climb over the pile to meet coworkers on the other side, who then shuttled them out to the access point over five miles away. More than 100 firefighters responded, with officials calling the successful rescue with no injuries a major blessing for the city.</p>

          <p>Indian automotive companies Mahindra & Mahindra and Uno Minda are considering domestic production of rare earth magnets, a critical component for electric vehicles, to decrease their reliance on China. This move comes after Beijing restricted exports of the magnets, disrupting supply chains for Indian manufacturers. The Indian government is reportedly developing incentives to encourage local manufacturing of these components. While India possesses significant rare earth mineral reserves, developing the necessary mining and processing infrastructure to become self-sufficient is a major challenge that could take several years to overcome.</p>

          <p>This column recounts a father's experience taking his young, neurodivergent son to his first professional soccer match at the Club World Cup. The overwhelming sensory experience of the mega-stadium, with its loud music, pyrotechnics, and roaring crowds, proved too much for the boy, who was frightened by the spectacle. However, the kindness of two stadium employees, who provided noise-canceling headphones and moved the family to a quieter area, transformed the experience. The author reflects that amidst the commercialism and manufactured hype of modern sports, moments of genuine human empathy and connection can still shine through.</p>
