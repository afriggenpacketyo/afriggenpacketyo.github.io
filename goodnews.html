          <p>Tesla is promoting its lidar-free self-driving system in China, emphasizing its reliance on visual processing solutions to achieve safer autonomous driving in various scenarios. The company asserts that advanced technology does not require expensive sensors like lidar, which CEO Elon Musk has previously dismissed as unnecessary due to high production costs. Despite Musk's skepticism, lidar sensors are expected to be fitted in one out of every four new cars in China this year. This initiative underscores Tesla's strategy to navigate the Chinese market while awaiting Beijing‚Äôs approval for its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates are currently averaging 6.11% for a 15-year mortgage and 6.89% for a 30-year mortgage as of May 5, 2025, according to national averages. Refinance rates are similar, with 15-year refinances at 6.12% and 30-year refinances at 6.86%. Experts suggest that borrowers can secure better rates by improving their credit scores and shopping around for different lenders. While rates are higher than in previous years, potential relief may come if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, making borrowing more affordable. (not investment advice)</p>

He cites India's democratic system, inherited legal framework from the British, and widespread use of the English language as advantages. Unlike China, India's population is booming, which Shilling believes will lead to increased spending on services, benefiting the Indian economy. He also notes that as economies grow, more money is proportionally spent on services rather than goods.</p>
