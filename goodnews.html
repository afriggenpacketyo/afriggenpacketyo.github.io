          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, more than three months after his detention. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or a threat to the community. Khalil, a prominent voice in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested by ICE, sparking demonstrations. The government has not accused Khalil of a specific crime, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely-used portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act to argue that Khalil's presence in the U.S. could pose adverse foreign policy consequences.

          <p>Tesla is expected to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with initial rides in the Model Y.

          <p>President Trump suggested that the administration is nearing a "deal" with Harvard University regarding international students, with an announcement likely next week.
