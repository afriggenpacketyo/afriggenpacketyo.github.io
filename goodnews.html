          <h2>Trump Appoints Rubio as Foreign Policy Advisor Amidst Internal Disagreements</h2>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as his top foreign policy advisor, following the ousting of Mike Waltz, who held more hawkish views on Russia. This move consolidates foreign policy power, but also raises concerns about potential loss of diverse perspectives, as Steve Witkoff remains the chief negotiator. Rubio's new role is likely to limit his ability to travel as America's top diplomat, creating more space for Witkoff to continue his negotiations. Rubio has echoed Trump's stance on conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as on China, demonstrating loyalty to the president's agenda.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities are a cornerstone of retirement planning, providing a reliable income stream, and in 2025, a good annuity rate depends on the type of annuity considered. Fixed annuities currently offer rates between 5.25% and 6.80%, while immediate annuities for retirees in their mid-60s to mid-80s can secure payout rates between 6.5% and 10.5%. Variable and indexed annuities do not have a guaranteed fixed rate, but may include income riders to ensure a minimum income floor. When choosing an annuity, it's important to consider your timeline, compare multiple insurers, evaluate fees and riders, understand the surrender period, factor in inflation, and align with your overall retirement plan (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>London's FTSE 100 has achieved a record-breaking winning streak, marking fifteen consecutive days of gains, fueled by the UK's unique position away from new US tariffs. The index's defensive giants, including healthcare, energy, and consumer staples, have attracted investors seeking refuge from volatility, supported by a high dividend yield. Robust corporate results and a resilient UK economy growing at an annualized rate of 1.5% have also contributed to the rally. While technical indicators suggest a potential pullback, undervaluation relative to global peers and expectations of interest rate cuts could push the index higher.</p>

Eig argues that King's letter provides guidance for those who disapprove of current tactics and seek to fight back with mercy and action.

          <p>House Republicans are planning to incorporate several of President Trump‚Äôs campaign promises into their tax bill, including not taxing tips, overtime pay, or Social Security benefits. However, these proposals are expected to be narrower than the blanket tax exemptions Trump has advertised, with limitations to control costs. Republicans are trying to limit the bill's impact on the deficit, necessitating negotiations over cuts to spending on Medicaid and other programs. The leading proposal for not taxing tips, for example, would exclude higher-income individuals and limit the tax break to specific industries.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party has won enough seats to form a government in Canada, but falls short of a majority, with Carney remaining prime minister following Justin Trudeau's resignation. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh both lost their seats. The Liberals have 168 seats, needing 172 for a majority, while the Conservatives hold 144. Increased support for the two largest parties has come at the expense of smaller parties. Poilievre's loss comes after opinion polls earlier in the year had the Conservatives significantly ahead of the Liberals.</p>

Lawmakers from high-tax states are pushing for a higher SALT cap, which could influence negotiations.
