          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have voiced criticism of the R&A's enforcement of slow-play rules during the third round of The Open. Both golfers' groups were warned for their pace, which they felt was inconsistent with the handling of play in earlier rounds that ran significantly over time. DeChambeau called the pace in the first two rounds "out of control" and advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player. Stenson described the sudden focus on minor time overages as feeling "a bit inconsistent."</p>
