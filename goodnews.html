          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of cooling down, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% and the number of workers on payrolls falling in the first few months of the year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Job vacancies have also declined, indicating a potential impact from April's increase in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage. Wage growth has slowed but remains relatively strong, leading the Bank of England to remain cautious about future interest rate cuts. This article highlights the balancing act the Bank faces between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential of public transport to replace cars in cities, aiming for cleaner air and reduced congestion. While some cities have implemented free public transport with mixed results, behavioral science suggests that psychological factors, such as the desire for safety and comfort, influence travel choices. Strategies like prioritizing buses, improving information, and redesigning cities to favor public transport are discussed as ways to encourage people to switch from cars to public transport.
