          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has revised its COVID-19 vaccine guidelines, narrowing eligibility for the latest shots. Previously available to nearly everyone aged 6 months and older, the updated vaccines are now restricted to individuals at higher risk of severe complications, specifically those aged 65 and over or with underlying health issues. This change marks a significant shift from the broad accessibility that characterized earlier vaccination campaigns during the pandemic. NPR is currently soliciting public questions to be addressed by a medical expert to clarify the implications of this new policy.</p>

          <p>Shares of the "buy now, pay later" company Affirm surged by 10% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company posted earnings of 20 cents per share and revenue of $876 million, a 33% increase from the previous year, signaling robust consumer spending and transaction frequency. CEO Max Levchin expressed confidence in the company's performance and its ability to manage loan repayments effectively. Despite losing Walmart as a partner, Affirm's growth was bolstered by strong partnerships with Amazon and Shopify, as well as significant expansion of its Affirm Card usage.

          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares climbed nearly 13% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter, driven by accelerated growth in its cloud computing unit. Revenue for the cloud division grew 26% year-over-year, largely fueled by strong demand for artificial intelligence products, which have seen triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While overall company revenue slightly missed forecasts, investors responded positively to the cloud division's performance and the continued recovery of its e-commerce business. The company is strategically balancing heavy investment in AI and instant commerce with maintaining growth in a competitive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An administrative law judge has ruled that a homeowner, whose house was destroyed in a fire, can investigate State Farm's claims-handling practices as part of the insurer's rate increase hearing. The decision is a victory for policyholders who have criticized the company's response to recent firestorms, alleging payment delays and underpayments. State Farm is seeking an 11% rate hike on top of a 17% emergency increase granted in May. This ruling connects the insurer's service quality directly to its rate-setting process, a move supported by consumer advocacy groups who argue against rate increases until claim disputes are resolved.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has accepted a bid from Spanish club Real Betis for the permanent transfer of Brazilian winger Antony. The 25-year-old, who had a successful loan spell with Betis last season, has been given permission to travel for his medical examination. Antony was one of several players training separately from the main squad, signaling the club's intent to move him this summer. The transfer marks the end of a disappointing tenure at United for the player, who was the club's second-most expensive signing at £81.3 million but struggled to perform consistently in the Premier League.</p>

          <p>Seattle police have arrested a 29-year-old man in connection with the robbery of rapper Macklemore's home in June. The suspect was apprehended after an investigation into a series of high-profile burglaries targeting celebrities led law enforcement to a jewelry store where stolen items were found. During the home invasion, two men entered the residence through an unlocked door and used bear spray on the rapper's nanny before stealing thousands of dollars worth of personal items. The arrest was the result of a collaborative effort between multiple law enforcement agencies in the Seattle area.</p>

Her campaign has already secured endorsements from prominent Democrats, including Mayor Karen Bass and five current members of Congress.

          <p>A Texas man has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring 56 years after he lost it in the waters off Long Island, New York. Al DiStefano, 77, dropped the ring from a dock in 1969 and assumed it was gone forever. This summer, an electrician named David Orlowski discovered it with a metal detector and, after seeing the engravings, decided to track down its owner rather than sell it. With the help of a Fordham alumni Facebook page, Orlowski successfully located DiStefano and mailed the ring back, providing a heartwarming conclusion to a decades-long story.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market experienced a slight downturn on Friday, causing the S&P 500 to end a four-week winning streak, but the index still closed out August with a gain of roughly 2%. The week's decline was partly driven by profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a drop in Nvidia's stock, which fell despite a strong earnings report. The market also digested the latest PCE inflation data, which showed persistent price pressures but did not derail expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. Overall, August was a positive month for equities, extending a period of gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have unveiled a clearer picture of one of the "strangest" dinosaurs ever found, an ancient ankylosaur named Spicomellus that lived 165 million years ago. Based on newly discovered fossils from Morocco, the herbivorous dinosaur had long, bony spikes fused directly onto its rib bones, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate. This "punk rocker" dinosaur also possessed a tail weapon, making its armor far more elaborate than previously expected for such an early ankylosaur. The discovery is so unusual that it may force scientists to reassess their theories about the evolution of this tank-like group of dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, won a decisive reelection victory four years after white officials allegedly locked him out of town hall and refused to recognize his 2020 win. Braxton won with 66 votes to his opponent's 26 in the town's first mayoral election since at least the 1960s, which was held as part of a federal lawsuit settlement. For decades, the town's leadership was passed down by appointment, resulting in a white government in a majority-Black town. Braxton's victory is seen as a restoration of democratic governance and a significant moment for the small community.</p>

          <p>After a decade of focusing on original music and smaller, more intimate tours, "Weird Al" Yankovic is returning to his signature large-scale productions featuring costumes, props, and his famous song parodies. Yankovic explains he took a break from parodies partly because the decline of a pop "monoculture" made hit songs less obvious targets, and he wanted to prove his versatility with original pastiches. Now, with his "Bigger & Weirder" tour, he has re-embraced the full spectacle, expanding his band to replicate the layered sounds of the songs he satirizes. He says the break "cleansed the palate" and has renewed his enthusiasm for the elaborate shows his fans expect.</p>
