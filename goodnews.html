          <h2>Wild Chimpanzees Consume Moderate Amounts of Alcohol Daily Through Fermented Fruit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:56:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume alcohol through their diet of ripe, fermented fruit. Scientists from UC Berkeley found that the ethanol intake from pounds of figs and plums eaten daily is equivalent to about two cocktails for a human. This steady, low-dose exposure supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in primate fruit-eating habits. The study provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in fruits that are a routine part of a wild chimpanzee's diet.</p>

The committee also called for new national minimum standards for Send support in schools, increased teacher training, and more funding to make the system sustainable.

          <p>Liverpool defeated Atletico Madrid 3-2 in a dramatic Champions League match at Anfield, thanks to a stoppage-time winner from Virgil van Dijk. The home side initially took a 2-0 lead before Atletico fought back to equalize, continuing a trend of Liverpool giving up two-goal advantages this season. The game also marked the debut of Liverpool's record £125m signing, Alexander Isak, who showed promising signs before being substituted. The victory gives Liverpool a strong start to their European campaign, though manager Arne Slot expressed a desire for less dramatic wins.</p>

          <p>During his second state visit to the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump praised the "special relationship" between the two nations at a lavish banquet hosted by King Charles at Windsor Castle. The visit featured extensive British pageantry, which Trump appeared to enjoy, calling the invitation one of the highest honors of his life. However, the event was contrasted by protests in London, where thousands marched against the visit. The trip is seen as an opportunity for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to deepen economic ties and secure investments from the U.S.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:09:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to hold its key interest rate at 4% during its upcoming meeting on Thursday. This follows a rate cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to a two-year low. Analysts believe that with UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the official 2% target, policymakers are unlikely to risk another cut at this time. The decision is being closely watched as it impacts borrowing costs, mortgage rates, and savings returns across the UK economy, with many anticipating no further cuts this year.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent 0.25% interest rate cut, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors against making drastic portfolio changes based on the decision alone. He argued that the move was widely expected and does not fundamentally alter major market themes, such as the strength of the technology and banking sectors. Cramer suggested the mixed market reaction was due to some investors hoping for a more significant cut and that the Fed is prudently navigating a difficult position between inflation and a weakening labor market. He characterized Fed Chair Jerome Powell's approach as "steady as she goes." (not investment advice)</p>

Borg described the diagnosis as psychologically difficult but maintains a fighting spirit, undergoing tests every six months.

          <p>Hong Kong's de facto central bank has cut its base interest rate for the first time in 2025, mirroring the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent 25-basis-point reduction. The move is intended to lower funding costs for businesses and ease the burden on mortgage holders in the city. The Fed's decision to cut rates was justified by Chairman Jerome Powell as a response to a softening U.S. labor market. Because Hong Kong's currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar, its monetary policy typically follows the actions taken by the Federal Reserve to maintain financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

The Princess of Wales, Catherine, also made a statement in a golden gown by Phillipa Lepley, wearing the historic Lover's Knot Tiara. These sartorial selections are analyzed as deliberate gestures, with choices of British designers like Burberry seen as nods to the host nation.</p>
