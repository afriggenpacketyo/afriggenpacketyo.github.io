        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports growth in May fell short of expectations, primarily due to a significant decrease in shipments to the U.S., with analysts suggesting the impact of the Beijing-Washington trade agreement will be evident in June's data. Specifically, Chinese exports to the U.S. plummeted by 34.5% compared to the previous year, marking the most substantial drop since February 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global trade. While overall exports saw a modest increase of 4.8%, imports declined by 3.4%, attributed to sluggish domestic demand, though shipments to Southeast Asia, the EU, and Africa saw substantial increases.

Polish military officials later reported that the threat of Russian strikes had diminished, leading to the return of Polish and allied warplanes to their normal operations, and they confirmed no violation of Polish airspace.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has proposed an extension to the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, in its waters. The proposal aims to expand the prohibited area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 within the UK's offshore protected areas. This announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France and follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the detrimental effects of bottom trawling on marine life and the seabed. The proposed extension would cover 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas, seeking to safeguard rare marine species and their habitats, with a 12-week consultation period for industry input.</p>
