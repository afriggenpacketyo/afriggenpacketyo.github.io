          <p>DJI has released the Matrice 400, an enterprise drone priced at US$10,000, designed for applications like emergency response and infrastructure inspection. This model features extended flight time of nearly an hour, a payload capacity of up to 6kg, and an obstacle-sensing system using lidar and mmWave radar for nighttime operation. The drone is also built to withstand harsh environments, operating in temperatures from -20 to 50 degrees Celsius, and can take off and land on moving ships, making it suitable for offshore operations such as wind turbine inspections. DJI aims to maintain its lead in the commercial drone market, which is projected to grow to 4.5 million units by 2029. </p>

          <p>Two years after the Kakhovka Dam's destruction, the landscape is undergoing a natural revival, with lush vegetation and diverse wildlife returning to the area. The Dnipro River has reformed vast floodplains resembling the pre-dam era of the 1950s, attracting various species, including sea eagles, hawks, and wild boars. Ecologists have noted a significant increase in plant species and the discovery of fossilized bones from prehistoric animals, but the region faces uncertainty as Ukraine debates rebuilding the hydroelectric power plant. Reconstructing the plant could threaten the newly formed ecosystem, while engineers argue it's essential for regional water supply and energy stability.</p>

          <p>A house-burning demonstration in Anaheim showcased the effectiveness of wildfire defense strategies, offering a potential blueprint for communities rebuilding after devastating fires. The demonstration compared two tiny homes, one built to typical standards and the other employing fire-mitigation techniques. The unprotected home was quickly engulfed in flames, while the fire-protected house remained unscathed due to features like metal gutters, fiber cement siding, enclosed eaves, and a cleared perimeter. The event emphasized the importance of defensible space and fire-resistant materials in protecting homes from wildfires.</p>
