          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 03:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR discussion explores the pervasive issue of smartphone addiction, noting that phone proximity alone can diminish concentration even when the device is silent. The conversation highlights a growing trend among younger users, who are disproportionately affected by phone overuse, to embrace "dumbphones" or older models like the BlackBerry as a less addictive alternative. Experts suggest that overcoming this addiction is less about willpower and more about creating intentional moments of connection away from screens, such as spending time in nature or with friends. This shift reflects a desire for a healthier relationship with technology.</p>

          <p>Scientists are studying a unique group of individuals known as "SuperAgers," who are people aged 80 and older but possess the memory capabilities of those decades younger. Research from Northwestern University's SuperAging Program, summarized in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, is uncovering the secrets behind why their brains seem to resist the typical shrinkage and cognitive slowdown associated with aging. By understanding the biological and lifestyle factors that contribute to this resilience, researchers hope to find new ways to combat dementia and Alzheimer's disease for the broader population.</p>

          <p>The market for space company Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) is showing renewed activity after a recent lull, with several firms like Firefly Aerospace successfully going public. This resurgence marks a shift from the previous trend of using special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) for listings. While the broader IPO market faces uncertainty from geopolitical tensions, space companies are attracting investor interest due to their alignment with national priorities and innovation. Analysts suggest that government contracts and the hype around long-term growth potential are fueling this trend, though competition and reliance on foreign components remain potential vulnerabilities.
