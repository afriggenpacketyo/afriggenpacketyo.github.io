          <p>European defense company stocks experienced a significant rally after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a major shift in his position regarding the war in Ukraine. In a social media post, Trump stated that Ukraine, with NATO support, is in a position to win back all of its territory, and that the U.S. would continue supplying weapons to the alliance. This new rhetoric boosted investor confidence in the sector, with companies like Sweden's Saab and Germany's Hensoldt seeing their share prices climb. The broader European market, however, opened lower, influenced by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments on overvalued U.S. equities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Comedian Jimmy Kimmel returned to his late-night show with an emotional monologue addressing his recent suspension over comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel clarified it was never his intention to make light of the murder and criticized what he termed "anti-American" threats to free speech from figures like FCC Chair Brendan Carr and President Donald Trump. He argued that a leader celebrating people losing their jobs over jokes is dangerous and un-American. Despite his return to the network, many local affiliate stations run by Nexstar and Sinclair declined to air the episode.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million lost to fraud over the past year, aided by a new artificial intelligence tool. A significant portion of the reclaimed money, £186 million, was linked to fraudulent activity during the Covid-19 pandemic, including illegitimate Bounce Back Loans. The AI tool, known as the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, cross-references data across government departments to identify and prevent fraudulent claims. The UK now plans to license this technology to other countries, including the U.S. and Australia, though civil liberties groups have previously raised concerns about government use of AI for fraud detection.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described a visit from a bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives delegation as an "ice-breaking journey," emphasizing that the two nations are partners, not rivals. During the meeting in Beijing, the first of its kind in six years, Wang urged Washington to value the current stabilizing trend in relations and uphold its commitments regarding Taiwan. The visit, led by Democrat Adam Smith, is seen as a crucial step in reopening channels of communication between the two powers. Wang expressed hope that the engagement would help the U.S. to understand China more accurately and handle differences rationally.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced at the United Nations General Assembly that China will not seek "special and differential treatment" reserved for developing countries in future World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. This move is positioned as a gesture of support for multilateralism and free trade, signaling China's role as a responsible major global power. Li emphasized that the pursuit of economic decoupling is harmful to the global economy and that nations should work to build an open world economy. The announcement comes as the WTO's appellate body remains non-functional due to the U.S. blocking new appointments.</p>

          <p>Eve Graham, a 67-year-old woman from the Scottish Highlands, has spoken out about enduring nearly five decades of physical, mental, and financial abuse from her husband. She recounts how his control over their finances left her feeling trapped for years, staying for the sake of their children. Graham found the confidence to report the abuse to the police only after discovering a new hobby in welding and sculpture, which offered a path to financial independence. Her husband was subsequently jailed for two years, and she hopes her story will encourage other victims of domestic abuse to seek help.</p>

He framed the initiative as essential for delivering the future of AI, which requires an unprecedented level of infrastructure. Critics have raised concerns about a potential bubble and a circular financing model among the partner companies involved in the projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The city of Datong in China's Shanxi province successfully avoided disaster during heavy summer rains, a success attributed to a major infrastructure project completed over 15 years ago. Former mayor Geng Yanbo led an initiative to widen the city's main river and reinforce its banks, a move that was controversial at the time due to resident relocations and the area's typically low rainfall. However, this long-term investment proved crucial in managing nearly 20 hours of upstream flood discharges this year. Economists suggest that such infrastructure spending not only builds climate resilience but can also serve as a short-term economic stimulus for the region.</p>

          <p>Australia's national broadcaster, the ABC, has been ordered to pay A$150,000 in penalties for the unlawful dismissal of presenter Antoinette Lattouf. The Federal Court found that the ABC fired Lattouf from a temporary radio hosting role due to her political views after she shared a Human Rights Watch post about the war in Gaza, and following pressure from pro-Israel lobby groups. The judge stated the substantial penalty was necessary to ensure the ABC understood the unacceptability of its actions and to deter it from appeasing lobby groups in the future. The case has sparked a national debate about journalistic independence and support for culturally diverse employees.</p>
