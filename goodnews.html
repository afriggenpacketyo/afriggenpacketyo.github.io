          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues China is Leading the Global Green Transition, Not Disrupting It</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article challenges the notion of a "China Shock 2.0," arguing that China's advancements in green technology are constructive rather than destabilizing. The author posits that while the original "China Shock" involved lost manufacturing jobs in the West, the current wave is about building new industries like electric vehicles and clean energy. The piece highlights that China installed more solar capacity in 2023 than the rest of the world combined, significantly driving down global costs for green technology. It concludes that China is effectively underwriting the world's green transition, a role distinct from simply competing in established markets.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate the Trump administration is considering a list of 11 individuals to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair when his term ends. The list includes previously unmentioned names such as Jefferies' David Zervos and BlackRock's Rick Rieder, alongside figures like Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman and former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard. According to officials, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will conduct interviews to narrow down the candidates before presenting a final list to the president. The extensive list and deliberative process suggest a final decision is not imminent, providing some stability to monetary policy in the interim.</p>

          <p>This article features an interview with Mo Amer, the creator and star of the Netflix comedy series "Mo." The show, a first-of-its-kind Palestinian-American sitcom, draws heavily from Amer's own life, exploring the complexities of the American immigration system and the longing for a connection to his family's homeland. Amer discusses the experience of translating his personal story into a narrative for a broad audience. He also reflects on the responsibility and challenges of becoming a prominent spokesperson for the Palestinian-American community, particularly in the current social and political climate, and how he navigates this role through his comedic work.</p>

          <p>During a dominant performance against the Atlanta Braves, the New York Mets baseball team hit a total of six home runs, leading to an unusual problem at their home stadium, Citi Field. The home run celebration pyrotechnics were used so frequently that the stadium completely ran out of fireworks. A message on the videoboard humorously apologized to fans for the inconvenience caused by the offensive onslaught. The game was also notable for Pete Alonso, who hit two of the home runs, surpassing Darryl Strawberry to become the Mets' all-time franchise leader in home runs with 254.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Total mortgage application volume in the U.S. rose sharply last week, driven by a 23% jump in demand for refinancing. This surge, the strongest since last April, coincided with a decrease in the average contract interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to 6.67%. The Mortgage Bankers Association noted a significant increase in applications for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which rose 25% as their rates became more attractive compared to fixed-rate loans. However, the lower rates had a minimal impact on home purchase applications, which only saw a 1% increase for the week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists from the University of Science and Technology of China has constructed the world's largest array of atoms for quantum computing. According to a paper in Physical Review Letters, they developed an AI-driven system that can arrange over 2,000 rubidium atoms into perfect patterns with unprecedented speed. These atoms serve as qubits, the fundamental units of quantum computers. This achievement overcomes a significant obstacle for atom-based quantum systems, which were previously limited to arrays of just a few hundred qubits, and marks a major advance in the field's experimental feasibility and computational power.</p>

          <h2>Film Review Explores How New Horror Movie 'Weapons' Portrays Unmarried Women as a Threat</h2>

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," directed by Zach Cregger, centers on the mysterious disappearance of 17 children, with suspicion immediately falling on their unmarried schoolteacher, Justine. This article analyzes how the movie taps into a long-standing cultural trope where single, childless women are depicted as unstable, dangerous, and a threat to the social order. The film uses a multi-perspective structure to show how the community projects its fear and grief onto Justine, who becomes a scapegoat. Despite the harassment, she emerges as the film's unlikely hero, determined to uncover the truth, challenging the very stereotypes used to condemn her.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to hold a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and leaders from several NATO countries. This meeting is set to occur just before a high-stakes, in-person summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The virtual conference, convened by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is seen as an effort to ensure European and Ukrainian perspectives are considered ahead of the direct U.S.-Russia talks. European allies have expressed concerns about being sidelined from peace negotiations, fearing that a deal could be struck that favors Moscow at Ukraine's expense.</p>

          <p>Following a landmark antitrust ruling that found Google illegally monopolized the search market, AI startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited offer to buy the Chrome browser for $34.5 billion. The U.S. Department of Justice has proposed that Google be forced to sell off Chrome as a remedy for its anti-competitive practices. Losing Chrome would be a significant blow to Google, as the browser is a critical gateway for data collection that fuels its dominant advertising business. While other companies like OpenAI and Yahoo have expressed interest, Perplexity's formal offer marks a concrete step in the potential restructuring of the tech giant.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Australia have identified a new species of ancient whale that lived 26 million years ago, piecing it together from a well-preserved skull found on Victoria's Surf Coast. Named Janjucetus dullardi, after the local who discovered it, the creature was about the size of a dolphin but was a formidable predator with a mouth full of sharp, slicing teeth. The fossil belongs to the mammalodontids, a group of smaller, distant relatives of modern filter-feeding whales. This discovery provides new insights into early whale evolution and highlights the region as a crucial site for uncovering the history of marine mammals.</p>

          <p>The revival of the animated series "King of the Hill" returns to a suburban Texas that feels both familiar and, in today's climate, somewhat fantastical. This article argues that the show's focus on close-knit neighborly relationships and community support presents an idealistic vision of coexistence that seems increasingly rare. While the characters grapple with modern inconveniences and personal struggles, the show largely sidesteps the deep political and cultural divisions fragmenting many real-world American communities. By doing so, it offers a comforting, if unrealistic, playbook for belonging and mutual responsibility, reaffirming its core message about the value of committing to one's community.</p>

This article reviews the book, exploring what their ordeal reveals about partnership and resilience. Despite their different personalities, their shared mission to survive, and their constant planning for a future sailing trip, created a powerful bond that glued them together.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since the market turmoil caused by the Truss government's mini-budget in September 2022, the average interest rate for a two-year fixed mortgage in the UK has fallen below 5%. Financial data provider Moneyfacts described the drop to 4.99% as a "symbolic turning point" that indicates more aggressive competition among lenders. This development offers some relief to the 1.6 million borrowers whose fixed-rate deals are set to expire this year. However, with inflation forecasts recently revised upward, it is unlikely that the Bank of England's base rate will be cut further, limiting how much lower mortgage rates can go.
