This shift aims to combat the rising complexity of attacks, such as realistic phishing campaigns, and to alleviate burnout in the understaffed cybersecurity industry. Experts see this as a necessary evolution, transforming defense strategies to keep pace with AI-driven threats.</p>

          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," is set in 18th-century England and centers on five mysterious sisters accused of witchcraft after they are rumored to transform into dogs. The story is told from the perspective of outsiders, examining how a community's fear and suspicion can curdle into hatred when faced with perceived transgressions against nature and social norms. The review notes that while the novel engages with familiar themes of persecuted women, its lush, violent prose and satirical take on the fear of women's bodies offer a fresh perspective.</p>

          <p>In 2025, 19 states are implementing temporary sales tax holidays, waiving taxes on specific items like back-to-school supplies and disaster preparedness gear. While politically popular, tax experts suggest these holidays may not be as beneficial as they seem, often benefiting wealthier taxpayers who can time their large purchases. However, many middle- and lower-income families also plan around these events to save on essential spending.

With the help of the local community, the 12-ton oak hull was preserved and researched. Historians identified the vessel as the whaling ship Earl of Chatham, which was formerly the HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy ship built in 1749. The ship had a long history, including service during the American Revolution, before it sank in the North Sea in 1788 with all crew members surviving.</p>

The article argues for the importance of realistic optimism, highlighting positive developments like falling murder rates to provide a more complete and resilient perspective on the world.</p>

A lunar base requires a significant and reliable energy source to function, especially during the 14-day lunar nights, making nuclear power essential. The move is also framed as a matter of national security, aiming to counter a joint Chinese-Russian plan for a more powerful lunar reactor.
