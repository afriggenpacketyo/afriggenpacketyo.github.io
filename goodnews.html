          <p>India's Gen Z is increasingly turning to spirituality, but in a personalized way that often diverges from traditional religious rituals. While interest in organized religion declines globally, many young Indians are embracing spiritual practices, yoga, and meditation as coping mechanisms for mental health and to find solace in a chaotic world. This trend is amplified by social media, where spiritual content is widely accessible, and supported by a government promoting Hindu cultural heritage, leading to a modern, customized approach to faith that prioritizes personal resonance over rigid doctrine.</p>

The rare and poorly understood neurological disorder caused her extreme pain, swelling, and loss of function, making even the lightest touch unbearable. After many failed treatments, she connected with a specialized physical therapist and began a multi-pronged approach involving tailored physical therapy, relaxation exercises, and ketamine infusions, which has significantly improved her quality of life.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially limited President Trump's sweeping asylum ban, ruling that his administration cannot use the proclamation to deport migrants to places where they would face persecution or torture. While the D.C. Circuit panel allowed the administration to continue denying access to the asylum system itself, it affirmed that the U.S. is still bound by laws requiring protection for individuals who meet the higher legal threshold for withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture. The ruling stems from a lawsuit challenging the legality of the president's order.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, upholding a lower court's finding that the operations appeared to be based on unconstitutional factors like race. The Ninth Circuit panel affirmed that federal agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone and cannot base arrests solely on factors like ethnicity, speaking Spanish, or being in a particular location. The ruling is a setback for the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, which has utilized widespread raids and arrests in Southern California.</p>

          <p>Following a stock drop due to Equinix's announced increase in capital expenditures, activist investor Elliott Management has reportedly increased its stake in the data center operator. While short-term investors were spooked by a downgraded forecast for adjusted funds from operations, Elliott, with its deep experience in the data center sector, likely sees long-term value in the company's expansion to meet AI-driven demand. The firm could push for improved market communication, cost structure optimization, and financial engineering to amplify returns, potentially seeking a board seat to guide the strategy.

          <p>Following NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders' recent surgery for bladder cancer, medical experts are explaining the complex neobladder reconstruction procedure he underwent. The surgery involves removing the patient's bladder and creating a new one from a segment of their own small intestine, which is then connected to the kidneys and urethra. While the procedure allows for urination, it requires retraining as the new organ cannot signal the brain when it is full. Sanders has been praised for openly discussing the challenges, including incontinence, to reduce stigma for others.</p>

          <p>In an interview, philosopher Mark C. Taylor argues that humanity's survival depends on moving beyond an individualistic, human-centric worldview that has dominated since Descartes. He contends that our current crises, from climate change to the risks of AI, stem from the illusion that humans are separate from nature. Taylor proposes a new understanding of the self as a node in a vast, interconnected web of information, urging a recognition of relationality and alternative intelligences in the natural world to foster a necessary "love of world" and defy a nihilistic, technology-driven escapism.</p>
