          <p>China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable energy projects, with solar and wind power constituting 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, approximately US$66 billion was invested in Africa's energy sector, with one-fifth of China's overall energy sector investment taking place there. This shift aligns with China's commitment to halt funding new coal-fired power plants overseas, as well as Africa's growing energy demands, with Chinese solar and wind technology exports surging 153% from 2020 to 2024. Africa has become a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As weight-loss medications like Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Wegovy become increasingly popular, many individuals are choosing to keep their use of these drugs a secret, even from close family and friends. This phenomenon is driven by a fear of judgment and the pervasive idea that weight loss should involve hard work and willpower. Some individuals also feel ashamed about being overweight in the first place, leading them to hide their medication use to avoid criticism. The article explores the reasons behind this secrecy, highlighting the societal pressures and stigmas surrounding weight loss and medication use.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that mothers should stop striving for perfection, as being flawed is an essential part of parenting. She contends that a child's caregivers are the template for their future relationships, and relationships are not one-way. Dr. Ross also notes that psychiatrists have historically blamed mothers for their children's problems, which can deter parents from seeking mental health treatment for their teenagers. She encourages mothers to embrace their imperfections and recognize that they are good enough.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo government has initiated the redevelopment of a two-kilometer expressway encircling the Ginza shopping district into an elevated greenway for pedestrians, scheduled for completion by the 2040s. This Tokyo Sky Corridor will replace the Tokyo Expressway, commonly known as the "KK Line," transforming it into an elevated promenade inspired by New York City's High Line. The project aims to create a tourist attraction with trees, flowers, benches, restrooms, rest areas, and event spaces. The project faces challenges, such as summer heat and the structure's ability to withstand the weight of soil and plant life.</p>

          <p>Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego encouraged the Democratic party to return to its roots as a "big tent" party, suggesting the party has become too exclusive. He cited Joe Rogan as an example of someone the party has ostracized. Gallego, who represents a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats, emphasized the need to form alliances with individuals who may not agree with the party on every issue. His remarks have fueled speculation about a potential presidential run in 2028. Gallego also stressed the importance of empathizing with voters on issues impacting them.</p>

          <h2>Yunnan's Role in China's Pursuit of Food Security Through Asean</h2>

          <p>As China seeks to diversify its sources of imported food amidst global uncertainties, its Southeast Asian neighbors are becoming increasingly important suppliers. Yunnan, a southwestern Chinese province bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, plays a key role in regional agricultural cooperation. The province's involvement dates back to the "alternative crop cultivation programme," which aimed to reduce opium production by sharing agricultural technology. With China's rising demand for agricultural products and limited farmland, overseas agricultural investment and cooperation are seen as effective ways to bolster the country's food security.</p>
