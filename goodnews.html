        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of "South Park," are finalizing new agreements with Paramount Global that are among the most lucrative in television history, valued at a minimum of $2 billion. The deals include securing exclusive global streaming rights for Paramount+ and extending their production contract to create at least 50 new episodes through 2030. The negotiations were complex, reportedly involving a pause initiated by Paramount's prospective buyer, Skydance Media, over the high cost. Ultimately, the agreements underscore the immense value of proven hit content in the competitive streaming landscape.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump recently held a private, hour-long meeting with Amazon founder and Blue Origin CEO Jeff Bezos at the White House. While the specific topics of discussion were not disclosed, the meeting occurs amidst a shifting dynamic between the two influential figures, who were often at odds during Trump's first term. In his second term, Trump has spoken more favorably of Bezos. The meeting also comes as Bezos reportedly seeks to strengthen his relationship with the administration, potentially to gain an advantage for his companies, like Blue Origin, in securing government contracts.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has drawn public attention for his choice of attire during a strenuous hike in Arizona. Despite temperatures exceeding 90°F, the 71-year-old was photographed hiking up Camelback Mountain in dark blue jeans, a decision that fellow hikers and social media users found both impressive and perplexing. This is not the first time Kennedy has been noted for exercising in denim. The incident has sparked a lighthearted debate online, contrasting his clothing choice with public health recommendations for staying safe in extreme heat, which his own department promotes.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) is set to name Gita O’Neill, a career city attorney, as its new interim chief executive. Her appointment comes as the agency faces a significant downsizing, with Los Angeles County forming a new department that will take over about 40% of LAHSA's budget and hundreds of its employees. O'Neill will be tasked with guiding the embattled joint city-county authority through this transition. The leadership change follows the departure of the previous CEO and persistent criticism of the agency over poor financial management and contract oversight.</p>

          <p>Venture capital investment in U.S. artificial intelligence startups surged to $104.3 billion in the first half of the year, nearly matching the total for all of 2024. Massive funding rounds for companies like OpenAI and Anthropic drove this boom, with AI attracting almost two-thirds of all U.S. venture funding. However, the exit market tells a different story, with only $36 billion realized through acquisitions and IPOs during the same period. This indicates that while investors are pouring unprecedented capital into the sector, lucrative returns remain comparatively scarce. (not investment advice)</p>
