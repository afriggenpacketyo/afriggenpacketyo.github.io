          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cuts, savers can still achieve significant returns through certificates of deposit (CDs). The article outlines several strategies, such as depositing specific amounts into CDs with varying term lengths to earn approximately $1,000 in interest. For example, a $24,000 deposit in a one-year CD or an $8,200 deposit in a three-year CD can yield this return. With rates expected to fall further, the article suggests that now is an opportune time for savers to lock in current returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia's market capitalization has surpassed $4.5 trillion after its stock reached a new record high, driven by a series of significant AI infrastructure deals. The chipmaker's value has been bolstered by an agreement with OpenAI, which will see Nvidia take a substantial equity stake and build massive data centers. Further cementing its central role in the AI boom, Nvidia shareholder CoreWeave also announced a $14.2 billion deal to supply AI infrastructure to Meta. These developments have led analysts to increase their price targets for the company's stock.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's manager, Eddie Howe, has responded to comments from Bayern Munich's Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who called the club "idiots" for paying a £69 million transfer fee for striker Nick Woltemade. Howe stated that the criticism is "irrelevant" and that transfer fees are determined by market forces, not by the opinions of other clubs. He defended the acquisition, highlighting Woltemade's strong start with two goals in three games and asserting that the player's performance is what truly matters. The manager emphasized that Woltemade appears unaffected by the high price tag.</p>

          <p>A vibrant underground music scene is re-emerging in Russia, providing a platform for anti-war sentiment and political dissent despite the risk of imprisonment. Musicians are performing banned songs in public spaces, echoing the role of rock music during the final years of the Soviet Union. The Kremlin has responded by arresting artists and labeling them as foreign agents, but these repressive measures often backfire by increasing the musicians' popularity. This growing movement offers a source of hope for young Russians disheartened by the ongoing war and domestic repression.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has made two key decisions that are expected to significantly increase the number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available to investors. By approving generic listing standards for spot crypto ETFs, the SEC has streamlined the process for launching funds for cryptocurrencies like Solana and XRP. Additionally, the agency has granted approval for mutual fund companies to offer their portfolios as an ETF share class, opening the door for thousands of new products. These changes will provide investors with more options but also introduce new complexities to the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thrive Global CEO Arianna Huffington is challenging the "collective delusion" that success requires constant overwork, drawing from her own collapse due to exhaustion in 2007. She argues that burnout is not a sign of achievement and emphasizes that scientific evidence shows people are more effective and creative when they prioritize rest and recharging. Huffington advocates for a cultural shift away from celebrating sleep deprivation, particularly for young professionals who fear falling behind. Her company promotes "micro steps"—small, incremental changes—to build healthier habits and achieve sustainable success without sacrificing well-being.</p>

          <p>Modern football tactics are showing increasing similarities to the NFL, particularly in the emphasis on structured, pre-planned set-pieces. This season, the Premier League has seen the highest percentage of goals from set-pieces in a decade, reflecting a shift towards more choreographed plays. Teams like Arsenal are using movements analogous to the NFL's "rub routes" and basketball's "screens" to create space and scoring opportunities from corners and free-kicks. This trend suggests managers are exerting greater control over games by capitalizing on these structured situations, much like their NFL counterparts.</p>

However, the company faces challenges, as its reputation for canceling beloved shows can make viewers hesitant to invest deeply in new series. While some projects generate massive organic followings, the article suggests Netflix has yet to create the consistent, overarching brand identity necessary for true fandom.</p>
