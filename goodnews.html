        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump stated that Israel and Iran have agreed to a "complete and total" ceasefire, potentially leading to lasting peace after escalating aerial attacks. Trump announced the ceasefire would be phased in over 24 hours, but Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi indicated no such agreement was in place. The recent conflict was triggered by an Israeli attack on Iran, followed by retaliatory missile strikes by Tehran, and U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The situation remains fluid, with questions lingering about the true commitment of both sides to a lasting peace. Optimism surrounding this announcement must be measured. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering requiring Google to make changes to its search services to promote greater competition. The CMA's investigation, initiated under a new law, could lead to requirements for "choice" screens for users to access different search providers. The regulator also seeks more transparency and control for publishers regarding how their content appears in search results. Google, which controls over 90% of UK searches, stated the suggestions were "broad and unfocused" but pledged to work constructively with the regulator. The watchdog's final decision is expected in October.</p>

          <p>Global equities experienced minimal gains as investors processed Trump's ceasefire announcement between Iran and Israel, alongside growing weariness of U.S. policymaking. The MSCI World index showed a slight increase, while U.S. futures also edged higher. The market's subdued response suggests a potential desensitization to policy changes and a lack of significant impact from Iran's subdued response to U.S. strikes. Analysts suggest that the market is becoming less reactive to alarming headline moves in tariffs and geopolitical events.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, compounded by U.S. military strikes, may lead to greater disruption for Western airlines compared to their Chinese counterparts on China-Europe routes. Western airlines face the disadvantage of being barred from Russian airspace, while Chinese companies can still utilize it. Flight diversions and cancellations have increased since Israel's military campaign against Iran began, with both Western and Chinese carriers avoiding Iranian skies. This situation may widen the competitive gap that Chinese airlines already have over Western firms.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing the prospect of significantly increasing its defense spending to meet a potential 5% of GDP target set by NATO. The country currently spends around 2% of its GDP on defense, and increasing this to 5% would require additional tens of billions of euros annually. Experts suggest that financing these expenses would likely involve loans, budget cuts, and potential tax increases.

          <p>This article explores how Myanmar plays a critical role in China's rare earth dominance, particularly in heavy rare earth elements. China has become reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar, which accounted for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. The article highlights that Myanmar's production has strengthened China's dominant position, effectively giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain. The report states that China effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar at a terrible cost to the environment and local communities.</p>

          <p>Germany's cabinet is set to approve a draft budget for 2025 that includes record figures, particularly in defense spending. The defense budget is projected to more than double by 2029, reaching ‚Ç¨152.8 billion, driven by security concerns and pressure from the U.S. Net borrowing will also increase significantly, reaching ‚Ç¨81.8 billion in 2025. These increases are made possible by easing Germany's debt brake, which limits government borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, Republican lawmakers praised President Trump's negotiating skills. Democrats, however, have been more reserved in their response, with some questioning the legality of Trump's actions. The article highlights the differing reactions to the ceasefire announcement, with Republicans crediting Trump's leadership and Democrats raising concerns about the lack of congressional approval for military actions. The article states that Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who was pushing to pass a resolution alongside Democrats ahead of this weekend's attacks seeking to require Trump to gain congressional approval before attacking Iran, said that he would not seek to advance the measure any further on account of the ceasefire.</p>
