          <p>Dedicated conservation efforts in China's Shennongjia mountains have led to a remarkable recovery of the endangered golden snub-nosed monkey population, growing from under 500 to over 1,600. Professor Yang Jingyuan, who has spent his entire career studying and protecting the species, has fostered close interactions with the monkeys, even understanding their vocalizations. The initiative involved transforming impoverished local farmers into forest protectors and restoring tree cover from 60% to 96%. This successful environmental recovery story highlights the complex social structures of these unique primates and offers optimism for future conservation endeavors, aiming to surpass 2,000 monkeys within a decade.</p>

          <p>Identity software maker Okta reported strong fiscal second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue growing 13% year-over-year and net income significantly increasing. CEO Todd McKinnon attributed the strong performance to better-than-anticipated economic conditions, despite cautious spending from U.S. government customers following the launch of the Department of Government Efficiency. The company raised its fiscal 2026 forecast, no longer factoring in macroeconomic uncertainty, and noted strong renewals across federal agencies. Okta also announced the acquisition of Axiom Security and emphasized the future need for software to manage AI agent identities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock experienced a significant jump after President Donald Trump publicly weighed in on the company's controversial logo rebranding, which had drawn criticism from some conservatives. Trump suggested the company revert to its old logo, acknowledge customer feedback as "the ultimate Poll," and leverage the "Billion Dollars worth of free publicity" as a "great opportunity." The White House's official X account also posted "Go woke, go broke" with a reimagined Cracker Barrel logo featuring Trump.

          <p>U.S. financial markets showed a surprisingly muted reaction, edging higher on Tuesday, despite President Trump's unprecedented attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her post. Investors appeared to shrug off immediate concerns regarding the central bank's independence, with traders still anticipating a September rate cut with high probability. Cook has firmly denied Trump's authority to fire her, stating she will not resign and will continue her duties, setting the stage for a potential legal challenge. This article details the market's initial response to a significant political challenge to the Fed, highlighting a disconnect between political drama and investor confidence.

          <p>Conservative MP George Freeman will not face a formal parliamentary standards investigation into "cash for questions" allegations, after referring himself over claims he consulted a company he advised on parliamentary questions. The Commissioner for Standards found insufficient grounds for a formal probe, stating that lobbying rules do not prohibit MPs from advocating for sectors or issues of public interest, even with a financial interest, as long as registration and declaration rules are followed. Freeman, a former science minister, expressed delight with the decision, labeling the claims "unfounded."

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed the Trump administration's unprecedented lawsuit against 15 Maryland judges who issued a standing order barring immediate removal of migrants challenging their detentions. U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen ruled that the administration lacked legal standing and that the judges were absolutely immune from the suit, criticizing the "confrontational" approach against a co-equal branch of government. Cullen noted that such a lawsuit by the executive against the judiciary for exercising judicial power is "not ordinary." This article highlights a significant legal setback for the Trump administration and a reaffirmation of the judiciary's independence and separation of powers.</p>
