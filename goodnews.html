          <p>The article discusses the rise of private policing firms in affluent areas of the UK, where families pay substantial fees for patrols and security services.  These firms, staffed by ex-police and military personnel, are seen by some as a necessary supplement to under-resourced public policing, while others criticize them for creating a two-tier system.  Concerns exist about the blurring of lines between private security and public law enforcement, and questions remain about accountability and potential risks.</p>
