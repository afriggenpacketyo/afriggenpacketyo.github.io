        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scammers are creating convincing but fake websites to steal personal and financial information from individuals expecting payouts from class-action settlements, such as those from Facebook and AT&T. This article outlines several red flags to identify these fraudulent sites, including requests for excessive personal data, promises of upfront payout estimates, and the demand for processing fees. To safely handle settlement notices, individuals should verify claims through official sources like the Federal Trade Commission, avoid clicking direct links in emails, and use robust antivirus software for protection. The best defense is a healthy skepticism to ensure a legitimate payout does not result in further financial loss.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has commented on Marcus Rashford's potential, stating there are "no limits" to what the forward can achieve while also cautioning him against future regrets. Rashford is currently on a season-long loan at Barcelona from Manchester United, where he has shown promising form with three goals and five assists. Tuchel emphasized that while Rashford possesses immense talent, including speed and finishing ability, he must consistently perform at a high level to fully realize his capabilities. The manager's remarks serve as both praise and a challenge for the 27-year-old to maximize his career opportunities.</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced its intention to hire 250,000 additional full-time and part-time workers for the upcoming holiday season, maintaining its large-scale seasonal hiring for the third consecutive year. The company stated that these positions will offer an average pay of over $19 per hour, distinct from its regular employee wages. This move comes as the broader retail sector is projected to see its lowest number of seasonal job additions since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The overall decline is attributed to factors like higher business costs and increased reliance on automation by other retailers.</p>

          <p>A significant step towards ending the two-year war in Gaza occurred as Hamas released all living Israeli hostages in exchange for Israel freeing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The US-brokered exchange prompted emotional reunions and celebrations in both Israel and the Palestinian territories. Following the exchange, U.S. President Donald Trump arrived in the region, addressing Israel's parliament and attending a summit in Egypt to discuss the next phases of his peace plan. While the ceasefire and exchange mark a major breakthrough, significant challenges remain in negotiating a lasting peace, including the disarmament of Hamas and the future governance of Gaza.</p>

CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted the need to overcome reliance on unreliable sources for critical products and minerals.

          <p>This news analysis focuses on President Donald Trump's central role in the recent Gaza ceasefire deal, framing his visits to Israel and Egypt as a celebratory victory lap for his administration. The article highlights how Trump has successfully brokered an end to two years of brutal conflict, earning praise from world leaders who gathered in Egypt to mark the occasion. However, it also notes that while the initial phase of hostage and prisoner exchanges is complete, the most difficult parts of the peace plan, such as Hamas's disarmament and Gaza's reconstruction, lie ahead.

The restaurant's distinctive taste comes from specific peppers, like the ají dulce, which are essential to authentic Venezuelan food but difficult to source in the U.S. To solve this, the restaurant partnered with a local Maryland farmer to grow the peppers, ensuring the chefs have the aromatic and flavorful base for their dishes. The goal is to offer a unique cultural and dining experience that reflects the rich history of migrations that have shaped Venezuelan food.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks rebounded on Monday, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all posting significant gains, partially recovering from a sharp plunge on Friday. The market's renewed optimism was fueled by President Trump's more conciliatory tone regarding trade tensions with China over the weekend, which eased investor fears of an escalating tariff war. Friday's downturn had been triggered by the announcement of a new 100% tariff on Chinese imports. Despite the recovery, analysts note that the market remains sensitive to trade policy fluctuations, with attention now turning to the upcoming corporate earnings season. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toyota has introduced a new app called ChargeMinder, designed to encourage more consistent charging habits among drivers of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Using behavioral science and gamification elements like streaks and rewards, the app aims to make smart charging a regular activity. Trials in the U.S. showed the app increased charging rates among plug-in hybrid drivers by 10%. In Japan, it helped shift nearly 60% of charging to daytime hours, aligning with peak renewable energy production. This innovation could help drivers save money on gas, reduce emissions, and better utilize clean energy sources.</p>

This fusion created a new cultural identity for migrants moving to urban centers. The genre was later popularized nationwide by orchestras like Don Medardo y sus Players. The piece also examines the modern phenomenon of tecnocumbia, a mass-market genre that mixes Indigenous rhythms to make them danceable, as exemplified by the popular all-female group Tierra Canela, which holds competitive auditions for new members.</p>
