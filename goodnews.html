          <h2>Experts Warn Against Sleeping with Wet Hair Due to Health and Hygiene Risks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 05:00:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hair stylists and dermatologists are advising against going to bed with wet hair, citing several potential health issues. When wet, hair is more fragile and prone to breakage from friction against a pillowcase, leading to split ends and damage. The damp, warm environment created on the scalp can also promote the growth of fungi and bacteria, potentially causing dandruff, irritation, or even folliculitis. Furthermore, moisture transferred to pillowcases can harbor bacteria that may contribute to skin breakouts like acne or eczema.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit scoring company FICO will begin incorporating data from "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans into some of its credit score models this fall. This change addresses a blind spot for lenders, providing a more complete financial picture of borrowers who increasingly use these popular installment-based payment options. While making timely BNPL payments could help consumers build credit, missed payments could negatively impact their scores. Consumer advocates note that while this provides more data, BNPL services still lack some of the robust consumer protections associated with traditional credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes highlighted the blockchain's growing integration into the institutional finance sector. Major financial players like Robinhood, Deutsche Bank, and BlackRock are increasingly building on Ethereum and its Layer 2 networks to offer tokenized assets, including stocks and funds. This shift is driven by Ethereum's reputation for stability, security, and decentralization, which institutions value for core transactions. Despite market volatility, the focus on utility is cementing Ethereum's role as the essential back-end infrastructure for the future of finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The exposure of a software engineer secretly working for several startups simultaneously has ignited a debate within the tech industry about extreme hustle culture and remote work ethics. The engineer, Soham Parekh, claimed financial necessity drove him to take on multiple full-time roles, a practice known as "overemployment" that has gained traction in recent years. While some in the tech community are divided, experts warn that such behavior, enabled by remote work, could damage trust and lead companies to reconsider flexible work policies. This could negatively impact employees who genuinely benefit from such arrangements.</p>

          <p>China's state-owned company Sinopec has launched a significant floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao, a breakthrough for the renewable energy industry. This project, combined with a similar one launched in May, forms the largest offshore photovoltaic initiative of its kind. The combined stations are expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 14,000 tonnes. The panels' proximity to the ocean surface also enhances their efficiency by taking advantage of the water's cooling effect.</p>

          <p>Japan defeated Wales 24-19 in a grueling rugby match in Kitakyushu, extending Wales' international losing streak to 18 games. The game was played in extremely hot and humid conditions, requiring multiple water breaks and an extended halftime to ensure player safety. Wales led 19-7 at the break but struggled in the second half as Japan, led by captain Michael Leitch, mounted a comeback. A late try by Halatoa Vailea secured the win for Eddie Jones's Japanese side, marking a new low for Welsh rugby as they slip to 14th in world rankings.</p>

          <p>Recent studies are reigniting the debate over whether people from different cultures perceive the world differently. One study found that people from Western, "carpentered" environments tend to see rectangles in an optical illusion, while people from rural Namibia see circles. However, another study challenges this "carpentered world" hypothesis by showing that the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion affects a wide range of subjects, including non-human animals and the congenitally blind. The author, a neuroscientist, suggests that while perceptual diversity exists, it's complex and likely occurs within cultures as much as between them.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, the Seine River in Paris has been officially reopened for public swimming. This milestone is a legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics, which spurred a €1.4 billion project to improve the river's water quality. Three designated swimming zones, complete with lifeguards and facilities, have been established for residents and tourists to use free of charge. Swimming in the Seine was banned in 1923 due to severe pollution, but major infrastructure upgrades have now made it safe enough for recreational use.</p>

The team, once seen as a collection of individuals, is now praised for its intense, collective effort and team-first principles, a change from previous star-focused eras. This new identity was forged after a difficult start to their Champions League campaign, but the coach's consistent vision ultimately paid off. Now facing Bayern Munich, PSG is viewed not just as a favorite for the current tournament but as a team poised for sustained dominance.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by successfully restoring damaged ear tissue in mice. Their research, published in the journal 'Science,' identified a "genetic switch" that, when activated, allows for the complete regeneration of lost tissues, including cartilage. The key was discovering that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative. While human application is still a distant goal, the findings offer hope that similar regenerative pathways might exist in other organs and species.</p>
