        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing via a home equity loan has decreased, making it a more attractive option for homeowners. A typical $75,000 loan now has lower monthly payments compared to earlier in the year, with a 10-year term costing around $923 and a 15-year term about $726. The article suggests that while the costs are lower, homeowners should still carefully compare these fixed-rate loans with variable-rate home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) to determine the best financial product for their specific needs.

          <p>A convention in Atlanta celebrated the latest revision of "The Sacred Harp," a Christian songbook first published in 1844 that uses a unique "shape-note" musical notation. This new edition, the result of seven years of work, includes 113 new songs and features compositions from a younger, more diverse group of singers, including the book's first Latino and Black composers. The tradition, which involves unaccompanied four-part harmony singing, is experiencing a revival, attracting a new generation of participants from various backgrounds and ensuring the vitality of this historic American musical form.</p>

          <p>A new study on Maria Branyas Morera, who lived to be 117, suggests her extreme longevity was due to a combination of unique genetic variants and healthy habits. Researchers at the University of Barcelona found she possessed genes that protected against many disorders, some of which had never been seen before. Her lifestyle, which included not smoking or drinking and a diet rich in fish, olive oil, and daily yogurt, likely also played a crucial role by promoting beneficial gut bacteria and combating chronic inflammation, a key factor in aging and disease.</p>

          <h2>Tropical Storm Humberto May Interact with Nearby System, Potentially Causing Rare Fujiwhara Effect</h2>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto is currently in the Atlantic, and while not projected to make landfall, it could interact with another developing storm system nearby. This interaction could lead to the Fujiwhara effect, a rare meteorological phenomenon where two storms orbit a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths. Meteorologists note that such an outcome is unlikely, and typically the stronger storm absorbs the weaker one; however, the possibility highlights the complex and dynamic nature of storm systems during hurricane season as forecasters monitor both developments.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released new architectural renderings showing more details of the 90,000-square-foot ballroom currently being built in the White House's East Wing. The project, which will have a seated capacity of 650, is being funded by private and corporate donors, who have reportedly pledged nearly $200 million for its construction. Significantly larger than the main White House building, the new ballroom represents a major architectural addition to the executive mansion, with construction already underway on the South Lawn.</p>

          <p>The latest trailer for James Cameron's "Avatar: Fire and Ash" delves into the backstory of the Mangkwan Clan, or "Ash People," a new Na'vi faction set to be adversaries in the upcoming film. Led by Varang, this clan was hardened by a natural disaster that their goddess Eywa did not prevent, leading them to align with the human antagonist Quaritch. The trailer showcases their fiery origins and their subsequent war against other Na'vi clans, framing Varang not as purely evil but as a traumatized leader fighting for her people's survival, adding complexity to the film's central conflict.</p>

This initiative, which began in 2022 and is now over 90% complete, responds to long-standing concerns from flight crews about health risks associated with inhaling leaked engine oil fumes. The problem has been particularly noted on the A320 family of jets, and Delta's proactive engine replacement program aims to ensure the safety and health of both its passengers and employees.</p>

Goodwin believes that while technical skills can be hired, the core value he provides as a leader stems almost entirely from his ability to connect with people and maintain the company's mission.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card debt and interest rates remaining high, many Americans are considering debt relief options. The article advises that waiting for the Federal Reserve's rate cuts to lower credit card APRs is likely an ineffective strategy, as card issuers rarely pass on such savings to consumers. Instead, borrowers are encouraged to explore proactive solutions like debt consolidation, balance transfers, or formal debt management plans. These strategies can provide a more immediate and structured path to reducing high-interest balances, which grow daily and make repayment increasingly difficult. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis of a million-year-old human skull, known as Yunxian 2, found in China suggests that our species, Homo sapiens, and our sister species like Neanderthals may have emerged at least 500,000 years earlier than previously believed. Researchers now think the skull belongs not to Homo erectus, but to an early form of Homo longi, a species at a similar developmental level to early Homo sapiens. If correct, this finding dramatically pushes back the timeline for the evolution of large-brained humans and implies these different human species co-existed for a much longer period.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign off on a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the United States under a new structure designed to address national security concerns. The agreement establishes a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors, including Oracle, which will host U.S. user data and oversee security. A key component involves copying TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm and retraining it to run solely on the data of its American user base, a complex solution intended to comply with a federal law mandating its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, divest from the U.S. business.</p>
