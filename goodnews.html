          <p>Personal finance expert Ric Edelman is calling for improved financial literacy in America, particularly among young investors who are drawn to risky, get-rich-quick schemes. Edelman argues that the lack of personal finance education in high schools leaves young adults unprepared for financial decisions like buying a car or getting a mortgage. He cautions against overly complex financial products and getting financial advice from unreliable sources like TikTok. The article emphasizes the need for credible financial education to help younger generations achieve long-term financial security.</p>

          <p>A family from Ohio found hope through a gene therapy clinical trial after their three children were diagnosed with LAD-1, a rare immune disorder. The trial, led by Dr. Donald Kohn at UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital, involved extracting and modifying the children's stem cells to correct the genetic defect. Five years after participating in the study, the children are thriving and leading normal lives, with the therapy now under review by the FDA for potential approval.</p>

          <p>An order was lifted that had confined some 160,000 people in Spain's northeastern Catalonia region after a fire at an industrial estate caused a toxic cloud of chlorine, the regional government said. The blaze at a swimming pool cleaning products firm started in Vilanova i la Geltru. The fire service said it was "monitoring the blaze... for its toxic levels," and that "no casualties" had been reported.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check: Is Germany's AfD not right-wing extremist?</h2>

          <p>The Alternative for Germany (AfD) has filed a lawsuit against the German domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), which recently labeled the far-right party as "confirmed right-wing extremist." On Thursday, the BfV complied with the AfD's request to follow a so-called "standstill commitment" (Stillhaltezusage). This means that the agency is putting its official reclassification of the AfD as a right-wing extremist party on hold. The article claims that the classification "confirmed right-wing extremist" was not withdrawn.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in space. The spacecraft splashed down in the Indian Ocean. The return of Kosmos-482 serves as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the ambitions of the Soviet Union to explore the solar system, highlighting the enduring legacy of those early space exploration efforts.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's representatives have stated she is being dragged into a legal dispute between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively as a ploy to generate "tabloid clickbait." Swift was summoned to court following allegations that she encouraged Baldoni to accept script re-writes by Lively for the film It Ends With Us. Her representatives deny any involvement in casting, creative decisions, or reviewing edits of the film, dismissing the claims as baseless.</p>
