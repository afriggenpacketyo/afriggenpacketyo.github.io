          <p>Microsoft is laying off 3% of its workforce across all levels, teams, and geographies as part of organizational changes to position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace. Despite reporting better-than-expected financial results, the company is implementing these cuts, which are expected to affect thousands of employees. This move is likely Microsoft's largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023, but is not related to performance, according to a company spokesperson. The cuts come as the company seeks to optimize its operations and adapt to evolving market conditions.</p>

          <p>Bernalillo County sheriff's deputies in New Mexico successfully de-escalated a dangerous situation involving two young boys, ages 7 and 9, who were found holding a loaded handgun in a backyard.

Sheriff John Allen credited the department's drone program for preventing a potentially tragic outcome, noting that the department had been called to the home over 50 times due to domestic violence issues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A $1 million annuity can provide monthly payments ranging from approximately $5,800 to over $10,600, depending on factors such as age, gender, and the specific annuity structure. Immediate annuities start paying income almost right away, while deferred annuities allow the investment to grow before payouts begin. Lifetime-only annuities pay the most but end payments upon death, whereas adding a period certain or joint-life option reduces monthly income. The interest rate environment at the time of purchase also significantly impacts payouts, with higher rates translating to higher monthly income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stadium concerts, while popular, often fall short of delivering a divine experience for fans due to factors like poor views, chaotic VIP sections, and high costs. Gen Z's fear of missing out drives attendance, but these large-scale events often prioritize social media posting over genuine enjoyment of the music. Stadiums, designed primarily for sports, present acoustic challenges and can be physically demanding for concertgoers. The benefits of stadium tours are more evident for the performers, offering increased revenue and a way to assert their status in the industry.</p>

          <p>Homeowners nearing retirement can strategically use their home equity to bolster their retirement savings.
