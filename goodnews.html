          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index achieved a fresh record high, rising over 1% to 49,739.76, while the Topix also hit a new peak, driven by Wall Street gains. Investors are anticipating Sanae Takaichi's likely confirmation as Japan's next prime minister, with the Japan Innovation Party's support. Concurrently, Australian rare earth companies saw significant stock surges following a critical minerals agreement signed between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and US President Donald Trump. This deal aims to counter China's market dominance, boosting companies like Lynas Rare Earths and Iluka Resources.

          <p>The Aukus security pact is a multi-billion dollar trilateral defense agreement between Australia, the UK, and the US, designed to enhance Australia's military capabilities and counter China's growing presence in the Indo-Pacific. Valued at £176bn over 30 years, the deal has two main pillars: providing Australia with nuclear-powered attack submarines and fostering collaboration on advanced military technologies like hypersonic missiles and AI. Initially reviewed by the Trump administration, the deal is now proceeding "full steam ahead." China has condemned the agreement, viewing it as a threat to regional stability and an intensification of the arms race, while Australia sees it as a major upgrade to its defense.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has successfully completed a round of radiation therapy for an aggressive, high-risk prostate cancer that had metastasized to his bones. His daughter, Ashley Biden, shared a video of him ringing a bell at the University of Pennsylvania's Radiation Oncology clinic, symbolizing the conclusion of a treatment phase. This latest medical procedure follows earlier Mohs surgery in September to remove skin cancer lesions. Biden's health had been a prominent concern during the 2024 campaign, ultimately leading to his withdrawal from the election. The article notes that prostate cancer is common, but Biden's aggressive form makes treatment more challenging.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and Australia have formalized a deal aimed at boosting their supply of rare earths and critical minerals, directly challenging China's overwhelming market dominance. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the agreement would support an $8.5 billion pipeline of projects to expand Australia's mining and processing capabilities, including a $1 billion joint investment within six months. This strategic partnership comes as the Trump administration reiterates its "full steam ahead" commitment to the Aukus submarine deal. The initiative seeks to reduce US vulnerability to China's supply restrictions, with specific investments like a gallium refinery in Western Australia.</p>

          <p>St. Johns, Michigan, a city of 8,000, has begun regulating the widespread use of golf carts on its public roads due to safety concerns. With an estimated 2,000 golf carts sharing streets with regular traffic, Mayor Scott Dzurka highlighted the potential for "disastrous" accidents. The new ordinance restricts carts to streets with speed limits of 25 mph or lower, mandates drivers be at least 18 with a valid license, and requires carts to pass inspections for turn signals and horns. This reflects a growing trend across hundreds of US communities grappling with the increasing popularity of golf carts for general transportation rather than just golf.</p>

          <h2>Early Peanut Introduction Prevents Allergies in 60,000 Children, Study Shows</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Pediatrics reveals that approximately 60,000 children have avoided developing peanut allergies thanks to landmark medical advice issued in 2015. This guidance, which recommended introducing peanut products to infants as early as four months, reversed decades of previous medical practice. Researchers analyzed electronic health records and found a more than 27% decline in peanut allergies in children aged 0-3 after the initial 2015 guidance, increasing to over 40% after expanded recommendations in 2017. Despite slow adoption by pediatricians, the findings offer "promising evidence" that early allergen introduction is making a measurable impact on public health.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's repeated calls to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco are creating tension amidst the city's post-pandemic resurgence, largely fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. San Francisco has seen significant improvements in crime rates, with homicides at a 70-year low and car break-ins at a 22-year low. Venture capital funding for AI is surging, with the Bay Area significantly surpassing previous investment peaks. Mayor Daniel Lurie and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who initially supported the idea, now oppose federal troop deployment, emphasizing local law enforcement's success and the city's positive trajectory.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has fully restored its services after a daylong outage significantly impacted numerous major websites and applications globally. The disruption, which began early Monday morning in AWS's US-East-1 region, was attributed to an "operational issue" affecting an internal subsystem responsible for monitoring network load balancers, particularly impacting DynamoDB. Services like Venmo, Snapchat, and various airline operations experienced issues, with some government websites also affected. The incident highlights the world's increasing reliance on a few major cloud providers, demonstrating how a single technical fault can have widespread, cascading effects across the internet's infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A potential tragedy was averted at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport when police arrested Billy Cagle, 49, who allegedly threatened a mass shooting. Cagle's family alerted authorities after he streamed on social media about heading to the airport with a semi-automatic assault rifle. Officers apprehended Cagle unarmed inside the terminal, subsequently locating an AR-15 with 27 rounds in his truck. Police Chief Darin Schierbaum credited the family's alert and inter-agency collaboration for preventing the incident, stating Cagle, a felon with mental health issues, likely intended to use the weapon in the crowded terminal. He faces charges including terroristic threats.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that Apple's recent rally to a record high, which boosted broader markets, underscores why investors should hold the stock rather than trade it. He attributes Apple's success to its "best products," highlighting strong demand for the iPhone 17 lineup and features like improved selfie technology and pricing stability. Cramer criticized investors distracted by negativity, such as Siri concerns or China sales, noting analysts now foresee double-digit growth and a multi-year phone cycle. He also pointed to Apple's ability to monetize its ecosystem, suggesting it could charge AI chatbot developers for iPhone integration, generating substantial margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Panama's Minister of Canal Affairs, Jose Ramon Icaza, indicated that the government is preparing for a potential "orderly transition" of port concessions currently held by CK Hutchison, should the Supreme Court rule against the extension of their contract. CK Hutchison's 25-year concession for Balboa and Cristobal ports was renewed in 2021, but the comptroller general filed suits challenging its constitutionality. Icaza mentioned a plan for the Panama Maritime Authority to take control without disrupting the supply chain, or a mutual agreement with CK Hutchison for a smooth transition.
