          <p>AVZ Minerals has paused its arbitration case against the Democratic Republic of Congo, encouraged by the U.S. government to resolve a dispute over the Manono lithium project. This suspension aligns with U.S. support for KoBold Metals, backed by tech billionaires, to acquire AVZ‚Äôs stake in Manono, with a US$1 billion investment pledge. This move challenges China‚Äôs control over critical minerals in Congo, as Zijin Mining currently controls the northern section after Congo revoked AVZ‚Äôs rights in 2023. Washington's efforts aim to secure critical minerals for the green energy transition, directly countering China's influence in the region.</p>
