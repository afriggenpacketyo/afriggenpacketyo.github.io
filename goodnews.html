          <p>AI scientist De Kai advocates for a shift in perspective regarding artificial intelligence, framing it as an "AI climate change challenge" rather than a US-China competition. In his new book, De Kai argues that AI systems should be "parented" like children, emphasizing the importance of conscientious human behavior around these learning systems. He suggests that since AI learns by absorbing online content, humans need to be mindful of the examples they set. De Kai's approach underscores the ethical responsibility of shaping AI development through positive influence and guidance.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to launch a registration system to encourage people to maintain connections with rural areas facing depopulation, with a goal of attracting over 10 million users in the next decade. This initiative, spearheaded by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, seeks to reverse the trend of over-concentration in major cities like Tokyo. Registered nonresidents would receive information on local events and services, with the government also promoting multi-residency to facilitate the movement of city dwellers to rural areas. Despite these efforts, migration to the Tokyo metropolitan area has accelerated, raising questions about the plan's potential impact.</p>

          <p>An ancient writing system called Sona, originating from the Chokwe, Luchazi, and Luvale people in the borderlands of Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Zambia, is being rediscovered. This system, once used by women to transmit knowledge, involves geometric patterns made in sand, cloth, and on bodies, carrying mathematical principles and messages about nature and community life. The Women's History Museum of Zambia is working to revive this cultural heritage, which was nearly erased by colonialism. The project highlights the importance of reclaiming indigenous knowledge and understanding the role of women in pre-colonial societies.</p>

          <p>The EU is considering changing its laws to standardize sizing for free underseat baggage on EU airlines, aiming to address passenger confusion over varying baggage rules. EU transport ministers proposed that passengers should be guaranteed one free personal item measuring up to 40x30x15cm. The European Consumer Organisation believes the proposals do not go far enough, and legitimise "charging for reasonably sized hand luggage". Consumer experts suggest that a universal approach to hand luggage dimensions would simplify the process for passengers and reduce disputes at airports.</p>

          <p>UK doctors are testing "poo pills" containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors to combat superbug infections. These pills aim to replace drug-resistant bacteria in the gut with a mix of healthy gut bacteria, offering a new approach to tackling antibiotic-resistant infections. Early data suggests that the pills can flush out superbugs from the bowel and improve the diversity of gut bacteria. The trial has shown promising signals that poo pills could help tackle the rising scourge of superbugs, potentially reducing them to a level that doesn't cause problems.</p>
