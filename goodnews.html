          <p>Hong Kong is intensifying its efforts to establish itself as a global data-trading hub, fostering connections with mainland China and Southeast Asia. Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po emphasized that cross-border data sharing is a vital component of an AI-driven economy that will benefit both individuals and businesses. The government's open data portal has over 5,600 data sets and recorded over 60 billion downloads in 2024.

          <p>China's industrial profits rose for the second consecutive month in April, with growth improving despite U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms climbed 3% year-on-year, accelerating from 2.6% in March. This boost is largely attributed to Beijing's efforts to support the private sector, offsetting some negative impacts from the U.S. tariffs. Profits in the high-tech manufacturing industry also saw notable improvement. However, some industries, such as the automobile and apparel sectors, faced headwinds due to price competition and shifting demand (not investment advice).</p>
