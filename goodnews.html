          <p>Donald Trump unveiled a federal program providing $1,000 government-funded investment accounts for American babies, with backing from top business leaders who plan to contribute billions more. The ‚ÄúTrump accounts‚Äù are tax-deferred investment accounts tracking stock market performance for children born between 2025 and 2029. The accounts will be controlled by guardians and allow additional private contributions up to $5,000 annually. The program passed the House as part of a massive budget bill but faces stiffer Senate Republican resistance. (not investment advice)</p>
