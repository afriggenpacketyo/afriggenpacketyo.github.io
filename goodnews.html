          <p>Brazilian police arrested two individuals in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro, which drew approximately 2 million fans to Copacabana Beach. The suspects were allegedly part of a group spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community and aimed to recruit teenagers for attacks. The concert, funded by the city to revitalize the economy, was Lady Gaga's largest show ever, and organizers estimated it would bring in around $106 million. The singer's team stated they were unaware of any specific threats prior to the event.</p>
