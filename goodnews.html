          <h2>Samsung Secures $16.5 Billion Semiconductor Supply Contract Through 2033</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 23:13:30 EDT</div>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has announced a major $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors to an undisclosed client until the end of 2033. The company cited a confidentiality request from the counterparty to protect trade secrets, leading to speculation about the client's identity, with analysts suggesting either Qualcomm or Tesla. This deal provides a significant boost to Samsung's foundry business, which has been working to catch up to competitors like TSMC and secure major orders for its next-generation 2-nanometer chip technology. The news caused Samsung's shares to rise nearly 3% in early trading.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a framework deal on tariffs, averting a broader trade war. The agreement, which sets a 15% US tariff on many EU goods, is being hailed as a significant win for President Trump, as the rate is higher than before but lower than the threatened 30%. While a climbdown for the EU, Brussels secured the lower rate for key exports like pharmaceuticals and cars, avoiding more punitive measures. The deal removes significant economic uncertainty for Europe, which has been facing sluggish growth, and strengthens the US negotiating position in its ongoing trade talks with China.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has successfully shut down four major dark web sites dedicated to the trade of child sexual abuse material, a network that boasted over 120,000 members worldwide. The investigation, dubbed "Operation Grayskull," has led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led or utilized the sophisticated, encrypted platforms. Among those convicted is a man labeled "one of the most significant" purveyors of such material, who received a life sentence. Officials described the operation as one of the most successful of its kind, dismantling entire online communities built around the horrific exploitation of children.</p>

          <p>Authorities in the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen have implemented a new policy mandating leniency for innovators whose state-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The rules state that researchers and companies should not be punished or have their future funding prospects affected if a project fails due to reasonable circumstances, such as unforeseen technical difficulties or market changes. This policy applies to all universities, hospitals, and companies receiving government financial aid for technical innovation. The move is designed to encourage researchers to "boldly explore uncharted territories" and foster a culture that is more tolerant of the risks inherent in groundbreaking research.</p>

The department's bomb squad was called to the scene and used a robot to assess the devices before deeming them safe to transport. The explosives were moved to a secure facility for collection by the U.S. military. This incident occurred less than two weeks after a separate explosion of law enforcement munitions killed three Los Angeles County sheriff’s detectives, heightening awareness and caution around the handling of such materials.</p>

          <p>Leaders across the European Union have responded to the new trade deal with the United States, which sets a 15% tariff on most EU goods. While many expressed that a no-tariff situation would have been preferable, the overall sentiment was one of relief that a more damaging trade war was averted. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called the deal "positive" and said it "ensures stability," while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz noted it preserved Germany's fundamental interests, particularly in the auto industry. The agreement provides clarity and predictability for European businesses, though the higher tariffs will still make trade with the U.S. more expensive.</p>

          <p>An archaeological dig in the village of Keeladi in southern India's Tamil Nadu state has become a source of intense political and historical debate. Excavations have unearthed a 2,500-year-old urban settlement, with some artifacts potentially dating back to 580 BCE. Some archaeologists and regional politicians claim these findings challenge the long-held narrative of Indian civilization spreading from the north to the south, suggesting the ancient Tamil civilization is older and developed independently. The controversy has been fueled by accusations that the national government, led by the BJP, is attempting to suppress the findings to uphold a northern-centric view of history.</p>

The article traces his path from trying stand-up at the Edinburgh Fringe festival to his breakout role on "The Daily Show" and ultimately to his own award-winning program. Oliver's success is attributed to his unique brand of meticulously researched, long-form comedy that tackles complex and often obscure systemic problems.

Investigative journalist Miriam Lewin, herself a survivor of a detention camp, and Italian photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo spent years tracking the Skyvan PA-51 plane, eventually finding it in the United States. By obtaining its flight logs, they were able to provide irrefutable evidence of a specific flight that corresponded to the disappearance of a group of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, leading to the conviction of the pilots.

          <p>Oscar Piastri's victory at the Belgian Grand Prix highlighted the fine margins in the McLaren team's internal championship battle. Piastri secured the win by taking the lead from his pole-sitting teammate Lando Norris on the first lap, capitalizing on the powerful slipstream effect at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit. An analysis of the race reveals that while Piastri drove a flawless race, a few small errors from Norris, including a suboptimal restart and a mistake at the first corner, contributed to his loss of position. The strategic choices on tire compounds also played a key role in the final outcome of the closely contested race.</p>

However, the company is seen as well-positioned to benefit from the reindustrialization of America and has a strong aerospace business.
