          <p>The White House has confirmed that a military parade will be held on June 14 to celebrate the US Army's 250th anniversary, which also happens to be President Donald Trump's 79th birthday. The event, featuring thousands of soldiers, vehicles, and aircraft, will take place on the National Mall in Washington DC. Trump had previously proposed a similar parade during his first term but scrapped it due to cost concerns. Additionally, Trump announced plans to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" and VE Day as "Victory Day for World War II", although it remains unclear if these will become federal holidays.</p>

          <p>Australians are participating in a national election where President Trump's policies are playing a significant role, mirroring trends observed in Canada's recent elections. Opposition leader Peter Dutton's campaign has echoed Trump's messaging, focusing on economic issues, which has proven unpopular among the Australian public. While Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has adopted a moderate stance towards Trump, the president's unpopularity in Australia is expected to impact the election results, potentially leading to a minority government. The close security relationship between Australia and the U.S., formalized through AUKUS, underscores the importance of Canberra demonstrating its commitment to defense spending to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a national election where the high cost of living and a shortage of housing are major issues influencing voters.

Both parties have focused on addressing the rising cost of living, with annual inflation peaking after Labor's election in 2022.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and has permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it. The judge found that the order, which sought to penalize the firm for its representation of certain clients, violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution. The ruling is a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's actions. The case underscores concerns about using government power to suppress dissenting viewpoints.</p>
