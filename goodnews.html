          <p>Charles Rangel, a longtime U.S. congressman from New York City, has died at the age of 94. Rangel, a Korean War veteran, served as a Democratic member of the House of Representatives for 46 years, representing Harlem. He was known as a champion for justice, equity, and opportunity, fighting for affordable housing, urban revitalization, fair tax policies, and equal opportunities for all Americans. Rangel was the first Black chair of the House's influential Ways and Means Committee and played a key role in the creation of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation.</p>

          <p>Physicists are recording rocket launches and landings, particularly those by SpaceX, to better understand the acoustics of spaceflight. With the increasing frequency of rocket launches, noise pollution has become a growing concern for communities near launch sites. Researchers are studying why Falcon 9 boosters generate a three-part sonic boom and how topography affects the spread of sound waves. The ultimate goal is to gather data that could help lessen disruptions and inform the design of quieter rockets for the future, especially with the development of larger and louder rockets like Starship.</p>

          <p>Physicists who record rocket launches and landings, most often by SpaceX, are learning important facts about the acoustics of spaceflight. As SpaceX increases the frequency of rocket launches, the noise is no longer just the roar of the rockets heading upward, but also the sonic booms of rocket boosters returning to Earth. That noise shakes windows and foundations and wakens sleeping people. Rules and limits that were designed for airports and rock concerts may not suffice.</p>

          <p>Former Dodgers utility player Chris Taylor has signed a one-year, major-league minimum contract with the Los Angeles Angels. Taylor will start in center field for the Angels and provide versatility and depth to the team, particularly with outfielder Mike Trout on the injured list. The Angels optioned prospect Kyren Paris to triple-A to make room for Taylor on the roster. Taylor, a career .250 hitter and one-time All-Star, was released by the Dodgers after hitting .200 in 35 at-bats.</p>

          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, became the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard, completing the 62-mile journey over 12 days to raise awareness about the plight of sharks. Pugh aims to change public perceptions and encourage protections for sharks, which he says have been unfairly portrayed as villains. He noted that humans kill around 274,000 sharks globally each day and emphasized the need for drastic measures to protect these essential apex predators. Pugh called the decimation of sharks an "ecocide" and highlighted their importance in maintaining a healthy ocean ecosystem.</p>

          <p>King Charles III arrived in Canada to deliver the Speech from the Throne, which will outline the government's agenda for the new Parliament. Prime Minister Mark Carney said the visit underscores Canada's sovereignty amid U.S. President Trump's talk of annexing its northern neighbor. The visit comes after Trump's meeting with Carney and has been interpreted as a message to the world about Canada's distinct identity. The last time a monarch delivered the throne speech in Canada was in 1977.</p>
