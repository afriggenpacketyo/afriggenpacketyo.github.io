          <p>Amazon's self-driving robotaxi unit, Zoox, has cleared a significant regulatory hurdle, receiving an exemption from some National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requirements. This marks a first for U.S.-built vehicles under an expanded program, and NHTSA is closing its 2023 safety probe into Zoox. The company plans to deploy a commercial ride-hailing service, eyeing Las Vegas as its initial market later this year. This regulatory easing benefits Zoox and other autonomous vehicle developers.</p>

          <p>Four rare Barbary lion cubs have made their public debut at Dvůr Králové Safari Park in the Czech Republic, part of an international program aiming to reintroduce the breed to its native habitat. The Barbary lion, once prevalent in northern Africa, went extinct in the wild by the mid-1960s. While a full reintroduction is a "far distant future," preliminary talks with Moroccan authorities are underway, and a conference is planned. The zoo's licensed breeding program is crucial for maintaining genetic diversity and the species' long-term survival.</p>

          <p>Apple plans to commit an additional $100 billion to U.S. domestic manufacturing over the next four years, increasing its total U.S. investment to $600 billion. This announcement, confirmed by the White House, aims to ease tensions with President Trump, who has pushed for more U.S. production and threatened tariffs. The new manufacturing program seeks to reshore critical components, bolstering America's economic and national security. While analysts note shifting production to the U.S. could take years and raise prices, Apple continues to expand its domestic supply chain.</p>

          <p>Human foot remains found in a hiking shoe on the shores of Fish Lake, Utah, have been identified as belonging to David White, who went missing in 1997.

          <p>The murder of 32-year-old Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig, initially reported as a suicide, was solved by a crucial piece of evidence: a metal ring from a bathroom door lock. Matthew Ecker, the only other person present, claimed Pennig locked herself in the bathroom before shooting herself, and he broke the door open afterward. However, the discovery of the lock piece *underneath* Pennig suggested the door was forced open *before* she was shot, contradicting Ecker's story. Ecker was subsequently charged and convicted of second-degree murder.</p>
