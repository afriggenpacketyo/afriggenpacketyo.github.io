          <p>Erin Smith, widow of D.C. police officer Jeffrey Smith who died by suicide after the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, found relief in a jury's $500,000 verdict against David Walls-Kaufman for assault and battery. Jeffrey Smith was traumatized by the events, leading to his death nine days later. Despite Walls-Kaufman's misdemeanor plea and a presidential pardon, the civil trial found him liable for assaulting the officer. Erin Smith has successfully advocated for a law designating some police suicides as "line of duty" deaths and seeks to have her husband's name added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.</p>

          <p>Monica Sementilli was found guilty of murder and conspiracy in the 2017 stabbing death of her husband, Fabio Sementilli, a prominent beauty executive. Prosecutors argued she orchestrated the murder with her lover, Robert Baker, for financial gain and to be together, presenting evidence of a staged robbery, a secret affair, and suspicious phone activity. Despite Monica's defense claiming she was only guilty of infidelity and Baker's testimony attempting to exonerate her, the jury delivered a guilty verdict. She was sentenced to life in prison without parole and plans to appeal, bringing an end to the nearly eight-year legal saga.</p>

Both blocs anticipate improved market access for over 97% of their exports, aiming to boost bilateral trade and benefit businesses and citizens.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had eight finalists for the National League All-Star Game starting lineup but ultimately fell short of setting a new record, with only three players selected. Shohei Ohtani was already a starter, joined by catcher Will Smith and first baseman Freddie Freeman after fan voting. The team's other five finalists were outvoted, leaving the 1976 Cincinnati Reds' record of five starters intact. Reserve players and pitchers will be determined by player votes and the commissioner's office, with full rosters announced on Sunday.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, under which the U.S. will impose a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports, a significant reduction from the previously threatened 46% levy. Vietnam, in turn, will grant the U.S. "TOTAL ACCESS" to its markets with zero tariffs on American products. The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods trans-shipped through Vietnam, addressing concerns about Chinese products circumventing U.S. tariffs. This deal follows Trump's earlier "reciprocal" tariffs and aims to rebalance trade relationships, with Vietnam having become a major manufacturing hub for several global brands.</p>

He noted President Trump's new trade deal with Vietnam, which lowered previously threatened tariffs, leading to stock jumps for companies like Nike and Williams-Sonoma that manufacture there. Cramer also pointed to the dollar reaching a four-year low, suggesting it benefits consumer packaged goods companies like Procter & Gamble by making their exports more competitive.
