          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant drop of nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress in combating the public health crisis. The CDC reported declines across major drug categories and in most states, attributing the improvement to changes in the illicit drug supply, increased access to treatment, and the use of naloxone. However, public health experts caution that proposed budget cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis, could jeopardize this progress. Representative Dean criticized Health Secretary Kennedy Jr. for the proposed cuts, given his own history of heroin addiction.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause to the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits starting in 2026 due to a $12 billion budget deficit. While emphasizing California's continued support for immigrants, Newsom cited higher-than-expected program costs and economic uncertainty as reasons for the freeze. The plan also includes a $100 monthly premium for adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" on Medi-Cal starting in 2027. Newsom blamed President Trump's tariff policies for the state's financial shortfalls.</p>

          <p>After Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced, their lawyer, Mark J. Geragos, emphasized how the culture and politics of the 1990s were scrutinized during the court review, arguing that under today's mores, the brothers merited a second chance. The defense invoked the era's criminal justice policies, including three-strikes laws and long sentences, to support their argument. Popular culture's treatment of the case, which often mocked the brothers, was also discussed in court. The brothers' case has arguably benefited from the modern media landscape, with Netflix series and social media campaigns fueling new interest and support.</p>
