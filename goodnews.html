          <p>Ncuti Gatwa has left his role as the Doctor in Doctor Who after two series, regenerating into Billie Piper, who previously played companion Rose Tyler. The BBC confirmed Piper's return but kept the circumstances of her reappearance a mystery. Gatwa expressed gratitude for his time on the show, calling it an unforgettable journey. Piper, who starred in the show's revival in 2005, has since gained acclaim for her roles in TV and on stage, solidifying her status as a versatile actress.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie defeated fellow Briton Jacob Fearnley in the French Open third round, in a match disrupted by fireworks outside PSG's stadium.

He acknowledged the difficulty of managing the distractions, stating it was the toughest part for both players. With Jack Draper also advancing, this marks the first time since 1968 that two British men have reached the last 16 at the French Open.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk lashed out at a Fox News reporter in the Oval Office after being questioned about a New York Times report alleging frequent ketamine use. Musk, who was concluding his role with the Trump administration's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), dismissed the Times' reporting as false. He later posted on X that he tried prescription ketamine a few years ago but has not taken it since, contradicting the Times' claims. Musk's role in DOGE reportedly saved $170 billion, although some cuts contained errors, and Musk's relationship with Trump has shown signs of strain recently.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported a much higher number, but later corrected the count with the help of a beekeeper. The public was advised to avoid the area, while over two dozen beekeepers assisted in the rescue efforts. The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen, and most bees are expected to return to their hives.</p>
