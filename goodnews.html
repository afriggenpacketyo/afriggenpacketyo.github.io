          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport after experiencing a maintenance issue with a tire during takeoff. All 173 passengers and six crew members safely deplaned via emergency slides as smoke was seen near the rear of the Boeing 737 MAX 8. The Denver Fire Department extinguished a fire, and while five people were evaluated at the scene, only one person was transported for a minor injury. The incident caused a brief ground stop, but airport operations have since returned to normal.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China are attempting to recreate the Houfeng Didong Yi, a legendary seismoscope invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as an urn with eight dragons that would drop a bronze ball to indicate the direction of a distant earthquake. Despite its historical acclaim, the device's existence has been debated, and it was even removed from Chinese school curricula. The new research effort, supported by modern science, seeks to restore the reputation of this ancient technological marvel.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge is heading to the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. The diagnosis is considered relatively good news, as it avoids a more serious injury that could have required a long-term layoff. Judge, who received a PRP injection, hopes to return in 10 to 14 days, initially as a designated hitter. He first felt the pain during a game on Tuesday after making a strong throw from the outfield.</p>

          <p>The early 2000s reality show "The Osbournes" is remembered for transforming Black Sabbath singer Ozzy Osbourne into a beloved, if unconventional, television father. The MTV series, which ran from 2002 to 2005, pioneered the "reality sitcom" format by focusing on the mundane and chaotic domestic life of a famous family. Before shows like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," "The Osbournes" offered an unprecedented look into celebrity life, blending rock-and-roll excess with relatable family dynamics. It won an Emmy and set the stage for a new genre of television.</p>

Known for his devout faith and integrity, his stand against corruption ultimately cost him his life.

          <p>With the tension of the Euro 2025 final looming, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions fans experience during crucial games. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, can cause an elevated heart rate and a feeling of being on edge. Experts advise fans to manage these effects by getting adequate rest, eating well, and reframing the nervous energy as part of an enjoyable, communal experience. They suggest that physical movement can help dissipate adrenaline, and focusing on being part of a larger collective can provide a sense of pride regardless of the outcome.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the 60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While inland areas of California have faced oppressive heat, the Bay Area has remained locked in a cool, drizzly pattern. Forecasters warn that despite the cool start, hotter weather could still arrive later in the season.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to change licensing rules to protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. The proposed reforms would require developers building near existing venues to incorporate soundproofing measures. The changes also aim to streamline the process for opening new bars in disused shops and encourage more outdoor dining and live performances. This initiative is designed to help struggling town centers and a pub industry that has seen a steady decline in recent years.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a visit to the Maldives aimed at reinforcing ties with the island nation, which has recently pivoted towards China. Maldives' President Mohamed Muizzu, who was elected on a pro-China platform, has since softened his anti-India rhetoric as his country faces economic struggles. During the visit, Modi unveiled a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The diplomatic effort underscores the geopolitical competition between India and China for influence in the strategically important Indian Ocean region.</p>
