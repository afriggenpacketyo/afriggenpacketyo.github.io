          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its market share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's share declined. This shift is largely attributed to the growing momentum of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors and command higher prices. While tariffs and a wider range of price points also contribute to Samsung's gains, analysts anticipate Apple will respond with its own foldable device and a new slimmer iPhone model to reclaim its competitive edge.

          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful steps for building emotional endurance, which is the capacity to manage stress without being overcome by negative feelings. She advises using a visual aid to remind yourself that learning and growth occur in the often-frustrating space between not knowing and knowing. Kennedy also emphasizes the importance of engaging in positive self-talk to reframe internal dialogues and starting with small, manageable experiments to build tolerance for discomfort, which gradually strengthens overall resilience.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level recorded since tracking began in 1939. This decline is mirrored by a sharp drop in underage drinking and a growing public awareness of the health risks associated with even moderate alcohol consumption. While reduced drinking correlates with positive public health outcomes, such as fewer alcohol-related deaths and illnesses, some concern exists that this trend may be linked to a broader decline in social interaction among Americans.</p>

Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and intends to pursue his own legal action, asserting the lawsuit is an attempt to intimidate him for his reporting.</p>

The approach combines targeted social services, such as housing and job training, with the threat of focused law enforcement, representing a significant shift away from the zero-tolerance policing of the past.</p>

However, certified financial planners recommend starting even earlier to fully leverage the power of compound interest.
