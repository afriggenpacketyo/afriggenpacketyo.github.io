          <p>Official data reveals that China's industrial profits saw a second consecutive month of growth in April, increasing by 3% compared to the previous year, an acceleration from March's 2.6% rise, which is attributed to the industrial sector's resilience and ability to withstand shocks, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, with high-tech and equipment manufacturing sectors contributing significantly to this expansion. Despite tariffs and deflationary pressures, the high-tech manufacturing industry experienced a 9% profit increase, boosted by biopharmaceutical products and aircraft manufacturing. However, some sectors, like automobiles and apparel, faced challenges due to price competition and shifting demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study by ACS' Environmental Science & Technology found elevated levels of PFAS, or "forever chemicals," in some US-brewed beers, exceeding EPA limits. The research correlated PFAS concentrations in beer with municipal drinking water sources, revealing that beers brewed in North Carolina, California, and Michigan had higher levels. The team tested 23 beers, finding PFAS in 95% of samples, with perfluorooctanesulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid being the most common chemicals. International beers tested from Holland and Mexico were less likely to have detectable PFAS.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a delay in implementing a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union until July 9, following a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a desire for serious negotiations. Trump initially threatened to impose the tariffs on June 1 due to frustrations with trade negotiations, a move that caused stock market instability. This decision provides additional time for the U.S. and EU to engage in trade talks, with von der Leyen emphasizing the importance of their close trade relationship.</p>
