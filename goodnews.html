          <p>This article profiles the remarkable journey of Indian seam bowler Akash Deep, who recently achieved a five-wicket haul against England. Hailing from a small village in Bihar, Deep overcame significant personal tragedy, including the deaths of his father and brother, which forced him to temporarily abandon cricket to support his family. With the encouragement of a childhood friend, he relocated to Bengal, where his raw talent was eventually recognized. The piece highlights his resilience and determination, culminating in his success in the Indian Premier League and his impactful debut for the national Test team, a performance he dedicated to his sister battling cancer.</p>

          <p>The European Union is launching an ambitious initiative to build a network of AI "gigawatt factories" to close the gap with the U.S. and China in artificial intelligence. The plan involves creating centralized ecosystems that combine immense computing power, data, and talent to develop advanced AI models. With an initial investment of 20 billion euros, the EU aims to establish facilities that can power a new industrial revolution and enhance its technological sovereignty. However, the project faces significant hurdles, including high energy costs, regulatory delays, and the need for substantial private investment to fund the power-intensive infrastructure required for these massive data centers.

          <p>Volunteer crew members for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) are defending their life-saving work in the English Channel amid accusations of acting as a "taxi service" for migrants. The charity emphasizes that its sole mission is to respond to distress calls from the Coastguard and save anyone in peril at sea, without political consideration. Volunteers describe their work as an act of compassion, driven by a desire to help people in their most desperate moments. The RNLI released harrowing images from a 2023 rescue to show the dangerous reality they face, highlighting the profound human impact of their operations on both the rescued and the rescuers.</p>

          <h2>India Overtakes China as Top Smartphone Exporter to the United States</h2>

          <p>India has surpassed China to become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S. market, marking a significant shift in global manufacturing supply chains. In the second quarter, Indian-assembled smartphones accounted for 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from just 13% a year prior, according to research from Canalys. This surge is primarily driven by Apple's strategy to move production away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties and tariffs. While China's share of U.S. smartphone imports fell to 25%, the trend highlights India's growing importance as a global electronics manufacturing hub, a development other major brands are also exploring.

          <p>A survey of British newspaper front pages reveals a focus on several key stories, including President Donald Trump's meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Multiple papers highlight Trump's call for more aid to Gaza to address "real starvation" and his advice for Starmer to cut taxes. Other prominent topics include the fallout from the new EU-US trade deal, which some outlets frame as a humiliation for the EU, and a war of words between NHS bosses and striking junior doctors. The victorious England women's football team, the Lionesses, also feature heavily, with calls for them to receive further national honors after their Euro 2025 win.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on his new South Korean counterpart, Cho Hyun, to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling." The appeal was made during their first official phone call, signaling Beijing's effort to reset relations with Seoul's new administration under President Lee Jae-myung. Ties between the two nations have shown signs of improvement since Lee, who is viewed as more open to China than his predecessor, took office. The ministers agreed to advance their strategic partnership and ensure the upcoming APEC summit in Gyeongju becomes a new turning point in strengthening bilateral cooperation.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has ordered 300,000 H20 chipsets from manufacturer TSMC, signaling a restart of production for the AI processor designed specifically for the Chinese market. This move comes after the Trump administration reversed a ban and allowed sales of the H20 to resume, a chip less powerful than those sold elsewhere but crucial for Nvidia to maintain its foothold in China. The new order, prompted by robust demand from Chinese tech giants, will supplement an existing stockpile of the GPUs. The decision underscores the strategic tightrope Nvidia is walking between complying with U.S. export controls and competing with rivals like Huawei in the lucrative Chinese AI market.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II to discuss the logistics of the operation.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto showcased his ace potential with a masterful performance in a 5-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. The Japanese star pitched seven superb innings, allowing only one run on four hits while striking out nine batters. After a shaky period mid-season, this outing continues a recent revival for Yamamoto, who effectively mixed his pitches to keep the Reds' offense off balance. His dominant start provided a strong foundation for the Dodgers' offense, which broke a 1-1 tie in the fifth inning, and highlights the formidable strength of the team's starting rotation as they head into the later part of the season.</p>

          <p>The United States has reportedly denied a request from Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te for a stopover in New York during a planned trip to South America. While the official reason cited by Taiwan's Presidential Office was the need to focus on typhoon rehabilitation efforts, sources suggest the decision may be a diplomatic maneuver. Some analysts believe that avoiding a high-profile U.S. visit by the Taiwanese leader could help ease tensions with Beijing. This could potentially clear the way for a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump later in the year, a significant event in international relations.</p>

          <p>This political analysis piece examines the recent meeting between UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland, describing it as invaluable but risky for the British leader. The article notes that engaging with Trump's freewheeling, often unpredictable style of diplomacy provides Starmer with crucial face time to build a relationship with a key ally. However, it also presents jeopardy, as Starmer must carefully navigate Trump's public commentary on sensitive topics like Gaza and immigration. The visit is framed as a key test of Starmer's ability to manage the UK-US relationship and align on critical international issues.</p>
