          <p>China has identified 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of the year, a 31% increase from the previous year, bolstering its resource security goals. The discoveries include significant deposits of rubidium and gold, which are crucial for electronics, aerospace, and other high-tech industries. During this period, China's investment in mineral exploration saw a substantial year-on-year increase, particularly for critical elements like tin, tungsten, and copper. The Ministry of Natural Resources stated these efforts are part of a strategic push to strengthen national energy and mineral resource security amid a global race for these materials.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a tentative ruling suggesting she will order the Trump administration to stop indiscriminate stops and arrests of individuals based on their appearance in Los Angeles. The lawsuit, filed by civil rights groups, argues that federal agents have been unlawfully targeting brown-skinned people without probable cause, creating terror in immigrant communities. During the hearing, Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong questioned the government's lack of specific evidence to justify the arrests, noting the general nature of their declarations. A final order is expected soon in the case, which has become a significant battle over the administration's mass deportation strategy.</p>

          <p>Firefighters successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the site of the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a major infrastructure project, when a section of the tunnel caved in, trapping 27 workers who were later joined by four colleagues attempting a rescue. All individuals were brought to safety without any visible injuries after being trapped for about an hour. The project has been put on hold, and Cal/OSHA is now investigating the cause of the collapse to ensure future safety.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order that sought to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The ruling came in a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, which argues the order violates the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. This decision follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that limited the use of universal injunctions but still allows them through specific legal channels like class-action suits. The White House has criticized the judge's decision as an unlawful attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court, vowing to fight the ruling.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning NWA 16788, the largest known piece of Martian meteorite on Earth, with an expected price of up to $4 million. The 54-pound rock was likely ejected from Mars by an asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles before landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, constituting only about 0.6% of all meteorites found on our planet. This specific piece represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on Earth, offering a significant dataset for scientists studying the red planet.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole after 46 years in prison. The California Board of Parole Hearings made the decision after hearing testimony from victims and prosecutors. Bianchi, along with his cousin Angelo Buono Jr., was responsible for the sexual assault, torture, and murder of 12 women in the 1970s, terrorizing Los Angeles. Bianchi pleaded guilty and testified against Buono in a plea deal that left open the possibility of parole. He will not be eligible for another parole hearing for ten years.</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science, known for its dinosaur exhibits, made a rare and unexpected discovery: a dinosaur fossil found deep beneath its own parking lot. The hockey-puck-shaped vertebra, believed to be from a small, plant-eating dinosaur from 67.5 million years ago, was found in a core sample drilled over 750 feet deep during a geothermal study. Museum officials described the find as incredibly rare, akin to a "hole in one from the moon," as such discoveries in bore samples are almost unheard of. The fossil is now on display, becoming the museum's deepest and oldest find from the immediate area.</p>

The meeting's agenda was not disclosed, but it comes as Nvidia grapples with U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, particularly to China, which Huang has stated effectively closed off a $50 billion market. President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance on social media, linking it to his tariff policies. The company faces ongoing uncertainty regarding U.S. restrictions on AI technology exports.

          <p>The iconic red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris have begun turning again, 14 months after they were knocked down by high winds in a nighttime accident. The event was celebrated with a performance by 60 can-can dancers in the street and a fireworks display from the cabaret's roof. The original blades collapsed in April 2024 due to a mechanical failure, but no one was injured. While new aluminum sails were installed before the Paris Olympics, delays in acquiring a new electric motor kept them motionless until now, marking the full restoration of a beloved Parisian landmark.</p>

          <p>Political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for effective political slogans after analyzing 20,000 campaign messages from around the world. In his book, he identifies eight key words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, together—that serve as "emotional shortcuts" resonating with voters across different cultures and political leanings. While not a guarantee of success, these words act as powerful building blocks for campaign messaging. The article also notes the trend towards highly targeted, AI-crafted messages, which may eventually replace traditional, broad-appeal slogans in political campaigning.</p>

          <p>Tesla is seeking to expand its Robotaxi service to Phoenix, Arizona, applying for permits to test and deploy its autonomous vehicles in the area. This move follows competitor Waymo, which has operated a driverless service in Phoenix since 2020. Tesla recently began a pilot program for its Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, using human-supervised vehicles, but has faced some issues, including a minor accident and traffic violations captured on social media. The expansion into a new market represents a key step in Tesla's effort to catch up in the autonomous vehicle space, even as it faces regulatory scrutiny.</p>

The incident resulted in injuries to several people, but Harris's injury is reportedly minor, and he is fully expected to be ready for the start of the upcoming NFL season. Harris, a key free-agent acquisition for the Chargers, signed a one-year deal and is anticipated to be a major contributor to the team's running game.

          <p>Despite South Korea having the world's lowest birth rate, its fertility clinics are experiencing a surge in demand, with treatments rising nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022. This boom is attributed to a generational shift where people desire more control over family planning, often delaying childbirth due to social and financial pressures. Consequently, many turn to treatments like IVF when they are older and ready to start families. While the government has increased subsidies for these treatments, the high costs and workplace pressures remain significant barriers for many couples, highlighting a persistent desire for children that is difficult to fulfill.</p>

With 60% of its business now occurring outside the U.S. and minimal exposure to China, the apparel maker can better absorb the effects of the trade policies. Gass mentioned the company is protecting consumers by managing its own costs and leveraging its growing volume with long-standing vendors.
