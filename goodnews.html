          <p>Intel reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue, signaling a recovery in demand for its core x86 processors for PCs, which led to a 6% jump in its stock in extended trading. This marks the first earnings report since the U.S. government became its top shareholder through an $8.9 billion investment negotiated in August. The chipmaker also announced a $5 billion investment from its former rival Nvidia in September, establishing a partnership to integrate Intel's central processors with Nvidia's dominant artificial intelligence graphics processors. The article notes that Intel's foundry division, requiring $100 billion in capital, has yet to secure a major external customer. (not investment advice)</p>

This strategic shift impacts the team tasked with assessing product and feature risks and ensuring adherence to global regulatory requirements, a unit originally established after Meta faced a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission following the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. While the company is implementing more basic automation, rather than bleeding-edge generative AI, it aims to streamline risk management and accelerate innovation while upholding high compliance standards. This development is part of broader organizational restructurings at Meta, which recently included layoffs within its Superintelligence Labs AI unit.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company surpassed Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations but significantly lowered its 2025 guidance, primarily due to the impact of a supplier fire. This incident at an aluminum plant is disrupting the production of its highly profitable large trucks and SUVs, with an estimated cost of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Ford plans to mitigate much of this by increasing manufacturing and adding 1,000 workers to its Michigan and Kentucky plants early next year. Additionally, the automaker anticipates a $1 billion reduction in expected tariff costs following recent changes by the Trump administration. Ford's CEO Jim Farley emphasized that the company's "Ford+ plan" for turnaround and cost-improvement is delivering consistent results, despite these challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold recently experienced a significant 6% drop, its largest single-day decline in over a decade, prompting questions about its investment value. Despite this decline, gold remains above $4,000 per ounce, and experts suggest that this dip presents an affordable entry point for investors considering purchases. The article discusses purchasing gold from major retailers like Costco, noting it offers a flexible and potentially trustworthy path for immediate investment compared to online companies or pawnshops. While gold price dips are generally temporary, historical trends suggest a rebound. Locking in a purchase now could position investors for profit if gold continues its upward trajectory.

          <p>Money Singh, who immigrated to San Francisco from India at 19, transformed from a $6-an-hour cab driver into a successful serial entrepreneur with businesses generating over $2 million annually. After years in the taxi industry, he launched Dandies Barbershop & Beard Stylist and ATCS Platform Solutions, an advertising agency. Despite facing challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced him to close his barbershop for a year and incur significant debt, Singh's resilience, honed from a childhood impacted by conflict, drove him to barber school and business expansion. Now owning three Dandies locations, he plans to launch a third venture, Barber's Network, an app for barbershop appointments.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Rates Dip Near 6%: Key Considerations for Homebuyers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 15:08:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have dropped for two consecutive weeks, with the 30-year average now at 6.19%, nearing the three-year low seen in September. This decline presents a potential opportunity for homebuyers previously sidelined by high rates, but experts advise a judicious approach given elevated home prices in many regions. While further gradual rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are anticipated in the coming months, significant rapid drops are unlikely, and delaying action might mean missing current opportunities. Homebuyers are encouraged to consider acting now to lock in current rates, as future reversals are possible, and less competition may exist compared to the traditionally fierce spring homebuying season, allowing for potential refinancing later if rates drop further.

          <p>Gold prices have experienced sharp swings this week, plunging from over $4,300 to $4,000 per ounce before rebounding, highlighting the metal's volatility in an uncertain market. This fluctuation, driven by factors like Federal Reserve rate cuts and shifting investor appetite for riskier assets, presents opportunities for strategic investors. Three key strategies include trading gold mining stocks or ETFs for leveraged exposure and liquidity, using gold-backed ETFs or futures contracts for precise short-term plays, and buying physical gold on dips for long-term hedging against instability. Flexibility and a strategic approach, such as dollar-cost averaging, are crucial for navigating this dynamic market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quantum computing stocks, including IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum, remained comfortably higher on Thursday despite the Trump administration denying it was "currently" negotiating equity stakes in these companies. Investors maintained optimism, interpreting the term "currently" as implying potential for future talks or different deal structures, such as warrants. Rigetti Computing emphasized the significant national security risks if the U.S. fails to lead in supporting these technological breakthroughs. While a federal stake in quantum firms would represent a different approach compared to the recent Intel bailout, it carries inherent risks as the technology is not yet commercially viable at scale. Moreover, major tech companies like Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon already possess advanced quantum programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Emma Stone delivers a captivating and multifaceted performance in Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film, the paranoid comedy "Bugonia," further solidifying her unique acting prowess. In a stripped-down role, Stone portrays Michelle Fuller, a pharmaceutical CEO held captive by two working-class conspiracy theorist cousins, Teddy and Don, who are convinced she is an alien. The film, an adaptation of a 2003 Korean satire, delves into themes of online brain rot, the human need for purpose, and the growing divide between societal classes. Lanthimos masterfully uses Michelle's corporate-speak to subtly dehumanize her, while the captors' pathetic desperation highlights the stark realities of their marginalized lives. Stone's ability to make Michelle's torment darkly humorous underscores the film's edgy and absurd tone.</p>

          <p>Pediatric psychologists and child development experts offer insightful explanations for common, often confounding, toddler behaviors, reframing them as developmentally appropriate stages of self-discovery and boundary-testing. Behaviors such as saying "NO!" to everything, claiming everything as "mine," or constantly exploring through licking and smashing are explained as crucial for building a child's sense of self and understanding their impact on the world. The article provides practical parent tips for responding strategically to these actions, including modeling calm responses, offering positive choices during transitions, and teaching problem-solving instead of simply stating prohibitions. These expert-backed approaches aim to empower children with manageable pieces of personal power, fostering their development into well-adjusted young adults.</p>

          <p>California will soon allow the hunting of mute swans, classified as a "destructive, non-native" species, with the measure taking effect on January 1. This action, authorized by new state legislation set to expire in 2031, permits anyone with a valid hunting license, as well as landowners and lessees, to kill the invasive waterfowl at any time. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife stated that the mute swan population has significantly grown to 6,900 birds since first being identified in 2007, and they are not protected under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The species is known for its territorial behavior, its interference with other wintering birds, and its consumption of submerged aquatic vegetation, which is limited in California and vital for sensitive native species.</p>

          <p>With mega-cap tech and AI stocks dominating the S&P 500, creating unprecedented portfolio concentration risk, investors are increasingly turning to alternative assets like cash, precious metals, and cryptocurrency as hedges. This shift, noted by strategists, aims to find uncorrelated returns and protection from market volatility, moving away from traditional advice like "never bet against America" when the market is so concentrated. Gold has seen significant inflows, hitting record highs this month, while regulated Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are legitimizing digital assets as portfolio tools. This trend suggests a new normal for diversification, with allocations to these assets, though currently small, steadily growing. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump stated on Truth Social that Lurie was making "substantial progress" on crime and that tech leaders expressed optimism for the city's future. This reversal marks a political win for Mayor Lurie, who has adopted a moderate approach with the Trump administration. Lurie emphasized that while the city welcomes federal partnerships on crime, militarized immigration enforcement would hinder its recovery, citing positive trends in crime rates and business momentum driven by the AI boom.</p>
