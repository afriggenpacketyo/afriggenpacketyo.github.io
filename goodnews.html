          <p>JPMorgan Chase announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street predictions, driven by strong performance in its trading and investment banking divisions. The company reported earnings of $5.24 per share on revenue of $45.68 billion, outperforming LSEG analyst expectations. In the release, CEO Jamie Dimon noted the U.S. economy's resilience but also pointed to significant ongoing risks, including trade uncertainty, geopolitical conditions, and high asset prices. The report comes ahead of earnings announcements from other major banks like Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled plans to encourage people with savings in low-interest accounts to invest in stocks and shares. Under the proposals announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, banks would proactively send investment information to savers, supported by a government advertising campaign. The initiative is part of the "Leeds Reforms" aimed at boosting the UK's financial services sector and stimulating economic growth. While the goal is to help savers achieve better returns, concerns have been raised about potential risks for inexperienced investors and the possibility of increased fraud.

          <p>Renowned performance artist Marina Abramović has been named one of the laureates of the 2025 Praemium Imperiale, an esteemed international award presented by the Japan Art Association, often called the "Nobel Prize of the Arts." Born in Serbia, Abramović is celebrated for her pioneering and often provocative work that tests her own physical and psychological limits, such as her famous 2010 performance "The Artist is Present." The article highlights key moments from her five-decade career, from her early radical performances to her more recent focus on asceticism and teaching. The prize recognizes her significant contributions to the world of art.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025, maintaining a pace that aligns with the government's annual target of approximately 5%. This growth was supported by government stimulus measures and a temporary pause in trade escalations with the United States, which allowed for a surge in exports. However, analysts express caution about the sustainability of this growth, pointing to underlying weaknesses such as low consumer confidence and a persistent crisis in the property sector. The report highlights the ongoing economic challenges as trade tensions with the U.S. continue to simmer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, opening its first showroom in Mumbai and launching its Model Y electric SUV at a price of approximately $69,770. This price is significantly higher than in other markets, largely due to India's steep import tariffs and luxury taxes on electric vehicles. Analysts suggest this high price point positions Tesla in the premium segment, competing with brands like BMW rather than mass-market EV manufacturers. Experts believe this initial launch is a strategic move for Tesla to "test the waters" in the world's third-largest auto market before committing to local manufacturing.</p>

          <p>In an effort to encourage marriage and address declining birth rates, authorities in China's Hubei province have increased the duration of paid marriage leave from three to fifteen days. This policy is the latest in a series of incentives introduced by local governments across the country to create a more "family-friendly society." The move comes as China faces a significant demographic challenge, with marriage registrations hitting a record low and the population shrinking. Despite these efforts, many young people still view the high cost of weddings and living as major deterrents to getting married.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh, known as "Big Dumper," has won the MLB All-Star Home Run Derby, becoming the first catcher and first switch-hitter to ever claim the title. Raleigh defeated Tampa Bay's Junior Caminero in the final round with a score of 18-15. He had entered the All-Star break as the major league leader in home runs. One of the night's highlights was a 513-foot drive by Pittsburgh's Oneil Cruz, the longest of the event.

The new framework will not impose the strict age limits proposed by the previous government, instead outlining topics for primary and secondary levels. The changes, which also emphasize parental engagement, aim to address the challenges posed by online culture and promote respectful relationships.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old boy from Minnesota has survived a freak accident in which an arrow penetrated his brain after he slipped and fell on an icy driveway. The boy, Gus Deterding, was carrying a youth bow and arrow when he fell, with the arrow entering his head near his nose and coming within an inch of exiting the back of his skull. Despite the severity of the injury revealed by scans, Gus pulled the arrow out himself and showed minimal symptoms. Doctors at Children's Minnesota hospital expressed astonishment at his survival and recovery, with his family and medical staff calling it a miracle.</p>

His selection is a reward for outstanding domestic form, having been named the Professional Cricketers' Association player of the year for the last two seasons. The call-up is an unexpected opportunity for Dawson, who told reporters earlier this year that he believed his international career was over. England currently leads the five-match series 2-1.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a new grant scheme offering discounts of up to £3,750 to encourage drivers to switch to electric vehicles (EVs). The grants, funded by a £650 million program, will apply to eligible zero-emission cars costing up to £37,000. This initiative is part of the government's plan to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. While the auto industry has welcomed the move, some argue that the primary barrier to EV adoption is not cost, but the insufficient number of public charging points, with only 82,000 currently available nationwide.</p>
