          <p>As Japan approaches a period with no giant pandas for the first time in over half a century, China's "panda diplomacy" is receiving renewed attention. Amidst escalating tensions between China and the United States, experts suggest that Beijing may use panda loans to improve relations with Tokyo. Since 1972, pandas have served as symbols of friendship between the two nations, bringing economic benefits to Japan as tourist attractions. However, with historical and territorial disputes ongoing, the impact of panda diplomacy on Japanese public opinion remains uncertain, and a new loan may signal a friendly attitude towards Beijing.</p>

          <p>Researchers are advocating for increased standards and testing of AI models to address the growing number of harmful responses, such as hate speech and copyright infringements. The lack of regulations and insufficient testing are compounding the emergence of these undesirable behaviors in AI systems. Experts suggest red teaming, a practice common in cybersecurity, to uncover potential harm in AI systems. They also recommend adopting standardized 'AI flaw' reports and incentives to disseminate information on these flaws, drawing from successful practices in software security.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, suggests avoiding threats, bribes, and harsh consequences. Instead, parents should use language that encourages children to cooperate by respecting their autonomy while maintaining boundaries. The expert recommends replacing phrases like "Because I said so" with explanations, shifting from threats to empowering choices, validating emotions instead of dismissing them, and inviting problem-solving rather than blame. By creating conditions where cooperation feels natural, parents can foster trust, self-regulation, and emotional resilience in their children.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian rights activist recently released from ICE detention, reaffirmed his commitment to Palestinian freedom at a rally in New York. Khalil criticized Columbia University for attempting to suppress pro-Palestine voices and accused the university of funding the killing in Gaza. He stated that he would continue to advocate for Palestinian rights, even in the face of threats. Khalil's release from detention followed a court ruling that deemed his detention unconstitutional, but the Trump administration plans to appeal the decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become a global leader in electric vehicles (EVs) through a combination of long-term planning, government subsidies, and strategic investment. The Chinese government has spent billions developing the EV industry, encouraging companies like BYD and CATL to become major players. This has led to a thriving EV start-up sector, driven by competition and innovation, and a vast public charging network. China's success in EVs is attributed to its capacity to mobilize its economy towards specific goals and its dominance in critical supply chains for battery production.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to establish a clinic by the end of the year that offers ketamine as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for hard-to-treat depression. This move follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine assisted therapy to clients with treatment-resistant depression last summer. Alex, a patient who has experienced periods of depression and anxiety, found that ketamine assisted therapy made her more receptive to psychotherapy. While ketamine is associated with recreational drug use, medical professionals emphasize that the pure form and low doses used clinically carry much lower risks.</p>

          <p>After Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, scientists feared for the fate of the rhesus macaque monkeys on Cayo Santiago, also known as Monkey Island. Despite losing two-thirds of the island's vegetation, most of the monkeys survived, a mystery that scientists are still trying to solve. Researchers were able to preserve decades of data and biological samples through dedicated staff and backup generators, with luck playing a major role in saving data dating back to the 1930s. The survival of the monkeys and the research highlights the resilience and dedication of those involved.</p>

The story highlights the threats to sperm whales, including noise pollution and ship strikes, and the importance of conservation efforts to protect the vulnerable species. The sanctuary, the first sperm whale reserve in the world, is 300 square miles and has a senior whale officer assigned to ensure the whales' security.</p>

Cooke challenges conventional wisdom about gender roles in the animal kingdom, challenging Charles Darwin's theories and promoting the importance of slow and sustainable living.
