          <h2>Walmart CFO Warns of Potential Price Hikes Due to Tariffs Despite Earnings Beat</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey indicated that consumers may soon see price increases due to tariffs, despite the company's efforts to maintain everyday low prices. The retailer beat quarterly earnings estimates, posting its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business, but acknowledged that the magnitude of tariff increases is too significant for retailers and suppliers to absorb. While Walmart expects net sales to increase, it declined to provide specific earnings guidance due to fluctuating U.S. tariff policy, but it is unlikely they will be able to absorb all of the costs. </p>

          <h2>UK Economy Shows Unexpected Resilience, Challenging Predictions of Downturn</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy has demonstrated surprising resilience, exceeding expectations with a growth rate of 0.7% in the first three months of the year, according to an article by Faisal Islam. This performance challenges earlier predictions of a recession, though millions of families and small businesses still face cost-of-living pressures. The impact of potential interest rate cuts and relative political stability may be more significant than initially thought, with real incomes rising and businesses accommodating increased National Insurance contributions through profit margin adjustments. While a slowdown is anticipated in the current quarter, the initial growth figures have shifted the perception of the UK economy. </p>

          <p>During a speech in Saudi Arabia, President Trump denounced Western intervention and nation-building, eliciting applause from the audience. He criticized past American policies in the Middle East, particularly the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, and urged the region to chart its own course. Trump expressed a desire for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and to reach a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, and he met with the new leader of Syria, Ahmed al-Shara, a former jihadist. The remarks sparked varied reactions, with some viewing it as a positive shift away from interventionism and others expressing concern about the potential impact on human rights. </p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods announced its plan to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, a move driven by concerns over tariffs and the desire to expand its market presence, according to the article. The deal would create a global platform with enhanced store designs and omnichannel experiences, while also providing Dick's with its first international foothold. Foot Locker shareholders will have the option to receive cash or Dick's common stock, but the acquisition raises concerns about anti-competition and the potential impact on financial results. The transaction still needs approval from Foot Locker shareholders. </p>

Frimpong's arrival could help offset the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who is expected to join Real Madrid. Frimpong played a key role in Leverkusen's Bundesliga title win this season. </p>

ReturnPro handles 259 categories of goods returned to retailers, which may have otherwise sold the products to liquidators for pennies on the dollar or sent them to a landfill at a loss. </p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves asserted that the UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" following a stronger-than-expected growth rate of 0.7% in the first quarter of the year. The growth was fueled by increased consumer spending and business investment, but analysts caution that this rate is unlikely to persist due to upcoming US tariffs and increased domestic business taxes. While Reeves acknowledged the ongoing cost of living crisis, she emphasized that the numbers indicate progress, though Conservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride said it was "a bit premature to be popping the champagne corks". </p>

However, the article warns against dramatic key changes and novelty acts, noting that those gimmicks are unlikely to resonate with modern audiences.
