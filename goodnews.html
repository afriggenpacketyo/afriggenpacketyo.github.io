          <p>Skin and hair specialists advise against going to bed with wet hair, warning that the practice can lead to significant scalp and skin problems. When hair is wet, it becomes more fragile and susceptible to breakage from friction against a pillowcase. The damp, warm environment created on the scalp is an ideal breeding ground for fungi and bacteria, potentially causing dandruff, irritation, or folliculitis, while also transferring microbes to pillowcases, which can contribute to facial acne.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant milestone in renewable energy by launching a large-scale floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao. The project, developed by state-owned Sinopec, is part of a broader initiative that constitutes the company's largest offshore photovoltaic project. Spanning approximately 60,000 square meters, the new station is expected to help generate a combined 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which will significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 14,000 tonnes.</p>

          <p>Following recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for the negotiation of a new international agreement to address the Iranian nuclear issue. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating regional tensions and the risk of a "nuclear disaster." He urged that Iran's nuclear activities be placed under the strict supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This move positions China as a key mediator seeking a diplomatic resolution.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the return of champion eater Joey Chestnut to the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, using the event as a lens to examine American culture. The author describes the contest as an honest, if grotesque, spectacle that embodies themes of will, passion, and a uniquely American form of excess. While acknowledging the disturbing nature of the competition, the article argues it serves as a satirical mirror to a society obsessed with consumption, turning a simple hotdog into a "klaxon of decay and excess."</p>

          <p>The long-standing debate over whether culture influences how people see the world is explored through two recent studies with conflicting findings on visual illusions. One study suggests people from "carpentered" Western environments perceive illusions differently than those from rural Namibian communities, supporting the idea that our surroundings shape perception. However, another study compellingly refutes this hypothesis for the famous Müller-Lyer illusion, showing it affects animals and even the congenitally blind. The article concludes that perception is a complex brain construction, highlighting the need for more research into both inter- and intra-cultural perceptual diversity.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has reopened sections of the Seine River to public swimmers, a legacy project of the Paris 2024 Olympics. The ban, instated in 1923 due to pollution, was lifted after a €1.4 billion cleanup effort improved water quality enough to host Olympic swimming events. Three supervised swimming zones have been established with amenities like changing rooms and lifeguards, allowing residents and tourists to cool off in the iconic river amid a European heatwave, fulfilling a long-held civic ambition.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have made a potential breakthrough in regenerative medicine by identifying a "genetic switch" that restored damaged ear tissue in mice. The study, published in *Science*, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in development. By reactivating a disabled genetic pathway, the scientists were able to achieve complete restoration of lost cartilage and tissue. This discovery offers hope that similar regenerative mechanisms might be present in other organs and could one day be applied to humans.</p>
