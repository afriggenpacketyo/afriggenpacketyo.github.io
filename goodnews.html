          <p>Arsenal's Bukayo Saka has been recalled to the England national football team for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia after recovering from a hamstring injury. His inclusion comes as other prominent players, including Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, and Jack Grealish, were not selected for the squad. The team is preparing for a friendly match and a crucial World Cup qualifier, where a victory would move them closer to securing a spot in the next tournament. The roster also sees changes in defense due to injuries, with Jarell Quansah replacing Tino Livramento.</p>

          <p>United States Men's National Team coach Mauricio Pochettino has explained his unconventional philosophy of not telling players why they have been left off the roster. He believes that players should intuitively understand the reasons for their inclusion or exclusion based on their performance, arguing that providing justifications is unnecessary. This approach comes as he announced the squad for upcoming friendlies, which saw the return of several players like Weston McKennie while omitting others who have been in good form. Pochettino emphasized that no player has a guaranteed spot and that he is building a competitive culture ahead of the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>An opinion article reflects on the evolution of passenger trains, contrasting the historic 24 km/h steam engine with modern high-speed rail, particularly China's extensive network. The author notes that what was once a 15-hour train journey from Beijing to Xian now takes only four hours, showcasing a remarkable transformation. The piece argues that while rail travel was long overshadowed by shipping and air travel, China's investment in high-speed rail has created a revolutionary system. This development serves as an inspiration for how efficient, modern railway infrastructure can reshape transportation and connectivity globally.</p>

          <p>On the 35th anniversary of German Unity Day, a new report highlights the enduring disparities between the former East and West Germany. Elisabeth Kaiser, the federal commissioner for eastern Germany, notes that while a new generation has grown up in a unified country, significant differences remain, particularly in rural eastern regions. These areas face lower incomes, less inherited wealth, and an older population compared to the west, which shapes the identity and opportunities of young eastern Germans. Despite economic growth and progress in areas like renewable energy, the report suggests these structural gaps will be difficult to close.</p>
