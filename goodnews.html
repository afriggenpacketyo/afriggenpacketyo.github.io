          <p>A significant fire erupted at a Chevron oil refinery in El Segundo, California, one of the largest on the U.S. West Coast. The blaze, which followed reports of an explosion, prompted an active response from Chevron's fire department and local emergency services. The company confirmed that all personnel and contractors were accounted for, with no injuries sustained. Officials have not issued any evacuation orders for nearby residents, and air quality monitoring systems have not detected any dangerous emissions.</p>

          <p>U.S. Men's National Team manager Mauricio Pochettino has defended his unconventional approach of not explaining to players why they were left off the roster. He argues that players should intrinsically understand their performance and that providing justifications can be counterproductive. This philosophy is part of his effort to change the team's culture, ensuring no player feels entitled to a spot on the World Cup squad based on past achievements. His recent roster for friendlies against Ecuador and Australia reflects this strategy, with several notable players returning while others were omitted without public explanation.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether the Nobel Prizes, first awarded in 1901, remain relevant in the contemporary scientific landscape. While the prizes successfully popularize major scientific breakthroughs, they face criticism for promoting a "genius scientist" myth that overlooks the collaborative nature of modern research. The piece also highlights the historical lack of diversity, with laureates overwhelmingly being male and from Western institutions. Despite these shortcomings, the Nobels continue to capture public imagination and serve as a significant milestone for recognizing discoveries that have benefited humanity.</p>
