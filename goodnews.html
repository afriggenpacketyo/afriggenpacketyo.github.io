          <p>The United States government has reversed its export restrictions on chip-design software to China, allowing American companies like Synopsys and Cadence to resume business with the country. This move is viewed as a significant step in a broader trade truce between the two economic superpowers. The announcement had an immediate positive impact on the market, causing shares of the affected semiconductor software firms to rise sharply. The decision rescinds a policy from May that required U.S. firms to obtain special licenses for such exports.</p>

The shift comes in the wake of dissatisfaction with Moscow's role following the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war.

          <p>Chinese engineers have successfully developed a record-setting hydropower turbine with a single-unit capacity of 500 megawatts, making it the largest of its kind in the world. The massive component, which took four years to design and test, will be installed at the Datang Zala Hydropower Station in Tibet. Built from highly durable martensitic steel, the turbine is hailed as a significant technological advancement for China's renewable energy sector.

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) is undergoing a remarkable resurgence, positioning the city to potentially lead the world in new listings this year. This boom is primarily fueled by a wave of mainland Chinese companies choosing to raise capital in Hong Kong, encouraged by supportive regulatory policies from Beijing and a slower listing pace on mainland exchanges. In the first half of the year, new listing volumes soared to $14 billion, a dramatic increase that signals a powerful renewal of investor confidence in the region's financial markets.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has issued a ruling that blocks the Trump administration's policy designed to ban migrants who cross the southern border from seeking asylum. In his decision, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss wrote that the president had exceeded his legal authority, asserting that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an alternative immigration system that supersedes laws passed by Congress. The judge has paused his ruling for 14 days to give the administration an opportunity to appeal, in a decision praised by civil liberties organizations as a crucial defense of asylum law.</p>
