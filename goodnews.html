          <p>A Chinese national, Zhimin Qian, has been convicted in London for her central role in the world's largest cryptocurrency seizure, valued at over £5.5 billion ($7.4 billion). Qian pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing bitcoin, stemming from a large-scale scam between 2014 and 2017 that defrauded over 128,000 victims in China. Her conviction follows a complex seven-year international money laundering investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, during which she fled China using false documents and attempted to launder money by buying UK property. This case underscores the significant challenge posed by organized criminals using cryptocurrencies to conceal illicit gains, with authorities now focused on preventing the fraudsters from reclaiming the stolen funds.</p>

          <p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by former US President Donald Trump, following the suspension of his account after the January 6, 2020 Capitol Hill riot. This settlement, which does not constitute an admission of liability, makes YouTube the latest tech firm to resolve legal action with Trump over his social media bans. Of the total, $22 million will fund a construction project at the White House through a non-profit, while $2.5 million will go to pro-Trump organizations. Meta and X (formerly Twitter) previously settled similar lawsuits with the former president for $25 million and $10 million respectively.</p>

          <p>Two mountain lion cubs, found malnourished and alone earlier this year, have been successfully rehabilitated and released back into the San Diego County wilderness. The cubs received specialized care at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center, where human interaction was minimized to encourage natural behaviors. Released on September 18, the animals were intentionally left unnamed to prevent human attachment, a common practice in wildlife rehabilitation. This effort is crucial as wild mountain lion populations in California are significantly lower than previously estimated, facing threats from vehicles, wildfires, and habitat encroachment.</p>

          <p>China's official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered 49.8 in September, indicating a smaller-than-expected contraction and marking its strongest reading since March. While still below the 50-point benchmark that separates growth from contraction, this figure suggests a modest pickup in manufacturing activity. The improvement comes as Beijing intensifies efforts to curb industrial overcapacity amid sluggish domestic demand and global trade disruptions. A private survey, RatingDog's manufacturing PMI, also showed a better picture at 51.2 for September, beating economists' forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tight end Darren Waller delivered a vintage performance, catching two touchdown passes, to help the Miami Dolphins secure their first win of the 2025 season against the New York Jets. Waller, playing his first game for the Dolphins after a year off, showed his former Pro Bowl form, making key plays including a 9-yard score in the third quarter. However, the victory was tempered by a gruesome knee injury sustained by star wide receiver Tyreek Hill, who is feared to have dislocated his knee. The Jets struggled with numerous penalties and turnovers, contributing to their 10th consecutive loss in Miami.</p>

She argues that while brands feature inclusive imagery, their retail practices do not match, causing unnecessary waste and expense for athletes like her.
