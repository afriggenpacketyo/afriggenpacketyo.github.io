          <p>Premier League club Aston Villa is actively exploring a potential deal to sign winger Jadon Sancho from Manchester United. The 25-year-old has been out of favor at United, having spent the last 18 months on loan at Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea. Previous interest from Italian clubs Roma and Juventus did not materialize into a move for the English attacker. Sources indicate that any potential transfer for Sancho would be separate from Manchester United's ongoing interest in Villa's goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology giant Alibaba reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter, largely driven by a 26% year-on-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division. This growth is attributed to robust demand for artificial intelligence services, with AI-related product revenue seeing triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. While overall company revenue slightly missed forecasts, the strong performance of the cloud unit and a revival in its e-commerce business have been positively received by investors. The company continues to invest heavily in competitive areas like instant commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The final stage of England's largest-ever expansion of government-funded childcare support has launched, offering working parents 30 hours of subsidized care per week for children aged nine months to four years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a "landmark moment" that will provide significant financial relief to families. However, the rollout is facing challenges, as parents report long waiting lists and nurseries struggle with staff shortages to meet the surging demand. The sector estimates it needs an additional 35,000 staff members to fully deliver the promised places.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national rail operator, ScotRail, has permanently abolished peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer face higher prices for traveling during busy weekday rush hours. The policy, championed by the Scottish Greens and announced by First Minister John Swinney, aims to make train travel more affordable and encourage commuters to switch from cars to public transport. This move will result in significant savings for passengers, with some key routes like Edinburgh to Glasgow seeing ticket prices reduced by nearly 50 percent following a previous pilot scheme.</p>

          <p>Scientists from Tarim University have discovered brine shrimp, an ancient species dating back 400 million years, in a highly saline water source within the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang. These shrimp, also known as Artemia, are extremely tolerant of salt and are widely used in aquaculture as feed. The discovery suggests that the region has the natural conditions suitable for cultivating salt-tolerant organisms. Researchers will now conduct laboratory studies to determine if it is a new species and explore its potential for commercial aquaculture development.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the history of the American Volunteer Group, famously known as the Flying Tigers, who were American mercenaries hired by China in 1941 to combat the Japanese air force during World War II. Led by Claire Chennault, these pilots, mechanics, and support staff are credited with destroying hundreds of Japanese planes and became heroes in both the U.S. and China. Despite current US-China tensions, their contribution is still highly revered in China, with relatives of the group's founder being among the few American invitees to a recent military parade commemorating the war's end.</p>

The summit, attended by leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin and India's Narendra Modi, is seen as an opportunity for China to position itself as a global peacemaker amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. Xi highlighted China's $84 billion investment in other SCO countries and pledged further support for educational programs, aiming to foster a new phase of high-quality development and regional cooperation.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic has advanced to the quarter-finals of the US Open after a commanding 6-3, 6-3, 6-2 victory over qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff. Despite the dominant performance, questions about the 38-year-old's physical condition persist, as he required medical attention for both his neck and right forearm during the match. This follows earlier signs of fatigue and a lower back issue in previous rounds. Djokovic, who is pursuing a record 25th Grand Slam title, will next face American player Taylor Fritz in the last eight, continuing his historic run in the tournament.</p>

          <p>A new pilot scheme in Wales will offer young people aged 16 to 21 single bus tickets for just £1, with a full day pass costing £3. The program, which will later expand to include children aged five to 15, aims to make public transport more accessible and affordable. Transport Minister Ken Skates expressed hope that the reduced fares will help young people access education, employment, and leisure activities more easily. The initiative is part of a budget deal with the Welsh Liberal Democrats and is supported by £15 million in government funding over two years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey has shown that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, marking its fastest pace of expansion in five months. The RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 50.5, beating estimates and rebounding from a contraction in July, largely due to a recovery in new export orders. However, this optimistic result contrasts with an official government survey that indicated a fifth straight month of contraction. The divergence suggests that while external demand may be resilient, domestic demand within China remains persistently weak. (not investment advice)</p>

Prescott stated that while he didn't initially think a trade would happen, he "wasn't surprised" given how personal the contract negotiations between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones appeared to become. Parsons secured a record-breaking four-year, $188 million deal with the Packers after the trade.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued an order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from deporting hundreds of unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala. The emergency injunction was granted after lawyers argued the children would face risks of abuse and persecution if returned, and that the government was attempting to bypass legal protections afforded to them. The judge's order came as deportation flights were reportedly being prepared in Texas. The administration contended it was repatriating the children for family reunification at the request of the Guatemalan government, a claim disputed by advocates.</p>
