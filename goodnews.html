          <p>Shares of Robinhood surged over 160% this year, hitting a new all-time high before closing slightly lower amid news of potential new industry costs. Despite its strong performance, the online brokerage faces multiple challenges, including a formal investigation by Florida's Attorney General into allegedly deceptive crypto trading cost claims. The company is also facing pushback over a new 25% fee on crypto staking rewards and friction with OpenAI over its tokenized stock offerings in Europe. Nevertheless, many investors remain bullish, partly due to the company's potential role in the government's new 'Trump Accounts' initiative for newborns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Carolina is set to erect a statue of Robert Smalls on its Capitol grounds, marking the first time a Black man has been honored with a monument at the site. Smalls was a remarkable figure who was born into slavery, commandeered a Confederate ship to escape to freedom during the Civil War, and later served as a U.S. Congressman. His statue will join those of several white men, most of whom have connections to the Confederacy or the Jim Crow era. The move represents a significant step in recognizing the contributions of African Americans to the state's history.</p>

          <p>A growing number of single people, particularly in Gen Z, are using artificial intelligence to enhance their dating app experiences, according to a recent study. AI dating assistants like Rizz and Keepler help users craft witty opening lines, suggest replies, and even offer advice on how to handle being "ghosted." These tools aim to boost confidence for those who struggle with writing or need objective advice. While some users find the AI helpful for breaking the ice, experts caution against over-reliance, stressing that AI should supplement, not substitute, genuine human connection and authenticity.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago court. As a leader of the "Los Chapitos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, he admitted to overseeing a massive operation that trafficked staggering amounts of fentanyl into the U.S. As part of his plea deal, Guzman Lopez must forfeit $80 million and provide "substantial assistance" to the government, which could involve testifying against his own brother and other cartel members. His cooperation could lead to a sentence of less than life in prison.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin rallied to a new all-time high, briefly topping $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also supported by a divergence among Federal Reserve officials on potential interest rate cuts and political tailwinds that are seen as positive for the cryptocurrency. The significant price increase triggered over $550 million in short liquidations, further fueling the upward momentum as investors anticipate more corporate buying and favorable legislation.

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to proceed. The lawsuit alleges that the social media giant knowingly uses manipulative and addictive design features to exploit its younger users, keeping them engaged for longer to increase ad exposure and e-commerce purchases. The judge ruled the state's claims were valid, focusing on the app's alleged "defective and dangerous features" rather than its user-generated content. The case is one of several recent legal actions by states targeting the design and safety policies of major tech platforms concerning children.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal weapons against journalists covering protests. The ruling comes in response to a lawsuit from press rights groups, which argued that LAPD officers have deliberately targeted and injured reporters during recent demonstrations against federal immigration policies. The judge's order, which cited specific instances of journalists being hit, bars the use of such munitions against reporters who do not pose an imminent threat and forbids police from obstructing their work, marking a significant victory for press freedom.</p>
