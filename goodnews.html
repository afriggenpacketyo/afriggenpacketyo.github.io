        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins voiced support for the recent interest rate cut but expressed caution about the extent of future reductions, citing ongoing inflation threats. Speaking in New York, she acknowledged the dual risks of persistent inflation and a weakening labor market, suggesting a "modestly restrictive" policy remains appropriate for now. While further easing might be possible this year, Collins emphasized that any decision will be data-dependent, reflecting the highly uncertain economic environment. Her comments align with a broader sentiment of careful navigation by Fed officials. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains that "excessive" credit card debt is not defined by a specific dollar amount but rather by its impact on an individual's financial health. Key indicators of a problem include a high debt-to-income ratio (over 10% for credit cards), high credit utilization (above 30%), and the inability to pay more than the minimum monthly payment. The article outlines several strategies for tackling unmanageable debt, such as the snowball or avalanche repayment methods, balance transfers, and debt consolidation loans. For more severe situations, it also discusses credit counseling and, as a last resort, bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A suspect has been identified in the infamous 1991 murders of four teenage girls at a yogurt shop in Austin, Texas, according to an original investigator on the case. The suspect is Robert Eugene Brashers, a deceased serial killer who died by suicide in 1999. A connection was reportedly made through DNA evidence linking him to the crime scene, specifically a bullet casing found in a drain. This development marks a major breakthrough in the decades-old cold case, which previously saw four other men wrongly arrested and two convicted before their sentences were overturned due to new DNA findings.</p>

          <p>In his keynote speech at the Labour party conference, Prime Minister Keir Starmer positioned his party as the patriotic choice for national renewal, directly challenging the rise of Reform UK. He criticized Reform's leader, Nigel Farage, for negativity and argued that Labour must make uncomfortable decisions, particularly on migration, to regain the trust of working-class voters. Starmer also announced a new policy focus, shifting away from a university-for-all target to promoting "gold standard apprenticeships" and technical colleges. The speech aimed to define Labour's platform and rally support by contrasting its vision with what he portrayed as the decline offered by opponents.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that Pfizer has agreed to lower the cost of some of its prescription drugs for Medicaid, as part of the administration's push for "most favored nation" pricing. Alongside this agreement, the administration plans to launch a direct-to-consumer website called "TrumpRX" for purchasing prescription medications. This initiative aims to reduce healthcare costs for Americans by leveraging federal power to negotiate better prices with pharmaceutical companies. The announcement comes amid a partisan standoff over government funding, with both sides accusing the other of failing to adequately address rising healthcare expenses.</p>

          <p>Canadian authorities have identified the remains of a woman, known for nearly two decades as "The Woman in the Well," as Alice Spence, who was born in 1881. Her preserved and partially dismembered body was discovered in a barrel in an old well in Saskatoon in 2006. The case, believed to be the oldest in Canada solved with investigative genetic genealogy, remained cold for years until forensic evidence was sent to a private lab. By building a comprehensive DNA profile and tracing her family tree, investigators were able to give a name to the victim, who is believed to have died over a century ago, between 1916 and 1918.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is undertaking a massive initiative to integrate artificial intelligence into every facet of its operations, with the goal of becoming the world's first fully AI-powered megabank. The bank is using a proprietary platform called LLM Suite to harness models from OpenAI and Anthropic, aiming to provide every employee with a personalized AI assistant and automate internal processes. This strategic shift could dramatically increase productivity, such as creating investment banking presentations in seconds, but also raises concerns about the future of jobs, particularly for junior and operational staff. The effort reflects a major corporate push to capitalize on the transformative potential of generative AI.</p>

          <p>In a major scientific advance, researchers have successfully created functional human eggs using DNA from adult skin cells, which were then fertilized to produce early-stage embryos. The technique, developed at Oregon Health & Science University, involves transferring the nucleus of a skin cell into a donor egg and then inducing it to halve its chromosomes. While the technology is still in its infancy and requires significant refinement to ensure genetic stability, it holds the potential to treat infertility for older women and could one day allow same-sex couples to have genetically related children. The breakthrough also prompts complex ethical discussions about the future of human reproduction.</p>

Her retirement is prompted by a chronic nerve injury in her leg that has sidelined her for over a year and forced her to withdraw from the recent Paris Olympics. Riley hopes to make at least one final on-field appearance for her club before ending a decorated career celebrated for both her accomplishments and her character.</p>

He will be succeeded by the company's current co-presidents, Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström, who will serve as co-CEOs. Ek stated that this change formalizes an operational structure that has been in place for some time, with his deputies handling much of the day-to-day management.
