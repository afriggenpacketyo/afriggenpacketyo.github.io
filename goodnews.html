          <p>This week's edition of "CBS News Sunday Morning" will cover a range of topics, including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers' perspective on President Trump's pressure on universities, which Summers describes as 'extortion'. The show will also explore the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute exhibition, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," celebrating the culture of the Black dandy. Additionally, the program will feature the story of Enoteca Maria, a Staten Island restaurant where dishes are prepared by grandmothers from around the world, and a profile of Cole Escola, the actor and playwright behind the Broadway hit "Oh, Mary!". The episode will also remember notable figures who have recently passed away and look into the history of Malcolm X.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement about renaming November 11 as "Victory Day for World War I," the White House clarified that it will be an additional proclamation, not a replacement for Veterans Day. Trump also stated his intention to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." According to the Congressional Research Service, establishing a federal holiday or national observance requires the passage of a law. The White House Press Secretary has affirmed that Veterans Day will not be renamed, but rather supplemented with an additional proclamation.</p>

          <p>China is speeding up its efforts to construct the world‚Äôs first nuclear fusion reactor capable of achieving net energy generation, a move that would be a historic step towards commercializing a clean and nearly limitless energy source. The Burning Plasma Experimental Superconducting Tokamak (Best) is in its final assembly phase in Hefei and is expected to be completed in 2027. Assembly involves tens of thousands of components with a total weight of around 6,000 tonnes. The project's chief engineer, Song Yuntao, stated that they have fully mastered the core technologies both scientifically and technically.</p>

          <p>The area where Elon Musk's SpaceX operates in South Texas has officially become a city named Starbase, following a vote by residents, most of whom are SpaceX employees. The new city will be governed by a mayor and two commissioners with power over local issues. The possibility of incorporation was rumored for years before the vote, and environmental groups have criticized SpaceX's impact on local wildlife. The first mayor of Starbase will be Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice-president. A bill in the Texas legislature could give Starbase officials the ability to close a local highway and limit access to nearby areas during rocket launches.</p>

          <p>Slate Auto, an EV startup backed by Jeff Bezos, has raised over $111 million to launch its "Blank Slate" electric truck by the end of 2026. The company is taking a unique approach to EV design, focusing on simplicity and customization, with a starting price around $25,000. The truck comes without traditional paint or power windows, allowing customers to build it up as needed with over 100 available accessories and modular kits. The base model offers a 150-mile range with an optional larger battery, and Slate Auto has also launched Slate University, a digital DIY learning hub.</p>

          <p>This article discusses two plays, "The Picture of Dorian Gray" and "Vanya," that explore the impact of image and performance in the modern era. "Dorian Gray" uses smartphones and social media tropes to critique the drive for an idealized aesthetic, while "Vanya" suggests that embodying multiple voices can be a form of liberation. The article questions whether performing a persona is a perversion of truth or a way of becoming more freely oneself. The author also highlights the difference between the plays, where "Dorian Gray" warns about misinterpreting an act as reality, and "Vanya" suggests that self-expression can be a powerful force.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues for the widespread adoption of self-driving cars, citing data from Waymo that suggests autonomous vehicles are significantly safer than human drivers. The Waymo study found 81% fewer airbag-deploying crashes and 85% fewer crashes with suspected serious injuries compared to human drivers. The author contends that the benefits of AI drivers, including their ability to avoid distractions and make quicker decisions, outweigh the risks. The author also suggests that public apprehension and focus on outlier events involving self-driving cars are hindering progress, and that slowing down the adoption of autonomous vehicles is costing lives.</p>
