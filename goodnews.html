          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 18:18:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new vocational V-level courses for 16-year-olds in England, aiming to simplify the current "confusing landscape" of post-GCSE qualifications. These V-levels are intended to replace Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, building on their practical, employment-focused aspects. Additionally, an alternative qualification will be introduced to reduce the number of students resitting maths and English GCSEs, addressing the "demoralising roundabout" of repeated exam failures. While the Sixth Form Colleges Association warns V-levels may not fully fill the gap left by BTecs, the initiative seeks to enhance vocational routes and break down barriers to opportunity for young people.</p>

          <p>Liu Qian, founder of Wusawa Advisory and former managing director of The Economist Group in Greater China, discusses the evolving US-China rivalry, asserting that economic concerns regarding global trade protectionism are exaggerated. She highlights that exports to the US now constitute only about 2.8% of China's GDP, with ASEAN having surpassed the US and EU as its largest export destination. Qian emphasizes that the rivalry extends beyond trade into technology, ideologies, and global collaboration, posing risks to both countries and the world if unhealthy competition persists. The article also touches upon her advocacy for gender equality and the critical role of women's voices in policymaking, underscoring their importance in navigating complex global challenges.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Great Powers Urged to Emulate Nixon-Zhou Enlai Accommodation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 17:30:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that in the current multipolar world, major powers face a critical choice: manage hegemonic transitions through rigid alliances or pursue managed accommodation, akin to Richard Nixon and Zhou Enlai in the 1970s. The author suggests that economic fundamentals have already established a multipolar order, with the key question being whether it's handled through statecraft or confrontation. Two distinguishing factors of today's competition are highlighted: the irrationality of total war due to nuclear weapons, and unprecedented costs of systemic rupture due to technological interdependence. These factors create powerful incentives for major economies to avoid systemic breakdown, favoring patient statecraft over confrontation.</p>

The article explores various motivations for the protests, including immigration, tariffs, and government cuts, alongside frustrations with Democratic leaders for not being more combative. The ongoing government shutdown further complicates the political landscape.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries campaigned at Black churches in Los Angeles for California’s Proposition 50, a redistricting effort that could add Democratic representatives to Congress.

The article highlights the historical significance of First African Methodist Episcopal Church as a center for civil rights and community support. While California Republicans criticize the initiative as a "scam" undermining democracy, Democrats argue it is a necessary response to Republican actions and a fight for equitable representation and healthcare access.</p>

          <p>A five-day strike by thousands of registered nurses and other healthcare workers at Kaiser Permanente facilities in California and Hawaii has ended, with bargaining scheduled to resume this week. The United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals (UNAC/UHCP) stated the strike sent a message that "patient care and safe staffing must come first," citing new Joint Commission standards recognizing adequate staffing as a patient safety mandate. While Kaiser welcomed back 30,000 employees, it emphasized that wages, not staffing, remain the primary issue, having offered a 21.5% wage increase over four years against the union's 25% demand. The union remains energized to continue advocating for a fair contract.</p>

          <p>A new film titled "Diamond Diplomacy" explores the long and complex relationship between the United States and Japan through the lens of baseball, featuring Shohei Ohtani prominently.

It also highlights the challenges faced by Japanese Americans and early Japanese players in MLB, like Masanori Murakami and Hideo Nomo. The article notes Ohtani's current status as a cultural icon, symbolizing a shift where a Japanese face now represents Major League Baseball in the US, transcending the sport.</p>

Erhurman, a centre-left politician, campaigned on a platform of reinvigorating stalled UN talks and exploring a federal solution for the island's nearly 50-year division. This outcome contrasts with the incumbent's two-state policy, which was backed by Turkey and rejected by Greek Cypriots. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan congratulated Erhurman, emphasizing democratic maturity while reaffirming support for Turkish Cypriot rights.
