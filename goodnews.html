          <p>Many Monday papers highlight the government's new migration control plans, driven by recent local election losses to Reform UK. The prime minister is toughening rules, including English language tests for spouses and preventing care homes from recruiting abroad. The i Paper quotes Sir Keir Starmer, emphasizing immigrants must earn the right to stay and improve their English. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to direct negotiations with Vladimir Putin following US pressure, despite initially demanding a ceasefire first.

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier He Lifeng held trade talks in Geneva, with both sides reporting progress. Bessent described the discussions as productive and constructive, while He Lifeng noted they were in-depth and candid. The White House called it a trade deal, but details are expected in a joint statement, marking the first face-to-face meeting since the US imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports. Frank Lavin expects tariff cuts, but Deborah Elms is less optimistic, anticipating an agreement to keep talking. Following the talks, Jamieson Greer stated the deal would help reduce the US's $1.2tn trade deficit.</p>

          <p>Britain is increasing its military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, aiming to stimulate domestic job creation and local prosperity, with Barrow-in-Furness serving as a potential model.

The initiative aims to address infrastructure problems, attract workers, and improve health and education outcomes. This strategy could be replicated across Britain, directing military spending towards poorer regions and generating positive effects on local communities, with the key being to attract new businesses and opportunities.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its third system outage in less than two weeks, causing significant delays and cancellations. The latest incident involved a momentary failure of a backup air traffic control system, leading to a 45-minute ground stop. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to reduce flights temporarily and build a direct line from Newark to the Philly TRACON to address the ongoing issues. Passengers expressed frustration, with many experiencing multiple delays and overnight stays. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer emphasized the need for the FAA to prioritize fixing Newark to prevent similar problems nationwide.</p>

          <p>Immigration into the UK has been a significant demographic change in the 21st century, marked by a consistent trend of more people migrating to the UK than emigrating over the past 30 years. Net migration began to climb in 1994, particularly during Labour's time in office in the early 2000s. Despite Conservative promises to reduce net migration to the levels of the 1990s, numbers remained historically high. Brexit, intended to grant greater control over immigration, has not resulted in a decrease, with net migration reaching 906,000 in the year to June 2023, though recent data suggests a potential fall in 2024.</p>

          <p>A measure in President Trump's reconciliation bill aimed at restricting federal payments to abortion providers may face opposition from moderate House Republicans. The provision, intended to redirect funds from "big abortion" to federally qualified health centers, has raised concerns about how these groups are defined. Moderate Republicans argue that the Hyde Amendment already prevents federal funding for abortion services, and that a new fight on abortion could be divisive. With a narrow majority in the House, Republican leaders face the challenge of passing the bill without significant dissent.</p>

However, it also poses challenges, as it could triple electricity demand and exacerbate climate change, given India's reliance on coal for power generation. Despite these concerns, the priority for many Indians is immediate relief from the heat, leading to increased AC purchases and energy consumption.</p>

          <p>Yao Yang, a Chinese economist, discusses the US-China trade war, stating that there‚Äôs a growing recognition in the US that the trade war is unsustainable. He believes the likelihood of a deal is high, with a rollback to something like the original 34% tariff level being possible. The US might demand China buy more American goods, such as farm products, energy, and Boeing planes. Yao Yang also addresses overcapacity, technological innovation, and other economic challenges facing China.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Health Insurance System Faces Politicization Risk</h2>

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, known for its affordability and support for a long-lived population, is facing serious strain from a shrinking workforce and aging population. The system is now entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections, raising concerns that its stability and public trust could be undermined. Analysts emphasize the need for a measured, long-term debate rather than rushed reforms driven by electoral pressures. The government is seeking to secure funds for child-rearing steps, with some savings expected from the medical system.</p>

          <h2>US Halts Cattle Imports from Mexico Due to Flesh-Eating Maggot Fears</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 20:56:43 EDT</div>

          <p>The U.S. has halted cattle imports from Mexico, citing concerns over the spread of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins made the decision to protect U.S. animals and the nation's food supply. The New World screwworms are fly larvae that burrow into wounds and feed on the flesh and blood of their host. The ban will continue on a "month-by-month basis, until a significant window of containment is achieved," according to the USDA.</p>
