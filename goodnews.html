          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, which saw only 22,000 nonfarm jobs added, financial commentator Jim Cramer has identified Home Depot as a key stock to purchase. He argues that the disappointing labor market data will lead to lower interest rates, including mortgage rates, which in turn will stimulate the housing market. Cramer believes this economic environment will create a significant surge for housing-related stocks, with Home Depot poised to be a primary beneficiary due to its strong position in the home improvement sector.

          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new, long-term compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth up to $975 billion if all milestones are met. The plan consists of 12 tranches tied to massive increases in the company's market capitalization, starting at $2 trillion and reaching up to $8.5 trillion, along with ambitious operational goals for vehicle and robot deliveries. This proposal comes after Musk's previous $56 billion pay package from 2018 was voided by a Delaware court, and it aims to keep him motivated and focused on the company's future growth.</p>

          <p>A lightsaber prop used by the character Darth Vader in the Star Wars films "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" has sold for over $3.6 million at a Propstore auction. The piece, which was the primary dueling prop for the character, significantly exceeded its estimated sale price of $1 to $3 million. Constructed from a modified 1950s camera flash attachment, the prop was wielded by both actor David Prowse and stunt performer Bob Anderson during filming. The sale was part of a larger auction of over 1,000 Hollywood memorabilia items in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>With global equities at all-time highs, financial analysts are advising investors to consider defensive strategies to protect their recent portfolio gains. The weak August jobs report has increased expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut, but it also signals potential broader economic trouble ahead. Experts suggest that many portfolios are overly concentrated in mega-cap tech stocks, creating significant risk if the market shifts. They recommend re-evaluating this concentration and considering a rotation into value and defensive sectors that have been overlooked during the recent rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.7 billion, the third-largest prize in U.S. history, ahead of the next drawing. Winners face a choice between a 30-year annuity or a lump-sum cash payment, which is currently valued at approximately 45% of the advertised total. Regardless of the choice, a mandatory 24% federal tax is withheld, with winners likely owing more at the top 37% tax bracket. This article provides a breakdown of the total after-tax winnings for both payout options in every participating state, accounting for varying state income tax laws, which range from over 10% to zero.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Public Supports Trump's Proposal to Deploy National Guard to High-Crime Cities</h2>

          <p>A contributor argues that Donald Trump's proposal to deploy the National Guard to cities like Chicago and Baltimore is a politically savvy move that aligns with public concern over crime. The author contends that this is not an authoritarian overreach but a necessary federal intervention when local governance fails, citing historical precedents like the Insurrection Act. The article suggests that critics who label the idea as "fascism" are out of touch with voters who prioritize law and order. It frames the proposal as an example of Trump's ability to force opponents to defend unpopular positions.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her upcoming memoir, "Listening to the Law," Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett reflects on the difficult decision to accept President Trump's nomination to the high court. She describes the intense public scrutiny and loss of privacy she and her family experienced during a previous consideration for a court seat. Barrett reveals that she and her husband, Jesse, agreed to move forward only on the condition that they would "burn the boats," a commitment to not look back or second-guess the decision. She ultimately accepted out of a sense of duty to the rule of law.</p>

          <h2>Review Praises Evocative Imagery in Story Collection by South Korean Filmmaker Lee Chang-dong</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 10:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of "Snowy Day and Other Stories," the first English-translated collection by acclaimed South Korean writer and director Lee Chang-dong, praises his masterful use of imagery to evoke emotion and political atmosphere. The stories, written early in his career during the repressive 1980s Chun Doo-hwan dictatorship, explore themes of masculinity, state violence, and paranoia. The reviewer notes that Lee's literary style foreshadows his cinematic work, like the film "Burning," by communicating meaning through feeling and intuition rather than direct explanation. The collection is celebrated for its ability to transport readers into its tense, historical setting.</p>

          <h2>Conservationists in India Assist Newly Hatched Sea Turtles on Their Journey to the Ocean</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 09:53:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article highlights a successful conservation effort in India aimed at protecting the vulnerable olive ridley sea turtle. Along the coast south of Mumbai, activists collect turtle eggs from the seashore to protect them from predators and incubate them in safe hatcheries. Once the baby turtles hatch, they are carefully released onto the sand to make their way to the Arabian Sea. During this critical journey, conservationists and sometimes tourists watch over them, shooing away threats like crabs and dogs, and cheering as the tiny hatchlings finally reach the waves.</p>
