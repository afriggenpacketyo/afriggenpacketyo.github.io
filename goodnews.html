          <h2>Genetic Study Reveals Ancient Human Migration from Asia to the Americas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 02:04:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of researchers has conducted an extensive genetic analysis, tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas. The study indicates that Native Americans descended from Asian populations, particularly those in the West Beringian region. It also found that early migrants to South America formed distinct, isolated groups because of environmental conditions. This research provides insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have experienced significant population declines, and confirms human presence in South America as early as 14,500 years ago.</p>

          <p>Scarlett Johansson is speaking out about the need for regulation of artificial intelligence, particularly concerning the use of her likeness and voice by AI companies. She recounted an incident where OpenAI's chatbot, "Sky," sounded eerily similar to her voice, despite her declining an offer to voice the bot. Johansson's legal team took action against OpenAI, leading to the removal of "Sky." She emphasizes the importance of establishing boundaries to prevent AI from being detrimental and advocates for more public figures to support AI regulation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, as investors sought refuge from U.S. markets amid concerns over President Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest net inflows since 1996. This shift was driven by institutional investors, including pension funds and asset managers, who diversified away from the U.S. due to uncertainties surrounding the U.S. economy. Japanese assets are generally considered a haven, whose appeal rose as the "sell-U.S." narrative gained ground in April.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law allowing preemptive acts of cyberdefense, enabling the government to monitor communications data during peacetime and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law requires key infrastructure operators to report cyber breaches to the government. Police will initially handle neutralizing attackers' servers, with the Self-Defense Forces intervening in more sophisticated incidents. An independent panel will provide prior approval for data acquisition and analysis, ensuring government surveillance is properly conducted.</p>
