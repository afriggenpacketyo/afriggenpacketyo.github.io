          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump met with Scottish First Minister John Swinney to discuss key issues, including tariffs on Scotch whisky and the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The conversation, which took place at Trump's Balmedie Estate, also touched on North Sea oil and gas taxation, with Swinney advocating for the industry which he believes is overtaxed. Swinney emphasized the unique importance of Scotch whisky to Scotland's economy, appealing to Trump for an exemption from the 10% U.S. tariff. The leaders also exchanged views on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, with Swinney urging the president to use his influence to push for a ceasefire.</p>

          <h2>IMF Raises Global Growth Forecast, Citing Easing of Some U.S. Tariffs</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, attributing the improvement in part to the softening of some U.S. tariffs on imported goods. The projection was also boosted by a surge in U.S. imports as companies moved to preempt higher taxes. The IMF now predicts global growth of 3.0% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, though this remains below pre-pandemic averages. Despite the modest improvement, the organization warned that persistent trade tensions and uncertainty could still lead to weaker economic activity and that U.S. inflation may remain above target.

          <h2>JPMorgan Chase Reportedly Nearing Deal to Become Apple Card Issuer, Replacing Goldman Sachs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 11:34:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase, the largest credit card issuer in the U.S., is reportedly in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs. This move would mark Goldman's exit from a high-profile but challenging venture into consumer credit cards, which incurred significant costs and regulatory scrutiny. For Apple, partnering with an established issuer like JPMorgan could bring more stability to its financial product offerings. The potential deal would further solidify JPMorgan's dominance in the credit card market while allowing Goldman Sachs to refocus on its core businesses, moving past a difficult chapter for its consumer banking ambitions.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club has announced the sale of a portion of its holdings in Wells Fargo, capitalizing on the stock's recovery following a recent earnings report. The stock had initially dropped after the bank lowered its net interest income forecast, but has since rebounded as the market seemingly accepted the bank's strategy to bolster its fee-based businesses. The article notes that this sale is a strategic move to lock in profits and right-size the position, not a change in the long-term positive outlook for the bank under CEO Charlie Scharf's leadership.

          <p>Following a deadly train derailment caused by a landslide after heavy rain, Germany is increasingly focused on adapting its railway infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events linked to climate change. National railway company Deutsche Bahn is implementing measures such as redesigning bridges to be less vulnerable to floods and using AI-driven vegetation management to prevent trees from falling on tracks during storms. The company is also making technological upgrades to protect rails and signaling equipment from extreme heat. These efforts aim to ensure the safety and reliability of train travel, which remains a more sustainable and safer alternative to cars.</p>

          <p>Boeing announced a significant reduction in its quarterly losses, fueled by a 35% jump in revenue as it delivered the most aircraft since 2018. The aerospace giant lost $176 million, a substantial improvement from the $1.09 billion loss a year earlier, prompting CEO Kelly Ortberg to state that 2025 could be the company's "turnaround year." The positive results indicate progress in stabilizing production and overcoming a series of crises, including renewed federal scrutiny after a door plug incident in January. While challenges remain, such as delays in certifying new 737 Max models, the improved performance suggests the company is on a path to recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady this week, resisting public pressure from President Trump to implement a cut. Economists give a 96% probability that the central bank will maintain the rate in its current 4.25% to 4.5% range as it continues to monitor inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has consistently stated that policy decisions are driven by economic data, not political influence, and aims to keep inflation near the 2% target. While some Fed governors have signaled a desire for a rate cut, the consensus remains that the central bank will wait for clearer economic signals, possibly until its September meeting.

          <p>With a record number of Certificates of Deposit (CDs) set to mature this year, savers face a key decision about where to place their funds. Experts advise against passively allowing CDs to auto-renew, as current interest rates are lower than last year and may fall further if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. Instead, savers should proactively compare options during their bank's grace period. Alternatives include shopping for a new CD with a better rate, moving funds to a more liquid high-yield savings account, or considering other investment vehicles depending on their financial goals and need for access to the money.

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from Catalhoyuk, a 9,000-year-old Neolithic settlement in Turkey, provides strong evidence that the society was organized around women. Researchers analyzed DNA from individuals buried under the same houses and found they were often related through their mothers, indicating a matrilocal system where men moved in with the woman's family. This finding supports earlier archaeological theories based on female figurines found at the site. The study also revealed that grave goods were far more abundant with female bodies than male ones, further suggesting women held an elevated status in this ancient community.</p>

          <p>India is now home to over 3,600 wild tigers, representing about 75% of the global population, according to a recent census. While these numbers mark a conservation success, experts warn that significant risks remain. The primary threat is habitat fragmentation caused by deforestation, agriculture, and infrastructure projects, which isolates tiger populations and affects their movement and breeding. Conservationists argue that focusing solely on population size is insufficient and that protecting the quality and connectivity of their habitats is crucial for the long-term survival of the species. Human-wildlife conflict and poaching also continue to pose challenges in certain regions.</p>

Phrases like "if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything" can create self-blame when things don't work out, while telling kids they "can't be selfish" can discourage healthy self-care. The article suggests that instead of promoting false positivity or discouraging requests for help, parents should foster emotional resilience by acknowledging difficult feelings.

          <p>According to Juliet Schor, a lead researcher on global four-day workweek trials, companies that successfully transition to a 32-hour week without pay cuts employ three key strategies. First, they reduce the number and length of meetings, replacing many with written updates and protecting focused work time. Second, they empower employees to re-engineer their own work processes for greater efficiency, particularly in non-office environments like manufacturing. Finally, they eliminate low-impact work by questioning the value of long-standing tasks and projects, freeing up time for more strategic activities. These changes have consistently led to higher profits, less turnover, and improved employee well-being.</p>
