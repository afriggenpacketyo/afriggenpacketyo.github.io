          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva indicated that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appears "much more willing to talk" about peace than in previous encounters, echoing a similar sentiment regarding Russian President Vladimir Putin. Lula is actively reviving a joint Brazil-China peace plan, emphasizing the need for the United Nations to lead negotiations and regain its central role in international diplomacy. This push for a ceasefire and a contact group comes after a rare alignment between China and Brazil on a U.S.-led Security Council initiative, signaling a potential turning point in diplomatic efforts. The six-point plan includes humanitarian access, prisoner exchanges, and civilian protection, despite initial dismissal from Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely advanced on Thursday, diverging from Wall Street's recent declines driven by a second consecutive day of selling in major tech stocks like Nvidia and Oracle. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw a modest rise, buoyed by Chinese automaker Chery Automobile's strong debut after its $1.2 billion IPO, with Xiaomi shares also gaining on new device launches. South Korea's Kospi was near flat, but defense stocks performed well, while Taiwan's Taiex dipped due to TSMC's fall following reports of Intel seeking Apple investment. U.S. stock futures remained stable as investors awaited jobless claims data, which could influence Federal Reserve policy amid labor market concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chery Automobile, China's leading vehicle exporter, experienced an impressive 11% jump in its Hong Kong stock market debut, having raised US$1.2 billion through its initial public offering. Despite the listing ceremony being canceled due to a super typhoon, the company's shares traded significantly above their IPO price. Chery is rapidly expanding its global footprint, particularly in Vietnam, the Middle East, and Europe, with plans to launch new SUV models. Industry experts note Chery's strategic advantage in manufacturing across multiple countries, which helps mitigate the impact of rising tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles in markets like the U.S., Canada, and the European Union.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally mandate states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants. This decision represents a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to withhold funding from "sanctuary" cities and states. Twenty mostly Democratic states had sued, arguing that tying critical disaster preparedness funds to immigration assistance violated federal law and the Constitution. The judge sided with the states, granting summary judgment and stating that the policy was "arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," emphasizing the irreparable harm from losing emergency funds.</p>

          <p>Canada's Supreme Court has issued a temporary stay on the planned culling of nearly 400 ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farms in British Columbia, following an avian flu outbreak. This decision allows the farm owners to appeal the cull order, marking the latest development in a case that has garnered international attention and high-profile interventions. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) had ordered the cull due to the risk of viral mutation and human health concerns, but the owners have vehemently opposed it, even leading to their brief arrest for obstruction. The CFIA will maintain custody of the birds while the court decides whether to hear the case.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's substantial investment in OpenAI, potentially reaching $100 billion, will largely be used by the AI startup to lease Nvidia's advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for new supercomputing facilities. This arrangement allows OpenAI to spread out the significant costs of these data centers over several years, with Nvidia bearing more of the financial risk. OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar confirmed that partners like Oracle are also leveraging their balance sheets to fund these facilities, addressing a dramatic shortage of compute capacity. However, some analysts express concern about the "circular nature" of such deals, questioning the true value creation amidst the AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Africa is experiencing a significant surge in solar energy adoption, with Chinese-made solar panel imports reaching a record 9,516 megawatts in the first seven months of this year, a substantial increase from the previous year. This rapid expansion, particularly in South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria, is largely driven by large-scale energy projects developed by Chinese firms and falling costs. The Oxford Economics study highlights China's dominant role in global solar panel production, making these imports a key indicator of Africa's growing solar capacity. This development signifies a major step towards rewiring the continent for a sustainable energy future.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' bullpen is struggling significantly, with a 4.33 ERA ranking 21st in the majors and a concerning 5.69 mark in September, prompting manager Dave Roberts to seek reliable options. Closer Tanner Scott and top right-hander Blake Treinen have seen their ERAs soar, and other relievers have underperformed or are injured. Amidst this disarray, 23-year-old rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki is rejoining the active roster after a five-month shoulder injury, offering a glimmer of hope. Sasaki, who rediscovered his velocity and impressed in recent minor league relief appearances, is now considered a potential critical playoff option, despite his limited experience.</p>

          <p>Fourth-generation cranberry farmers in Massachusetts are increasingly participating in a state program that pays them to restore unproductive bogs back into wetlands. This initiative, driven by falling cranberry prices due to global competition and rising operational costs, aims to preserve land and ecological health. The Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration's Cranberry Bog Program has already restored over 500 acres, with another 500 planned, transforming former bogs into thriving wetlands that filter water, store carbon, and enhance storm resilience. This article highlights a pragmatic solution for farmers facing economic headwinds, allowing them to protect their land and contribute to environmental conservation.</p>

The earthquake was also felt in neighboring Colombia and several Caribbean islands. Despite Venezuela being largely within seismic zones, strong quakes are not common, with the last major one in 1997 causing 73 deaths.
