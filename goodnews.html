          <p>President Trump has ordered his administration to declassify all federal records related to Amelia Earhart, the pioneering aviator whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has captivated public interest for decades. Trump highlighted the enduring mystery surrounding Earhart's attempt to become the first female aviator to circumnavigate the world. While the prevailing theory suggests she crashed due to fuel exhaustion, other speculative narratives, such as her alleged capture by the Japanese on Saipan, continue to circulate. A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands prompted this move, though experts like journalist Laurie Gwen Shapiro generally dismiss the more dramatic theories, emphasizing the strong likelihood of a simple fuel-related accident.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace achieved a significant 2-1 victory over Liverpool, exposing the latter's defensive vulnerabilities in a thrilling Premier League match at Selhurst Park. Despite dominating the first half and taking an early lead through Ismaila Sarr, Palace only held a 1-0 advantage at halftime due to Liverpool's goalkeeper Alisson's heroic saves. After Liverpool managed a late equalizer, substitute Eddie Nketiah secured a deserved winner for Palace in the 97th minute, marking their first home league win against the Reds since 2014. This impressive result extends Crystal Palace's unbeaten run to 18 games across all competitions, propelling them to second place in the league under the transformative leadership of manager Oliver Glasner.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Science indicates that chimpanzees regularly consume notable quantities of alcohol through fermented fruit in their natural habitats. Researchers in Uganda's Kibale National Park and the Ivory Coast's Taï National Park found that the ripe pulp of common fruits contains an average alcohol content of 0.3%. A chimpanzee's daily intake of these fruits amounts to nearly 14 grams of alcohol, comparable to more than half a liter of beer for a human. This groundbreaking research suggests that regular alcohol consumption is not exclusively a human cultural phenomenon but may possess deeper evolutionary roots, extending to our closest primate relatives.</p>

Philosopher Frank Martela suggests Finns' contentment stems from their societal structure, which prioritizes citizen well-being through accessible public services like the Oodi Central Library. This library offers a wide array of free resources, ensuring opportunities regardless of personal wealth. Additionally, a strong connection to nature, the widespread use of saunas for relaxation and endorphin release, and a cultural emphasis on living one's own dream rather than external pressures contribute to their high quality of life and perceived happiness.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, a pioneering journalist and the first Black woman hired as a television reporter on the West Coast, has died at 92. Davis, who began her career in the 1950s without a college degree, broke barriers in an industry dominated by white men, becoming a trusted figure at KPIX-TV, KRON, and KQED. Friends and colleagues remember her as unflappable, fair, and a mentor who "opened doors for a generation" of Black and women journalists. Her reporting spanned critical events from the 1960s to her retirement in 2012, including the assassination of Harvey Milk and the AIDS crisis, inspiring many with her commitment to diverse perspectives.</p>

          <p>Kara Egan, CEO of Teal Health, is working to make cervical cancer screenings more accessible with the Teal Wand, the first FDA-approved at-home cervical screening test. Despite Pap smears being crucial for prevention, screening rates have declined, partly due to barriers beyond cost, such as time off work and childcare. The Teal Wand offers the same accuracy as in-office tests, with the entire process—from doctor consultation to sample collection and results—conducted from home. Egan notes that over 50% of Teal users were behind on screenings, and 20% had never been screened, demonstrating the significant impact of this convenient solution in improving women's health outcomes.</p>
