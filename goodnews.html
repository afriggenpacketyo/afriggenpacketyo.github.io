          <p>Nicole Eggert, known for her role as Roberta "Summer" Quinn on "Baywatch," shared that the show negatively impacted her dating life and career. Eggert said that she left the show after two seasons because it was not what she signed up for, and she had hoped to detach herself from the "Baywatch" stigma. She said that people had a preconceived notion of who she was based on the show, which made it difficult for people to get to know her. Eggert also discussed the negative press surrounding the show, which led to casting doors closing for the actors.</p>

          <p>President Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey, solidifying Ciattarelli's position in the upcoming Republican primary. Ciattarelli, who narrowly lost to the Democratic governor in 2021, has openly courted Trump's support after initially distancing himself. The endorsement could be a liability in the general election due to New Jersey's Democratic lean, but Trump's improved performance in the state has given Republicans hope.
