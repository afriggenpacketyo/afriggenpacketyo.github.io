          <p>Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama have jointly addressed and dismissed persistent rumors about their marriage being in trouble. Appearing together on a podcast, they joked about the speculation, which had been fueled by Barack Obama attending some events alone. Michelle Obama clarified her recent decisions to prioritize her personal freedom now that her husband is out of office and their daughters are grown. She reaffirmed the strength of their marriage, stating she has never considered leaving her husband despite facing hard times together.</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Alaska, initially prompting a tsunami warning for the state's southern peninsula. The warning was later downgraded to an advisory, as officials confirmed a tsunami was generated but did not expect large, widespread inundation due to the quake's shallow depth. The earthquake was felt throughout the Alaska Peninsula, a seismically active region known as the Pacific "Ring of Fire." Authorities confirmed there was no immediate danger to Anchorage, the state's most populous city, following the event.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry walked through a de-mined area in Angola, continuing the advocacy work of his late mother, Princess Diana, who famously visited a minefield there in 1997. Working with the HALO Trust, the same organization his mother supported, Harry highlighted the ongoing danger posed by landmines left from Angola's 27-year civil war. Diana's visit helped galvanize support for an international land mine ban treaty. Despite significant progress, with over 120,000 mines destroyed by the trust, an estimated 1,000 minefields still remain, posing a daily threat to local communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that he has convinced Coca-Cola to replace high-fructose corn syrup with real cane sugar in its cola products sold in the United States. While Coca-Cola already uses cane sugar in some international markets like Mexico, its U.S. formula has long used corn syrup. In response, Coca-Cola issued a statement appreciating the president's enthusiasm and hinted that details about new product innovations would be shared soon, without explicitly confirming the change. Trump praised the move, stating that cane sugar is "just better."</p>

          <p>Germany is set to introduce new legislation by the end of the year to crack down on gangs that smuggle migrants across the English Channel to the UK. The change will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to a non-EU country, closing a loophole that existed after Brexit. This move, announced during the German chancellor's visit to the UK, is expected to help authorities disrupt smuggling operations, including the storage of small boats. The agreement comes as the UK government faces increasing pressure to address the rising number of Channel crossings.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have observed the birth of a planetary system around a sun-like baby star named HOPS-315, located 1,300 light-years away. Using data from the Webb Space Telescope and other observatories, scientists detected the formation of silicon monoxide, a mineral that only forms at extremely high temperatures near a young star. This discovery provides a glimpse into what our own solar system may have looked like in its infancy, about 4.6 billion years ago. The finding helps scientists understand the initial processes of planet construction and provides a new marker for identifying other budding solar systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to cardiologists, walking for at least 21 minutes every day can significantly boost cardiovascular health. This aligns with the American Heart Association's recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week. Experts emphasize that even simple physical activity like walking helps lower blood pressure, aids in weight loss, and improves the body's insulin response. For those new to exercise, starting with shorter walks and gradually increasing the duration to 30 minutes is an effective strategy. The positive impacts on mood, energy levels, and long-term heart health can be seen almost immediately.</p>

          <p>In a landmark medical achievement, doctors in the UK have successfully used a pioneering technique involving DNA from three people to prevent eight babies from inheriting devastating mitochondrial diseases. The method combines the nuclear DNA from the parents with healthy mitochondria from a female donor's egg, ensuring the child is free from the often-fatal genetic conditions passed down by the mother. This is the first confirmation that the procedure, which has been legal in the UK for a decade, is effective. The children are all reportedly healthy and meeting developmental milestones.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that China is making "big steps" in controlling the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., a significant shift in tone from his previous criticisms. In the past, Trump has used the fentanyl crisis as a justification for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. His recent positive assessment comes amid ongoing high-level trade negotiations between the two countries. Trump's comments were made as he signed the HALT Fentanyl Act, which permanently classifies fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I drugs, tightening control over the deadly synthetic opioid.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill known as the Genius Act, which has passed the Senate, is now being considered by the House and could create a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, making them less volatile and more suitable for payments. The legislation would establish consumer protections and clear rules for issuers like banks and fintech companies. This move is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the crypto industry and could pave the way for wider adoption. (not investment advice)</p>

The renewed optimism was fueled by a statement from President Trump indicating that Republican holdouts had agreed to support the legislation. The potential passage of these bills is seen as a major step toward regulatory clarity for the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a late scare that saw two quick wickets fall, India held its nerve to secure the win. For England, Sophia Dunkley's 83 runs and a sloppy fielding performance were key factors in the loss, which marks a crucial start to the series ahead of the upcoming World Cup.</p>
