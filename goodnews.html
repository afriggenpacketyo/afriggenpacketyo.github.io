          <p>Japan's core consumer prices experienced a 3.5% year-on-year increase in April, signaling ongoing inflationary pressures in the country. This rise reflects the continued impact of global supply chain issues and rising energy costs on the Japanese economy. The Bank of Japan is closely monitoring these trends as it considers potential adjustments to its monetary policy. The article offers a snapshot of Japan's current economic situation. </p>

          <p>Amazon shareholders voted against a proposal to require the company's CEO and board chair roles to remain separate, with about 82% rejecting the measure. The proposal aimed to codify the existing structure, where Jeff Bezos serves as executive chairman and Andy Jassy as CEO. While proponents argued it would enhance corporate governance, Amazon urged shareholders to vote against it, asserting the current policy allows the board to determine the optimal leadership structure based on evolving needs. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has strongly suggested that Federal Reserve board members would have special protection against being fired by a president, while allowing President Trump to fire two members of other federal agencies' boards. The ruling, resulting from a case regarding the removal of two members of other federal agencies' boards, indicated that the President may remove executive officers who exercise power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions. The decision prompted a dissent from liberal justices, who argued that the exemption for the Federal Reserve lacked proper justification. </p>
