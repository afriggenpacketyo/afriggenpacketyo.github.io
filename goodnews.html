          <p>Citigroup has reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong performance in its markets and banking divisions. The bank posted earnings of $1.96 per share against an estimated $1.60, with revenue reaching $21.67 billion versus a $20.98 billion forecast. This performance comes amid a volatile market period and as CEO Jane Fraser continues her strategic turnaround plan, which includes pulling back from some international markets. The positive results follow a significant outperformance of the company's stock in the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a high-level meeting, China's leadership has declared a fundamental shift in its urban development model, moving away from large-scale expansion to focus on enhancing existing city resources. With 67% of its population now in urban areas, Beijing will prioritize human well-being, efficiency, and improved governance. The new framework for the property sector will concentrate on renovating urban villages and repairing dilapidated housing. This change reflects China's adaptation to a more stable phase of urbanization after decades of rapid growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Use Public NASA Data for Deep-Sea Mining Exploration in Indian Ocean</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 08:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have utilized publicly available NASA satellite data to identify promising locations for deep-sea mining in the Indian Ocean. After NASA's GRACE satellites detected gravity anomalies along the Ninety East Ridge, Chinese researchers investigated and confirmed the presence of a significantly thicker oceanic crust in the area. This thickened crust suggests the presence of valuable minerals like copper, cobalt, and rare earths pushed up by magma. The use of the free data has potentially saved the Chinese research team years of work and significant financial resources.</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a new grant program to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles, offering discounts of up to £3,750 on new electric cars. The discounts, funded by a £650 million scheme, will apply to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000 and are designed to help phase out new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. While the government aims to make EVs more affordable, critics and some consumers point to the insufficient number of public charging points as a major barrier to widespread adoption.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to better-than-anticipated revenue from fixed income trading and investment banking. The bank reported earnings of $5.24 per share, outperforming estimates, although net income was down compared to the prior year which included a significant gain from Visa shares. CEO Jamie Dimon praised the bank's resilient performance while reiterating warnings about persistent risks from trade policy, geopolitical conflicts, and high fiscal deficits. The strong results were bolstered by a 14% jump in fixed income trading revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

The Faroese model, funded by borrowing against future toll revenue, is seen as a viable path for Shetland. The project could be crucial for key local industries like salmon farming and the UK's only spaceport, though it will require significant investment and public buy-in for a tolling system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This personal essay reflects on the author's journey of leaving the conservative evangelical church to reconcile her sexuality with her Christian faith. Raised in the Southern Baptist tradition, she was taught that opposition to same-sex marriage was a moral duty and that her identity as a lesbian was a cross to bear through celibacy. After years of internal conflict, she chose to leave her church community, ultimately finding a more profound sense of faith and integrity in an affirming congregation. The author argues that for many queer Christians, affirmation is a sincere religious conviction, not a capitulation to secular culture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that despite a recent IRS rule change allowing political endorsements, churches should refrain from this practice to maintain their moral authority and unity. The author, a pastor, distinguishes between bearing witness against injustice, a vital role of the church, and endorsing specific candidates, which can be destructive. Endorsing candidates risks reducing faith to partisan politics, deepening societal divisions, and disrespecting the individual conscience of congregants. The piece concludes that the church best serves the state by reminding it of its limits, not by becoming a political tool.</p>
