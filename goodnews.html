          <p>Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk announced a significant 67% increase in second-quarter sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, reaching 19.53 billion Danish kroner. Despite the surge, this figure slightly missed analyst expectations, causing a minor dip in the company's stock price. In response to recent stock losses, the company has pledged to implement cost-cutting measures and sharpen its commercial focus. Novo Nordisk reiterated its full-year outlook, aiming to balance strong product demand with improved operational efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines how the throw-in, a frequent but often overlooked set-piece in football, remains a largely untapped tactical resource. It reminisces about Rory Delap's famously long and effective throws for Stoke City, questioning why more teams haven't developed similar specialists or strategies. The piece argues that because throw-ins are exempt from the offside rule, they offer unique attacking possibilities akin to corner kicks or free-kicks. It suggests that with dedicated coaching and a shift in mindset, teams could develop complex routines to gain a significant competitive advantage.</p>

          <p>U.S. artificial intelligence leader OpenAI has released two new open-source models, GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b, marking a significant strategic shift for the company. CEO Sam Altman described the new models as "the best and most usable open models in the world," a move widely seen as a direct challenge to the growing influence of Chinese open-source AI. This is OpenAI's first major open-source release since 2019 and signals a return to its original principles. The launch comes as OpenAI is also reportedly preparing to release its next-generation GPT-5 model.</p>

          <p>In Seattle's nonpartisan mayoral primary, progressive activist Katie Wilson and incumbent Mayor Bruce Harrell have advanced to the November general election. Wilson, known for her leadership of the Transit Riders Union, secured a narrow lead with approximately 46% of the vote, slightly ahead of Harrell's 45%. The race pits Wilson's progressive platform, which includes pledges to expand social services, against Harrell's more established, incumbent position. The runoff will determine if Harrell can become the first Seattle mayor in two decades to win re-election.</p>

The central government had flagged these regions in September 2023, implementing a two-year plan for debt control and restructuring.

          <p>Following Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit's decision to end his NFL pursuit, this article analyzes the significant challenges crossover athletes face in making it in American football. The primary obstacle is the complexity of the NFL playbook, which one former player described as more difficult to learn than law books. Additionally, the "planet theory" suggests that for skill positions, the pool of elite athletic talent in the U.S. is so vast that international athletes must be truly exceptional to stand out. While some have succeeded, it requires a rare combination of physical attributes and rapid learning.</p>

          <h2>China Increases African Coffee Imports Driven by Growing Demand and Zero-Tariff Policies</h2>

          <p>China is actively strengthening its coffee supply chains by increasing imports from major African coffee-producing nations like Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda. This strategic push is fueled by a combination of a "super spike" in domestic coffee demand and a zero-tariff policy for certain African goods. Chinese companies, such as the rapidly expanding Cotti Coffee, are leading the effort by signing agreements to invest in local processing and procure thousands of tons of beans annually. Analysts suggest this is a strategic move by China to "lock in supply" for its booming consumer market.</p>

          <p>McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown has expressed confidence that his drivers, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, will not have a major falling out as they compete for the Formula 1 championship. With the teammates having won 11 of the 14 races this season, Brown acknowledges that tension will likely grow but believes their mutual respect and open communication will prevent a destructive rivalry. He expects them to "swap paint again at some point" but is positive they will never deliberately run each other off the track. Brown emphasized that managing the relationship is crucial for the team's long-term success.</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Venezuelan forward David Martínez scored twice to give Los Angeles FC a 2-1 victory over Tigres UANL in a Leagues Cup match.

After Tigres equalized early in the second half, he secured the win with a skillful individual effort, leaving a defender behind before finishing calmly. The result severely damages the qualification hopes of Tigres, who were previously undefeated in the tournament. Despite the win, LAFC's chances of advancing to the next round also remain slim.</p>

Muncy's performance provided a much-needed spark for the Dodgers' lineup, which had struggled significantly during his month-long absence due to a knee injury. The win also saw other slumping players like Mookie Betts and Teoscar Hernández (who also hit two homers) break out of their funks.

Her son, daughter-in-law, and eight-month-old granddaughter were taken in 1978. For decades, she and other grandmothers marched weekly, demanding answers and facing threats from the regime. In 2000, she was reunited with her granddaughter, who had been illegally adopted by a military family. Now 87, she reflects on the Abuelas' legacy of finding 140 of the estimated 300 missing grandchildren.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a medium-security state prison in Norco by fall 2026. The decision to shut down the facility, which houses nearly 3,000 inmates, is attributed to the state's declining prison population and is expected to save $150 million annually. The site has a unique history, having originally opened in 1928 as a luxury hotel before its conversion. While the state will aim to reassign the 1,200 employees, local officials are hopeful the historic property can be restored to its former glory as a resort.</p>
