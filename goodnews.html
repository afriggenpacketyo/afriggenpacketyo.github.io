        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sophisticated phishing campaign is targeting individuals with fraudulent emails disguised as Apple Pay receipts sent via DocuSign. These messages, which often appear to be for subscriptions from well-known companies, aim to create panic by showing an unauthorized charge. The core of the scam is a phone number provided for disputes, which connects victims directly to scammers posing as support agents. These agents then attempt to steal personal and financial information by requesting account details or tricking users into installing remote access software. To avoid this, consumers are advised to inspect sender addresses, verify charges directly through their accounts, and avoid clicking suspicious links.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that many of the extensive tariffs imposed by President Trump earlier this year exceed his authority under federal emergency economic laws. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 does not grant the president unlimited power to levy tariffs, calling it a "core Congressional power." While the ruling is a significant legal challenge to Trump's trade strategy, it does not immediately block the tariffs. The court has sent the case back to a lower court to reconsider whether a universal injunction is appropriate, giving the administration an opportunity to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A 78-year-old retired education professor attributes his excellent memory and continued professional activity to five intentional daily habits. He emphasizes the importance of regular social interaction to combat stress and depression, which can contribute to memory loss. He also advocates for lifelong learning by reading widely on unfamiliar subjects to keep his mind active and curious. Other key practices include using a simple organizational system, such as color-coded sticky notes, engaging in daily physical activity like swimming or walking to increase blood flow to the brain, and maintaining a healthy diet rich in nutrients, proper hydration, and adequate sleep.</p>

They journeyed over 9,000 miles from Peru to Cairns, Australia, becoming the first team to ever complete the full crossing from South America. Throughout their arduous journey, the trio faced severe weather, injuries, and equipment challenges while also raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar. Their arrival in Australia was met with celebrations from family and supporters, marking a historic achievement in maritime endurance and charitable fundraising.</p>

          <p>The tradition of a single wedding dress is being replaced by a multi-outfit "bridal wardrobe," with brides now purchasing an average of 12 different looks for a season of wedding-related events. Fueled by social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, events such as engagement parties, bridal showers, and multi-day bachelorette trips now demand unique, photo-ready attire. This trend has prompted retailers to expand their offerings of "little white dresses" and accessories. Experts note that the pressure to present a perfect, varied wardrobe is amplified by the increasing extravagance of weddings, larger guest lists, and the desire to create a memorable and highly documented experience.</p>

          <p>Canada secured its place in the knockout stage of the Women's Rugby World Cup with a decisive six-try victory over Wales, leaving the Welsh team on the verge of elimination. The world's second-ranked Canadian team demonstrated a masterclass in attacking rugby, establishing a bonus-point lead by halftime. Despite a brief early period of pressure from Wales, Canada's clinical performance was highlighted by two tries from McKinley Hunt and additional scores from four other players. The loss means Wales' progression now depends on the outcome of the Fiji versus Scotland match, underscoring the tough competition within their pool.</p>

          <p>The engagement of pop superstar Taylor Swift and NFL player Travis Kelce has triggered a wide range of interpretations and theories across the political spectrum. Some conservatives hope the marriage will "deradicalize" Swift and shift her toward right-wing politics, with figures like JD Vance even floating conspiracies about the NFL rigging games for Kelce's team. Meanwhile, some fans praise Kelce for supporting a successful woman, though his past comments have drawn criticism. The author notes the intense projection of hopes and fears onto the celebrity couple, while also critiquing Swift for her silence on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, arguing that her immense influence makes neutrality a deliberate choice.</p>

The last jackpot to exceed $1 billion was claimed over a year ago, in April 2024. Winners face odds of 1 in 292.2 million and must choose between a 30-year annuity or a lump-sum cash option, which is valued at just under half the advertised amount. All winnings are subject to a 24% federal tax withholding, with the total federal tax rate likely reaching 37%, in addition to state income taxes in most jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>A new ranking from The Princeton Review identifies the private colleges in the U.S. that offer the best return on investment (ROI), with Princeton University topping the list. The analysis considered factors like financial aid, cost after aid, and median post-graduation earnings. While private colleges often have high sticker prices, elite institutions with large endowments, such as Princeton, MIT, and Harvard, frequently provide generous financial aid packages, including "no-loan" policies for families below certain income thresholds. This financial support, combined with high median salaries for graduates, allows these schools to deliver significant long-term value compared to many public universities. (not investment advice)</p>

A collection of articles reflects on these timeless aspects, from the round-the-clock culture of social togetherness to the profound personal growth that occurs as young people navigate their first taste of independence. These formative years continue to be defined by making new friends, making mistakes, and reshaping the parent-child relationship as students prepare for adulthood. The shared, late-night hangouts and memorable reunions underscore that while the context of college evolves, its fundamental role as a crucible for growing up endures.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, a prominent activist hedge fund, has acquired a significant position in Rexford Industrial Realty, a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on Southern California's industrial market. Rexford's stock has underperformed, trading at a discount to its net asset value, which Elliott attributes to poor corporate governance, bloated expenses, and a growth strategy that has diluted shareholder value. Elliott is expected to push for changes, including better capital allocation and governance reforms, to unlock value. Given Rexford's premium assets and the current market dynamics, this activist involvement could also make the company a prime acquisition target. (not investment advice)</p>

A new wave of high-end restaurants, such as New York's Bungalow and Semma, are earning Michelin stars and drawing massive waitlists by focusing on hyper-regional and authentic flavors rather than Americanized staples. This trend is fueled by a growing consumer interest in global cuisines, the increasing affluence of the Indian American population, and rising investor confidence. As a result, Indian cuisine is beginning to rival the prestige of established fine-dining categories like French and Italian, marking a new era for the industry.</p>

Newcomers such as Blank Street Coffee have gained a cult following through social media by offering a colorful array of matcha drinks that appeal to Gen Z. This shift, combined with the rise of home coffee machines and a preference for supporting smaller, artisanal shops, is putting pressure on established brands. Analysts suggest that chains stuck in the middle—neither a quick, cheap option nor a high-end treat—must innovate to stay relevant in an increasingly competitive market.</p>

Furthermore, the fundamental success of cash transfers—giving people money to alleviate poverty—was demonstrated. The article emphasizes that decades of research have proven that cash assistance has strong, long-term benefits, especially for children, improving health, education, and lifetime earnings, and remains one of the simplest and most effective ways to combat poverty.</p>
