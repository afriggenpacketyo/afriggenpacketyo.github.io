        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Broadcom's stock value increased by over 10% after the company revealed a new $10 billion order for custom artificial intelligence chips from a fourth major, unnamed customer. Analysts from several firms, including Mizuho and Cantor Fitzgerald, speculate the client is the AI startup OpenAI, following reports of a co-designed chip. This significant order has boosted the company's revenue forecast for the upcoming year, when shipments are set to begin. The news underscores Broadcom's growing prominence alongside Nvidia in the competitive AI hardware market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, marking the largest one-day drop in over a year and the lowest rate since October of the previous year. This sharp decline followed the release of a weaker-than-expected August employment report, which influenced market sentiment. For a homeowner purchasing a median-priced home, this rate drop could translate to a monthly payment reduction of nearly $170. While the decrease provides relief for potential buyers, analysts question if it is substantial enough to reinvigorate housing market demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of over 40,000 pounds of cocaine and the apprehension of 36 suspected smugglers in the Eastern Pacific Ocean over the past month. The seizures were part of Operation Pacific Viper, an initiative designed to increase force presence and disrupt trafficking routes from South America. The agency released images from the operations, including one of a burning vessel that was intercepted in mid-August. This series of successful interceptions highlights heightened counter-drug efforts in both the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.8 billion, the second-largest prize in U.S. lottery history, ahead of the next drawing. Winners face a choice between an annuity or a lump-sum cash option of approximately $826.4 million, both of which are subject to significant taxes. A mandatory 24% federal withholding is applied upfront to prizes over $5,000, but the final tax bill will be higher as the winnings push the recipient into the top 37% federal income tax bracket. State taxes may also apply, further reducing the total take-home amount. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The city of Norwalk, California, has agreed to repeal a controversial local law that banned the development of homeless shelters as part of a settlement with the state. California Attorney General Rob Bonta had sued the Los Angeles County community, alleging the ban violated fair housing and anti-discrimination laws. Under the settlement, Norwalk will also dedicate $250,000 toward new affordable housing and accept increased state monitoring of its housing policies. State officials emphasized that they will continue to take legal action against municipalities that attempt to block necessary housing solutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, an analysis of lottery data reveals how a winner's location can dramatically affect their net winnings. After federal taxes, which reduce the prize significantly, state income taxes can take another large cut. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing winners to keep the most money. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would result in the lowest after-tax payout for the winner. The current jackpot is the second-largest in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new, ambitious 10-year compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth up to $1 trillion. The plan involves awarding Musk 423 million shares, currently valued at $143 billion, contingent on the company meeting aggressive market capitalization, production, and profitability goals. To receive the full award, Tesla's market cap would need to reach $8.5 trillion, and the company must achieve major milestones in vehicle delivery, robotaxi production, and its humanoid robot program. This proposal follows a Delaware court's decision to revoke his previous $56 billion pay package.</p>

          <p>Less than two months after his last release, Justin Bieber has dropped a new 23-track album titled "Swag II." The collection continues the indie rock and '80s R&B-influenced sound of its predecessor, featuring collaborations with artists like Tems, Lil B, and Hurricane Chris. Produced by many of the same collaborators as the first "Swag" album, the new record focuses on themes of marriage, fatherhood, and religion. The album arrived with minimal advance notice, a strategy Bieber also used for his previous project, and is expected to perform strongly on streaming platforms.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to issue an executive order creating a formal designation for state sponsors of wrongful detention, enabling the U.S. to impose penalties on such countries. This measure, modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism list, will provide the State Department with tools to punish nations that use detained Americans as political leverage. The order aims to deter the practice and encourage the release of currently held U.S. nationals. The move follows several high-profile cases of Americans being detained on what critics call unsubstantiated charges in countries like Russia and Iran.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed legislation raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This change modifies the $10,000 cap that was implemented as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The SALT deduction, which primarily benefits taxpayers in high-tax states, allows those who itemize to deduct state and local income and property taxes from their federal tax liability. Critics of the higher cap argue it will significantly increase the national debt, with estimates suggesting a cost of over $142 billion over ten years. (not investment advice)</p>
