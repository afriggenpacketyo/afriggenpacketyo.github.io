          <p>China's trade performance in July surpassed market forecasts, with exports showing robust growth and imports recording their most significant increase in a year. Official customs data revealed that exports climbed 7.2% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms, beating the 5.4% rise predicted by economists. Meanwhile, imports grew by 4.1% from the previous year, a sharp acceleration from the 1.1% growth seen in June and defying expectations of a 1.0% decline. This economic data provides a positive signal amid ongoing global trade uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>United Airlines has resolved a significant technology issue that led to a nationwide ground stop for several hours, affecting major hubs like Newark, Denver, and Chicago. The problem was traced to the airline's "Unimatic" system, which manages critical flight data for weight, balance, and timing. While the underlying issue is fixed, the airline anticipates residual delays as it works to restore normal operations. United stated the disruption was a controllable delay, meaning it will cover applicable customer expenses like hotels where necessary.</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring after a 25-year career, just months after returning from a challenging and prolonged mission in space. Wilmore co-piloted the first crewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner, which experienced technical issues that extended his and his crewmate's stay on the International Space Station to over nine months. Despite the mission's difficulties and the narrative of being 'stranded,' Wilmore maintained they were prepared for the extended duration. His retirement follows a distinguished career that included three space missions and service as a Naval officer and test pilot.</p>

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel returned to the Hollywood Bowl for a performance marking the 20th anniversary of his U.S. debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The concert featured a unique pairing of Duke Ellington's symphonic works with Maurice Ravel's jazz-influenced piano concertos, performed by pianist Seong-Jin Cho. The review praises the orchestra's ability to handle Ellington's swinging style, a rarity for classical ensembles. While the week is a joyful homecoming for Dudamel, it is also bittersweet, as his Venezuelan orchestra's planned visit was canceled due to travel issues.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to introduce a new regulatory framework for the non-surgical cosmetic industry to enhance public safety. The proposals include a licensing scheme for clinics offering procedures like Botox and dermal fillers, requiring them to meet strict standards for training, safety, and insurance. For higher-risk treatments such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), only qualified health professionals will be permitted to perform them. The crackdown aims to protect consumers from rogue practitioners and the potential harm caused by unregulated beauty treatments, including age restrictions for certain procedures.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, has predicted that a record number of 18-year-old students are likely to be accepted into their first-choice university this year, even if they narrowly miss their grades. This trend is attributed to universities seeking the financial stability offered by domestic undergraduates amid uncertainty surrounding international student enrollment. With universities making more offers, there is increased competition to fill courses. This situation provides a favorable environment for UK students as they await their A-level and other qualification results next week.</p>
