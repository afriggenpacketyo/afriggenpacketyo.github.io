          <h2>Trump to Announce US-UK Trade Deal Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 04:33:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to announce a trade deal with the United Kingdom, potentially easing investor concerns about global tariffs. The UK government has also suggested considering lowering tariffs on US cars and cutting digital sales tax affecting US tech companies. The announcement follows Trump's earlier imposition of broad tariffs on US trading partners, many of which were later reversed or paused for negotiations, with the exception of the 145% levy on Chinese imports. A trade deal with the US is considered vital by Prime Minister Starmer's government, particularly after the UK recently struck a free trade agreement with India.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's strategy of nurturing a relationship with President Trump appears to be paying off with an imminent trade agreement between the UK and the US, a significant political victory for Starmer. The details of the agreement remain unclear but the fact that Britain is the first country to conclude a deal with the United States after Trump imposed tariffs on other trading partners affirms the 'special relationship' between the two nations. Starmer has avoided criticizing Trump and has acted as a bridge between Europe and the US, even coaching President Zelensky on mending his relationship with Trump, according to the article. The deal could help buoy Britain‚Äôs confidence amid faltering economic growth, but also presents potential hurdles with resetting trade relations with the European Union.</p>

          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, as it reported its fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year results. The company's forecast is based on current U.S. tariff rates, with President Shuntaro Furukawa noting that additional tariffs could decrease demand in the U.S. If prices need to be adjusted, duties could significantly impact profit, potentially costing tens of billions of yen. Nintendo delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. following the initial announcement of Trump's tariffs, as its consoles are manufactured in Vietnam, which faces substantial duties.</p>

President Trump alluded to the agreement on social media, surprising the UK side, which had been expecting an announcement, and while the details are still emerging, it is expected to be a more specific deal to reduce tariffs on particular goods.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie, the famous British novelist who died in 1976, has been brought back to 'teach' an online writing course using artificial intelligence. The course, offered by BBC Maestro, features a digital prosthetic of Christie created with AI and performed by an actor, using scripts based on her writings and interviews. While the project has the approval of Christie's family, it raises ethical questions about the use of AI to recreate deceased individuals and whether it accurately represents their views. This event is occurring amid debates about the ethics of AI, including copyright law and the use of AI to create likenesses of deceased individuals.</p>
