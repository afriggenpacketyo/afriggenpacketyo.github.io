          <p>This article from DW explains the formation and purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which was established in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion after World War II and promote political integration in Europe. The core of NATO is its collective security alliance, outlined in Article 5, which ensures mutual defense if a member state is attacked. The article details NATO's expansion over the years, including the addition of former Warsaw Pact countries and, most recently, Sweden, while also highlighting the ongoing tensions with Russia over Ukraine's potential membership. The article clarifies NATO's open-door policy and the requirements for aspiring members to contribute to the alliance's security. </p>

          <p>Senate Republicans and the House are considering changes to the child tax credit as part of President Trump's spending bill. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 temporarily increased the child tax credit to $2,000, but this is set to expire after 2025. The Senate bill proposes permanently increasing the credit to $2,200 starting in 2025 and indexing it for inflation, while the House bill suggests a $2,500 credit from 2025 through 2028, which would then revert to $2,000. Policy experts note that neither version would significantly benefit the lowest-earning families. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists predict that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could flourish in UK waters due to rising ocean temperatures. A study by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change, with many potentially finding new habitats in the North Sea. While mobile species are expected to adapt well, static creatures like sea pens and ocean quahogs may struggle, impacting ecosystems and food chains. The report emphasizes the need for careful management and reduced pressures like fishing and pollution to ensure these species thrive in new habitats. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate, defying President Trump's repeated calls for a rate cut. The Fed has adopted a wait-and-see approach to assess the potential effects of Trump's tariff policy on the U.S. economy. While inflation has eased and job growth has slowed, the Fed remains cautious about the possibility of tariffs causing stagflation. Trump has criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates more aggressively, but Powell has reaffirmed the independence of the Fed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the U.S. imposes duties on various countries, businesses are increasingly using 'tariff engineering' to lower their duty payments by altering materials or dimensions of products to fit into different harmonized system codes.

Examples include adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry and adding fuzzy-felt fabric to the soles of sneakers to classify them as slippers.
