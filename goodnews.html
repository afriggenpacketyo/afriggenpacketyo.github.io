          <p>An extensive exhibition of works by 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin is now on display at the National Museum of China in Beijing. The collection, featuring 48 oil paintings and numerous sketches from Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, is curated to emphasize the artist's "Russianness" and his connection to St. Petersburg's Imperial Academy of Arts. This focus on Repin's Russian identity comes as Ukraine, where the artist was born, has also claimed him as part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition highlights a cultural dimension of the ongoing geopolitical tensions between the two nations.</p>

Known for his inquisitive nature and dedication, Baker has overcome previous back injuries, partly crediting a daily routine of drinking bone broth. The young bowler is recognized for his high-speed deliveries and meticulous note-taking on opponents like Steve Smith. Despite his rapid ascent, Baker remains focused on his immediate goals, expressing excitement about the opportunity to learn from seasoned players like James Anderson.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's new head coach, Ruben Amorim, is implementing significant changes to restore the club's success after a difficult previous season. His plan involves a specific tactical formation with three central defenders and a deeper role for captain Bruno Fernandes. Amorim has also established a six-player leadership group to manage the dressing room and has reduced his media commitments to focus more on coaching. While known for his jovial and modern approach, he has also laid out a strict code of conduct, aiming to bring confidence and structure back to the team ahead of a challenging start to the season.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has posted on social media for the first time since her "Good Jeans" ad campaign for American Eagle sparked a divided public response. The campaign, which played on the term "great genes," was criticized by some for having racial undertones, while others praised it for challenging "woke" advertising. Sweeney, who has not publicly commented on the controversy, shared photos from a night out with friends. Reputation experts suggest the firestorm could ultimately boost her career and earning potential by increasing her public profile, regardless of the backlash from some quarters. This is one of two Fox News articles selected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-standing guideline known as the "85th percentile rule" is being reconsidered by some U.S. states for setting speed limits. This rule suggests that the posted speed limit should match the speed of the 15th-fastest car out of 100, assuming most drivers naturally travel at a safe speed. However, critics argue this creates a feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, especially in urban areas with pedestrians. In response to rising road fatalities, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that other factors like road use and crash frequency should be considered, prompting a shift toward more context-sensitive policies.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method that can make organs, including the brain, transparent, offering an unprecedentedly clear view of their internal structures. The technique creates what is described as "ionic glassy tissue," which preserves the organ's original shape and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells and molecules. This process allows for highly accurate and vivid 3D imaging of biological structures. The resulting transparent tissue can also be stored long-term at low temperatures, providing a powerful new tool for biological research.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers reclaimed sole possession of first place in the NL West with a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, who committed a series of critical mistakes. In the first two innings alone, Dodgers catcher Will Smith threw out three Padres runners attempting to steal, neutralizing San Diego's offense. The Dodgers capitalized on walks and a costly error by Padres center fielder Jackson Merrill to build an early 5-0 lead on just one hit. The win not only extended the Dodgers' division lead but also clinched the head-to-head season series, which serves as a potential tiebreaker.</p>

          <h2>China Proposes Hypersonic Drone Carrier Design Featuring a Pivoting 'Scissor Wing'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 22:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have proposed a design for a hypersonic drone carrier that revives NASA's "scissor wing" concept. The design features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, while at transonic speeds, it pivots to 45 degrees to mitigate shock waves. For hypersonic flight at Mach 5, the wing aligns parallel with the fuselage, turning the entire aircraft into a "waverider" for high efficiency. This innovative approach aims to solve the aerodynamic compromises inherent in aircraft designed for both low and high-speed flight.</p>

          <h2>Couples Therapist Explains Five Psychological Triggers for Infidelity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological reasons why people, even those who consider themselves "good," risk their careers and families for an affair. These triggers include a lifetime of repressing one's own needs to be "good," the burnout from perfectionism, having poor boundaries established in childhood, and being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage. Additionally, a recent significant loss, such as the death of a parent, can act as a catalyst for re-evaluating life priorities. The article suggests that understanding these underlying pressures is key to preventing such personal crises.</p>

          <h2>Small Aircraft Conducts Emergency Landing on San Diego Highway</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 21:35:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A small private plane made a successful emergency landing on Interstate 805 in San Diego's Sorrento Valley on Saturday afternoon. The aircraft was reportedly en route from Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport to Miramar Marine Corps Air Station when it experienced mechanical issues, forcing the pilot to land on the highway. The California Highway Patrol responded to the scene, and fortunately, no injuries were reported from the incident. The landing resulted in a temporary closure of all southbound lanes as authorities investigated and worked to remove the aircraft from the roadway.</p>
