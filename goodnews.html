          <p>Members of the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber team have shared details of Operation Midnight Hammer, a successful 36-hour mission in June that struck three Iranian nuclear facilities. President Trump announced an order for 28 new B-2 bombers, emphasizing their critical role in U.S. air defense due to their unique combination of long-range, high payload, and stealth capabilities. Commanders lauded the mission's flawless execution, highlighting the deployment of Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs specifically designed for deep underground targets. This operation, which involved stealth fighter escorts into advanced enemy airspace, underscored the B-2's strategic importance and the military's confidence in its advanced capabilities against sophisticated threats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Instagram, through its parent company Meta, is implementing new content restrictions for teen accounts, aligning them with PG-13 movie ratings to ensure age-appropriate content by default. These automatic protections, set to be fully implemented by the end of the year, will block search results for terms like "alcohol" or "gore" and prevent users under 18 from following or interacting with accounts posting age-inappropriate material. Opting out of the 13+ setting will require parental permission, and a "Limited Content" option offers even stricter filtering. This initiative aims to reassure parents and provide teens with a safer, more controlled online experience, also applying to AI interactions to avoid age-inappropriate responses.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the M23 rebel group have agreed to establish an international body to monitor the ceasefire they initially agreed upon in July, which had previously failed to halt fighting. The deal, mediated by Qatar in Doha, aims to investigate and verify violations, communicate with parties to prevent hostilities, and prepare for a comprehensive peace agreement. Qatar, the U.S., and the African Union will participate as observers in this mechanism, which will also include representatives from the Congolese government and M23. This agreement is seen as a pivotal step towards lasting peace in eastern Congo, a region plagued by conflict and displacement.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 19:32:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major three-year study has found that specially designed group singing classes are clinically effective in treating new mothers experiencing postnatal depression, offering a potentially cost-effective solution for healthcare services. The "Melodies for Mums" program, which incorporates lullabies, folk, and gospel songs, has shown to significantly reduce symptoms, with improvements lasting up to six months post-intervention. Researchers suggest the benefits stem from enhanced social connection among peers and the inherent relaxing effect of singing itself, with early cortisol measurements indicating reduced stress levels. This initiative provides a valuable complementary or alternative therapy for mothers facing long waiting lists for traditional mental health services.</p>

          <p>Jess Smith, a former Australian Paralympic swimmer, discovered significant bias in AI image generators when ChatGPT initially failed to create an accurate image of a woman missing her left arm. Despite specific prompts, the AI produced images with two arms or prosthetics, attributing the difficulty to a lack of diverse data. While OpenAI has since updated its model to accurately represent her disability, the article highlights ongoing issues, such as Naomi Bowman's experience of AI altering her face to "even out" her eyes. Experts emphasize that AI bias reflects societal inequalities and the urgent need for more diverse data sets and inclusive training to ensure fair representation for all.</p>

          <p>Wim van den Heever has been named Wildlife Photographer of the Year for his captivating image of a rare brown hyena amidst the ruins of an abandoned diamond mining settlement in Kolmanskop, Namibia. Capturing the elusive, nocturnal animal took him a decade of patient effort with a camera trap. The annual exhibition at London's Natural History Museum showcases a diverse array of other winning entries, including Andrea Dominizi's "After the Destruction," which depicts a beetle on a logged tree, symbolizing habitat loss. The collection also features images of peppered moray eels scavenging, an orb-weaver spider, and an Alpine ibex, collectively celebrating the beauty and challenges of the natural world.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is making an aggressive pivot towards vertical integration, aiming to control every aspect of its business from core models to infrastructure and hardware, a strategy reminiscent of tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. The company has partnered with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators and plans to deploy them by late 2026, gaining deeper control over its technology stack. This move, part of the "Stargate" campaign, also includes massive investments with Nvidia and AMD, totaling hundreds of billions, and the acquisition of Jony Ive's startup to explore AI-native consumer devices. OpenAI's rapid expansion seeks to establish it as the dominant leader in the evolving AI ecosystem.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep and Chrysler, plans to invest $13 billion in its U.S. manufacturing operations over the next four years, creating over 5,000 new jobs and increasing domestic production by 50%. This substantial investment, part of CEO Antonio Filosa's turnaround strategy, will bring new vehicles to plants across Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. While President Trump's tariffs aim to boost U.S. manufacturing, Filosa downplayed them as the primary driver, emphasizing the company's long-term planning for growth in the largest market it operates. The plan includes a midsize truck for Toledo and new Jeep vehicles for Belvidere, marking a significant commitment to expanding the company's American footprint. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBA star Tyrese Haliburton, a Wisconsin native and former Milwaukee Brewers fan, is now actively rooting against them in the NLCS due to an alleged snub. Haliburton claims the Brewers canceled his ceremonial first pitch last summer after his Indiana Pacers eliminated the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA playoffs. Since then, he has publicly demonstrated his changed allegiance, wearing rival Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers jerseys while the Brewers faced those teams in high-stakes postseason games. This high-profile and somewhat unusual shift in loyalty highlights a unique intersection of professional sports and personal grievances, as the Brewers continue their pursuit of only their second World Series berth.</p>

          <p>Women in China are actively reshaping their identities and futures, a dynamic trend symbolized by the social media phenomenon of urban professional women, like "Tracy," temporarily adopting their rural identities as "Cuihua" during Lunar New Year. This contrast masks a deeper societal transformation, building on the foundation of the People’s Republic of China's 1950 Marriage Law, which committed to "equal rights for men and women." After decades of both progress and persistent challenges, Chinese women are increasingly asserting their agency and redefining traditional roles. This ongoing evolution reflects significant social and cultural shifts, empowering them to actively rewrite their personal and collective narratives for the future.</p>
