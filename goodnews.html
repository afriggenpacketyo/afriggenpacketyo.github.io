          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that U.S.-China trade talks have stalled and require direct engagement between President Trump and President Xi Jinping to progress. Despite a breakthrough agreement in Switzerland on May 12, where both countries agreed to roll back recent tariff increases for 90 days, disagreements persist regarding tech restrictions on Beijing and China's restrictions on rare earths. Bessent expressed confidence that China would return to the table once President Trump communicates his preferences, highlighting the good relationship between the two leaders. Analysts suggest China will only agree to a call if there is certainty of no surprises from the U.S. during the conversation. (not investment advice)</p>

The dismissal comes amid efforts by the Trump administration to demonstrate its support for the crypto industry, with the Justice Department having shut down its crypto enforcement team.

          <p>Political philosopher Erica Benner challenges the popular view of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli as a proponent of ruthless pragmatism, arguing that his famous work, *The Prince*, is actually a satirical critique of authoritarian power. Benner suggests Machiavelli is more concerned with human nature and the creation of a politics that allows people to coexist. She emphasizes Machiavelli's republicanism, particularly evident in *Discourses on Livy*, where he advocates for shared power and constitutional checks. Benner also analyzes how Machiavelli's insights can be applied to contemporary politics, particularly in understanding leaders like Trump and the dangers of undermining institutions.</p>

          <p>Christina Ramberg's art delves into the artificiality of the female body and the ways women construct themselves through mass-market products. Her paintings often feature fragmented and depersonalized images of women's bodies, such as torsos in corsets and intricately arranged hairstyles. Ramberg's work emerged during a period of contradictions, as second-wave feminism coincided with cultural debates about sexual liberation. Her paintings blend elements of advertisements, comic panels, and voyeuristic photography, exploring themes of control, desire, and the constructed nature of identity.</p>

          <p>Amelie Mauresmo, the French Open director, has responded to criticism regarding the scheduling of night sessions, which have predominantly featured men's singles matches. Only four women's matches have been included in the night sessions since their introduction in 2021, and none since 2023. Mauresmo cited the potential for women's matches to be shorter as the justification, stating that two sets can go "really fast" in a three-set format. She also noted that the tournament avoids scheduling two matches in the night session to prevent late finishes.</p>

          <p>The euro has been gaining strength against the dollar, prompting European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde to suggest that the euro could play a greater international role. Lagarde highlighted geopolitical shifts and the rise of zero-sum thinking as opportunities for the euro to gain influence. A stronger euro could offer benefits such as lower borrowing costs, protection from exchange rate volatility, and greater autonomy for Europe. However, market analysts are divided on the euro's potential to significantly challenge the dollar's dominance as the world's reserve currency. (not investment advice)</p>
