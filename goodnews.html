          <p>Major League Baseball is reportedly close to finalizing new three-year media rights deals with Disney's ESPN, Comcast's NBC Sports, and Netflix for various packages of live games. Under the proposed terms, NBC would acquire all of the league's Sunday games and Wild Card playoff games for approximately $200 million annually. Netflix is set to secure the rights to the popular Home Run Derby for about $50 million a year, marking a notable entry for the streaming giant into live MLB events. ESPN, which opted out of its previous deal, is getting a new package valued at $550 million, including MLB TV and in-market games for five local teams. This article details a significant restructuring of MLB's broadcast landscape, aiming to diversify its media presence and capitalize on new distribution channels.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock rose by approximately 6% after President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. government would take an equity stake in the struggling chipmaker, suggesting a 10% share of the company. While a White House official clarified that discussions are ongoing and Intel's CEO has not explicitly agreed to a deal, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick previously indicated the government sought equity in exchange for CHIPS Act funds. This potential move signifies a distinct shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the government actively investing in key domestic industries to boost advanced chip manufacturing. This article highlights a significant government intervention in the tech sector, aimed at bolstering national capabilities despite Intel's recent slowdown in factory construction plans.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that conditions "may warrant" adjusting the policy stance towards interest rate cuts, citing "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies that are shifting the balance of risks. Speaking at the Fed's annual conclave in Jackson Hole, Powell noted that while the labor market remains strong, tariffs pose a risk of renewed inflation, creating a complex environment for monetary policymakers. He reaffirmed the Fed's independence from political pressure, stating that decisions would be based solely on their assessment of economic data and its implications.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will drop many of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, though significant levies on autos, steel, and aluminum will remain in place for now. This decision follows a recent phone call between Carney and President Donald Trump, marking the first direct communication since a trade agreement deadline was missed. The move, effective September 1, aims to re-establish free trade for most goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Carney asserts gives Canada a better tariff deal than other countries. This article highlights a significant step in easing trade tensions while ongoing negotiations continue for strategic sectors, emphasizing the complex diplomatic efforts to manage bilateral trade relations.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack voiced skepticism about lowering interest rates, a stance that differs from recent market enthusiasm sparked by Chair Powell's speech hinting at potential easing. Hammack emphasized the critical need to maintain a "modestly restrictive stance" in monetary policy to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target, noting that inflation has persistently remained above target for four years. She expressed strong concern that an accommodative policy could "reinvigorate inflationary pressures," highlighting a divergence of views within the Fed on the immediate path for interest rates. This article provides a crucial counterpoint to the prevailing market sentiment, underscoring the internal debates and cautious approach some policymakers advocate regarding future rate decisions.

          <p>Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's younger brother, publicly stated that Elon "deserves to be paid" in light of Tesla's ongoing legal battle over its CEO's compensation, noting Elon has received zero salary for years. Elon Musk is compensated through performance-based stock options, and was recently granted an "interim" package of 96 million shares worth approximately $29 billion, which still requires a long-term strategy and shareholder approval. This comes after a Delaware judge revoked his previous 2018 $56 billion package, the largest compensation plan in U.S. history for a public company executive.
