          <p>President Trump's budget reconciliation bill includes a measure aimed at restricting federal payments to abortion providers, which is already facing opposition from moderate House Republicans. Rep. Mike Lawler expressed concerns that the language needed further review, especially given the existing Hyde Amendment. With a slim majority, House Republicans risk dissent that could jeopardize the bill's passage, which seeks to cut spending and address Trump's priorities on issues like the border, immigration, and energy. The Energy & Commerce Committee is tasked with finding significant spending cuts within its jurisdiction, targeting Medicaid funds for large abortion providers, implementing work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries, and repealing Biden administration green energy subsidies. The article emphasizes the challenges Republicans face in passing the bill with minimal dissent.</p>

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng called the talks "in-depth" and "candid". The meetings, the first face-to-face discussions since President Trump's tariff hikes, raised hopes for potential tariff reductions and a reduction in the US's trade deficit. While details are forthcoming, the talks are seen as a significant step toward stabilizing the global economy and restoring confidence in the multilateral trading system.

          <p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad argues that President Trump's tariffs will hurt Americans more than targeted countries, increasing the U.S. cost of living. He suggests that American products will struggle to compete with cheaper alternatives, causing economic suffering that will eventually force Trump to reverse his decision. Mahathir believes ASEAN can withstand the impact through intergroup trade and business with other countries. He advocates for peaceful solutions rather than retaliation, emphasizing the importance of dialogue to address concerns over the tariffs' impact.

          <p>Astronomers have detected a supermassive black hole, roughly a million times the mass of the Sun, located far from the center of its galaxy. The discovery was made when a star passed too close to the black hole and was torn apart, creating a flare of light known as a tidal disruption event. This event, named AT2024tvd, revealed the presence of a wandering black hole, not gravitationally bound to the galaxy's central supermassive black hole. This discovery opens the possibility of finding more wandering black holes in future sky surveys.
