          <p>China's leading EV battery manufacturer, CATL, is bolstering its overseas expansion through a US$4.6 billion Hong Kong IPO, marking the largest IPO on the Hong Kong stock exchange in four years. The IPO is expected to be priced at the top end of its range, indicating strong investor confidence. CATL intends to use the raised funds to establish factories in overseas markets, which currently account for 30% of its total revenue. This move signifies China's ambition to promote its EV technologies globally, despite increasing international trade barriers, as the company aims to draw more international investors and industry officials.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has approved a $433 million joint venture between Apple supplier Foxconn and HCL Group to establish a semiconductor plant in Uttar Pradesh. This initiative aims to boost India's domestic chip manufacturing capabilities, aligning with the global shift of Apple suppliers away from China due to ongoing trade tensions. The facility is expected to be operational by 2027 and will produce display driver chips used in various electronics. With a planned production capacity of up to 20,000 wafers and 36 million display driver chips per month, the plant signifies India's growing prominence in the semiconductor industry.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article analyzes winning Eurovision Song Contest entries since 2000 to determine the key ingredients for success. The analysis suggests that singing about personal liberation, performing in English, alluding to folk music, and creating a memorable stage performance are crucial. However, the article advises against dramatic key changes and novelty acts. Staging should be spectacular and inspiring, and the use of fire can also help a performance stand out, so long as a piano is not burned in the process. The article highlights specific examples of past winners to illustrate these points.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced a 0.7% growth in the first three months of the year, surpassing analysts' forecasts, according to the latest official figures. The Office for National Statistics attributes this growth primarily to the services sector, with significant contributions from production. However, analysts caution that this growth rate may not be sustainable due to impending US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves celebrates the figures as evidence of the UK economy's strength, critics point to downgraded growth forecasts and the potential impact of rising employer National Insurance payments on job creation. The article also includes perspectives from business leaders on navigating the current economic challenges.</p>

          <p>The UK's faster-than-expected GDP growth of 0.7% in the first quarter of the year provides some positive news for the Labour government, which is under pressure to deliver on its economic promises. The growth, primarily driven by the services sector, comes after two weak quarters following Labour's ascent to power. While some analysts suggest that this growth may be a temporary surge before the impact of Donald Trump's trade tariffs, the recent US-China trade deal has eased some concerns. The article also considers the potential effects of the controversial rise in employer national insurance contributions, noting that its impact on employment has not yet been fully realized.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of its stockpiled rice to approximately 600,000 tons in an effort to control rising rice prices. This decision comes as rice prices remain near record highs due to a supply shortfall, prompting concerns about hoarding by wholesalers and farmers. While the increased release aims to stabilize prices, it would reduce the government's stockpile to around a third of the appropriate reserve level, raising questions about future responses to potential harvest failures. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage participation in auctions.</p>
