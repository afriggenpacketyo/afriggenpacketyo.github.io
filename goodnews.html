          <p>British comedian Sam Nicoresti has made history by winning the Best Comedy Show award at the Edinburgh Fringe festival, becoming the first transgender person to receive the prestigious accolade. Nicoresti was honored for the show "Baby Doomer," which explores life as a trans woman and was praised for its high joke count. In another historic win, Ayoade Bamgboye was named best newcomer for her show "Swings and Roundabouts," making her the first Black woman to earn that award. This year also marked the first time the festival did not present an award for the single funniest joke, shifting focus to the overall shows.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has erupted for the 31st time since December, sending lava fountains up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. The eruption is contained and poses no threat to homes, offering a spectacular view for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma buildup in a lower chamber is forcing periodic, high-pressure releases through narrow vents, creating the dramatic fountains. While the current eruption's duration is uncertain, it follows historical patterns of episodic activity, and researchers continue to monitor the volcano for changes using seismic and ground-deformation sensors.</p>

          <p>For the third consecutive year, the Georgia Institute of Technology has been ranked as the public college with the best return on investment, according to The Princeton Review. The rankings considered factors such as academics, financial aid, college costs, and post-graduation earnings. Georgia Tech's strong focus on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields likely contributes to the high salaries its graduates command, enhancing its value proposition. The report highlights that despite its academic rigor, the university fosters a supportive and collaborative environment rather than a cut-throat competitive one, making it an attractive option for students.</p>

          <p>Recent court decisions allowing college athletes to be compensated by advertisers, fans, and their universities are accelerating the professionalization of NCAA sports. This shift marks a dramatic change from the original amateur model of college athletics. As football and men's basketball generate massive revenue, the focus on these sports raises questions about the future of niche college sports like squash and water polo. The evolving landscape is reshaping not only the careers of student-athletes but also the fundamental experience and purpose of sports within higher education, highlighting a system that has long been changing.</p>

          <p>A restaurateur who had lost movement in his left arm and leg after a stroke has experienced significant recovery thanks to a novel medical implant called the Vivistim System. The FDA-approved device uses vagus nerve stimulation during physical therapy to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, a process known as neuroplasticity. After his rehabilitation progress had stalled, the patient received the implant at the Cleveland Clinic and has since made substantial gains in function and eliminated chronic pain. This technology represents a promising new frontier for stroke recovery, offering hope to patients with long-term motor deficits.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Guidance on Transferring Real Estate to Heirs Amid Great Wealth Transfer</h2>

          <p>As the great wealth transfer continues, financial advisors are providing strategies for families to pass down an estimated $25 trillion in real estate without incurring major tax burdens or inciting family conflict. Experts recommend transferring property through a will or trust at death to allow heirs to benefit from a stepped-up cost basis, minimizing capital gains taxes. Using legal structures like Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) can protect the property from lawsuits and creditors. It is also crucial to create a detailed operating agreement for shared properties and set aside liquid assets to cover ongoing expenses like maintenance and insurance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's Wardrobe Choices Signal Shift in Diplomatic Tone</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent choice of attire for a meeting with President Trump at the White House has been interpreted as a deliberate act of "wardrobe diplomacy." After being criticized for wearing a casual Henley shirt during a contentious previous visit, Zelenskyy opted for a more formal black canvas blazer and collared shirt. This subtle change was seen as a signal of a more serious, diplomatic approach, moving away from his bunker-chic wartime look. The shift in clothing appeared to improve the meeting's tone, illustrating how even seemingly minor details can send powerful political messages in high-stakes international relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of devastating storms like Hurricane Ian, Florida is grappling with how to rebuild for a more resilient future. Some residents are relocating to inland, purpose-built communities like Babcock Ranch, which was designed with storm-proof features and survived Ian with minimal damage. Others, particularly in lower-income areas with deep community roots, are relying on city programs and nonprofits to rebuild their homes to be stronger and more elevated. However, these efforts face significant challenges as federal funding for mitigation measures declines, forcing a greater reliance on local and private initiatives to protect against increasingly severe weather.</p>

          <p>Coventry City Football Club has successfully purchased the Coventry Building Society (CBS) Arena, its home stadium, from Frasers Group. Club owner Doug King hailed the acquisition as a "pivotal moment" that provides long-term stability and safeguards the club's future. The move ends years of uncertainty for the club and its supporters, who have endured multiple stadium owners and periods of playing at different grounds since leaving their original home in 2005. Owning the arena allows the club to invest directly in facilities and fan experience, signaling a new era of ambition and stability.</p>

          <p>A wave of younger Democratic candidates is launching primary challenges against some of the party's most senior incumbents, arguing that the establishment has grown complacent and out of touch. Frustrated by what they see as a failure to respond urgently to the threats posed by the Trump administration, these challengers are campaigning on a platform of generational change, energy, and a more aggressive political strategy. They contend that the party needs new voices to connect with voters and reimagine its core message. The incumbents are pushing back, emphasizing their experience and legislative accomplishments as essential in a volatile political climate.</p>

          <p>At 75 years old, Eddie Horne has received his high school diploma, decades after his education was cut short by severe abuse at the notorious Dozier School for Boys in Florida. Horne, who was sent to the brutal reform school at age 14, dropped out of high school to support his family but never gave up on his goal of graduating. He achieved his diploma through a compensation program established by the Florida legislature for victims of abuse at Dozier and a similar institution. Horne hopes his story of perseverance inspires others who have faced significant setbacks in their lives.</p>
