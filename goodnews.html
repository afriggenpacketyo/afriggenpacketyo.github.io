        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CoreWeave's CEO, Michael Intrator, addressed investor concerns regarding the company's high capital expenditure plans, which are projected to be between $20 billion and $23 billion for the year. Intrator explained that these expenditures are driven by strong demand signals from major clients, including OpenAI, who are requesting infrastructure at an accelerated pace. He reassured investors that financing remains robust and that CoreWeave is capable of repaying lenders within the terms of its contracts, citing their understanding of the company's business model and contracts. The company's financial strength is underlined by major deals with technology clients like Microsoft and Nvidia, signaling continued growth and confidence in its AI server rental business.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against dozens of immigrants caught in a new military zone on the US-Mexico border, citing that the immigrants did not know they were entering the military zone. Judge Gregory Wormuth ruled that the immigrants could not be charged with trespassing because they were unaware they were entering the restricted area. The immigrants still face charges for crossing the border illegally, but the dismissal marks a setback for efforts to increase penalties for unlawful crossings. The so-called New Mexico national defense area was established in April along 180 miles of the border, authorizing US army troops to detain immigrants.</p>

This strategy led to Lewandowski becoming the top scorer with 25 goals, Raphinha tallying 18, and a rejuvenated team dynamic that propelled Barcelona to win the La Liga title.

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, indicated that consumers could start seeing higher prices on goods due to tariffs, despite a recent agreement to lower duties on imports from China. He stated that the magnitude of the tariff increases is too significant for retailers and suppliers to absorb, and the effects will likely be seen towards the end of the month and more substantially in June. While Walmart beat quarterly earnings expectations, the company declined to provide specific earnings guidance for the fiscal second quarter due to fluctuating U.S. tariff policy. Despite these challenges, Walmart reported its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business in the U.S. and globally.</p>

          <p>A military parade planned in Washington, D.C., to commemorate the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade is expected to feature over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters, requiring extensive coordination with the FAA. Trump has defended the cost, stating it is "peanuts compared to the value of doing it," while Democrats have criticized the event as wasteful. This parade revives Trump's previous interest in military displays, reminiscent of a postponed 2018 event due to high cost estimates.</p>

          <p>Prince Royce has released a new album featuring bilingual covers of famous English-language pop songs from artists like The Beatles, Lionel Richie, and Stevie Wonder, giving them a 'spanglish' twist. The selection includes songs from the 70s, 80s, and even the 90s, with Royce aiming to blend rock, pop, R&B, and country. He also discusses the importance of preserving the essence of each song while adding his unique bachata style and the challenges of obtaining permissions for the covers. Royce also touches on his identity as a 100% Latino-Dominican and 100% American artist, and his desire to reintroduce these songs to a new generation.</p>
