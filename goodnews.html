          <p>Federal authorities have charged a 22-year-old Oregon man with orchestrating extensive global cyberattacks using a powerful network he allegedly created. The "Rapper Bot" botnet, comprised of tens of thousands of infected devices like routers and DVRs, was reportedly rented out to clients to conduct disruptive denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets in over 80 countries. Law enforcement successfully dismantled the network and took the alleged operator into custody as part of an ongoing international effort to combat cybercrime infrastructures. The man faces a potential prison sentence of up to 10 years if convicted.</p>

          <p>During a Philadelphia Phillies baseball game, former player and current color commentator John Kruk sparked a philosophical discussion on air. He mused about the invention of the first clock, asking his broadcast partner how its creator could have possibly known the correct time to set it. The question led to a brief on-air conversation about historical timekeeping methods, such as the sundial, providing a moment of lighthearted curiosity during the game. The article notes Kruk's penchant for asking such thought-provoking questions, which adds a unique element to his sports commentary and engages viewers beyond the action on the field.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock increased after the company reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast, even though its second-quarter earnings and revenue slightly missed Wall Street's expectations. The home improvement retailer noted that while homeowners still exhibit a "deferral mindset" regarding large projects due to economic uncertainty, it saw positive momentum with a rise in big-ticket transactions. The company's comparable sales grew for the second time in the last eleven quarters, indicating some recovery. Home Depot's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could further stimulate homebuying and renovation activity later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The registration authorizes BYD Auto Argentina not only to import and sell cars but also to manufacture vehicles, batteries, and auto parts. This development follows the company's previous investment in an electric bus plant in Argentina and its announcement of regional expansion plans. If production plans materialize, it would mark BYD's second vehicle factory in Latin America, further solidifying its presence in the region's growing EV market and supply chain.</p>

          <p>Major food service chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Dunkin' are increasingly focusing on new and customized beverage offerings to attract customers and drive sales. This trend is largely driven by younger consumers, particularly Gen Z, who show a strong preference for cold, flavorful, and unique drinks. Data shows that consumers are now more likely to visit a restaurant specifically for a beverage, rather than as an add-on to a meal. In response, companies are rolling out diverse options, from nostalgic cereal-flavored lattes to protein-infused cold foams, in a competitive effort to capture this growing and profitable market segment.</p>

The event, held before the main singles draws, created a festive atmosphere at Arthur Ashe Stadium. While popular with fans, the new format has polarized opinion, with some traditionalists and doubles specialists viewing it as more of an exhibition than a serious Grand Slam competition.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is reportedly developing a new artificial intelligence chip for the Chinese market, tentatively named the B30A, which is said to be more powerful than its current offerings. This move follows a deal where Nvidia and other chipmakers agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their sales in China in exchange for permission to sell certain technologies there. The Trump administration had previously halted the sale of advanced chips to China over national security concerns. In a statement, Nvidia confirmed it evaluates various products to compete where permitted, ensuring all offerings are approved by authorities for commercial use.</p>

The CHIPS Act was designed to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. This new requirement could set a precedent for other companies receiving federal funds under the program, as the administration seeks to convert grants into equity for the American people.

          <p>S&P Global has maintained its AA+ credit rating for long-term U.S. sovereign debt, citing an expectation that revenue from President Trump's tariff policies will largely offset the fiscal impact of his recent tax-and-spending legislation. The rating agency anticipates that the significant income from tariffs will counteract the weaker revenue resulting from the new law, which includes both tax cuts and spending reductions. However, S&P warned that it could lower the rating in the future if deficits increase due to an inability to contain spending or if political developments weaken U.S. institutions or the Federal Reserve's independence.
