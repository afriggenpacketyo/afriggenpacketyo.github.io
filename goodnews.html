          <p>Shares in SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a record high, marking their best performance in five years after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter profits. The Japanese investment giant posted a profit of 421.8 billion yen, significantly exceeding analyst estimates and reversing a loss from the previous year. The strong results were driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, its largest since 2021. This was attributed to positive performance from portfolio companies like Grab Holdings and the anticipation of upcoming IPOs for others. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued another nationwide injunction against President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens. This marks the fourth court decision to block the policy since a Supreme Court ruling in June limited the scope of such injunctions. The order, signed on the first day of Trump's second term, seeks to deny automatic citizenship to U.S.-born children if their parents are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. The judge certified a class action, stating the plaintiffs were likely to win their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment.</p>

Carano was dismissed following controversial social media posts, including one comparing the political climate for Republicans to the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but Carano expressed hope for "healing" and thanked Elon Musk, who had provided funding for her legal case. Lucasfilm released a statement describing Carano as well-respected and looked forward to potential future work opportunities.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly stated that the University of California should not "bend on their knees" while negotiating with the Trump administration to restore over half a billion dollars in frozen research grants for UCLA. The federal funding was suspended amid accusations of antisemitism on campus. Newsom criticized settlements made by other universities like Columbia and Brown, which involved large payments and concessions. He emphasized the importance of principles and academic freedom, expressing confidence that the UC system would "do the right thing" and not compromise its values.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance's office has claimed it had no knowledge of a Secret Service request to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to raise the water level of Ohio's Little Miami River. The adjustment was made ahead of a private boating trip for the Vice President's family. The Secret Service stated the measure was "operationally necessary" to ensure the safe navigation of its security detail and local law enforcement boats after one allegedly ran aground during a scouting mission. The incident drew some criticism and comparisons to a similar situation involving former Vice President Al Gore.</p>

          <p>The Southern Small White butterfly, a species typically found in Southern Europe, has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time. A volunteer photographed the butterfly at a nature reserve in Suffolk, confirming its presence. According to the charity Butterfly Conservation, the species has been rapidly expanding its range northward through Europe over the past two decades, moving at a rate of about 100 kilometers per year. While a warming climate is believed to be a contributing factor, it is not yet clear if the species will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials, are experiencing fatigue with dating apps and are turning to old-fashioned, in-person singles events to find partners. Companies like Date Cincy are hosting events that attract hundreds of people looking for genuine, face-to-face connections, free from the potential misrepresentation of online profiles. This trend aligns with data showing a decline in the popularity of dating apps and a 42% rise in attendance at singles events from 2022 to 2023. The shift reflects a craving for more authentic human interaction in the search for romantic relationships.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison. Haddix was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement. After claiming the celebrity chimp had died, Tonka was discovered alive in a small cage in her home. Animal rights group PETA, which had pursued legal action against Haddix, expressed relief at the sentencing, which they see as justice for the animal's suffering.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced that its experimental oral weight-loss pill, orforglipron, successfully helped adults with obesity lose a significant amount of weight in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Participants lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, with an efficacy and side effect profile similar to existing injectable GLP-1 therapies like Zepbound. The most common side effects included nausea and diarrhea. The company plans to submit the drug for FDA approval later this year, which could make a more convenient and potentially cheaper pill-based option available by 2026.</p>
