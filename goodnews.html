          <p>Sexual orientation is diverse and develops during puberty through an interplay of biological and psychosocial factors, with no single cause identified. Experts emphasize that sexual orientation is not a choice but rather a matter of fate, influenced by sex hormones and developing during adolescence. Once established, sexual preference remains stable throughout life, with attempts to change it proving unsuccessful. The article highlights the importance of accepting sexual diversity and combating discrimination against sexual minorities, noting that homosexuality remains punishable in many countries.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing "two bags fly free" policy, introducing checked bag fees for the first time in over half a century.

          <p>Anthropologist Sabine Hyland is studying khipus, knotted cords used by the Incas to record information, in the remote Peruvian village of Jucul. These khipus, locked away for centuries, could offer a breakthrough in understanding the lost writing system of the Inca empire. The Incas, who conquered a vast territory, used khipus for various purposes, including letters, calendars, and historical texts. Hyland and other scholars are employing linguistic analysis, radiocarbon dating, and artificial intelligence to decipher these cords and unlock the history of one of the greatest lost empires.</p>
