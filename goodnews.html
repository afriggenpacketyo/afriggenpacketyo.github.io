          <p>AI scientist De Kai proposes a new approach to artificial intelligence, suggesting it should be treated as a child that needs 'parenting' to avoid potential dangers. De Kai argues that AI learns by absorbing online content, making it crucial to be mindful of the influences it is exposed to. His book, "Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future," emphasizes the need for humans to act as conscientious role models for AI systems. This perspective shifts the focus from a US-China technological race to a more ethical and nurturing development of AI. This framework encourages a more responsible and thoughtful approach to AI development, emphasizing ethical considerations. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to launch a registration system to encourage people to maintain connections with rural areas affected by depopulation, with the goal of attracting over 10 million users in the next decade. This initiative, spearheaded by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, seeks to revitalize regional areas and reverse the trend of over-concentration in major cities like Tokyo. Registered nonresidents would receive information on local events and services, with the hope of broadening the program's appeal through tangible benefits. The government also aims to promote living and working in multiple areas to facilitate the movement of city dwellers to rural regions. The plan faces skepticism from some officials who question its novelty and effectiveness. </p>
