          <p>Technology giant Oracle is reportedly a key player in a consortium aiming to facilitate TikTok's continued operations in the U.S., contingent on a finalized framework deal between the United States and China. While commercial terms have been agreed upon, the specific structure, including ByteDance's ongoing involvement and control over TikTok's critical recommendation algorithm, remains ambiguous. Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping are slated to discuss the final terms this Friday, as the popular app faces a September 17th deadline to divest or be banned. This complex negotiation highlights the intertwined technological and geopolitical interests of both nations, with the Trump administration having previously issued orders to delay enforcement of the ban. The deal aims to address national security concerns while preserving the platform for its young user base.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Dodgers are considering using Shohei Ohtani in the bullpen during the playoffs, despite planning for him to primarily be a starting pitcher. President of baseball operations Andrew Friedman confirmed Ohtani would start, but noted unforeseen October scenarios could lead to relief appearances, citing past examples like Walker Buehler. Ohtani, returning from Tommy John surgery with a 3.75 ERA, has impressed as a starter but has innings limits and won't make consecutive starts on normal rest. His two-way status adds complexity, as MLB rules would remove him as a designated hitter if he pitches in relief, potentially restricting his use to late-game situations and creating a strategic dilemma for the team.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced a "framework" deal has been reached between the U.S. and China concerning the social media platform TikTok. The commercial terms are reportedly settled, with Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping scheduled to discuss the final terms this Friday. This agreement aims to pivot TikTok to U.S.-controlled ownership, addressing previous concerns about its foreign adversary-controlled status and potential national security threats. The deal comes ahead of a September 17th deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. business or face a ban, though the Trump administration has previously postponed enforcement. China's lead trade negotiator confirmed the framework but urged against further suppression of Chinese companies.</p>

          <p>Simon Leviev, the con artist featured in the 2022 Netflix documentary "The Tinder Swindler," has been arrested in Georgia at Interpol's request after arriving at Batumi airport. Leviev, whose real name is Shimon Yehuda Hayut, gained notoriety for allegedly posing as a wealthy diamond mogul on Tinder and swindling women out of an estimated $10 million through romance fraud. He was previously convicted of four fraud charges in 2019, serving only five months of a 15-month sentence. The documentary highlighted his elaborate scheme of luring victims with luxury and then feigning threats from "enemies" to extract significant funds, which he never repaid, leading to widespread criticism and legal action.</p>

          <p>Baker Mayfield orchestrated an impressive 11-play, 80-yard drive culminating in Rachaad White's two-yard touchdown run with just six seconds left, leading the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a dramatic 20-19 victory over the Houston Texans. Mayfield's crucial 15-yard scramble on fourth-and-10 sustained the game-winning possession. This marks Mayfield's second consecutive game-winning drive to start the season, making him only the second Buccaneers quarterback to achieve this feat. The Texans had taken a late 19-14 lead with over two minutes remaining, but their offense struggled in the second half, ultimately failing to prevent Tampa Bay's thrilling comeback victory.</p>

          <p>California is poised to potentially designate Diwali, the Hindu "Festival of Lights," as an official statewide holiday, following the Legislature's passage of Assembly Bill 268. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom before October 12, the bill would authorize community colleges and public schools to close on Diwali, and state employees could elect to take the day off. This initiative recognizes the festival's religious and historical importance, aiming to better enable the Indian diaspora and others to participate in one of the world's oldest religious holidays. With California hosting the nation's largest South Asian population, this move would provide significant recognition and representation for the community, mirroring similar actions in Pennsylvania and Connecticut.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets, including Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indexes, surged to fresh highs on Monday, driven by investor expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will resume its easing cycle with a rate cut this week. The dollar weakened as a result, while spot gold prices scaled a record high, supported by a weaker dollar and Fed cut expectations. Markets largely overlooked the confirmation of Stephen Miran to the Fed board and the appeals court decision on Lisa Cook, focusing instead on the anticipated 25-basis-point cut and potential dovish guidance. Additionally, the article notes a "framework" agreement on TikTok's U.S. ownership and China's accusation against Nvidia regarding anti-monopoly laws. (not investment advice)</p>

A defense ministry report indicates a backlog of US$21.54 billion across 18 active arms orders, with nearly US$4.5 billion worth of systems currently being delivered. While most orders are on schedule, some, like the AGM-154C Joint Standoff Weapon, face delays extending to 2026, pushing delivery nine years after congressional notification. The F-16V Block 70 fighter program is also behind schedule, though all 66 jets are still expected by the end of 2026, critically bolstering Taiwan's defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, just before a crucial interest rate vote. The two-to-one ruling upheld a lower court's decision, finding that firing Cook would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act's provisions designed to insulate the central bank from political pressure. Trump had sought to remove Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, citing unproven allegations of mortgage fraud related to conduct prior to her appointment. This decision allows Cook to participate in the upcoming Fed meeting and prevents Trump from immediately appointing a fourth nominee to gain a majority on the seven-member board, preserving a measure of the Fed's independence.</p>

Ronson reflects on how his childhood, marked by his parents' "angry crescendos and heavy silences," fostered a need for control that DJing ultimately fulfilled. The book serves as a heartfelt love letter to a bygone era of hip-hop and club culture, inspired by the death of a close friend and capturing the seediness and vibrancy of the scene.</p>

          <p>As autumn approaches, bringing a sense of fresh beginnings, experts offer four strategies for effective home decluttering, emphasizing its benefits for stress reduction and energy levels. Tips include starting small with individual drawers or cupboards to make the task manageable, and planning ahead for the disposal of items through donation, recycling, or selling, while being wary of "churning" unsold items. Prioritizing quality over quantity means keeping items that "reinforce and uplift" rather than those kept out of obligation. Distinguishing between nostalgia (longing for the past) and sentimentality (present emotional value) is crucial for deciding what to let go, recognizing that photos can often preserve memories more effectively than physical objects.</p>

          <p>The FDA is considering removing "black box" warnings from some menopause hormone therapy treatments, prompting a reevaluation of benefits and risks. Flawed 2002 research, focusing on older women who started therapy years after menopause, overstated risks like stroke, blood clots, dementia, and breast cancer. More recent studies emphasize that treatment timing and delivery method significantly mitigate risks, suggesting therapy started closer to menopause and continued until around age 60 is safer. While hormone therapy is highly effective for symptoms like hot flashes, a panel of experts has called for more input before changes are made, underscoring the evolving scientific understanding and the need for individualized patient-doctor consultations to assess risk.</p>

The three-team tournament, to be held at the Kingdom Arena in Riyadh and televised by Fox Sports, is a business venture disguised as a promotional stunt. It reflects the NFL's ongoing global expansion efforts and Saudi Arabia's significant investments in sports to diversify its economy and enhance its international image.</p>
