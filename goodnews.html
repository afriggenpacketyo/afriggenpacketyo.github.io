          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, reversing a recent, temporary pause on some shipments. The President stated the aid is necessary for Ukraine to defend itself amid ongoing conflict and high casualties. The decision comes after the White House confirmed a halt in some weapons transfers as part of a broader review of military stockpiles. The move follows recent calls between the U.S. president and the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia.</p>
