          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader and 2025 Nobel Peace Prize winner, María Corina Machado, expressed her gratitude to U.S. President Donald Trump for his efforts to promote peace and democracy worldwide. In a phone call with Trump, Machado conveyed the appreciation of the Venezuelan people for his actions in the Americas and beyond. The Nobel Committee recognized Machado for her courageous campaign against the authoritarian rule of Nicolás Maduro. Machado stated the award provides an injection of energy and hope for her movement, emphasizing the need for international support to cut the illicit financial flows that sustain the Maduro regime.</p>

          <p>Following what he described as a very productive phone call, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he urged U.S. President Donald Trump to help broker a peace agreement to end the war with Russia. Zelenskyy expressed optimism that if a war can be stopped in one region, it can be stopped elsewhere, referencing Trump's recent breakthrough in the Middle East. The conversation also covered bolstering Ukraine's air defense capabilities following a major Russian airstrike on the country's power grid. Relations between the two leaders have improved significantly since a tense White House meeting earlier in Trump's term.</p>

          <p>England secured a decisive 89-run victory over Sri Lanka, remaining unbeaten in the Women's World Cup. Captain Nat Sciver-Brunt was instrumental, scoring a sensational 117 runs after being dropped early in her innings, guiding England to a competitive total of 253-9. In response, Sri Lanka's batting effort was thwarted by a remarkable bowling spell from Sophie Ecclestone, who took four wickets for just 17 runs. The win places England at the top of the eight-team table as they continue their campaign.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five British army horses that bolted and ran through central London last year, has been honorably retired to a sanctuary in the countryside. The 15-year-old horse sustained a broken bone and serious bleeding after being spooked by construction noise during a morning exercise. Unable to return to his ceremonial duties with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, Quaker will now live at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire. The incident last April injured five soldiers and four civilians as the horses galloped for five miles through the city.</p>

          <p>A'ja Wilson led the Las Vegas Aces to their third WNBA title in four years, capping off a season of unprecedented individual achievement. The 29-year-old became the first player in WNBA or NBA history to win the scoring title, Most Valuable Player, Defensive Player of the Year, and Finals MVP in the same season. After a rocky start to the season, Wilson's leadership and a crucial mid-season team meeting sparked a 16-game winning streak into the playoffs. Her dominant performance throughout the finals has solidified her position in the conversation for the greatest player in the league's history.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's rapid growth and vertical integration are creating a level of market dominance unlike anything previously seen in Silicon Valley, causing both concern and opportunity for startups. The privately held company is investing heavily across the entire tech stack, from data center infrastructure to consumer apps and hardware, leaving entrepreneurs questioning where viable business opportunities remain. While some venture capitalists see a "gold rush mentality" with room for many companies to succeed, especially in niche or regulated industries, OpenAI's speed and massive spending create an opaque and unpredictable competitive landscape.

          <p>Members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) have backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum by winning a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election. The plan was endorsed at the party's conference, favoring a precedent-based approach over an amendment that would have treated the election as a de-facto vote on independence itself. Swinney asserted this is the most realistic path forward, despite UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's previous statements that he could not imagine another referendum taking place during his tenure.</p>

          <p>A growing number of younger consumers, part of Gen Z, are pushing back against the trend of "fast furniture"—cheap, mass-produced decor not built for longevity. Driven by awareness of furniture's large carbon footprint, budget constraints, and a desire for unique items with a story, they are increasingly turning to secondhand marketplaces. This shift challenges a market that encourages frequent redecoration with disposable items, which contributes to millions of tons of waste annually. The trend is reflected in a massive surge in online searches for secondhand decor and kitchens.</p>

          <p>White House envoy Steve Witkoff addressed a large rally in Tel Aviv, praising President Trump for brokering the recent peace plan and ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are returning to their devastated homes in Gaza, where the UN is scaling up aid deliveries. The situation remains tense, with an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon killing at least one person. In anticipation of a prisoner exchange, Israel has begun transferring Palestinian prisoners to two facilities ahead of the release of 48 hostages held by Hamas.</p>

          <p>Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed the critical role President Donald Trump played in brokering a potential peace agreement between Israel and Hamas. ABC News' Jonathan Karl argued that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has built his career on understanding American politics, is fundamentally dependent on U.S. support. As American public opinion on the conflict has shifted, pressure from Trump became a decisive factor in bringing the Israeli government to the negotiating table. The discussion highlighted how this turning point could lead to a historic deal to end the war in Gaza.</p>
