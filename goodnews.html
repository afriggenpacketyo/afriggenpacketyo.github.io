          <p>Japanese stock markets achieved new record highs on Thursday, with the Nikkei 225 index closing at 45,754.93 for its sixth consecutive day of gains. This performance contrasted with mixed results across the broader Asia-Pacific region, where markets diverged from Wall Street's recent tech sell-off. While Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw a rise, markets in South Korea and Taiwan experienced slight declines. The positive momentum in Japan reflects investor confidence despite global uncertainties.

After a difficult season at Bayern Munich, he was signed by Liverpool and has since flourished, particularly under manager Arne Slot, who has given him more attacking freedom. Gravenberch has become a standout performer for the league-leading team, showcasing exceptional skill in carrying the ball and creating chances. His resurgence is seen as a fulfillment of the immense potential he showed as a young talent at Ajax.</p>

          <p>State-backed entities in China, known as the "national team," held a combined total of 3.94 trillion yuan (US$553.1 billion) in domestic stocks as of June. This significant holding, which surpasses that of foreign investors, is seen as a key factor in buttressing the market and contributing to a key stock benchmark reaching a decade high. This strategy aligns with the government's emphasis on financial stability and promoting the stock market as a means for wealth preservation amid a property market downturn. The state's role is viewed as a persistent form of market support. (not investment advice)</p>

At a recent summit, Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang stated that the system has entered a new phase of global development after 31 years of work. BeiDou has already achieved a dominant market share of over 70% within China, powering a wide range of consumer devices and services. The push for international expansion aims to make this critical infrastructure available to a broader base of global users.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are one win away from securing the National League West title after a 5-4 extra-innings victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The game showcased the team's resilience and improvisational strategy, notably using starting pitchers Roki Sasaki and Clayton Kershaw as effective relievers. Despite the bullpen squandering a late lead, the Dodgers rallied, with Tommy Edman driving in the winning run in the 11th inning. The successful use of starters in relief roles may offer a blueprint for the team's pitching strategy in the upcoming postseason.</p>

The judge sided with 20 states that had sued, finding the policy to be "arbitrary and capricious" and noting that withholding critical disaster relief funds would cause irreparable harm to public safety.</p>

The case has gained international attention, with the farm owners having been briefly arrested for obstructing agents who were preparing for the cull.

          <p>African nations imported a record amount of Chinese-made solar panels in the first seven months of the year, signaling a rapid expansion of solar capacity across the continent. According to an Oxford Economics study, imports reached 9,516 megawatts, a significant increase from the previous year. This surge is driven by falling costs and the development of large-scale energy projects by Chinese firms in countries like South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria. Given China's dominance in solar panel manufacturing, these import figures serve as a strong indicator of Africa's accelerating transition towards renewable energy.</p>
