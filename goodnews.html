          <p>Eight female college athletes are appealing a $2.8 billion NCAA settlement, arguing it violates Title IX due to its disproportionate allocation favoring men's sports.  The appeal has halted back payments, potentially delaying compensation for over a year.  Despite this, the NCAA's new plan to allow schools to pay current players directly will proceed as scheduled. This highlights ongoing issues of gender equity in college athletics.</p>
