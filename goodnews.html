          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed China's commitment to bolstering advanced manufacturing, a strategy that has been criticized by the U.S. and trade partners for exacerbating global trade imbalances. During a visit to Henan province, Xi told workers that self-reliance in advanced manufacturing is crucial for China's economy. This push for self-sufficiency, especially in high-tech sectors, could clash with the Trump administration's demands to address trade imbalances and state subsidies to Chinese companies. Experts anticipate that China is unlikely to scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, potentially leading to continued trade tensions with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) plans to implement a new Digital Targeting Web to better connect soldiers with information from satellites, aircraft, and drones. This initiative aims to enhance the speed and precision of identifying and engaging enemy targets, drawing lessons from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The UK military has faced over 90,000 cyber-attacks in the past two years, leading to the creation of a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command to oversee cyber operations and electronic warfare.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-over-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of anticipated higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars.

Despite U.S. President Donald Trump imposing an additional 25% tariff on cars produced outside the United States, Toyota has stated it will not pass on the cost to consumers.

The court rejected the Trump administration's justification of the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), stating that it would be unconstitutional for Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.
