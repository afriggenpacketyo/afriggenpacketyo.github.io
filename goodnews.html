          <p>Bitcoin achieved a new all-time high, surpassing $111,000, driven by positive market momentum, increased optimism surrounding crypto regulation in the U.S., and sustained interest from institutional investors. Despite a recent dip in U.S. stock markets, Bitcoin's price has continued to climb, diverging from its typical correlation with equity markets. Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt and pro-crypto initiatives from President Trump and David Sacks, his AI and crypto czar, also contributed to Bitcoin's rise. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's announcement that the bank will allow clients to buy Bitcoin further boosted market confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Freddy Lim, the founder and lead singer of the heavy metal band Chthonic, has been appointed as Taiwan's envoy to Finland, a country known for its thriving metal music scene. President Lai Ching-te selected Lim for his human rights work and international experience, as he served as a national legislator and chairman of Amnesty International in Taiwan. Chthonic, often called "the Black Sabbath of Asia," incorporates elements of Taiwanese folklore into their music and has used their performances to advocate for Taiwan's recognition on the global stage. Despite some opposition, Lim's appointment is seen as a strategic move to strengthen ties between Taiwan and Finland.</p>

          <p>The House is poised to vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill after unveiling an updated version aimed at appeasing Republican holdouts. The legislation, addressing tax, defense, and energy priorities, has faced multiple setbacks due to opposition from various factions within the GOP. A 42-page amendment includes changes to Medicaid work requirements and renewable energy tax credits, seeking to win over both hardliners and blue-state Republicans.

          <p>Mayuri Chari and Janhavi Khemka, two Indian artists, are gaining recognition for their distinct artistic visions, which draw upon personal experiences of gender, disability, and family. Khemka, a hearing-impaired artist, explores sound through vibration and tactile mediums, inspired by her mother's support and guidance. Chari challenges societal perceptions of women through her conceptual art, often facing controversy for her bold depictions of the female body. Both artists have garnered international attention, with their work resonating strongly with Indian women and addressing themes of identity, accessibility, and freedom.</p>

          <p>China has voiced concerns over the European Union's proposal to impose a handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Mao Ning, urged the EU to provide a fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies. The European Commission's proposal includes a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly to customers from overseas, and a 50-cent fee for parcels sent to European warehouses.</p>
