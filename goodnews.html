          <p>Following their FA Cup victory, Chelsea's women's football team, under the guidance of coach Bompastor, is setting its sights on further success, including a Champions League title. The team's ambition is bolstered by investments like the acquisition of USA defender Naomi Girma. Bompastor emphasized the importance of increased competition within England to improve Chelsea's performance on the European stage. Manchester United manager Skinner highlighted the financial gap between his team and Chelsea, calling for more investment to close the divide and foster a more competitive environment for women's football in England.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are working to finalize agreements on a sweeping bill, focusing on green energy tax credits, Medicaid work requirements, and the SALT deduction. Negotiations involve handshake pacts or "gentlemen‚Äôs agreements," particularly concerning green energy and Medicaid. The "SALT caucus" seeks a compromise that grants a higher deduction initially, which then decreases over the bill's 10-year budget window. The goal is to post the bill's text early this week, with a possible vote following a Rules Committee meeting. The Budget Committee will focus on ensuring the bill doesn't increase the deficit over ten years.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies closer Jos√© Alvarado has been suspended for 80 games after testing positive for external testosterone under Major League Baseball‚Äôs drug-testing program. Alvarado claims the positive test was caused by a weight loss drug he took during the offseason, which Phillies president Dave Dombrowski believes. The suspension means Alvarado will be ineligible for the postseason and will lose half of his $9 million salary this year. The Phillies will now rely on other pitchers, including Jordan Romano and Orion Kerkering, to fill the closing role.</p>

          <p>France has refuted allegations of interference in Romania's presidential election, dismissing claims made by Telegram founder Pavel Durov as "completely unfounded." The French Foreign Ministry emphasized its support for Romanian democracy and EU accession, while also noting the annulment of the first round of elections due to electoral violations and Russian interference. The ministry views the accusations against France as a diversionary tactic from genuine threats targeting Romania. The ministry stressed France's support for Romania in its EU accession in 2007, as well as militarily.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz defeated Jannik Sinner in straight sets to win the Italian Open final, ending Sinner's 26-match winning streak. Sinner, playing in his first tournament since a three-month doping ban, was hoping to become the first Italian men's singles winner at the tournament since 1976. Alcaraz, however, proved too strong, especially in the second set, sealing the title with a cross-court volley at the net.

          <p>Todd S. Purdum reflects on Desi Arnaz's impact on Hollywood, highlighting his efforts to promote diversity and inclusion during a time of racial prejudice. Arnaz's success in casting himself as Lucille Ball's husband in "I Love Lucy" challenged stereotypes and broke new ground in television. His technical innovations, such as filming the show in front of a live audience, revolutionized the industry and created the syndication market. Arnaz's story serves as an example of the importance of diversity and creative risk-taking in entertainment, especially at a time when many institutions are retreating from diversity efforts.</p>
