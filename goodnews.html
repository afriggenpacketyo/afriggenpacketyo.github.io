          <p>Major U.S. health insurers, including UnitedHealthcare and Kaiser Permanente, are taking steps to streamline the prior authorization process to improve patient access to care. The initiative involves creating a standardized online system, reducing the number of claims requiring prior authorization, and providing real-time responses to requests. These changes, scheduled for implementation in 2026 and 2027, aim to alleviate administrative burdens on doctors and reduce delays for patients.

The market continues to be influenced by high mortgage rates, but increased inventory may be contributing to the small sales gain.

          <p>Taxpayers with unpaid tax debt should be aware of several warning signs that the IRS may be preparing to garnish their wages. These signs include receiving multiple notices about unpaid taxes, a Final Notice of Intent to Levy, and the filing of a federal tax lien. If an employer has been contacted by the IRS, it is a clear indication that garnishment is imminent. Taxpayers can take action to prevent wage garnishment by requesting a Collection Due Process hearing, setting up a payment plan, exploring hardship options, or working with a tax relief specialist.
