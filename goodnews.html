          <h2>Stocks Rise Following Court Decision Blocking Trump's Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 09:41:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global markets experienced a surge after a panel of U.S. judges blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs, which had been a threat to consumers, supply chains, and corporate earnings. The ruling, though subject to appeal, was seen as a potential slowdown in the trade war, boosting investor confidence. Nvidia's strong earnings report, driven by the tech industry's embrace of artificial intelligence, further fueled the market rally, with its stock significantly influencing major indexes. While the court's decision reduces the likelihood of extreme and rapidly changing tariffs in the long run, it also introduces short-term uncertainty as businesses navigate potential appeals and challenges, suggesting continued market volatility.

The company also confirmed that cloud providers remain their most important customers, accounting for about half of their data center revenue. Looking ahead, Nvidia is focusing on the potential for its GPUs to serve AI models to millions of customers through inference, which is where new surging demand is coming from.

          <p>Archaeologists have solved the mystery of a 1,500-year-old Byzantine Bromeswell bucket found at Sutton Hoo, revealing it was used to hold the cremated remains of an important person and their grave goods. Analysis of the bucket's fragments, including CT scans and X-rays, confirmed the presence of cremated human and animal bones. The bucket, dating back to the 6th century, is decorated with a hunting scene and is believed to have originated from Antioch in the Byzantine Empire. The discovery sheds light on Anglo-Saxon burial practices and the cultural exchange between different regions.</p>

          <p>A recent court ruling blocking some of President Trump's tariffs has limited direct impact on the UK's trade deal with the US, as it doesn't affect tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are key UK exports. While the UK has secured a deal with the US to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, the agreement is not yet in effect. The ruling does prevent Trump from imposing blanket tariffs on other UK goods, such as salmon and whisky, but the White House intends to appeal the decision.
