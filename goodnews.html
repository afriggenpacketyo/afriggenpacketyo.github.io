          <p>An investment group led by Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca has reportedly agreed to buy the WNBA's Connecticut Sun for a record $325 million. The deal, which is pending league approval, includes plans to relocate the team to Boston for the 2027 season and build a new $100 million practice facility. The sale marks a significant increase in franchise value compared to previous WNBA team sales and comes amid a period of rapid growth and expansion for the league. The Mohegan Tribe, the current owner, had purchased the team for $10 million in 2003.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has been solved. The platypus, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift from Australia in 1943 but died during its voyage to the UK. While rumors long suggested it died from shell-shock due to a nearby Nazi U-boat attack, archival research has revealed a more mundane cause. Logbooks show that Winston likely succumbed to heatstroke as the ship crossed the equator, as water and air temperatures far exceeded the safe threshold for the species.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes competition is underway at the New Orleans Saints training camp, where two Australian punters are battling for a single lucrative NFL contract. Incumbent punter Matt Hayball is facing a challenge from rookie James Burnip, both graduates of the ProKick Australia academy. The situation is a recurring one for the Saints, who have favored rookie punters in recent years. The winner will secure a multi-million dollar contract, while the loser will be cut from the team, highlighting the brutal, cut-throat nature of NFL roster finalizations.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong performance in his first start after a long injury layoff, but it wasn't enough to prevent a 4-0 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays. Snell recorded eight strikeouts over five innings, showing flashes of his Cy Young Award-winning form. However, he gave up two home runs to Rays slugger Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the team's temporary ballpark. Despite the loss, Snell's effective return and command on the mound offered a promising sign for the Dodgers' late-season pitching rotation.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris's announcement that she will not run for governor of California has reset the race, leaving no clear front-runner among the remaining candidates. For months, potential contenders had their campaigns stalled by the possibility of her entry, but now they are jockeying for position and donor support. Former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter appears to have a slight polling advantage, while other candidates like Xavier Becerra are also trying to build momentum. With the field wide open, factors like fundraising and major endorsements are expected to be crucial in shaping the contest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England is facing the monumental task of chasing a target of 374 runs to win the final Test against India at The Oval, a feat that would be a remarkable achievement. The team's situation was made more difficult by the loss of key all-rounder Ben Stokes to injury and a late wicket on day three. The article reflects on England's depleted fast-bowling resources throughout the grueling series, which has seen them bowl significantly more overs than India. A win would be a stunning victory, but a loss would mean a drawn 2-2 series and regrets over missed opportunities.</p>

          <p>Romania is taking steps to more openly acknowledge its history regarding the genocide of its Sinti and Roma populations during World War II, a topic long silenced in the country. At a recent event commemorating the European Day of Remembrance, Romania's new president and other officials called for the nation to grapple with its past and combat ongoing discrimination. During the war, Romania's pro-Nazi regime deported over 25,000 Roma to Transnistria, where most perished. The recent public discussions and educational initiatives signal a significant shift in addressing this dark chapter of the nation's history.</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has transformed from a niche, experimental project into a foundational technology for global finance, with a market capitalization of over $420 billion. Created by Vitalik Buterin and a small team, Ethereum introduced the concept of programmable money and smart contracts, which now underpin decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and tokenized assets. Major financial institutions like Deutsche Bank and BlackRock are now building on Ethereum's network, integrating it into their core systems. The platform's journey reflects a shift from a cypherpunk ideal to an invisible backbone for Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

Yamashita, who held a three-shot lead at the halfway point, struggled with a two-over 74, reducing her advantage to a single stroke over South Korea's A Lim Kim. With several players, including Hull, close behind and challenging weather forecast for the final day, the tournament is set for a dramatic conclusion.</p>
