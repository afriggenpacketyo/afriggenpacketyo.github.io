          <p>The NASA Crew-10 mission, consisting of four international astronauts, has safely returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean after a nearly five-month stay on the International Space Station. During their mission, the crew conducted over 200 scientific experiments aimed at preparing humans for future deep-space exploration. This successful return marks another milestone for NASA's Commercial Crew Program with SpaceX, which continues to provide reliable transportation to the orbiting laboratory as the ISS nears its planned retirement.</p>

          <p>In a move to ease tensions, North Korea has reportedly started removing its propaganda-blasting loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, according to the South Korean military. This action follows a similar step taken by South Korea under its new president, who has sought to improve relations with Pyongyang. The propaganda campaigns, which involved broadcasting K-pop and critical messages from the South and unsettling noises from the North, have long been a source of friction in the heavily fortified region.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the widely cited "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals three decades ago, is now offering updated guidance. In a new book, he argues that a more diversified portfolio, including assets like small-company stocks, can support a higher safe withdrawal rate, closer to 4.7% or even higher for current retirees. He emphasizes that his original rule was a conservative, worst-case scenario and that retirees should personalize their strategy to get the most out of their savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Australian scientist, along with organizations like the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA), asserts there is no supernatural mystery behind the Bermuda Triangle. They argue that the high volume of plane and ship traffic in the region means the number of disappearances is statistically proportional to any other well-traveled area. The so-called mystery can be explained by a combination of logical factors, including volatile weather patterns like the Gulf Stream, complex navigation, and human error.</p>

          <p>The American shopping mall is experiencing a potential rebirth by replacing failed traditional anchor stores with a diverse mix of non-retail tenants. Mall owners are subdividing large, empty spaces to accommodate businesses like churches, entertainment complexes, hotels, and large bookstores, which drive foot traffic and encourage "cross-shopping." This strategic shift away from a purely retail model is helping to revitalize once-dying malls by transforming them into broader community hubs, leading to a tangible increase in visitor traffic.</p>
