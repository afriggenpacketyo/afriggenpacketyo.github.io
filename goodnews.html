          <p>Organizations across Los Angeles County are preparing to host dozens of "No Kings" rallies and marches on Saturday, building on previous large-scale demonstrations against the Trump administration's perceived authoritarianism. These events, supported by various national groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and MoveOn, aim to peacefully protest and assert democratic values. The article provides an extensive list of specific times and venues, along with notes for attendees, from Alhambra to Whittier. Organizers emphasize that communities are coming together to share a resolved message: "We don't do dictators or kings in America," highlighting diversity as strength and empathy as a superpower in their pushback against the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>A popular Chinese spy drama, "Silent Honour," has inspired a significant public outpouring of praise and remembrance for real-life intelligence agents, particularly Wu Shi, an underground Communist Party member. The article notes a "sudden surge" of visitors to Wu's tomb, where hundreds of flowers and thank-you notes were laid, occurring outside the traditional grave-sweeping festival. This phenomenon reflects the show's profound impact in highlighting "unsung heroes" and fostering national sentiment and appreciation for historical figures involved in intelligence work. The drama appears to have successfully connected with audiences, driving a renewed interest in and respect for those who served in covert capacities.</p>

          <p>Eugenio Suárez delivered a decisive eighth-inning grand slam, his second home run of the game, leading the Seattle Mariners to a 6-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. This pivotal win puts the Mariners just one game away from their first-ever World Series appearance, holding a 3-2 lead in the American League Championship Series. Cal Raleigh initiated the game-winning rally with a leadoff homer in the same inning. The article also notes a potential injury to Blue Jays' leadoff hitter George Springer, who was hit by a pitch, adding a significant concern for Toronto as the series heads to Game 6 on Sunday.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is actively building an ecosystem to solidify its role as a leading offshore yuan trading center, making it easier and cheaper for businesses to borrow Chinese yuan. A new Renminbi Business Facilitation (RBF) scheme, for instance, allows companies to access yuan loans at significantly lower interest rates compared to Hong Kong dollar rates. This initiative is part of broader measures by Hong Kong and mainland regulators to encourage greater international use of the Chinese currency. The article highlights that the scheme will expand to support both mainland firms investing overseas and foreign firms expanding into the mainland, enhancing Hong Kong's financial connectivity and influence.

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation imposing new tariffs: 25% on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, and 10% on imported buses. This protectionist measure aims to shield U.S. companies from foreign competition and stimulate domestic manufacturing. Senior administration officials detailed a credit system designed to offset tariff liabilities for vehicle manufacturers who import some parts but produce the final vehicles in the U.S. This initiative seeks to incentivize the use of American labor and materials, ensuring that domestic production remains cost-competitive. The article highlights the administration's strategy to bolster the U.S. automotive industry and reduce reliance on foreign imports.</p>

          <p>This article commemorates Liu Huaqing, the former commander of the Chinese navy, as a revered strategist and visionary technocrat responsible for the comprehensive modernization of China’s naval forces to world-class standards. Often compared to 19th-century American naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Liu was instrumental in developing China's "blue sea strategy." Joining the Red Army at 13 and participating in the Long March, Liu rose through the ranks before being transferred to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952, marking his first encounter with the sea. His strategic foresight and leadership are credited with laying the foundational "road to the sea" for China's ambitious naval power.</p>

          <p>The Orionid meteor shower is set to peak next week, promising a dazzling celestial display visible until November 7, with optimal viewing conditions between midnight and dawn around October 22. Known for their brightness and speed, these meteors originate from debris left by Halley's Comet, traveling at approximately 41 miles per second and leaving distinctive long streaks of light. The article advises stargazers to find a dark spot away from city lights and look towards the constellation Orion after midnight, as the shower will be visible to the naked eye without the need for binoculars or a telescope. Up to 15 meteors per hour are expected during the peak, offering a natural fireworks spectacle.</p>

          <p>India's traditional Diwali gold rush is seeing a shift this year, with soaring gold prices (over $1,440 for 10g) influencing consumer behavior. While demand for gold remains strong due to its auspicious significance during Dhanteras and Diwali, customers are buying less in volume or opting for lighter, more innovative designs. The article highlights a clear trend: more Indians are purchasing gold and silver for investment rather than purely for jewelry, reflected in rising bullion market data and record inflows into gold ETFs. India's central bank is also significantly increasing its gold reserves for diversification and stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 19:42:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant turnaround in its fentanyl crisis, with fatal overdoses falling by 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives. This article attributes the decline to a commitment to harm reduction strategies, particularly in states like North Carolina, where overdose fatalities are down 35%. Initiatives include law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programs, which redirect substance users from crime to recovery, and expanded access to medication-assisted treatment like methadone. The widespread availability of Naloxone, an overdose reversal drug, and a generational shift among young people avoiding opioids are also cited as crucial factors in this optimistic trend.</p>

          <p>A viral classroom trend has kids and teens enthusiastically shouting "six, seven," often accompanied by a juggling motion, much to the bewilderment of adults. This article reveals the phrase originates from Philadelphia rapper Skrilla's song "Doot Doot (6 7)," which he leaked without intending a specific meaning. The trend has since appeared in pop culture, including "Abbott Elementary" and "South Park." Teachers are finding it disruptive but also recognize its impossible-to-ban nature, as kids enjoy the generational "secret code." Experts suggest it's a playful way for youth to express themselves and perhaps a subtle call for adults to "lighten up."</p>
