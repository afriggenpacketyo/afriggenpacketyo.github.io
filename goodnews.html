          <p>Shares of design software company Figma jumped 7% following an announcement by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that its technology will be integrated into ChatGPT. During a developer conference, Altman demonstrated how users could verbally instruct ChatGPT to create a workable diagram within Figma, streamlining the design process. This integration is part of OpenAI's new Apps SDK, which allows third-party applications to connect directly with the popular AI assistant. The partnership highlights Figma's increasing focus on incorporating generative AI tools into its platform, boosting investor confidence in its future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve beginning to cut interest rates, the earnings potential of a $10,000 deposit in a certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account is now closely matched. While high-yield savings accounts currently offer slightly higher or equal returns on some short-term timelines, their variable rates are expected to fall with future Fed cuts. In contrast, CDs offer a fixed rate, guaranteeing a specific return over their term, which provides stability in a declining rate environment. The article suggests a strategy of splitting funds between both to balance guaranteed returns with liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

The acquisition will integrate SciTec's software expertise in areas like missile warning, tracking, and defense into Firefly's launch and space services. The deal, comprising $300 million in cash and $555 million in stock, follows a recent period of volatility for Firefly's stock after a rocket explosion during a ground test. This move strengthens Firefly's position as a key partner for government and defense contracts. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), recent and anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are making large credit lines more affordable. A $150,000 HELOC currently costs between approximately $1,424 and $1,811 per month, depending on the repayment term, which is significantly lower than a year ago. Because HELOCs have variable rates, their costs will likely decrease further with future Fed cuts, making them an attractive option for tapping into home equity. However, homeowners must ensure they can manage payments, as the rate can fluctuate over the life of the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors considering a reverse mortgage to supplement retirement income, lenders typically require homeowners to have at least 50% to 60% equity in their property. This means the outstanding mortgage balance should not exceed about half of the home's appraised value. While the FHA, which backs the most common type of reverse mortgage, does not set a specific percentage, this range is the industry standard. The actual amount a senior can borrow is further determined by their age, current interest rates, and federal lending limits, not just their total equity. Homeowners who fall short of the equity requirement may need to pay down their mortgage or consider other options. (not investment advice)</p>

The atrocities were part of a government-backed plan to suppress a rebellion by African ethnic groups. Abd-Al-Rahman, who faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, turned himself in to the court in 2020.</p>
