          <p>A 13-year-old Glasgow student, Rebecca Young, has been named one of Time magazine's "girls of the year" for her invention designed to help homeless individuals. She conceived a solar-powered blanket that stores heat during the day in a battery pack, which can then be used for warmth at night. Her idea, which won a national engineering competition, was developed into a working prototype by the firm Thales, with dozens of units distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, which is partnered with Lego, Rebecca was also immortalized as a Lego mini-figure.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan have publicly endorsed a historic U.S.-brokered peace agreement, aiming to end over three decades of conflict and foster regional economic integration. In interviews, both leaders dismissed potential backlash from neighboring Russia and Iran, arguing the deal offers strategic benefits to all parties, including new trade and transit routes. The centerpiece of the pact is the "Trump Route," a transit corridor through Armenia connecting mainland Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave, for which the U.S. has secured a 99-year lease. While the U.S. gains a strategic foothold, Iran has responded with hostility, and the Armenian prime minister faces domestic opposition from nationalists.</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, according to a new projection from The Senior Citizens League. This estimate is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries received for 2025 and is based on recent inflation data. The Social Security Administration will finalize the official COLA in October, using inflation figures from the third quarter. While inflation has been stable, some economists express concern that this modest adjustment may not be sufficient to cover rising costs for seniors, especially if potential tariffs drive prices higher.

          <p>Cisco reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that slightly surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue growing 7.6% year over year. The networking giant also issued an optimistic forecast for the upcoming quarter and full fiscal year, signaling confidence in its business outlook. A significant driver of this positive performance is the booming demand for AI infrastructure, with the company securing over $2 billion in AI-related orders in fiscal 2025, double its initial goal. CEO Chuck Robbins stated that AI is not a "fleeting trend" and highlighted a strong sales pipeline from enterprise customers for AI networking solutions.</p>

          <p>In a break from tradition, the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics will allow corporate sponsors to have their names on venues, a first in Olympic history. The agreement between the LA28 organizing committee and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) overturns the long-standing "clean venue" policy that kept stadiums and arenas free of commercial branding during the Games. This change will provide a significant new revenue stream to help cover the privately funded event's $7.1 billion budget. Existing venues can retain their names if their sponsor becomes a top-tier Olympic partner, while temporary facilities will also have naming rights available.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tax legislation, which makes lower income tax rates permanent, could create new complications for those considering a Roth IRA conversion. While the permanent lower rates might make conversions more appealing, the bill also introduces several temporary deductions with varying income limits. Financial experts warn that a large conversion could push an individual's income high enough to lose eligibility for these new tax breaks. Planners advise a careful, multi-year analysis to balance the long-term tax benefits of a conversion against the immediate impact on deductions and other income-sensitive costs like Medicare premiums.

          <p>The FBI has returned a significant historical artifact to Mexico: a 500-year-old manuscript page signed by Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés in 1527. The document, which details payments for an expedition to the "spice lands," is one of 15 pages that were discovered missing from Mexico's national archives in 1993. The FBI's art crime team located and seized the page within the U.S. after the Mexican government requested assistance in 2024. The repatriation marks a successful moment in the effort to recover and return protected cultural property, though no one will be prosecuted as the document changed hands multiple times.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is on a path to intensify into the Atlantic season's first hurricane by Saturday and is forecast to become a major Category 3 storm by Sunday. While the storm is projected to pass north of Puerto Rico, bringing heavy rain and dangerous surf to the island, it is not currently expected to make a direct landfall in the United States. The majority of forecast models show Erin turning north and remaining over the ocean, passing between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast. However, it will likely generate a high risk of rip currents along the East Coast for an extended period.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has stated that both nations are prepared to move beyond simply stabilizing their relationship and are aiming for more productive economic cooperation. Speaking at a trade expo, the ambassador highlighted the potential for closer alignment between Australia's mining sector and China's manufacturing industries through joint exploration and technology sharing. This positive rhetoric follows a period of strained diplomatic ties that saw Beijing impose a series of trade curbs on Australian goods.

          <p>China has announced the development and upcoming commercial delivery of its first domestically produced e-beam lithography machine, a significant advancement in its quest for technological self-reliance. Developed by a lab at Zhejiang University, the tool, named "Xizhi," uses a focused electron beam to etch circuits onto silicon wafers, a critical process in semiconductor manufacturing. This achievement is a key step in breaking the country's dependence on foreign high-tech equipment, particularly in light of U.S. export restrictions. The milestone demonstrates progress in Beijing's national strategy to build a self-sufficient and advanced domestic chipmaking industry.</p>

          <p>Sky Sports is reportedly in the final stages of securing a new six-year contract for the exclusive UK live rights to the U.S. Open golf championship. The deal would see Sky retain the prestigious event, beating out a competitive bid from Netflix, which is increasingly moving into live sports content. This extension would solidify Sky's position as the primary broadcaster for major golf tournaments in the UK. The move by Netflix to bid on a standalone major sporting event reflects its strategy of acquiring high-profile content to attract new subscribers, signaling a growing challenge to traditional sports broadcasters.</p>

The new visa, available from October 1, is designed to attract recent graduates from renowned universities and researchers in these critical fields. Unlike other visas, the "young talent" visa will not require a domestic employer or an inviting entity, streamlining the application process.

His stance on easing monetary policy aligns with President Trump's public demands, though Sumerlin stressed the importance of Fed independence.
