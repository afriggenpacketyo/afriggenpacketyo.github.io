        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's rally continued, reaching a new record high near $112,000, driven by increased institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Positive momentum around U.S. crypto regulation and continued interest from institutional buyers have fueled the price surge. Despite a drop in U.S. equities, Bitcoin's price has diverged, potentially due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. President Trump's pro-crypto agenda and the Senate's advancement of crypto legislation have also supported the market, with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a known skeptic, announcing that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency.

The former Wall Street executive, who lacks prior government experience, aims to transform the agency into a premier service organization by adopting a "digital-first" mindset and integrating AI into its systems. Bisignano sought to reassure staff about the agency's future amid recent leadership turnover and scrutiny from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), stating that Social Security is "not going away" and that he does not intend to implement reductions in force.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from terminating the legal status of thousands of international students, citing that the students would "continue to suffer significant hardship" due to the administration's actions. The judge's nationwide injunction prevents immigration authorities from arresting or jailing the plaintiffs and those similarly situated, and from transferring them outside their jurisdiction. This ruling came after the administration's "Student Criminal Alien Initiative" terminated the SEVIS records of numerous students, effectively ending their legal status, despite lacking a criminal history that would pose a threat or render them deportable.</p>

These include the misconception that gold's price always rises, the belief that inflation always causes gold's price to rise, and the idea that it's worth waiting for gold's price to fall before investing. The article clarifies that gold prices can fluctuate, inflation doesn't always correlate directly with price increases, and waiting for a significant price drop may not be a viable strategy.

          <p>The Navy reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The review found only about 20 books needed to be removed pending further review by a Department of Defense panel. The initial ban, based on the Navy's own search terms, included titles like "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "How to Be an Antiracist." The reversal aligns with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs.</p>
