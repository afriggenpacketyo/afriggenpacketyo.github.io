          <p>Delta Air Lines' stock jumped over 12% after the company reinstated its 2025 profit outlook, signaling a stronger-than-expected summer travel season. CEO Ed Bastian stated that bookings have stabilized after a dip earlier in the year, giving the airline confidence despite lowering its full-year earnings forecast from initial projections. The carrier reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that slightly beat Wall Street estimates, driven by strong sales of premium seats and its partnership with American Express. This positive report boosted shares across the airline industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price climbed to a new record high on Thursday, exceeding $113,000 and building on gains from the previous day. The rally is being fueled by a broader investor shift into risk assets and a significant wave of short liquidations, where traders betting against the cryptocurrency were forced to buy back in, driving the price higher. Other cryptocurrencies, including Ether and Solana, also saw gains as optimism returned to the digital asset market. This surge follows a period of consolidation, despite steady inflows into bitcoin ETFs and increased buying from public companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new film “Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight,” adapted from Alexandra Fuller's memoir, offers a bracing look at a white family's life in 1980 Zimbabwe-Rhodesia during a civil war. Directed by and starring Embeth Davidtz, the story is told through the eyes of a 7-year-old girl, Bobo (Lexi Venter), who navigates the brutal realities of the conflict with a child's guileless perspective. The review praises the film for capturing the tension and contradictions of the era, contrasting the family's entitlement with the surrounding violence. Venter's performance as the wild, neglected child is highlighted as a major achievement.</p>

          <h2>Exploring How Annuities Can Strategically Impact Social Security Benefits</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities can serve as a powerful tool to supplement and enhance Social Security benefits for retirees by creating a reliable, lifelong income stream. One key strategy is using annuity payments to cover living expenses, which allows an individual to delay claiming Social Security until age 70, thereby maximizing their monthly government benefit by about 8% for each year of delay. Additionally, certain types of annuities can help manage the tax liability on Social Security income by controlling taxable distributions. This coordination can provide retirees with greater financial security and peace of mind. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While the United States is eliminating many clean-energy incentives under the Trump administration's new policies, China is continuing its massive investment in renewable energy. A photo essay from The Atlantic illustrates the vast scale of China's solar power projects. According to the article, China now accounts for a staggering 74 percent of all wind and solar power projects currently under construction worldwide. This highlights a significant divergence in energy policy between the two global powers, with China positioning itself as the clear leader in the green energy transition.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will use its upcoming All-Star Game in Atlanta as a high-profile test for the Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) Challenge System. Each team will receive two challenges per game, which can be initiated by the batter, pitcher, or catcher to review a ball or strike call made by the human umpire. The Hawk-Eye system will then determine the pitch's location, with successful challenges being retained by the team. This marks the next step in potentially implementing the system in the regular season, possibly by 2026, as MLB seeks to improve accuracy and reduce incorrect calls.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has created its own proprietary hardware to solve the significant cooling requirements of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell AI chips. As new AI processors run hotter, traditional air cooling is insufficient, necessitating liquid cooling systems. To avoid lengthy data center rebuilds, Amazon developed its own scalable solution, called In-Row Heat Exchangers (IHRX), which can be retrofitted into existing facilities. This innovation allows Amazon to deploy more of the powerful Blackwell chips without being constrained by infrastructure, a positive development for both companies' AI ambitions.

The evening marked the debut of Danish conductor Thomas Sondergard, who led a powerful but sometimes uneven performance. The concert took place amid real-world tensions, including the cancellation of an upcoming performance by Gustavo Dudamel's Venezuelan orchestra due to a travel ban. Despite some technical glitches with sound and video, pianist Kirill Gerstein delivered a gripping performance of Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.</p>

          <p>Joe Root displayed exceptional grit to score an unbeaten 99, guiding England to a total of 251-4 on a challenging first day of the third Test against India at Lord's. On a slow, dry pitch, England's batters were forced to abandon their aggressive "Bazball" style and grind for runs against a disciplined Indian bowling attack. England twice found themselves in trouble, at 44-2 and 172-4, but Root's steady presence and key partnerships held the innings together. Root will resume on day two just one run short of what would be a hard-fought 37th Test century.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's praise for Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," this article outlines six key facts about the unique relationship between the two nations. Liberia was founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, and English is its official language, often spoken with an American-style accent. Its capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, its flag closely resembles the American flag, and its culture retains strong U.S. influences. The historical context explains the deep-rooted connections that might not be immediately obvious to outside observers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for certain children born in the United States. The judge certified the case as a class action lawsuit, expanding its scope to cover all children who could lose their citizenship under the policy. The Trump administration's order challenges the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil. This ruling is one of several legal challenges across the country seeking to halt the controversial policy from taking effect.</p>

          <p>This article revisits Virginia Woolf's unpublished 1932 letter on the cultural debate between "highbrow," "lowbrow," and "middlebrow" tastes. Woolf fiercely defended the highbrow, defining it as the pursuit of ideas with thoroughbred intelligence, and expressed a mutual respect for the vitality of the lowbrow. However, she reserved her sharpest criticism for the "middlebrow," whom she saw as a dishonest consumer of art, chasing fashion without genuine conviction. The essay reflects on how these terms have evolved, while noting that Woolf's passionate defense of intellectual rigor and authentic taste remains relevant in today's cultural landscape.</p>

This sale makes it the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction. The iconic bag was famously created in 1984 after a chance encounter between Birkin and then-Hermès leader Jean-Louis Dumas on a flight, where she complained about not finding a suitable large purse. Dumas sketched a design on the spot, leading to the creation of a fashion accessory that has since become a global symbol of luxury and exclusivity.</p>
