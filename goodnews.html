          <p>During a joint press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating Putin had "let me down" regarding the war in Ukraine. Trump lauded the "special relationship" with the UK, largely avoiding contentious topics like Palestinian statehood, which he acknowledged as a minor disagreement. The press conference, held at the conclusion of a two-day state visit, focused on areas of alignment, with Trump praising the UK's commitment to defense spending. The discussion highlighted a unified stance against Russian aggression while reinforcing diplomatic ties.</p>

          <p>Youth-led protest movements, largely driven by Generation Z, are creating significant political shifts in several Asian countries, including Nepal, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. These digitally-native activists are challenging corruption, authoritarianism, and economic inequality, leading to the ousting of established leaders in some nations. Experts draw parallels to the Arab Spring, noting the role of social media in mobilizing decentralized movements focused on specific grievances. While these protests have sparked immediate change, questions remain about their long-term ability to establish stable, institutional reforms.</p>

          <p>Sacramento International Airport (SMF) has selected renowned artist Paul Ramírez Jonas to create a large-scale, permanent public art installation for its new parking garage. The piece, titled "The Trip Around the Block is the Trip Around the World," will feature hundreds of painted steel panels covering three sides of the structure. Airport officials believe the installation will transform the garage into a civic landmark that reflects Sacramento's spirit. Jonas's work will join other iconic art pieces at the airport, including the famous giant red rabbit sculpture.</p>

          <p>A team of eight female athletes is preserving a rich piece of Mexican culture through the traditional equestrian sport of escaramuza. Dressed in colorful adelitas dresses, the riders perform intricate, synchronized maneuvers on horseback while riding sidesaddle, a tradition passed down through generations. The sport, which originated during the Mexican Revolution, requires a deep bond between rider and horse, as well as significant balance and skill.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has set a date of November 5 to hear oral arguments concerning the legality of President Trump's extensive global tariffs. The case comes after a lower court ruled that the president overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a law intended for national emergencies, to impose the duties. The outcome will be a significant test of presidential executive power in setting trade policy, a role typically reserved for Congress. A ruling against the administration could force the U.S. to pay back billions in collected tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut is set to affect various consumer financial products, though the impact will be uneven. Borrowers with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) are likely to see the most immediate relief, as their variable rates are closely tied to the Fed's benchmark. Mortgage rates have also declined in anticipation of the move, offering some benefit to homebuyers, though they are influenced by broader economic factors as well. Conversely, savers may see reduced returns, as yields on high-interest savings accounts and CDs are expected to drop. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has changed its martial law regulations to permit men between the ages of 18 and 22 to travel abroad freely. This decision aims to keep more young people in Ukraine by giving them the flexibility to leave and return, rather than seeking ways to exit permanently. The move has sparked debate, with some viewing it as a positive step toward normalcy and others seeing it as unfair to older men subject to mobilization. While border officials have not noted a massive exodus, the new rule provides young Ukrainians with opportunities for short-term travel, work, or study abroad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new commentary in the journal Nature Food proposes a method for measuring the "welfare footprint" of farmed animals, focusing on the suffering of chickens raised for meat. Researchers estimate that the average factory-farmed chicken endures approximately 700 hours of pain during its short 45-day life due to rapid-growth genetics. The article argues that switching to slower-growing breeds could prevent at least 15 to 100 hours of the most severe pain for a cost of just half a cent to three cents per hour. This approach aims to incorporate animal welfare into food policy discussions alongside economic and environmental costs.</p>

Maintained by a dedicated caretaker and over 30 volunteers, the site hosts several weddings each year and attracts visitors from across the country.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut has nuanced implications for retirees considering a reverse mortgage. Unlike traditional mortgages, reverse mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond the Fed's benchmark, so rates may not fall in lockstep. However, lower rates can significantly increase a homeowner's borrowing capacity, as the formula used to determine loan amounts is rate-sensitive. The article advises retirees to shop around for rates, carefully consider the choice between fixed and adjustable-rate products, and weigh the long-term costs against the benefit of accessing more home equity.
