          <p>Meta's recently launched AI app, designed to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT, has raised privacy concerns due to users unknowingly sharing personal prompts publicly. Examples include prompts generating images of sensitive content or revealing personal information like home addresses. Meta clarifies that AI chats are private by default and sharing requires a four-step process, including a preview and the option to hide posts. Users can adjust their settings to prevent prompts from being shared on Facebook and Instagram, manage information visibility, and delete prompt history to enhance privacy. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley stated that a shortage of rare earth minerals, essential for automobile production, caused the company to temporarily shut down a factory last month. China, which accounts for approximately 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth mineral supply, has implemented export controls, creating challenges for U.S. automakers. Recent trade discussions between the U.S. and China have resulted in an agreement for Beijing to resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S., which has brought optimism to Ford. The company is awaiting approval of applications with China's Ministry of Commerce to export more rare earths.</p>

          <p>With gold prices poised to break records due to rising inflation and geopolitical tensions, investors are advised to consider strategic moves. Beginners should consider entering the market now, potentially through fractional gold, and avoid the temptation to sell quickly, viewing gold as an inflation protector. Veteran investors are encouraged to hold steady, potentially buying more to reach the recommended 10% portfolio allocation, and remember the initial reasons for investing. Consulting with a financial advisor or gold company is recommended for personalized guidance before the price of gold becomes too costly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment in June improved more than expected, signaling optimism as the Trump administration rolled back some tariffs. The University of Michigan survey data revealed an end to six consecutive months of worsening sentiment, with year-ahead inflation expectations dropping sharply. The improvement was reflected across all demographics, and recent trade agreements and tariff adjustments have contributed to easing costs for importers. However, concerns remain about potential price increases from retailers and the possibility of stagflation, with the Federal Reserve taking a wait-and-see approach to interest rates.
