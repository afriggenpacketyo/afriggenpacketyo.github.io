          <p>B√§rbel Bas, a politician from a working-class background, has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), serving alongside Lars Klingbeil. Her election is seen as a move to rejuvenate the party after it suffered a historic defeat, and her position on the party's left wing is intended to counterbalance Klingbeil's more conservative stance. In her new dual role as party co-chair and Germany's labor minister, Bas faces the significant challenges of reforming unemployment benefits and the pension system. She was elected with a strong 95% of the delegate vote.</p>

          <p>After missing the Six Nations due to injury, Scotland's Sione Tuipulotu feels he is returning to his peak performance during the British and Irish Lions tour in Australia. The center played a full 80 minutes in a victory over Western Force, showcasing the power that made him a favorite for a Test jersey. Tuipulotu praised his midfield partner Garry Ringrose's physicality and noted the positive influence of fly-half Finn Russell on the team's adaptable playing style. The team is now preparing for a more challenging match against the Reds in Brisbane.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former middleweight world champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. in a unanimous decision victory in Anaheim, California. Paul, 28, controlled the fight against a passive Ch√°vez Jr., who threw few punches for most of the contest, much to the visible frustration of his legendary father at ringside. Despite being jeered by the crowd, Paul claimed an easy victory and called out current champions, expressing his readiness for a title shot. The win continues to fuel debate about Paul's legitimacy in professional boxing and the caliber of his opponents.</p>

          <p>France is leading a ‚Ç¨1.35 billion investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. The move makes the French state the company's largest shareholder and signals a strategic push for technological sovereignty in the space sector. However, experts are skeptical about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance, citing its much smaller satellite constellation and different technical architecture. While Eutelsat may struggle in the mass market, it is well-positioned to serve security-sensitive government and enterprise clients in Europe who prioritize jurisdictional control.</p>

          <p>Quemoy, a Taiwanese-administered island located just 10km off the coast of mainland China, serves as a unique case study in the complex relationship between Taipei and Beijing. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. Despite its proximity to the mainland city of Xiamen, interviews on the island reveal the distinct limits of influence from both sides. Taipei continues to see Quemoy as a symbolic deterrent, while the island's unique position highlights the practical and political challenges inherent in the cross-strait dynamic.</p>

Ohtani, who is making a comeback to the mound following elbow surgery, allowed one single and a walk while striking out one batter.

          <p>A new smoking ban has gone into effect across France, prohibiting smoking on all public beaches, in parks, and near schools and other public spaces. The rules are part of a government initiative to protect children from passive smoking and to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. While e-cigarettes are not included and restaurant terraces are exempt, violators of the ban could face fines up to ‚Ç¨700. The move comes as France, despite having one of Europe's higher smoking rates, sees a gradual decline in tobacco use.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has voted to advance the "One Big Beautiful Bill," a major Republican legislative package focused on tax cuts and spending, after a tense, hours-long negotiation. A small group of conservative holdouts, including Sen. Ron Johnson, initially blocked the procedural vote over concerns about the national deficit and Medicaid spending. After securing a promise for a future amendment vote to alter Medicaid funding, the senators flipped their votes, allowing the bill to move forward. The bill, which is nearly 1,000 pages long, now faces a lengthy amendment process before a final vote.</p>
