          <p>The Camogie Association is under pressure to relax its rule mandating skorts in matches, with critics calling it sexist. Former All-Star Jane Adams argues that players should have a choice between skorts and shorts for comfort. A recent survey revealed that 70% of players find skorts uncomfortable, and 83% want the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress for May 22 to vote on the issue, amidst growing discontent and concerns about player welfare.</p>
