          <p>Former NASA astronauts and twin brothers, Mark and Scott Kelly, commented on the significant challenges facing the space agency, including proposed 20% workforce reductions. Speaking before a since-scrubbed SpaceX launch, Senator Mark Kelly expressed confidence in NASA's resilience while acknowledging the difficulties of organizational change. The brothers also reflected on the personal challenges of long-duration spaceflight, such as separation from family and Earth. Their discussion provides a veteran perspective on the intersection of space exploration policy, private partnerships like SpaceX, and the human element of living in orbit.</p>

          <p>Meta's stock surged after the company reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations on both revenue and profit. The social media giant's sales grew 22% year-over-year, driven by strong advertising revenue, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed to efficiencies gained from AI. The company also raised its third-quarter sales forecast and increased its capital expenditure outlook, signaling continued heavy investment in AI and its "superintelligence" vision. Despite a significant operating loss in its Reality Labs division, overall user growth across its family of apps remained strong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that 35% of U.S. adults are now using artificial intelligence for various health and wellness needs, such as researching medical concerns, planning meals, and finding workout routines. According to the research, more Americans trust AI for health guidance than social media influencers, although doctors remain the most trusted source. The trend reflects a broader desire for accessible health information, with many users finding AI more convenient than traditional search engines or even consulting a professional. This shift suggests AI is becoming an integral, though supplemental, tool in personal health management.</p>

          <p>The launch of the SpaceX Crew-11 mission to the International Space Station was halted just 67 seconds before liftoff due to a weather violation over the Kennedy Space Center. The crew, commanded by NASA's Zena Cardman, includes astronauts who were rescheduled after issues with Boeing's Starliner capsule last year. The mission is notable for using the Crew Dragon Endeavour, which is making its record sixth flight as SpaceX works to certify its capsules for up to 15 missions. The next launch attempt is scheduled for the following day, though weather conditions remain a concern for the flight.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its popular diabetes drug, Mounjaro, showed significant heart health benefits in a late-stage trial comparing it directly with Trulicity, an older drug from the company. While the primary goal was to prove Mounjaro was not inferior, the study also revealed it had a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and offered greater kidney protection. This data strengthens the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The results are expected to bolster Mounjaro's market position, especially as Trulicity's patent expiration approaches.</p>

Park, who found his own path to faith after a difficult childhood, believes that God is most present where love is, making the hospital a sacred space. He validates both anger at God and a renewed search for faith as legitimate spiritual responses to suffering and the end of life.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee has advanced legislation to prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks, with Republican Senator Josh Hawley joining all Democrats in the vote. The bill, now called the Honest Act, aims to curb potential conflicts of interest and has drawn both support and criticism from within the Republican party. The debate highlighted divisions on whether existing measures like blind trusts are sufficient, with proponents arguing the American public is demanding stricter ethical standards. The measure's future is uncertain, but its advancement from committee marks a significant step for the proposal.</p>

The decision came after a phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, which Trump described as successful. During this period, existing tariffs, including a 25% tariff on cars and a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, will remain in place while negotiations for a long-term agreement continue. The extension provides temporary relief for businesses and markets concerned about escalating trade tensions between the two major trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent column in The Atlantic explores the common phenomenon of impostor syndrome, where high-achieving individuals secretly feel like frauds despite their proven skills. The article notes that this feeling is prevalent among perfectionists and those in technical fields, and while it can motivate improvement, it often leads to anxiety and burnout. To combat this, the author suggests three key strategies: practicing kinder self-talk, tracking personal progress to create an objective record of accomplishments, and building a supportive peer community. These methods help reframe one's perspective from self-doubt to a focus on growth and learning.</p>
