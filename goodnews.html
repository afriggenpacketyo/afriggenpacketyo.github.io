          <p>U.S. consumers are demonstrating robust spending on jewelry, providing a significant boost to brands like Pandora even as the company faces weaker sales in Europe and China. This trend persists despite potential economic headwinds from U.S. tariffs, which jewelry companies are partially absorbing to maintain market momentum. While analysts note the current strength of the American market, they also point to rising silver prices and new tariffs as potential challenges that could eventually impact consumer demand and company profit margins.</p>

          <p>Online real estate company Opendoor saw its stock jump approximately 10% following the announcement of CEO Carrie Wheeler's resignation, a move that came after a significant pressure campaign from investors. Wheeler's departure follows a period of intense stock volatility and criticism from prominent figures, including a co-founder, who argued she lacked the support of the company's original leadership. The company has named its technology chief as an interim leader while it searches for a permanent CEO to navigate its challenging business model amid a tough real estate market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Zillow analysis reveals that it is still possible to purchase a mansion, defined as a home with at least 5,000 square feet, for under $1 million in a few U.S. metropolitan areas. Cities like Buffalo, Indianapolis, Cleveland, and Memphis offer these large properties at a median price below the seven-figure mark, a stark contrast to coastal markets where mansions can cost several million dollars. This affordability is often tied to older homes and is a remnant of a market where, just a few years ago, nearly half of all U.S. mansions were valued below $1 million.</p>

          <h2>Stock Market Sees Rotation into Health-Care Sector Amid Worsening Consumer Sentiment</h2>

          <p>The stock market experienced a rotation on Friday, with investors moving into the out-of-favor health-care sector, significantly boosting shares of companies like UnitedHealth. This shift was largely driven by the news of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway taking a major stake in the insurer, providing a strong vote of confidence. Meanwhile, broader economic sentiment appears less optimistic, as the University of Michigan's latest survey showed consumers are feeling worse about the economy and future inflation.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.21 trillion, this article outlines how minimum payments on a $3,000 balance are calculated, typically ranging from $60 to $85 depending on the issuer's formula. It warns that only paying the minimum can trap consumers in debt for years due to compounding interest. To escape this cycle, the article suggests strategies such as paying more than the minimum, using a balance transfer card with a 0% introductory APR, or exploring debt consolidation loans.

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a D.A. Davidson tech analyst has argued that such a government intervention is 'essential' for U.S. national security. The analyst stated that reviving the struggling chipmaker is critical to reducing America's dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturing, especially from companies in Taiwan and South Korea. This move would aim to bolster domestic production of high-end technology, a key priority for the administration, by giving Intel significant advantages to compete globally.</p>

          <p>A loud sonic boom was heard and felt across large parts of southeastern England after the Royal Air Force scrambled three Typhoon fighter jets. The jets were launched from RAF Coningsby to intercept a civilian aircraft that had lost communication with air traffic control while flying from Nice. Communications were successfully re-established, and the plane was safely escorted to Stansted Airport, with authorities confirming there was no cause for concern upon landing.</p>

          <p>Jacob Bethell, a 21-year-old all-rounder, has been named captain for England's upcoming T20 cricket tour of Ireland, making him the youngest man to ever lead the nation in international cricket. With many senior players being rested, the selectors have shown remarkable faith in Bethell, who has had limited playing time this summer and has little prior captaincy experience. The appointment is seen as an opportunity for the highly-regarded young talent to develop his leadership skills on the international stage.</p>
