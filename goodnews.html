          <p>Lucy Guo, the 30-year-old co-founder of Scale AI and now the youngest self-made woman billionaire, maintains a rigorous daily routine that includes 5:30 a.m. workouts and forgoing lunch breaks. Despite her $1.3 billion net worth, Guo advocates for a relentless work ethic, suggesting that new founders may need to work 90-hour weeks to succeed. She dismisses the idea that long hours preclude work-life balance, arguing that time often wasted on social media could be used more productively. Her perspective reflects a Silicon Valley ethos of constant work, contrasting with other entrepreneurs who argue such a culture is outdated and detrimental to talent retention.</p>

        </div>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption on Hawaii's Big Island, marking its 31st eruptive event since December. The eruption began with lava fountains shooting up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater, a spectacle contained safely within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma building up in a lower chamber forces its way to the surface, creating periodic fountain episodes. While the activity poses no threat to homes, it has drawn increased tourism to the park, with visitors eager to witness the powerful display of nature.</p>

          <p>In a hard-fought high school football season opener, Mission Viejo defeated Santa Margarita with a final score of 7-3. The game's only touchdown came late in the third quarter when Ohio State commit Luke Fahey threw a 33-yard pass to Jack Junker. The contest was dominated by strong defensive plays from both teams, with Santa Margarita's defense notably stopping Mission Viejo twice on goal-line situations. Fahey's mobility was crucial, as he completed 16 of 22 passes for 169 yards while under constant pressure. The victory was sealed when Mission Viejo's defense prevented a late-game comeback attempt by Santa Margarita.</p>

The ruling by U.S. District Judge William Orrick now protects Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and over 30 other cities and counties that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The judge had previously issued a similar order for other localities. The Trump administration has sought to pressure these communities as part of its broader immigration agenda, but the court deemed the executive orders an unconstitutional "coercive threat" that puts billions of dollars in funding at risk.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration despite a judge's order protecting him, has been released from federal custody. Garcia had been detained in the U.S. since March on charges of conspiring to transport immigrants illegally. His deportation was deemed an "administrative error," and he was held in a notorious Salvadoran prison before being returned to the U.S. in June. A Maryland judge's ruling ensured he would have time to challenge any new deportation order, leading to his release into home detention while he faces the criminal charges.</p>

          <h2>Malaysia to Ban Unprocessed Rare Earth Exports to Boost Domestic Industry</h2>

          <p>Malaysia has announced it will ban the export of unprocessed rare earth minerals to encourage investment in its domestic downstream processing industries. The move is intended to ensure that the value from these critical materials, which are essential for many electronic products, remains within the country. This policy signals Malaysia's intent to leverage its existing processing capabilities to become a key player in the global supply chain, particularly as countries like the United States seek to diversify their sources away from China. Foreign investment will be welcomed for projects that involve local processing, job creation, and technology transfer.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong has become the primary venue for initial public offerings by mainland Chinese companies, overtaking the United States in both the number of listings and capital raised this year. So far in 2025, 46 Chinese firms have raised $16.5 billion in Hong Kong, compared to just 16 listings raising $740.9 million in the US. This shift is attributed to the strong performance of new shares in Hong Kong and the geopolitical tensions between China and the US, which create regulatory uncertainty and delisting risks for Chinese stocks in American markets.
