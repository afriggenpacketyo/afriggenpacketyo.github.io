          <p>The Detroit Lions secured a decisive 38-30 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, showcasing a dominant ground game with 225 rushing yards and a relentless defense that sacked Lamar Jackson seven times. Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery led the rushing attack, while Al-Quadin Muhammad spearheaded the defensive effort. Despite Lamar Jackson's strong passing performance, the Ravens struggled to contain the Lions' balanced offense and aggressive defense. This win propels the Lions to a 2-1 record, while the Ravens fall to 1-2 after failing to capitalize in the game's crucial moments. The Lions' ability to control the line of scrimmage and capitalize on key turnovers proved to be the difference-maker in this high-scoring affair. The team's overall performance reflects a positive trajectory for the season. </p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle has intensified into a major Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 season. The storm's center is projected to pass east of Bermuda, with no watches or warnings currently in effect for the island. However, the National Hurricane Center advises those in the Azores to monitor Gabrielle's progress. Swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to reach the East Coast of North America, posing a threat of life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. While the Atlantic hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted, Gabrielle's strength underscores the potential for significant storms. </p>

          <p>Writer Jack Thorne has lauded the "remarkable" journalists who exposed the use of phone hacking in some parts of the media, ahead of a new TV series about the scandal. Thorne, who also wrote Netflix hit Adolescence, told BBC Radio 4's Today, the new show is about the relationship between the press, politics and the police. The Hack tells the story from two different points of view - that of Davies, as the journalist reporting on it, and police detective Dave Cook, who investigated the murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan. Thorne is working with some of the same team who made the hugely successful Mr Bates vs The Post Office. </p>

          <h2>China Rejects Stripped-Down Nvidia Chips, Prioritizing Tech Independence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 21:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has reportedly rejected Nvidia's B40-series chips, which were designed as less advanced alternatives to comply with U.S. export restrictions, signaling a shift towards prioritizing technological independence. Regulators have ordered leading tech companies to halt purchases of these chips and have opened antitrust investigations into Nvidia, raising questions about safety and security risks. This decision reflects a change in Beijing's approach, moving from reliance on U.S. hardware to a focus on indigenous innovation and self-reliance. The move highlights China's determination to reduce its dependence on foreign technology. </p>

          <p>Hundreds of pigs have been released into England's New Forest to participate in pannage, a historic practice where pigs graze on acorns that are toxic to other livestock. The verderers, who oversee the land, initiated pannage season due to a heavy acorn crop. The pigs clear the forest floor of acorns, chestnuts, and beech mast, helping to maintain the New Forest's ecology. Tourists are advised to drive carefully and keep a safe distance from the pigs during pannage season. The annual tradition helps to protect the other animals in the area. </p>
