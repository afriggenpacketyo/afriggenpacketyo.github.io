          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle after the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. Rather than simply filling the vacant positions, Starmer used the opportunity to significantly recast his government, appointing new individuals to the major offices of Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary. This move is seen as an assertion of authority and an attempt to re-energize his administration, which has faced challenges including declining approval ratings. The reshuffle results in women holding the top three cabinet posts below the prime minister for the first time, a strategic decision as the government prepares for future political battles.</p>

          <p>Joseph Emerson, the off-duty pilot who attempted to cut the engines of an Alaska Airlines passenger flight in 2023, is set to enter guilty and no-contest pleas as part of an agreement with prosecutors. Emerson, who was riding in the cockpit's jump seat, was subdued by the crew after he tried to activate the plane's fire suppression system. He later told police he had taken psychedelic mushrooms, was sleep-deprived, and believed he was in a dream. The plea deal includes probation, extensive community service, and restitution, with his attorney hoping he will avoid further prison time, highlighting ongoing concerns about mental health in the aviation industry.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has officially withdrawn a proposed rule that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations within the carriers' control. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, was never enacted and faced strong opposition from the airline industry, which argued it would increase ticket prices. In a statement, the DOT said it would reconsider such "extra-statutory requirements" while still enforcing consumer protection mandates required by Congress, such as ticket refunds. Airline industry groups praised the decision as a move away from overly burdensome regulations.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 91, industry experts are reflecting on Giorgio Armani's legacy not just as a designer but as a masterful business leader who built a global empire. Armani revolutionized fashion by creating the deconstructed power suit, making luxury accessible, and pioneering the use of celebrity endorsements on the red carpet. A key to his success was maintaining full ownership of his company, which allowed him to ensure creative consistency across a diverse portfolio that expanded from high fashion to perfumes, home furnishings, and even chocolates. This control distinguished him from his peers and cemented his brand's sophisticated and timeless vision.</p>

          <h2>UK Judge Rules Minimal Online Shopping at Work Does Not Justify Dismissal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An employment tribunal in the UK has ruled that spending less than an hour of work time on personal online browsing is not a sufficient reason for dismissal. The case involved an accountancy administrator who was fired after her employer used spyware to track her computer usage, finding she had spent time on sites like Amazon and Rightmove. The judge awarded the worker over £14,000, noting that the time was not excessive, much of it was for professional development, and the company had no clear policy against such activity. The ruling suggests the real motive for the dismissal was to replace her before she accrued two years of service.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has advanced to the US Open final, where she will face world No. 1 and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka. This achievement marks a remarkable comeback for Anisimova, whose last Grand Slam final appearance was a difficult 6-0, 6-0 loss at Wimbledon. Her performance in New York, including victories over top players, demonstrates significant mental growth and resilience. The final presents a formidable challenge against Sabalenka, who has a dominant record in hard-court Grand Slam finals but has also shown vulnerability under pressure in championship matches.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a less favorable environment for reinvesting their funds. Financial experts suggest several alternatives to simply rolling over a CD into a new one at a lower rate. Options include moving the money into a high-yield savings account, which offers comparable rates with greater flexibility, or a money market account that combines high interest with check-writing capabilities. Alternatively, locking in a current rate with a new long-term CD can provide security against future rate drops, despite being lower than recent highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Broadcom surged after the company reported strong earnings and an even stronger forecast, driven by booming demand for its custom AI chips. CEO Hock Tan announced that the company has secured a fourth major customer for its AI accelerators, believed to be OpenAI, with over $10 billion in orders. This unexpected growth means that Wall Street's future earnings estimates were too low, causing analysts to significantly revise their projections upward. Consequently, even as the stock price has soared, its price-to-earnings valuation multiple has barely increased, suggesting the rally is justified by fundamental growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.8 billion, the second-largest in U.S. history, sparking a surge in ticket sales on lottery courier apps like Jackpocket, which is owned by DraftKings. The company reported a massive increase in ticket orders, with sales on its platform growing 130% in a single day this week. This lottery fever provides a significant boost to DraftKings, which acquired Jackpocket in 2024 with the strategic goal of cross-selling lottery players to its primary sports betting and iGaming products. The odds of winning the massive jackpot remain exceptionally low at approximately 1 in 292.2 million.</p>
