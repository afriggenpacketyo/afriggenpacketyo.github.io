          <h2>Key Questions for Seniors Considering a Reverse Mortgage Amid Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 15:10:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With persistent inflation straining the finances of many seniors, reverse mortgages are gaining attention as a way to access home equity. The article advises homeowners aged 62 and older to ask critical questions before proceeding, such as whether it's the most intelligent way to borrow against their home compared to options like HELOCs. It also prompts them to consider if they can manage with existing funds and to re-evaluate financial goals for their beneficiaries, as a reverse mortgage can impact inheritance. Finally, it suggests deciding on the best payment type, whether a lump sum or monthly installments, to suit their specific needs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The executive director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies (Merics), Mikko Huotari, recently completed a visit to Beijing, marking a potential easing of travel restrictions imposed by China. Merics, a prominent German think tank, was sanctioned by Beijing four years ago, preventing its researchers from traveling to the country. Huotari was invited by a leading Chinese think tank, and Merics has welcomed the development, expressing hope for increased engagement between European and Chinese researchers. The sanctions have been a point of contention, with EU leaders repeatedly calling for their removal to foster better diplomatic and academic exchange.</p>

          <h2>MIT Researchers Develop Bionic Knee Offering Amputees More Natural Movement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 15:00:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at MIT have engineered a revolutionary bionic knee that provides above-the-knee amputees with significantly more natural and intuitive mobility. The system, called e-OPRA, involves surgically implanting a titanium rod into the femur, which connects directly to a robotic prosthesis and integrates with the user's muscles. This direct connection allows the bionic knee to respond to the user's intended movements, enabling actions like climbing stairs or kicking a ball with greater ease and confidence. Led by Professor Hugh Herr, himself a double amputee, the technology bypasses the discomfort of traditional socket-based prosthetics and could become more widely available within five years.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced the conclusion of a significant trade and military agreement with the Philippines, though Manila has not yet confirmed the deal. According to a post on Truth Social, the agreement includes a 19% tariff on goods imported from the Philippines, while U.S. goods will face no tariffs. The announcement followed a meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who discussed modernizing his country's military to counter Chinese aggression, with U.S. assistance. The Philippines was one of several nations that recently received a letter from Trump outlining a new tariff rate, a tactic his administration uses to pressure countries into new bilateral agreements.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of finalizing a £63.5 million deal to sign striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting, following prolonged negotiations over add-on payments. The 27-year-old Swedish international has already agreed to personal terms and a five-year contract with the London club. Gyokeres has been a highly sought-after player after a phenomenal season in Portugal, where he scored 54 goals in 52 games. The signing addresses manager Mikel Arteta's long-standing search for an elite center-forward to bolster his team's attack as they aim to compete for the Premier League title.</p>

          <p>While interest rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) have declined from their 2024 peaks, they still offer substantial and predictable returns for savers. The article compares the interest earned on a $20,000 CD now versus a year ago, showing a noticeable drop; for example, a 3-year CD would have earned over $1,000 more if opened in 2024. Despite the decrease, current rates remain significantly higher than they were at the start of the decade, making CDs a reliable vehicle for growing savings. The analysis suggests that with potential rate cuts looming, now may still be an opportune time to lock in a fixed return. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall, who was killed in an attack in Laos during the Vietnam War, has been officially accounted for 57 years after his death. Hall was one of 11 American soldiers killed on March 11, 1968, when their remote radio navigation site was overrun by Vietnamese commandos. His remains were unrecoverable at the time. After decades of joint U.S.-Laos recovery efforts, remains found on the mountain site earlier this year were identified as Hall's through anthropological and DNA analysis. His family has been briefed, and he is scheduled for burial in Kansas in September.</p>

The company stated the new product is designed to complement its existing portfolio and offer more choices, acknowledging the ongoing consumer and political conversations around sweeteners.</p>

          <p>A new student loan repayment plan, called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), was created as part of recent legislation signed by President Trump. This income-driven plan will become available by July 2026 and will calculate payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of earnings with a $10 minimum. Notably, RAP offers loan forgiveness after 30 years, a longer timeline than existing plans. As the legislation phases out other repayment options, RAP may become one of the few affordable choices for new borrowers, who will only be able to select between it and a standard 10-to-25-year plan.</p>

The report found that 27% of Americans have a second income stream, down from a peak of 36% in 2024. Analysts attribute the decline to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation for a few years, allowing people to feel less economic anxiety. This marks a shift from the post-pandemic era, when many relied on side gigs to cover basic living expenses, to now using the extra income more for discretionary spending. (not investment advice)</p>
