          <p>Japanese golfer Mao Saigo carded a rare albatross during the second round of the ShopRite LPGA Classic, propelling her into a tie for second place. Saigo holed out her second shot from 214 yards on the par-5 3rd hole, adding to her impressive performance which included five birdies. She finished the round with a 6-under-par 65, trailing leader Lee Il Hee by one stroke, and expressed satisfaction with her score despite some inaccuracies with her irons. The 23-year-old Saigo, already a major winner at April's Chevron Championship, is joined by compatriots Ayaka Furue, Jennifer Kupcho, and Elizabeth Szokol at 10 under par. Saigo has four top-10 finishes in her LPGA career.</p>

          <p>A referendum in Italy will allow voters to decide whether to loosen citizenship laws for immigrants. The referendum focuses on reducing the time required to apply for citizenship, aiming to integrate long-term residents who contribute to the country. However, it remains uncertain if enough voters will participate to validate the referendum, given potential apathy and opposition from conservative factions. The outcome could significantly impact the rights and integration of immigrants in Italy, reflecting broader debates about national identity and immigration policies across Europe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight in blind animals and enabling them to see infrared light. The study, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, demonstrated how tellurium nanowire implants in a biocompatible device restored vision in blind mice and a monkey. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, replacing damaged photoreceptor cells in the retina. This advancement holds promise for treating human blindness and potentially enhancing human vision capabilities.</p>

While she hasn't ruled out plastic surgery in the future, medical professionals have advised against it for her at this time.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The research, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains than subsidizing mothers alone. This policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study analyzed data from 23 countries and found that traditional expectations persist in China and other East Asian countries, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>

The company stated that the emojis have "fulfilled their role" and that Google's emojis have become more common globally. The mobile phones will now use Noto Color Emoji by Google or Samsung emoji instead, and the original set of 176 emoji was included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2016.</p>
