          <p>Former heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder marked his return to boxing with a seventh-round stoppage victory over Tyrrell Herndon. The win is Wilder's first since October 2022, following three losses in his previous four fights. While dominant, the performance was more measured than his typical explosive style, reflecting a more strategic approach after a period of emotional and professional recalibration. Wilder expressed that this is a new beginning for him, aiming to become a more complete fighter.</p>

Chief economist Peng Wensheng noted that these platforms function similarly to stablecoins and are already governed by a mature regulatory framework. He argues their stability is secured by being backed by central bank base money, positioning China favorably as digital currencies become more prominent in global finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study from the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a correlation between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and lower rates of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and other traditional staples. This is the first study of its kind to specifically link this dietary pattern to mental health benefits.

This minimally invasive technique, which avoids open-skull surgery like that used by Neuralink, helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement.
