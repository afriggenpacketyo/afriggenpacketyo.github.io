          <p>Beijing-based robotics company Roborock plans to make its high-end, AI-powered robot vacuums affordable for the mass market within the next five years. The company's president, Quan Gang, envisions these advanced cleaners, which currently cost over $2,000, selling for just a few hundred dollars. This strategy aims to increase the low household penetration rate of robotic vacuums, especially as the company expands its global supply chain and invests heavily in AI research. Quan also predicts that general-purpose humanoid robots will become a common household feature by 2030, with specialized companies like Roborock providing the 'apps' for specific tasks like cleaning.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom used his office's social media account to poke fun at the political backlash against restaurant chain Cracker Barrel for its recent logo change. In an all-caps post parodying President Trump's online style, Newsom sarcastically demanded the company keep its 'beautiful' old logo and called the new one 'woke.' The post highlights a recent cultural flashpoint where conservative figures accused the Southern-themed chain of becoming 'woke' for simplifying its branding. The restaurant's rebranding has been met with both online fury from some political commentators and a significant drop in the company's stock value.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 9-5 victory over the Colorado Rockies, allowing them to earn a split in their four-game series at Coors Field. The offense started strong with a two-run homer from Freddie Freeman in the first inning, and the team scored in each of the first five innings to build a commanding lead. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw earned his eighth win of the season, navigating a few bumps over five and two-thirds innings. The win provides crucial momentum as the Dodgers head to San Diego for a pivotal series against the second-place Padres.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is proposing the first revision to its 1998 pricing law in an effort to curb destructive internal competition, a phenomenon known locally as 'neijuan' or involution. The amendment targets cutthroat price wars that have led to severe oversupply and financial losses in key sectors, such as the solar panel industry. Manufacturers in these fields have been forced into loss-making sales due to a lack of product differentiation, making price the sole competitive factor. The government hopes that tightening regulations on pricing will help stabilize markets and create a more sustainable economic equilibrium for Chinese businesses.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace achieved a historic 1-0 victory over Fredrikstad in the Uefa Conference League, marking the club's first-ever win in a European competition. The celebratory atmosphere was bittersweet, however, as star midfielder Eberechi Eze was absent from the squad ahead of an imminent transfer to Arsenal. Manager Oliver Glasner confirmed after the match that Eze would not play for the club again. While fans celebrated the milestone on the pitch, many also paid tribute to the departing player who was instrumental in the team's recent FA Cup and Community Shield victories.</p>

          <p>The Colorado Rapids MLS team is allowing fans to exchange jerseys of their former star player, Djordje Mihailović, for a new one following his recent trade to Toronto FC. Mihailović, who had become a key part of the team's offense, surprised the club by requesting a transfer for 'personal reasons.' In an unusual gesture of goodwill, the Rapids are letting fans who purchased his No. 10 jersey swap it for a blank one or one featuring the team's new record-signing, Paxten Aaronson. The club stated the program is a way to show commitment to its community after the unexpected departure.</p>

          <p>Software company Workday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue growing 13% year-over-year. Despite the positive results, the company's shares declined in extended trading after it issued guidance that was merely in line with estimates. CEO Carl Eschenbach warned of challenges ahead, citing a slowdown in funding for state and local governments. He also noted pressure on the higher education sector due to the Trump administration's efforts to shut down the Department of Education, which is causing uncertainty and pullback in spending.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeastward into the Atlantic and away from the North Carolina coast. While the storm is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., it brought tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks, where some evacuation and storm surge warnings remain in effect. The National Hurricane Center is cautioning that Erin will continue to generate 'life-threatening surf and rip currents' along most of the U.S. East Coast for the next several days. The storm is forecast to gradually weaken and become a post-tropical cyclone by the weekend as it passes south of Atlantic Canada.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a '351 conversion' is gaining popularity among wealthy investors as a way to defer taxes on large investment profits. The process allows individuals to contribute highly appreciated stocks from a taxable account into a newly forming exchange-traded fund (ETF) in exchange for shares in that fund. This transaction defers the capital gains tax that would normally be due from selling the original assets. However, the strategy is subject to strict diversification rules, requiring that no single stock makes up more than 25% of the contributed assets. (not investment advice)</p>
