          <p>Asian-Pacific markets saw gains, with Japan's Nikkei 225 rising 1.5% and the Topix index hitting a record high following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement. The news introduced a period of political uncertainty but spurred positive market reactions, while the Japanese yen weakened against the dollar. Investors are now monitoring the leadership transition within the ruling LDP and key upcoming economic data from the region, including China's August trade figures. The resignation comes after mounting pressure on Ishiba following an election defeat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has reached an agreement with the United States to secure the release of its citizens detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia. A chartered flight is being arranged to bring the workers home pending the completion of administrative procedures. The raid, in which U.S. officials detained 475 people, has caused concern in Seoul, a key U.S. ally and major investor in American manufacturing. The incident has prompted calls within South Korea to improve the visa system to prevent similar occurrences in the future.</p>

          <p>Star edge rusher Micah Parsons made an immediate impact in his first game with the Green Bay Packers, recording his first sack for the team in a 27-13 victory over the Detroit Lions. The play drew a reaction of disbelief from his former Dallas Cowboys teammate, Trevon Diggs, who expressed his feelings on social media. Parsons was traded to the Packers in a bombshell move and subsequently signed a massive four-year contract extension. The Packers' defense was dominant in the game, sacking Lions quarterback Jared Goff a total of four times to start their season with a strong divisional win.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old woman in Suffolk, England, experienced a "cryptic pregnancy," giving birth to a baby boy in a football club toilet without ever knowing she was pregnant. Charlotte Robinson was attending a match with 600 other people when she felt a sudden urge to push and discovered she was in labor. Her son, Henry, was delivered safely with the help of her mother-in-law and an off-duty paramedic before an ambulance arrived. Experts note that such cases affect about one in every 2,500 births, often presenting risks due to the lack of prenatal care.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over a back injury that sidelined him for much of the preseason, Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford led his team to a 14-9 victory over the Houston Texans. Stafford passed for 245 yards and a touchdown, becoming the 10th quarterback in NFL history to surpass 60,000 career passing yards. The Rams' defense sealed the win in the final minutes when linebacker Nate Landman forced a crucial fumble that was recovered by Braden Fiske. The game also marked the debut of receiver Davante Adams with the team, contributing to a hard-fought but successful start.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has acquired the historic Griffith Park carousel for one million dollars, ensuring its preservation ahead of its 100th anniversary in 2026. The merry-go-round, which famously inspired Walt Disney to create Disneyland as he watched his daughters ride it, has been closed since 2022 following the death of its previous operator. Built in 1926, the carousel is one of the few remaining four-across wooden carousels of its type. The city plans to undertake significant repairs to make the beloved amusement ride operational again as part of a broader park restoration project.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Bank of America's head of global research, global investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, drawn by Asia's booming artificial intelligence sector and expectations of looser U.S. monetary policy. While U.S. stocks attracted $1.2 trillion between 2020 and 2024, investment has slowed this year, with capital flowing more evenly to international markets. The shift is spurred by a weakening U.S. dollar and the perception that Asian markets offer better valuations and significant growth potential, particularly in AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, as well as parts of Europe and Africa, were treated to the spectacle of a "Blood Moon" during a total lunar eclipse on Sunday night. The phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that gives the lunar surface a distinct reddish hue. This coloration is caused by sunlight scattering through Earth's atmosphere, which filters out blue light and allows red light to pass through and illuminate the moon. The event, which has captivated observers for millennia, was best viewed in Asia.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz captured his second U.S. Open title and sixth career Grand Slam with a commanding four-set victory over rival and defending champion Jannik Sinner. The 22-year-old Spaniard's superior performance will also return him to the world No. 1 ranking. The final was delayed due to heightened security for U.S. President Donald Trump's attendance, which drew a mixed reaction from the crowd. Alcaraz dominated much of the match with his powerful forehand and versatile play, effectively neutralizing Sinner's rhythm to win 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, marking the third time the two have met in a major final this year.</p>
