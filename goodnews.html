          <p>Laurent Mekies has been appointed the new team principal of Red Bull's Formula 1 team, replacing the recently dismissed Christian Horner. Mekies, an experienced engineer, is expected to bring a softer, more collaborative leadership style to a team that has faced competitive decline and internal turmoil. His immediate task is to stabilize the team and harness its existing talent to return to championship-contending form. The change in leadership marks a significant cultural shift for Red Bull as it moves on from the controversial Horner era.</p>

          <p>The United States and Japan have finalized a significant trade agreement, which President Trump described as "massive." The deal establishes reciprocal tariffs, notably lowering the duty on Japanese auto exports to the U.S. from 25% to 15%. In his announcement, Trump also claimed Japan would invest $550 billion in the U.S. and open its markets further to American goods. The agreement is seen as a potential political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who faces domestic pressure.</p>

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation remained steady at a four-year low of 0.8% in June, slightly below economists' expectations. Core inflation, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, also held firm at 0.6%. These soft inflation figures provide the Monetary Authority of Singapore with flexibility to potentially ease its monetary policy to support economic growth amid global trade uncertainties. The central bank has expressed concerns about a subdued domestic outlook for the second half of the year, despite strong GDP growth in the first half. (not investment advice)</p>

The terror bird, a flightless predator that could stand taller than a human, was a top predator of its time. This rare fossil provides direct evidence of a fatal interaction between two apex predators and offers new insights into the ancient ecosystem of the region.</p>

          <p>An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office has urged Chinese companies to become more deeply integrated with local economies in Southeast Asia.

By establishing genuine local operations rather than just using countries for transshipment, Chinese firms can build more resilient supply chains and protect themselves from unpredictable tariff policies.
