          <p>The third round of the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow was temporarily suspended due to adverse weather conditions, specifically the threat of lightning in the area. The delay affected the scheduled tee times for numerous golfers, including Max Greyserman, Rory McIlroy, and defending champion Xander Schauffele, as well as others. Practice had been briefly halted earlier due to the same weather concerns. This interruption impacts the tournament schedule and the players' preparation for the crucial third round, with officials closely monitoring conditions for a safe resumption of play.</p>

          <p>Rose Docherty, a 74-year-old grandmother in the U.K., was arrested for holding a sign outside an abortion clinic and is now raising concerns about the expansion of "buffer zones" that restrict free speech. Docherty's arrest occurred under the Abortion Services (Safe Access Zones) Act, which prohibits protests within 200 meters of abortion clinics in Scotland. She argues that the government is attempting to suppress any opposition to abortion and believes that authorities will continue to crack down on individuals whose views differ from the government's, regardless of the buffer zone's size.</p>

This would allow Couchbase to optimize costs and pursue organic growth away from the pressures of the public market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is pushing to revive the coal industry by using coal-fired plants to power AI data centers, but the tech industry is wary due to environmental concerns. While acknowledging the need for fossil fuels in the short term, tech companies are primarily focusing on natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal. Experts suggest Trump's executive order is a symbolic gesture to coal mining constituents, as the economics of coal plants are increasingly challenging compared to renewables, natural gas, and existing nuclear power.</p>

          <p>The United States has seen a significant decline in drug overdose deaths, with approximately 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023, marking the steepest single-year decline in 45 years. This drop brings overdose deaths back to pre-pandemic levels, with 45 states recording declines, particularly in Ohio and West Virginia. The increasing availability of naloxone, policies from the COVID-19 pandemic, and opioid-settlement cash have contributed to this reversal. While synthetic opioids like fentanyl are declining, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution pose a threat.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested on Truth Social that his past criticism of Taylor Swift has negatively impacted her popularity. This claim followed a four-day tour of the Middle East, where Trump engaged in diplomatic meetings and announced economic deals. The relationship between Trump and Swift has been strained, with Swift endorsing his political opponents in the past, leading to Trump's questioning of her political views and occasional disparaging remarks.</p>
