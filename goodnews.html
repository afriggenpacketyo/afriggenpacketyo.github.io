          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has been deemed fit to resume batting on the second day of the third Test against India after an injury scare. Stokes experienced a right groin issue on the first day but was able to bowl before play resumed, signaling his readiness to continue his innings. The all-rounder's fitness is crucial for England, especially given his recent return from hamstring surgery and his history of pushing his physical limits. Vice-captain Ollie Pope emphasized the importance of managing Stokes' condition to prevent further injury during the remainder of the series.</p>

Initially established with a focus on Asian infrastructure rather than poverty reduction, the China-led bank has expanded its membership from 57 to 110 economies. Despite initial skepticism from the West, the AIIB has positioned itself as a key player in global development finance. The institution's leadership emphasizes its goal is to improve international practices and demonstrate that China can be a constructive force for global prosperity.</p>

          <p>The UK government has paused plans to alter the tax-free allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) following significant opposition from banks, building societies, and consumer advocates. Chancellor Rachel Reeves had considered reducing the £20,000 allowance for cash savings to encourage more investment in stocks and shares to boost the economy. However, due to the backlash and concerns it would penalize savers, the reform is now on hold, though not entirely ruled out for the future. The Treasury stated its ambition remains to ensure savings deliver better returns and drive UK investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool captain and England international Jordan Henderson is set to return to the Premier League by signing with Brentford. The 35-year-old midfielder will join the club on a two-year contract after his deal with Dutch club Ajax was terminated a year early. This move provides Henderson a platform to remain in contention for England's World Cup squad next summer. The deal is expected to be finalized soon, marking his return to English football after a brief stint in the Saudi Pro League followed by his move to Ajax in January 2024.</p>

          <p>Despite a slump in Tesla sales across much of Europe, partly due to a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, the company continues to thrive in Norway. New Tesla sales in Norway jumped 54% year-on-year in June, driven by the popularity of its revamped Model Y, which meets local demand for space and all-wheel drive at a competitive price. This contrasts sharply with markets like Germany, where sales fell 60%. While a Norwegian survey found many would not buy a Tesla for political reasons, the brand's strong value proposition continues to dominate the world's most EV-friendly market.</p>
