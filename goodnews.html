          <p>The U.S. Army's Caisson Detachment has resumed its horse-drawn funeral tradition at Arlington National Cemetery after a two-year hiatus. The program was suspended due to concerns about the living conditions and care of the horses, prompting a $28 million overhaul. The renovated stables now provide better care for the horses, and the Army has brought in equine experts to ensure their well-being. The Caisson Detachment plays a crucial role in honoring veterans and service members, with the return of this tradition symbolizing the Army's commitment to respecting those who have served. The upgrades include improved feeding practices, rubber matting to prevent gravel ingestion, and enhanced veterinary care.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price experienced a rebound in morning trade, partially recovering from losses incurred after a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump. The stock had closed down 14% the previous day following the heated exchange, with Trump threatening to remove government contracts from Musk's companies. Despite the recent volatility, analysts remain optimistic about Tesla's long-term prospects, particularly regarding its autonomous vehicle technology. The rebound suggests that investors are assessing the fundamentals of the company and its future potential, rather than solely reacting to the short-term political drama.

          <p>The stock market is experiencing a rally following a positive update on nonfarm payrolls, which indicated the U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, and hourly wages increased by 3.9% year-over-year. The report eased concerns about a potential collapse in the labor market, which had been sparked by previous suboptimal economic reports. The U.S. economy's reliance on private consumption makes job market data a key indicator for investors. The jobs data suggests that the economy is stable enough to avoid an imminent recession, while also supporting the possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts in the coming months.

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed stringent new capital rules requiring UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its acquisition of Credit Suisse. The measures aim to stabilize the bank and require it to fully capitalize its foreign units, potentially reducing share buybacks. UBS shares initially jumped following the announcement, indicating investor confidence in the bank's stability. However, UBS expressed disagreement with the "extreme" increase in capital requirements, stating it would need to hold around $42 billion in additional CET1 capital in total. The bank plans to engage in consultations to evaluate alternatives and address the potential negative effects on its shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>
