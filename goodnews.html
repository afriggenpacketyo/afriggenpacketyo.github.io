          <p>Tim Friede, a US man who intentionally injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has contributed to the creation of an "unparalleled" antivenom. Antibodies in Friede's blood have demonstrated protection against fatal doses from various snake species in animal trials, offering a potential universal antivenom. Friede endured over 200 bites and 700 venom injections from deadly snakes like mambas and cobras, initially aiming to build immunity. Researchers identified broadly neutralizing antibodies in his blood, leading to a cocktail that saved mice from fatal doses of 13 of 19 venomous snake species, marking a significant step towards a universal antivenom.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic challenges and evolving global dynamics, with the ruling Labor Party led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese seeking a second term against opposition leader Peter Dutton. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing affordability, overshadowing global issues stemming from Washington. While recent polls suggest a Labor victory, dissatisfaction with both major parties is driving support towards independent candidates. The election also highlights cultural divides and the influence of international politics, particularly the Trump administration, on the Australian political scene.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to stabilize the local currency as it exceeded its trading band against the US dollar due to recent capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion worth of local currency. This intervention occurred before the US Federal Reserve's meeting where interest rate cuts are expected to be discussed. Similar interventions are anticipated if the US lowers interest rates, potentially increasing capital flow into Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is implementing administrative reforms to cut government spending and consolidate political power under new party chief To Lam. The reforms include merging ministries, shuttering media outlets, and eliminating 100,000 public sector jobs. These changes aim to streamline bureaucracy, address dysfunction from anti-corruption efforts, and adapt to external pressures like potential US tariffs. The restructuring is occurring ahead of the Communist Party's 14th National Congress, potentially strengthening the central government's control and narrowing pathways for party officials' advancement.</p>
