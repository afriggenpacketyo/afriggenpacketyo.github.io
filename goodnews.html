        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The choice of Alaska for the upcoming summit between the US and Russian presidents highlights the state's deep historical ties to Russia. From 1799 to 1867, Alaska was a full-fledged Russian colony before being sold to the U.S. for $7.2 million to pay off debts from the Crimean War. This shared history provides a symbolic backdrop for the talks, which are set to address the current conflict in Ukraine, also involving Crimea. Some Russian figures are emphasizing this historical connection on social media ahead of the meeting.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their tariff truce, postponing significant rate hikes and allowing another 90 days for negotiations on major economic and security issues. The agreement keeps U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods at 30% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods at 10%, averting a major escalation in the trade war. This extension is seen as a move to stabilize the economic situation and could pave the way for a leadership summit later this year. Analysts suggest the next steps will involve further official talks to resolve complex issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to an analysis by UBS, global investors are increasingly turning to China's $25 trillion domestic bond market as they seek alternatives to U.S. dollar-denominated assets. This shift is part of a broader de-dollarization trend, with foreign holdings of yuan-denominated bonds rebounding since a low in March 2023. While still a small fraction of the total market, foreign investment is growing, supported by Chinese regulators simplifying investment procedures. Major global bond indices have also started incorporating Chinese bonds, further integrating the market into the global financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he is open to a deal that would permit Nvidia to sell a less powerful version of its advanced Blackwell AI chip to China. Speaking at a press conference, Trump suggested he would consider an arrangement if the chip's performance was reduced by 30% to 50%. This development follows extensive lobbying by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang for access to the Chinese market after strict U.S. export controls were imposed. The potential move is seen by some analysts as a strategy to keep China dependent on American technology.</p>

          <p>The energy drink company Red Bull has acquired the English top-flight rugby club Newcastle Falcons, which will be rebranded as the Newcastle Red Bulls. This marks Red Bull's first entry into rugby union, expanding its extensive sports portfolio that includes football, Formula 1, and winter sports. The deal provides long-term financial security for the club, which has struggled competitively in recent seasons, finishing at the bottom of the league for three consecutive years. The takeover is seen as a positive development for the league, potentially attracting more major brands to the sport.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Trump-Putin Summit Reflects a New Geopolitical Reality</h2>

          <p>A Fox News opinion article frames the upcoming Trump-Putin summit as a necessary engagement in a world where the concept of a distant "abroad" no longer exists due to modern military technology like hypersonic missiles. The author argues that President Trump, as a realist, is uniquely equipped to handle a leader like Putin and that deterring global threats requires direct engagement. The article posits that if Trump can secure an acceptable end to the war in Ukraine, it would be a monumental achievement for his legacy, comparable to the Abraham Accords. It asserts that hoping for his failure is unpatriotic.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 05:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Swiss sportswear company On reported a 32% increase in sales for its second quarter, prompting it to raise its full-year revenue and gross margin guidance. The popular sneaker brand now anticipates annual sales of 2.91 billion Swiss francs, despite facing new U.S. tariffs on goods imported from Vietnam, where it sources 90% of its products. To offset the higher costs, the company raised prices in July but has not observed any negative impact on consumer demand. The strong performance highlights the brand's continued growth in the competitive sportswear industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will be shutting down its dial-up internet service, a technology synonymous with accessing the web in the 1990s, effective September 30. The service, known for its distinctive series of beeps and static noises during connection, was once a dominant force in bringing the internet to American homes. It functioned by using a modem to send data over standard telephone lines, a method that has since been almost entirely replaced by high-speed broadband. The decision marks the end of an era for a service that played a pivotal role in closing the early "digital divide."</p>

          <p>An American teen pilot and influencer, Ethan Guo, who was detained on a remote Antarctic island since June, has had all charges against him dropped. The 19-year-old was accused by Chilean authorities of illegally landing his plane in their territory and providing false flight plan information during a solo trip to raise money for cancer research. A judge ordered him to pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation and banned him from re-entering Chile for three years. Guo is now awaiting approval to depart the island and continue his mission.</p>

In an interview with the BBC, she noted that the industry remains male-dominated despite its global growth. To address this, Tems has launched "The Leading Vibe Initiative," a platform designed to create opportunities and provide support for young women in Africa's music scene. She hopes the project will help change how women see themselves in music and make it easier for them to achieve success.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) in Singapore has stated the integrated resort will "be ready" for its next casino license renewal after receiving a truncated two-year license instead of the usual three. The shorter renewal was due to what Singapore's gambling authority called "unsatisfactory" tourism performance from 2021 to 2023. Despite the rebuke, CEO Lee Shi Ruh confirmed that RWS's S$6.8 billion expansion plans are proceeding, with a focus on transforming the resort into a premium lifestyle destination with new attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium.</p>
