          <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo's Potential US Return Seen as a Strategic Move Ahead of World Cup</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Speculation is growing around Cristiano Ronaldo's potential return to the United States for the first time in over a decade, a move viewed as strategically significant for the upcoming World Cup. His long absence coincides with sexual assault allegations made against him in 2017, which he has always denied and which have since been legally resolved. The article suggests that a potential friendly match between Portugal and the US could signal a clearing of the path for his presence at the tournament. This development is seen as a major branding opportunity for both Ronaldo and FIFA, especially within the large American consumer market.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships in Tokyo commenced under grueling heat and humidity, with temperatures climbing to 30°C and humidity exceeding 90%. The challenging conditions significantly impacted the opening 35km race walk events, where some athletes collapsed after finishing. In a poignant moment for the host nation, Japanese race walker Hayato Katsuki secured a bronze medal, allowing local fans to celebrate after being denied the chance during the spectator-free 2020 Olympics. Organizers have already rescheduled marathon start times to mitigate health risks as a severe heatwave is forecast for the coming days.</p>

          <p>In a stunning high school football upset, Corona Centennial defeated the nation's top-ranked team, Mater Dei, with a final score of 43-36. Centennial dominated the first half, leading 33-7, largely due to forcing multiple turnovers from Mater Dei. Despite a massive 29-0 third-quarter comeback by Mater Dei to take the lead, Centennial rallied in the fourth quarter to secure the victory. The win marks the first time a Southern Section team other than St. John Bosco has beaten Mater Dei in a decade, coincidentally when Centennial last achieved the feat, led by the older brothers of Friday's star players.</p>

          <p>Pre-orders for Apple's new iPhone 17 series in China have seen exceptionally strong demand, setting new sales records on major e-commerce platforms like JD.com. Within the first minute of availability, sales surpassed the entire first-day volume of the previous iPhone 16 series, with the standard 256GB model being the most popular. The high demand caused technical difficulties on Apple's official website, and in major cities like Shanghai, all in-store pickup slots for the Pro Max model were booked within 20 minutes. Customers now face wait times extending into mid-October for new orders. (not investment advice)</p>
