          <p>Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong addressed the deepening US-China rivalry at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, emphasizing Asean's capacity to shape its own future. Wong stated that the region aims to be an inclusive arena, encouraging active engagement from both the US and China, while rejecting zero-sum competition. He highlighted the region's economic significance and its desire to avoid a recurrence of proxy wars reminiscent of the Cold War era. Asean seeks shared prosperity through cooperation among major powers, as it balances its relationships with the US as its largest investor and China as its largest trading partner.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Iran is tentatively holding, leading to cautious optimism in Israel and the reopening of Ben Gurion International Airport. Both countries have claimed victory, with conflicting reports emerging about the extent of damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear program. While President Trump stated the program was set back decades, initial intelligence assessments suggest only a few months delay. Iran has threatened to accelerate its enrichment work without IAEA oversight, prompting its parliament to consider halting cooperation with the agency, leaving some Israelis uncertain about the future, but the diplomacy could help revive talks to end the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates are stuck in a narrow range around 7%, showing little movement despite economic uncertainty and international conflicts. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes have slightly decreased, remaining historically low due to inflated house prices and limited supply. Refinance applications have increased, but overall volumes are still low, leading to significant percentage changes from small shifts. The article points to the average loan size for purchase applications declining to the lowest level since January 2025, which is driven by decreasing conventional purchase loan sizes.</p>

          <p>President Trump has asserted that the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear program resulted in "total obliteration," contradicting an early Pentagon report suggesting a setback of only months. Trump insisted Iran's nuclear program has been set back "basically decades," and that it's "gone for years." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio supported Trump's position, while Democratic Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Chris Coons called for answers and a return to negotiations with Iran.

The case concerned ‚Ç¨400 million in loans provided by the state development bank KfW, which were approved by the European Commission in July 2021. Ryanair challenged that approval, but the court said the Commission acted lawfully, finding no evidence that the aid discriminated against other airlines or violated freedom of establishment or the free provision of services.

          <h2>Navigating the Complexities of In-Law Relationships</h2>

          <p>In-law relationships can be intricate, with varying degrees of closeness and potential for conflict, often influenced by cultural and familial expectations. These relationships lack clearly defined expectations, leading to uncertainty about roles and boundaries. The partner's example significantly shapes interactions with in-laws, and early discussions about expectations and traditions are crucial. Maintaining a cordial relationship is often beneficial for the sake of the spouse or children, but respect should be mutual, and understanding each other's flaws can help navigate challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that there is "great progress" on negotiations to end the war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza. He also commented on the recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, claiming they caused "total obliteration" and set Iran's nuclear ambitions back by "decades." This statement comes despite a report suggesting the strikes did not fully eliminate Iran's centrifuges or stockpile of enriched uranium. Trump labeled these reports as "fake news."</p>
