          <p>Japan's core inflation rate accelerated to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in over two years and exceeding market expectations. This rise in inflation, driven by persistent cost pressures, strengthens the case for the Bank of Japan to consider exiting its long-standing ultra-easy monetary policy. Headline inflation also climbed to 3.6%, remaining above the central bank's 2% target for more than three years, prompting Governor Kazuo Ueda to signal a readiness to continue raising rates, albeit at a slower pace, as authorities assess the impact of U.S. tariffs on the economy.</p>

The race is overshadowed by controversy as Team Penske was penalized for using modified parts, leading to the dismissal of team executives and raising questions about conflicts of interest. O‚ÄôWard, known for his determination, aims to overcome these challenges and secure his first Indy 500 victory, dedicating his efforts to his close-knit team and family.</p>

          <p>Amazon shareholders rejected a proposal to adopt a policy that would require the company's CEO and board chair roles to remain separate. Approximately 82% of shareholders voted against the proposal, which aimed to codify the existing structure where the CEO and board chair roles are split. The proposal argued that this separation allows the board to focus on corporate governance and oversight, while the CEO focuses on the company's business. Amazon urged shareholders to vote against the proposal, saying the current policy enables the board to determine the right leadership for the company based on specific circumstances.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a case involving President Trump's firing of labor board members has eased concerns that he could fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at will. The court noted that the Federal Reserve is a "uniquely structured, quasi-private entity" distinct from other government agencies. While Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell, the Federal Reserve Act stipulates that Fed officials can only be dismissed "for cause," not for political disagreements, reinforcing the Fed's independence from political interference.</p>

The bill includes a provision to lift the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes, a key issue for blue-state Republicans.
