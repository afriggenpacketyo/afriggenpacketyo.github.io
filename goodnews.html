          <p>Ozeki Onosato has clinched his promotion to yokozuna, the highest rank in sumo wrestling, by securing back-to-back championships at the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament. The 24-year-old wrestler achieved an impressive 13-0 record after defeating fellow ozeki Kotozakura, establishing an insurmountable lead. Onosato's promotion marks a significant milestone as he becomes the first Japanese-born yokozuna since his stablemaster, the former Kisenosato, retired in 2019, and he will join Mongolian Hoshoryu at the sport's highest echelon. His rapid ascent in the makuuchi division, debuting just last year, highlights his exceptional talent and dedication to the sport.</p>

          <p>Former Brentford striker Ivan Toney has been recalled to the England squad by head coach Thomas Tuchel for the upcoming matches against Andorra and Senegal. This marks Toney's first call-up since his move to Saudi Arabian club Al-Ahli last summer, after making his last of six England appearances in the Euro 2024 final defeat by Spain. His impressive performance of 28 goals in 42 appearances for Al-Ahli has convinced Tuchel to reconsider him for the squad. Jude Bellingham has also been selected, despite his upcoming shoulder surgery, and a number of players competing in next month's Club World Cup are included as well.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Steven Pinker, a Harvard professor, critiques the excessive negativity directed at Harvard University. He acknowledges the university's genuine issues, including the erosion of academic freedom and a lack of viewpoint diversity, exemplified by incidents like the demonization of Carole Hooven and the dismissal of Ronald Sullivan. However, Pinker argues that the extreme characterizations of Harvard as a "woke madrasa" or "Islamist outpost" are disproportionate and unhelpful. He emphasizes that Harvard has also contributed significantly to society through research and innovation, advocating for a balanced approach that identifies and addresses specific problems rather than resorting to destructive measures, and that a bit of D.E.I. for conservatives would not hurt.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 05:01:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has confirmed a fall in the energy price cap, resulting in a typical gas and electricity bill decrease of ¬£11 a month from July for 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. Despite this drop, Ofgem advises consumers to explore fixed-rate energy deals, potentially saving up to ¬£200 annually, though current fixed-deal holders won't benefit from the immediate price decrease. While the reduction reflects lower international wholesale gas prices, energy bills remain significantly higher than pre-2020 levels, leading to rising customer debt to suppliers, and critics urge the government to provide targeted support for vulnerable households and invest in energy efficiency measures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Army is set to roll out its new Army Fitness Test (AFT) on June 1, 2025, replacing the current Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) with updated scoring standards that emphasize readiness and combat effectiveness. The AFT consists of five events: the three-repetition maximum deadlift, hand-release push-ups, sprint-drag-carry, plank, and a two-mile run. Scoring requirements are more demanding, with combat roles held to the highest standards, and these combat standards are sex-neutral to ensure fairness and operational readiness. Experts suggest the AFT is challenging but achievable for those with a basic fitness foundation, while others caution that it requires dedicated training to avoid injury.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines some of the more unusual clauses that have appeared in NFL contracts, such as performance escalators, homework clauses, and weight clauses. One notable example is Kyler Murray's "independent study" clause, which mandated that he watch four hours of film a week. Another is Dez Bryant's "security agreement," which included a three-person security detail and a ban on alcohol. The article also discusses weight clauses, where players receive bonuses for hitting target weights. These examples highlight the varied and sometimes bizarre ways that NFL teams try to incentivize player performance and behavior.</p>

The chicks were part of a 12,000-bird shipment left unattended at a Delaware mail distribution center, leading to the death of thousands due to high temperatures. The surviving birds were cared for by the First State Animal Center and SPCA, which ensured that adopters would not use the birds for meat.

          <p>Apple has raised trade-in values for iPhones in China to boost demand amid increasing competition from local rivals. The increased trade-in values apply to various iPhone models, including the iPhone 15 Pro Max, now valued at up to 5,700 Chinese yuan. This move is part of Apple's broader strategy to offer discounts and incentives, particularly around holiday periods, to maintain sales in the Chinese market. Apple faces challenges from competitors like Xiaomi and Huawei, with the latter experiencing a resurgence due to chip breakthroughs and aggressive device launches.</p>

          <p>Yoshio Itoi, a former professional baseball player for the Hanshin Tigers, has returned to his hometown of Yosano in Kyoto Prefecture to support local children through rice farming. Itoi is working with the agricultural corporation AGRIST to produce and promote a premium brand of Koshihikari rice known as "Superman Rice." A portion of the rice's sales is used to purchase sports equipment, which Itoi personally delivers to local elementary schools, aiming to address the decline in farming and youth participation in sports.</p>

          <p>A man in Norway woke up to find a large container ship had run aground and crashed into his front garden, missing his house by only a few meters. The 135-meter ship, the NCL Salten, went off course in the Trondheim Fjord, causing no injuries to the 16 people on board. The incident is under investigation, and the head of NCL, which chartered the ship, expressed gratitude that no one was injured. The ship had previously run aground in 2023 but got free under its own power.</p>
