          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has reduced its benchmark policy rate to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022, marking the third consecutive rate cut since February. This decision, below Reuters' median estimate of 5.75%, follows better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, which expanded 7.4% year-on-year. While the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, it acknowledges a slowdown compared to the previous financial year's 9.2%. The RBI's rate cut is also influenced by the downtrend in India's inflation, with the most recent headline inflation reading for April at 3.16%, its lowest since July 2019.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against President Trump's directive that would prevent Harvard University from admitting international students. The same judge also extended a block on another attempt by the administration to stop the university from issuing student visas. This ruling protects Harvard from potential harm caused by the enforcement of the ban. The judge's decision allows Harvard to continue enrolling international students without the restrictions imposed by the Trump administration's order.</p>

          <p>North Korea's state news agency KCNA reported that it has successfully raised a capsized 5,000-ton naval destroyer, which had been damaged during a failed launch in May. The ship is now moored at a pier in the northeastern port of Chongjin, where experts will assess its hull. Kim Jong Un has set a deadline for the "perfect restoration of the destroyer" by this month, having previously criticized the failed launch as a "criminal act." The ship is Pyongyang's second known destroyer and is reportedly capable of carrying various weapons, including nuclear missiles.</p>
