          <h2>Mastercard Faces Potential Payouts to Consumers After Unfair Fees Ruling</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent court ruling has determined that Mastercard administered unfair fees to shoppers over a 15-year period, potentially entitling millions of consumers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (or Scotland) to compensation of up to ¬£70 each. The legal case, initiated by a former financial ombudsman, argued that these fees led to higher prices for consumers. The total settlement is valued at ¬£200 million, with half specifically allocated for consumers who have until the end of the year to file their claims. This decision aims to provide a 'fair and just outcome' for those affected by the historic overcharges.</p>

The project, estimated to cost $175 billion, aims to integrate with existing defense capabilities and be fully operational within three years.

          <p>Novavax has secured FDA approval for its COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, but with restrictions limiting its use to individuals aged 65 and older and those aged 12 to 64 with underlying medical conditions. The approval requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart-related side effects. Despite these limitations, the approval is considered a win for Novavax, triggering a $175 million milestone payment from Sanofi, with whom they have a licensing deal. Sanofi's partnership is expected to enhance Novavax's market share, as the company prepares for commercial delivery of the vaccine in the US this fall.</p>

However, the FDA will now require vaccine manufacturers to conduct additional large studies to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for children and younger healthy adults.

          <p>A memorial bust of Jim Morrison, stolen from his grave site in Paris nearly four decades ago, has been recovered by Paris police. The bust, sculpted by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin, was placed on Morrison's tombstone in 1981 and disappeared in 1988. The recovery occurred during an unrelated investigation, with officials not sharing details about the search's purpose. Morrison's grave remains a popular destination for fans, and a representative from Morrison's estate expressed happiness about the bust's rediscovery.</p>

          <p>Team World, consisting of approximately 143,000 players, managed to draw against grandmaster Magnus Carlsen in a marathon chess showdown.

          <h2>Surprising Debt Relief Features You Should Know</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 15:49:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores three potentially surprising aspects of debt relief. First, being behind on payments can sometimes help you qualify for debt forgiveness, as it demonstrates an inability to pay. Second, smaller debt amounts, such as $5,000, may also qualify for certain relief options like credit card debt forgiveness. Finally, taking out another loan, specifically a debt consolidation loan, can be advantageous by consolidating debt at a lower interest rate and streamlining the payoff process. Understanding these features can help borrowers develop a more effective debt relief strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Impact of Debt Forgiveness on Credit Scores</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 15:46:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Debt forgiveness, while offering a path to becoming debt-free, generally hurts your credit score. Settling a debt for less than the full amount owed is typically reported as 'settled' rather than 'paid in full,' which can negatively impact your credit history. Additionally, stopping payments while negotiating debt forgiveness can lead to late payments and charge-offs, further damaging your score. While debt forgiveness remains on your credit report for seven years, its impact lessens over time as you rebuild your credit. The decision to pursue debt forgiveness depends on your financial situation and goals.</p>

          <p>Google is taking a significant step in artificial intelligence by adding interactive capabilities to its flagship search engine. The new feature, called A.I. Mode, will function like a chatbot, allowing users to ask follow-up questions and receive comprehensive answers generated by the company's A.I. system. This move aims to disrupt Google's traditional search business before competitors can. The A.I. transition comes amid mounting antitrust pressures and concerns from web publishers about traffic disruption. Google is also introducing other A.I. features, including personalized email replies and a shopping tool.</p>
