        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cleveland Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson criticized the Indiana Pacers' physical play during their recent playoff game, suggesting it crossed a line and contributed to injuries for Evan Mobley and DeAndre Hunter. Atkinson emphasized that while the play wasn't "dirty," the excessive physicality led to Mobley aggravating an ankle injury and Hunter dislocating a thumb. Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle defended his team, stating that coaches protect their players and that disagreements are common in heated playoff series. Mobley and Hunter were ruled out for Game 2 due to their injuries.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced plans to cut key interest rates and the bank reserve requirement ratio in an effort to stimulate economic growth amidst trade concerns. The People's Bank of China will lower the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points and reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, injecting liquidity into the market. These measures come as Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng is scheduled to hold trade talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland, signaling potential negotiations between the two countries to address the ongoing trade war.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Trump lightheartedly suggested the possibility of Canada becoming the 51st state, a notion Carney firmly rejected. Carney emphasized that Canada is "not for sale" and expressed a commitment to partnership rather than acquisition. The exchange occurred amid ongoing trade tensions between the two countries, with Trump maintaining his stance on tariffs and Carney vowing to defend Canadian interests. The leaders also discussed global issues of common concern, highlighting the complexities of the U.S.-Canada relationship.</p>

          <p>Long Beach has partnered with Throne Labs to install four "smart" public restrooms throughout the city, offering a high-tech solution to address restroom gaps in high-traffic areas. The restrooms, accessed via QR codes and physical access cards, feature a 10-minute time limit to discourage loitering and ensure safety. The pilot program aims to collect data on usage and user experience to determine the feasibility of expanding the initiative. Each restroom costs $6,200 per month, with the goal of providing clean and accessible facilities for residents and visitors.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a conciliatory tone during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a stark contrast to his previous hostile rhetoric towards Canada. Trump, who had spent months belittling Canada and suggesting its annexation, declared, "Canada loves us and we love Canada." The meeting, freighted with awkwardness and recrimination, saw Trump attempting to skate around the complications created by his previous statements, shifting the conversation to unrelated topics. Carney, however, remained guarded, making it clear that Canada was not open to any discussion of becoming the 51st state.</p>

          <p>The Met Gala appearances of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and singer Diljit Dosanjh, were met with disappointment by some South Asian fans who felt the stars were not given the respect they deserved. Vogue's livestream hosts appeared largely unaware of Shah Rukh Khan's global fame, and quickly cut away from Diljit Dosanjh's red carpet appearance. The incident sparked online criticism, with many expressing that such disrespect would not have been shown to other stars of similar stature. A Vogue representative stated that the lack of attention was unintentional.</p>
