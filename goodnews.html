        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are preparing for a surge in freight containers from China as importers rush to beat potential tariff increases, with vessel arrivals already showing an uptick. While officials are not calling it a "surge," they acknowledge the increase was expected due to President Trump's August 12 deadline for a U.S.-China trade deal. Despite the anticipated boost for trucking, railroads, and warehouse companies, terminals at both ports are operating below full capacity, and retailers aren't significantly boosting inventory levels, indicating that the cargo flow is still below normal for June. The increase in cargo has put more people back to work on the docks, although looming trade negotiation deadlines may impact volume forecasts for the remainder of the year.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compares the costs of a $50,000 home equity loan versus a $50,000 personal loan in June 2025, finding that the home equity loan is cheaper due to lower interest rates. The average home equity loan interest rate is 8.25% compared to the median personal loan rate of 12.65%. A five-year home equity loan at 8.25% would cost $1,019.81 per month, while a personal loan at 12.65% would cost $1,128.72 per month, saving approximately $6,540 over five years with the home equity loan. While HELOC rates are also down, they are variable and carry risk, making home equity loans more predictable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article discusses the anonymity of heat waves as disasters, contrasting them with named storms like Hurricane Katrina that evoke stronger cultural memory. It explores the idea of naming heat waves to increase public awareness and promote safety measures, referencing a pilot program in Seville, Spain, that assigned the name "Zoe" to a local heat wave. However, the author acknowledges the challenges of implementing such a system due to the varying scale and temperature thresholds of heat waves across different regions. Despite the difficulties, the author suggests that recognizing heat waves is crucial, especially as they contribute to larger warming trends and mass extinctions.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to meet with food delivery companies following reports that asylum seekers are illegally working as couriers shortly after arriving in the country. The Sun newspaper reported that Channel migrants were renting Deliveroo and Just Eat accounts via social media groups, earning up to ¬£1,000 a week, despite asylum seekers being prohibited from working for the first 12 months. Border Security Minister Dame Angela Eagle will meet with the companies to address the issue, which the government says undermines honest businesses and undercuts local wages. Food delivery apps have stated they have strict rules and checks to ensure only riders with the right to work in the UK are used.</p>

Despite the sale, Huang still owns over 800 million Nvidia shares, maintaining a net worth of approximately $126 billion.
