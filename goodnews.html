          <p>This opinion article, written by a former colleague, strongly endorses Eric Tung's nomination by President Trump to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The author details Tung's distinguished credentials, including clerkships for Justice Neil Gorsuch and the late Justice Antonin Scalia, presenting him as a brilliant constitutionalist. Despite this, his Senate confirmation hearing was reportedly marred by partisan attacks focused on his associations rather than his legal merits. The piece concludes by urging the Senate to confirm Tung, arguing his appointment would be a significant step in reinforcing the rule of law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey's Gobekli Tepe, a nearly 12,000-year-old archaeological site, has become a focal point for conspiracy theories, amplified by figures like Joe Rogan. These theories suggest a "lost civilization" built the site and that archaeologists are deliberately hiding discoveries. Lead archaeologist Lee Clare refutes these claims, explaining that the slow pace of excavation is necessary to preserve the site for future generations and properly decode its history. Clare emphasizes that rushing the process would destroy invaluable information, stressing that the real story of this ancient ceremonial hub is one of humanity's earliest known efforts at communal storytelling.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant de-escalation measure, North Korea has started to dismantle some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the border with South Korea. This move follows a similar action by Seoul, which recently halted its own broadcasts as part of President Lee Jae Myung's efforts to reopen dialogue with Pyongyang. The loudspeakers have been a recurring feature of inter-Korean tensions, with the South broadcasting K-pop and news, while the North emitted disruptive noises. This reciprocal step is seen as a positive development, reversing the hard-line policies of the previous South Korean administration and fostering a more conciliatory atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has officially completed the signing of 22-year-old striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for a total fee of £73.7 million. The Slovenia international has signed a five-year contract, becoming the club's third major attacking acquisition this summer. Sesko, who was also a target for Newcastle, expressed his excitement about the club's future and his eagerness to contribute to its success under manager Ruben Amorim. His arrival adds significant firepower to United's front line but also raises questions about the future of current striker Rasmus Hojlund at Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>As catastrophic hunger affects populations in Gaza, Sudan, and other conflict zones, health experts are highlighting the dangers of refeeding syndrome. This potentially fatal condition can occur when severely malnourished individuals resume normal eating too quickly, causing a rapid shift in electrolytes that can lead to heart failure and other critical issues. The article explains that proper treatment requires a slow, managed reintroduction of nutrients, often using specially formulated products like ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs). Experts stress that preventing this syndrome requires safe access for aid agencies to deliver care, a challenge in regions where aid is obstructed.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved plans to build the Strait of Messina Bridge, a project intended to be the world's longest single-span suspension bridge connecting Sicily to the mainland. The estimated cost is €13.5 billion, which the government says is fully funded publicly. While proponents tout economic benefits and job creation, the project has faced decades of cancellations due to concerns about cost, seismic activity in the region, and local opposition. Structural engineers believe the risks can be managed with modern technology, but the project's long and troubled history suggests a challenging path to its planned 2032 completion.</p>

          <p>This article provides etiquette advice for being a good houseguest, emphasizing respect for the host's space and schedule.

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly stated that U.S. military forces will not be permitted to operate in Mexico, following reports that President Trump directed the Pentagon to target Latin American drug cartels. While emphasizing that the two countries cooperate on security, Sheinbaum ruled out any form of U.S. military incursion on Mexican soil. The reported directive comes after Trump designated several Mexican cartels as terrorist entities. Mexican officials maintain that any U.S. action against cartels must respect their nation's sovereignty and cannot involve military intervention without their consent.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the unexpected return of Welsh star Louis Rees-Zammit to rugby union after a brief stint pursuing an NFL career with the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Commentators believe his time in the NFL has made him a more mature and skilled player, with a unique mindset that will benefit Welsh rugby. Despite not achieving his American dream, the move is framed not as a failure but as a closed chapter in a promising athletic career.</p>

Winger Abby Dow describes the team's journey as climbing "Everest," a metaphor inspired by a talk from a mountaineer who summited the peak. The team is focused on learning from past encounters, particularly their narrow Six Nations win over France and their heartbreaking loss to New Zealand in the last World Cup final.
