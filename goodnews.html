          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix with a last-minute lap, narrowly beating out McLaren's Oscar Piastri by just over a tenth of a second. Piastri's teammate, Lando Norris, secured third place, followed by Mercedes' George Russell in a tightly contested qualifying session at Silverstone. Despite a promising start, Lewis Hamilton finished fifth for Mercedes, expressing that a small mistake in the final corner likely cost him a front-row start. The results set the stage for a competitive race, with the top drivers separated by very slim margins.</p>

          <h2>Rise of 'Tipflation' and Digital Payments Creates Confusion for Consumers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 11:13:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The proliferation of digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options has led to a phenomenon known as "tipflation," leaving many consumers confused and pressured. While tipping has long been customary in certain service situations, new technology now prompts for gratuities in a wider range of transactions, from fast-food counters to self-service kiosks. Experts note that these systems often default to higher tip percentages, influencing customer behavior and increasing tip amounts overall. This shift has sparked a debate about when and how much to tip, as consumers navigate feelings of obligation and social pressure in new contexts.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally issued a "positive response" to the latest ceasefire proposal mediated by the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar, stating it is prepared to enter negotiations on the implementation details. The framework, announced by President Trump, reportedly involves a 60-day truce. While Trump expressed optimism that a deal could be reached soon, officials note that Hamas is still seeking firm guarantees for a complete end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The development marks a potentially significant step toward halting the nearly 21-month conflict that has devastated the region.</p>

          <p>England and Wales have been drawn into what analysts are calling the "toughest group of all" at the Women's Euro 2025 tournament. Group D also features football powerhouses France and the Netherlands, meaning three of the four teams are ranked in the world's top 11. Statistical analysis gives the group a 37% chance of producing the eventual tournament winner. While England are defending champions and the Netherlands won in 2017, France boasts an impressive recent winning streak. Wales enters as the underdog in their first major tournament but has shown resilience in recent matches against top-ranked opponents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral TikTok trend known as the "cortisol cocktail," a non-alcoholic drink made with ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, and magnesium, is being promoted as a way to lower the stress hormone cortisol. However, medical professionals are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. Endocrinologists explain that cortisol is a necessary hormone and that doctors rarely aim to lower it except in specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. While the drink is likely harmless for most and may aid hydration, experts caution that it is not a proven method for stress reduction.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the MingKwai, an innovative Chinese typewriter from the 1940s, has been discovered and acquired by Stanford University. Invented by linguist Lin Yutang, the machine was a groundbreaking attempt to adapt the complex, non-alphabetic Chinese language for modern technology. Its unique system, which organized characters by shape rather than sound, is considered a conceptual ancestor to modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean computing input methods. The discovery of the only known prototype, previously thought to be lost, is generating excitement among scholars for its historical significance in the evolution of global communication technology.</p>

The reopening follows a massive $1.5 billion cleanup project, initiated in preparation for last year's Olympics, which has successfully improved the water quality to meet European standards. On Saturday, designated swimming areas with safety measures, including lifeguards and lifebuoys, opened to the public near the Eiffel Tower and Île Saint-Louis.

          <p>At Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab, scientists are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to monitor the health of the marine ecosystem and challenge negative public perceptions of the animals. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the research team examines shark stomach contents to understand their diet, which serves as an indicator of the bay's overall water quality and ecological balance. The lab's work aims to demonstrate that healthy shark populations are crucial for a healthy ocean. Despite public fascination with sharks, researchers note that securing financial support for this vital scientific work remains a significant challenge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Google X executive and happiness researcher Mo Gawdat advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage anger and stress. Based on neuroscientific findings, the rule posits that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, involving hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any prolonged feeling of upset is due to consciously or unconsciously re-engaging with the negative thought. Gawdat suggests using this 90-second buffer to consciously choose a different focus, thereby preventing rumination and allowing for a quicker recovery from life's daily frustrations.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the central role of hobbies in Danish culture, a professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School undertook a year-long experiment of trying 17 different hobbies. The author found that engaging in activities from tennis and mahjong to woodworking helped her kick a doomscrolling habit, feel less lonely by connecting with new communities, and change her perspective on self-care. She argues that contrary to the belief that one needs to find balance before starting a hobby, the act of pursuing a hobby is what actually creates balance and forces the definition of personal and professional boundaries.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data reveals that Florida continues to be the most popular state for retirees, attracting a net influx of over 44,500 residents aged 60 and older in 2023. While this number is lower than the previous year, it still far surpasses other states like North Carolina and Arizona, which also saw significant gains. The state's appeal is attributed to its lack of state income, estate, or inheritance taxes, making it financially advantageous for those on fixed incomes. In contrast, California saw the largest exodus of retirees, with a net loss of nearly 57,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article from The Atlantic explores the importance of decoupling exercise from the singular goal of weight loss to foster a healthier relationship with physical activity. For many, the association between working out and trying to get thin can be detrimental, but finding a new form of movement or a supportive community can rewire this mindset. By focusing on strength, enjoyment, or mental well-being, people can discover that movement makes them feel better in their bodies in unexpected ways. The piece highlights how activities like weightlifting or group fitness can be more fulfilling than pursuing purely aesthetic outcomes.</p>

          <p>Deaths from heart attacks in the U.S. have plummeted by nearly 90 percent since the 1970s, a testament to significant progress in public health and medical treatment. This dramatic improvement is attributed to a combination of factors, including the successful anti-smoking campaign, the development of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and widespread adoption of CPR. Furthermore, advancements in emergency and hospital care, such as portable defibrillators and angioplasty, have greatly increased survival rates. While heart disease remains a leading cause of death, the focus has shifted from acute events to managing chronic conditions, with new drugs and screening methods offering further hope.</p>
