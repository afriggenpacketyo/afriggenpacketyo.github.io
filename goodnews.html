          <p>The US House of Representatives passed several bills aimed at countering China's economic espionage, export control violations, national security threats, and alleged human rights abuses, while also seeking to strengthen ties with Taiwan and protect Falun Gong practitioners. These bills, which had previously stalled in the Senate, gained bipartisan support amid rising US-China tensions over trade tariffs and technological competition. One key bill, reintroduced by Representative Rich McCormick, authorizes the president to impose sanctions on foreign entities involved in trade secret thefts or aiding adversarial militaries, specifically targeting Chinese firms transferring sensitive technologies to countries like Russia. The article highlights the increasing legislative pressure on Beijing from the US.</p>

          <p>In China, a growing circular economy is emerging around the recycling of lithium-ion batteries and solar panels, driven by the increasing volume of these products reaching the end of their life cycle. Companies like Henan Hairui Intelligent Technology are focusing on recycling valuable components such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel from these discarded items. This trend is particularly significant as it improves China's mineral independence amid global trade tensions. The sales manager at Henan Hairui Intelligent Technology noted that 70% of the company's business is dedicated to machines for recycling batteries and solar panels.</p>

          <h2>Social Security Cards to Become Available Digitally Amid Security Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 17:57:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Social Security cards will soon be available digitally, raising both optimism and concerns among experts. While digital access offers convenience, there are worries about access for older or less tech-savvy individuals, as well as the security of Social Security numbers and the devices on which they are accessed. Experts emphasize the need for robust ID theft protections, given that many Social Security numbers have already been compromised in data breaches. The move is seen as a step in the right direction if implemented securely.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor beat Wall Street's first-quarter expectations but suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs. The company expects to offset $1 billion of those costs through remediation actions, with a total impact of $1.5 billion in 2025. Ford cited near-term risks, including potential industry-wide supply chain disruptions and the potential for future or increased tariffs in the U.S., as reasons for pulling its guidance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to incentivize prescription drug manufacturing in the U.S., aiming to streamline the path for pharmaceutical companies to build new production sites stateside. The order directs the FDA to reduce approval times for domestic manufacturing plants and increase inspection fees for foreign plants. This move comes ahead of Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. Some pharmaceutical companies are starting to push back on Trump's plans, with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla saying the tariff threat is deterring further U.S. investments in research and development.</p>

Square Root Day is also special this year because the year itself (2025) is a perfect square (45 x 45).</p>
