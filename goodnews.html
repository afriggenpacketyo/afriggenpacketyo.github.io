          <p>The Trump administration has formally accepted a Boeing 747 jet gifted by Qatar, intending to potentially use it as the new Air Force One despite warnings and bribery accusations. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth accepted the luxury plane, with the Department of Defense ensuring it meets security measures and mission requirements. While Trump called it a "great thing," experts estimate converting the 13-year-old jet could cost over $1 billion and take years. Critics, including Democrats and some Republicans, have raised concerns about national security risks and ethical problems, viewing the exchange as a potential bribe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has emerged as a leader in stream restoration, primarily by implementing simple solutions such as providing clean drinking water for cows and keeping them out of streams. Farmer Grant Victor's decision to fence off his cattle from Horse Creek led to significant improvements, including reduced veterinarian bills and the return of wildlife. As a result of these practices, approximately 100 streams in Oklahoma, once polluted by farmland runoff, have been restored to health. This initiative demonstrates the effectiveness of local solutions in addressing environmental problems and serves as a model for other states.</p>

          <p>Google has launched AI Mode, a new artificial intelligence feature designed to provide users with more detailed and tailored responses to search queries. This follows the introduction of AI Overviews last year, with CEO Sundar Pichai calling AI Mode a "total reimagining of Search." The technology summarizes information from multiple sources and presents it at the top of the search platform, along with links to relevant sites. Google is also testing a "Search Live" feature that responds to questions based on video content and voice searches, utilizing its latest AI model, Gemini 2.5.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has appointed Freddy Lim, the founder and lead singer of the heavy metal band Chthonic, as its envoy to Finland, a country known as a heavy metal mecca. Lim's appointment is based not only on his musical fame but also on his human rights work and international exchange experience. He served as a national legislator and was chairman of Amnesty International in Taiwan. Chthonic, which incorporates Taiwanese mythology into its music, has used its performances to highlight Taiwan's struggles for international recognition. While some legislators have expressed doubts, Lim's appointment underscores Taiwan's efforts to strengthen its international relations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced the "Golden Dome for America," a multilayered missile defense system designed to protect the U.S. from foreign threats using advanced technologies in land, sea, and space. The system includes space-based sensors and interceptors to detect and destroy missiles before launch and during flight. While Trump aims to have it operational before his term ends, the plan lacks funding and is still in the conceptual stage. China has criticized the project as increasing the risk of militarizing space and fueling an arms race, while Lockheed Martin has expressed support for the mission. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer has announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments, reversing a policy that affected over 10 million pensioners. The previous means-tested approach, implemented last year, drew criticism from unions and pensioner charities. The government will change the threshold to allow more pensioners to qualify again, though the specifics remain unclear. The move follows pressure from Labour MPs and councillors who blamed the policy for recent election losses. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch welcomed the reversal but called for early details, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called for a full reversal of the cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retirees should carefully examine their HELOC borrowing options before borrowing their home equity. HELOC interest rates, have largely been on a steady decline since early 2024, making them a relatively inexpensive option for retired homeowners. A HELOC can function as a useful emergency fund, only requiring borrowers to pay interest on the amount borrowed during the draw period. Alternative borrowing sources like credit cards and personal loans are more expensive. (not investment advice)</p>

While overall consumer demand remains sluggish due to high interest rates and slower housing turnover, Lowe's anticipates a slight year-over-year sales increase for the fiscal year.
