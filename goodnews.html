          <p>President Trump has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which he described as the "largest Deal ever." The agreement reportedly involves reciprocal tariffs and a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States. Key provisions include the lowering of U.S. tariffs on Japanese autos from 25% to 15% and Japan opening its markets to more American products like cars and agricultural goods. This development comes after Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faced political pressure following his coalition's loss of a majority in the upper house elections.</p>

          <p>A powerful 1975 photograph taken by Stanley Forman captured the tragic collapse of a fire escape during an apartment fire in Boston, resulting in the death of a 19-year-old woman. The haunting image, which won a Pulitzer Prize, depicted the woman and a two-year-old girl falling five stories. The child survived by landing on the woman's body. The photo's widespread publication prompted immediate action from the city, leading to new regulations requiring fire escape safety certifications every five years, a change that had a ripple effect on safety standards nationwide.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged Michael Gann, a 55-year-old man from Inwood, with building and placing multiple homemade bombs throughout Manhattan. The improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were allegedly found in various locations, including on active subway tracks and residential rooftops. According to the U.S. Attorney, Gann constructed the devices using chemicals purchased online. Law enforcement officials emphasized that a coordinated effort between agencies successfully thwarted the plot before any harm could be inflicted, preventing a potential tragedy in the city.</p>
