          <p>President Trump spoke to West Point graduates, highlighting his administration's efforts to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. These changes, initiated by Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, include disbanding student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers and removing books on diversity from Naval Academy libraries. Critics argue that these actions stifle intellectual engagement and debate, while Trump officials claim they combat "Woke Leftist Ideologues." Trump also plans a military parade in Washington, D.C., to commemorate America's 250th birthday, showcasing the military and honoring service members.</p>

The rise in applications may also be due to changes in qualification periods for settlement and potential provisions for skilled workers.</p>

          <h2>UK Spending Review Anticipated to be Difficult</h2>

          <p>An upcoming Spending Review in the UK is expected to be challenging, with significant budget decisions impacting government departments until 2029. The Chancellor is facing tough choices as billions are allocated to health and defense, leading to potential cuts in other areas. Despite increased overall government spending due to tax rises, day-to-day expenses for public services like police and schools are likely to be squeezed. Ministers are engaging in intense negotiations, with some departments already reaching agreements with the Treasury.</p>

          <p>The measles outbreak in Texas is showing signs of slowing down, though health officials warn of rising cases in other states and urge vigilance. Lubbock, Texas, has not reported new cases in several days, but a 42-day period without new cases is needed to declare the outbreak over. Despite progress in Texas, other states, including New Mexico, Kansas, and Oklahoma, are experiencing outbreaks, highlighting the need for continued vaccination efforts. The US has over 1,000 confirmed measles cases, making 2025 the second-worst year since measles elimination in 2000.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the 2025 graduating class at West Point, marking his first military commencement address of his second term. This visit follows his administration's executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in the military. West Point has since disbanded several cadet clubs formed around race and gender, prompting criticism and resignations. Trump's address comes after Vice President J.D. Vance emphasized a shift in foreign policy against "forever wars."</p>

          <p>Violent crime rates in the US are experiencing a significant decline, reversing the spike seen during the pandemic. Murder rates have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, with early data suggesting 2025 could have the lowest murder rate in US history. Factors contributing to the decrease include the easing of pandemic-related disruptions, government initiatives to address community violence, and stabilization of police forces. Despite the positive trend, public perception often lags behind reality, with many still believing crime is on the rise.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the House pushed President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" through Congress, mirroring procedural tactics they previously criticized Democrats for using. The GOP rushed the 1,100-page bill through the House with limited review time, drawing criticism from both sides. Despite internal misgivings, most Republicans ultimately voted for the bill, highlighting the party's commitment to advancing Trump's agenda. The bill's fast-track passage reflects a pattern of Republicans using past criticisms as justification for even more aggressive legislative maneuvers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, ending 17 years of federal control over the mortgage giants. This move has been supported by Bill Ackman, a Wall Street investor and Trump ally. Critics warn that privatizing the companies could disrupt the mortgage market, while supporters argue it could benefit taxpayers. The decision could have significant implications for homebuyers and investors, depending on how the privatization is structured.</p>
