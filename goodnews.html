        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla is expected to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with initial rides in the Model Y limited to a geofenced area and monitored by a safety monitor and remote drivers. Elon Musk has emphasized safety and plans to scale up the service gradually, with potential expansions to Los Angeles and San Francisco. Wall Street analysts predict that robotaxis could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization, although Tesla lags behind competitors like Waymo in autonomous driving technology. The rollout faces regulatory hurdles and the need to ensure safety and reliability, as Tesla aims to establish itself in the autonomous vehicle market. Optimism among analysts remains, but caution is advised given past delays and ongoing competition.</p>

          <p>A recent study from the University of Chicago Medicine and Columbia University suggests that increasing the intake of fruits and vegetables can lead to more restful sleep. The study found that adults who consumed more fruits, vegetables, and healthy carbohydrates experienced deeper and more uninterrupted sleep patterns. Researchers believe that dietary modifications could offer a natural and cost-effective way to improve sleep quality. While a sleep expert noted that the study's findings are not entirely unexpected, the expert also emphasized the need for more extensive research to establish causality.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles to tour a federal law enforcement operations center and meet with Marines, marking the highest-ranking Trump administration official visit since protests erupted over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. The visit follows President Trump's decision to federalize troops from the California National Guard and deploy Marines to protect federal property. Federal immigration officers have increased enforcement efforts, aiming for 3,000 arrests a day, though the current average is around 1,200. This visit underscores the administration's focus on immigration enforcement and its response to protests in Democratic-run cities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, but President Trump suggested a "deal" could be reached to resolve the conflict. The Department of Homeland Security had previously threatened to revoke Harvard's student visa system certification due to alleged failures in addressing campus antisemitism. Trump also issued an order barring most international students from entering the U.S. to study at Harvard, which was also blocked by the judge.

          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, more than three months after his detention by ICE. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or threat to his community. Khalil, a prominent voice in Columbia's pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested by ICE, sparking demonstrations in New York and Washington D.C. The government has not accused Khalil of a specific crime, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely-used portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act to argue that Khalil's presence in the U.S. could pose "potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences."</p>
