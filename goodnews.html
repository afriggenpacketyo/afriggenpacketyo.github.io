          <p>Nvidia has announced a significant $5 billion investment in Intel, leading to a more than 22% surge in Intel's stock price. This strategic partnership aims to co-develop advanced data center and PC chips, combining Nvidia's expertise in AI with Intel's CPU and x86 ecosystem. The deal, which follows recent investments in Intel by Softbank and the U.S. government, is seen as a major boost for the struggling chipmaker's turnaround efforts. This collaboration is being hailed as a milestone for American high-tech manufacturing, although it does not currently include plans for Nvidia to use Intel's manufacturing facilities.

          <p>Weeks after a major immigration raid at its Georgia battery plant, Hyundai Motor outlined aggressive U.S. growth plans at its CEO investor day in New York. CEO José Muñoz described the U.S. as the company's "engine of growth," reconfirming a $26 billion investment to expand American operations and localize over 80% of its vehicle production by 2030. Despite lowering its annual profit outlook due to tariffs, the company is targeting a 34% increase in global sales by the decade's end. Muñoz also expressed empathy for the workers affected by the raid and stressed the importance of resolving visa issues for specialized technical experts.</p>

          <p>CrowdStrike's stock surged over 12% after the company presented a highly ambitious long-term financial roadmap at its investor day. Executives detailed plans for significant margin expansion and projected annual recurring revenue (ARR) to reach $10 billion by fiscal 2031 and $20 billion by 2036. This optimistic forecast is driven by the company's strategic focus on securing artificial intelligence agents, a rapidly growing sector creating new enterprise vulnerabilities. The presentation, which included the recent acquisition of AI security startup Pangea, reinforced investor confidence in CrowdStrike's position as a leader in the secular growth industry of cybersecurity.

          <h2>New Film 'One Battle After Another' Receives Acclaim for Its Politically Charged Action Narrative</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's new film, "One Battle After Another," is drawing praise for its electrifying and politically urgent story. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a burnout former revolutionary forced out of hiding, the movie is inspired by Thomas Pynchon's novel "Vineland" but updates the setting to the present day. The article highlights the film's willingness to tackle raw contemporary themes of political violence and government overreach, a departure from Anderson's typically historical settings. With powerful performances from DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, and Sean Penn, the nearly three-hour film is described as a taut, visceral, and emotionally investing blockbuster that masterfully blends action with commentary on modern American anxieties.</p>

          <p>The state of New York is collaborating with the national nonprofit Baby2Baby to provide free newborn supply kits to families in need. As part of a $2.2 billion commitment to maternal health and childcare, the state has allocated $9 million to the program, which will distribute 100,000 kits containing items like diapers, hygiene products, and breastfeeding supplies. The partnership aims to alleviate the financial burden on low-income families, for whom diapers are a major expense. Baby2Baby has developed a manufacturing system that produces diapers at a significantly lower cost, enabling wider distribution and support for over a million families nationwide annually.</p>

          <p>Hyundai Motor Group has confirmed it will proceed with a $2.7 billion expansion of its manufacturing plant in Ellabell, Georgia, just weeks after an immigration raid disrupted operations. The investment aims to increase the facility's production capacity to 500,000 vehicles annually and will support the assembly of 10 different electric and hybrid models. This decision reaffirms the company's long-term strategic commitment to the U.S. market, despite the raid causing a two-to-three-month delay in the opening of an adjacent battery plant. The move signals Hyundai's confidence in its U.S. operations and its relationship with state and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>A jury has acquitted a Los Angeles protester, Brayan Ramos-Brito, of misdemeanor assault charges against a U.S. Border Patrol agent, a verdict seen as a setback for federal prosecutors. The defense successfully cast doubt on the credibility of the agents involved, particularly Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino, who was the only agent to testify he witnessed the alleged assault. Video evidence presented in court showed an agent forcefully shoving the defendant but did not capture any assault by the protester. The trial also highlighted factual discrepancies in initial reports and brought up a past misconduct investigation against Bovino, ultimately leading to a swift not-guilty verdict.</p>

Despite past unsuccessful bids, including a $2 billion offer for the Nationals, he continues discussions with team owners.

          <p>Meta's Chief Product Officer, Chris Cox, has asserted that smart glasses represent the future of computing, envisioning a shift towards more natural interfaces using voice, gestures, and sight. The statement came as the company unveiled its new $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display controlled by a neural wristband. Unlike previous models, these glasses allow users to see messages and videos, not just listen to audio. The launch reflects Meta's significant bet on wearable technology, a field with growing competition from rivals like Google, Snap, and Apple, all of whom are developing their own smart eyewear.</p>

          <p>Following the latest Federal Reserve interest rate cut, the monthly cost for a $50,000 home equity loan has become slightly more affordable for homeowners looking to tap into record-high equity levels. Currently, a 10-year loan at an average rate of 8.43% would cost approximately $618 per month, while a 15-year loan at 8.31% would be around $487 per month. These payments are marginally lower than they were at the beginning of 2025, offering modest but tangible savings over the life of the loan. The article notes that while HELOCs may offer lower initial rates, their variable nature makes budgeting less predictable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American sprinter Noah Lyles, known for his outspoken nature, is using mind games to gain a psychological edge over his rivals ahead of the world 200m final. After setting the fastest time of the year in the semi-final, Lyles declared that the performance sent a message that his competitors "can't beat me." The article explores the use of such tactics in elite athletics, where marginal gains are crucial. While some athletes use intimidation, others adopt a quiet confidence to unsettle opponents, highlighting the intense mental battle that occurs in high-stakes events like a world championship final, where performance is often determined by psychological readiness.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing its first significant rainfall in months as moisture from a dissipated tropical storm moves through the region, prompting flood watches in several areas. While the rain is a welcome change after a long dry spell, meteorologists say it will have only a marginal effect on the upcoming wildfire season. Officials note that much more precipitation, typically two to four inches, is needed to substantially reduce fire risk, and this storm is unlikely to deliver such amounts. The rain may temporarily slow the start of the dangerous Santa Ana wind season but will not be enough to lift the region out of its severe drought conditions.</p>

The payments, ranging from $150 to $400, are designed to provide financial relief from higher sales taxes resulting from inflation. Eligibility is based on income thresholds and filing status from the 2023 tax year, and qualified individuals do not need to apply to receive the payment. The program is funded by surplus state revenue generated from increased sales tax collections, a direct consequence of higher consumer prices over the past year. (not investment advice)</p>

Huang emphasized that Nvidia will become a major customer for Intel's CPUs while supplying GPU technology, targeting a combined market worth $50 billion.

The administration had claimed it was acting on requests from the children's families and the Guatemalan government to reunify them. However, Judge Timothy Kelly found no evidence that any parents had sought their children's return, citing a Guatemalan report indicating families were surprised by the effort and believed their children were pursuing legal status in the U.S.</p>
