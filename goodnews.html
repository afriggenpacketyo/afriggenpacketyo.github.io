          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new visa policy aimed at foreign officials responsible for censoring protected expression in the United States. The policy targets officials who issue or threaten arrest warrants against U.S. citizens or residents for social media posts made on American platforms while they are physically present on U.S. soil. It also addresses foreign officials demanding that American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies that extend beyond their authority and into the United States.

This pause is intended to allow embassies and consulates to prepare for the operational implications of the new screening procedures.

          <p>New research from Vanguard indicates that having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing income and assets. The survey found that $2,000 in emergency savings increased financial well-being by 21%, compared to 12% for an income of $500,000 and 18% for assets of $1 million or more. This suggests that being prepared for unexpected expenses is crucial for alleviating financial anxiety. The median cost of an emergency is about $2,000, so having that cash on hand gives people the confidence that they can handle a sudden money stressor. (not investment advice)</p>
