Despite facing intense pressure, Rangers demonstrated resilience, with goalkeeper Jack Butland making several crucial saves.

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the Federal Reserve is reluctant to cut interest rates due to a mixed and uncertain macroeconomic environment. He notes that while some indicators like disappointing earnings from major retailers suggest a weakening consumer, others like strong reports from Visa and Starbucks show resilience. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has highlighted that a strong labor market and healthy GDP growth make a rate cut seem unreasonable at this time. Cramer believes the Fed is waiting for more definitive data before making a move, especially to avoid cutting too early and allowing inflation to resurge. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now estimating a net $2 billion impact from the levies. The automaker reported second-quarter revenue that surpassed expectations, though its net income was affected by special charges, including a major vehicle recall. Ford's new guidance for adjusted earnings is slightly lower than its pre-tariff forecast, reflecting the ongoing costs. CEO Jim Farley noted the company is in constructive conversations with the administration to mitigate the effects of tariffs on its global parts supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft's market capitalization briefly exceeded $4 trillion in after-hours trading following a strong quarterly earnings report. The company's shares jumped after it announced 18% revenue growth, its fastest in over three years, largely driven by its Azure cloud computing business. If the gains hold, Microsoft will become the second company, after Nvidia, to reach this valuation milestone. The surge highlights investor confidence in Microsoft's position in the artificial intelligence boom, further distancing it and Nvidia from other tech giants like Apple in market value.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing ongoing uncertainty in the economic outlook, particularly regarding the impact of tariffs.

The decision was not unanimous, with two Fed governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the economy is in good shape and that policy is not seen as overly restrictive, justifying the cautious approach. (not investment advice)</p>

His stand became a San Fernando Valley institution, attracting both local workers and food lovers on pilgrimages. His passing has prompted an outpouring of memories and admiration from customers and fellow restaurateurs who were inspired by his dedication and entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

          <h2>The Appeal of Stressful Television: Why Viewers Find Anxiety-Inducing Shows Calming</h2>

          <p>Popular television shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" are captivating audiences with their intensely stressful, high-anxiety narratives. These series use hyperrealistic filmmaking techniques, such as real-time sequences and single continuous shots, to immerse viewers in chaotic, high-pressure environments like a restaurant kitchen or an emergency room. Psychologists suggest that watching such scenarios can induce a "vicarious stress" response, which can be satisfying because it carries no real-world risk. This trend may also reflect a cultural desire for realism and a cathartic acknowledgment of the high-stakes pressures of modern work life.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has announced she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the upcoming election, ending months of speculation. In a statement, Harris said that her public service will not be in elected office "for now," leaving the race to succeed the term-limited Governor Gavin Newsom wide open. Her decision reshapes the contest for the state's top job and allows her to explore other roles, potentially including another presidential run in the future. Allies expect her to remain a prominent voice in the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>While the Latin Grammy Awards often recognize major commercial artists, many innovative independent musicians also release deserving work that can be overlooked. This year, several artists have produced progressive and critically acclaimed albums that merit consideration in top categories. Among them are Argentine experimentalist Juana Aguirre, Chilean songwriter Gepe, and Guatemalan-born cellist Mabe Fratti, whose albums fuse folk, electronic, and avant-garde elements. These artists are pushing the boundaries of Latin music and deserve recognition for their creative, forward-facing contributions to the genre.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kamala Harris's decision to not run for California governor is being interpreted as a strategic move that preserves the possibility of a 2028 presidential campaign. Running for and serving as governor of the nation's most populous state would have made a simultaneous presidential bid practically and politically difficult. While she would enter a 2028 race with high name recognition, she would also face a potentially crowded field and questions about her role in the Democrats' 2024 loss. Her announcement ends speculation in the California race but opens a new chapter of questions about her national political future.</p>
