          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation effort to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in five years due to disease. The disease was introduced by non-native animals brought to the region. In a rescue mission, biologists captured and airlifted dozens of sheep from the last disease-free herd to an isolated, safer mountain range. A recent check confirmed the relocated herd is surviving and has produced new lambs, offering hope for the species' recovery.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it is releasing approximately $6.8 billion in federal K-12 education funds that had been previously frozen. The Department of Education stated the Office of Management and Budget completed its review of the funds, which will be dispersed to states starting next week. Education Secretary Linda McMahon addressed the delay at a National Governors Association meeting, attributing it to a thorough review process. The move follows a lawsuit from over 20 Democratic attorneys general who called the freeze unconstitutional. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the necessity of adhering strictly to popular health benchmarks like drinking eight glasses of water, getting 10,000 steps, or sleeping eight hours a night. Experts offer varied perspectives, suggesting that while these targets are useful guides, there is often room for flexibility. For instance, one kidney specialist argues thirst is a reliable indicator for hydration, while a nutritionist stresses the benefits of a consistent target. The consensus suggests that a balanced, less rigid approach to incorporating healthy habits is more beneficial than fixating on achieving perfect numbers daily.</p>

          <p>Famed Tejano singer Bobby Pulido has launched an exploratory committee to potentially run as a Democrat for a congressional seat in South Texas in 2026. Pulido, who studied political science before his music career, aims to challenge incumbent Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz, criticizing her for prioritizing party over constituents. He plans to host "ranch halls" to connect with voters and focus on issues like immigration reform and the local economy.

While public contributions are a small drop in the bucket, amounting to about $67 million since 1996, the new payment option offers a novel way for citizens to directly support the nation's finances.

          <p>The White House has announced it will release $5.5 billion in education funds to states after abruptly freezing them earlier this month.

The administration had initially claimed the freeze was to review "grossly misused" funds for a "radical left-wing agenda."
