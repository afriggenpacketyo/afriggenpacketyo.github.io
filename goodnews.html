          <p>Dominion Voting Systems, a company central to false election fraud claims following the 2020 U.S. presidential election, has been acquired by Liberty Vote. The new parent company, founded by a former Republican elections director, has pledged to ensure the firm is "100% AMERICAN OWNED" and prioritize paper-based transparency to rebuild trust in election technology. The acquisition follows several years of high-profile defamation lawsuits by Dominion, including a nearly $800 million settlement with Fox News over its broadcasting of unsubstantiated allegations. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed to the public.</p>

          <p>South Africa secured a remarkable victory against co-hosts India in the Women's Cricket World Cup, driven by an explosive, unbeaten 84-run performance from all-rounder Nadine de Klerk. Chasing India's total of 251, the Proteas were struggling at 81-5 before de Klerk's aggressive batting, which included five sixes, turned the game around and sealed the win with seven balls remaining. The victory marks a significant turnaround for South Africa, who had suffered a heavy defeat to England earlier in the tournament. The result places South Africa level on points with India, who suffered their first loss of the competition.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education under the Trump administration is proceeding with sending notices of debt cancellation to student loan borrowers, despite the ongoing government shutdown. The emails inform recipients that they are eligible for loan discharge under the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, which cancels remaining debt after 20-25 years of payments. This action follows a temporary pause in IBR forgiveness that had caused concern among borrowers, as it is currently the only forgiveness plan available. The timing is critical, as student loan forgiveness is set to become federally taxable again after 2025 if existing provisions are not extended.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has accepted senior part-time advisory positions at tech giant Microsoft and artificial intelligence startup Anthropic. The independent watchdog Acoba, which oversees the post-government roles of former ministers, has stipulated that Sunak must not lobby the UK government on behalf of these companies for two years. Sunak, who remains a Member of Parliament, will reportedly donate his earnings from these roles to a charity he founded. During his premiership, Sunak prioritized technology regulation and hosted a major AI safety summit, making his transition into these roles a notable development.</p>

          <p>King Charles and his son, Prince William, appeared together at a reception at the Natural History Museum ahead of the upcoming COP30 climate summit in Brazil. In a significant move, Kensington Palace announced that the Prince of Wales will attend the environmental conference on behalf of the King, highlighting a continuation of the family's long-standing advocacy for environmental protection. This joint appearance underscores Prince William's increasing role in "climate diplomacy," which complements his own Earthshot Prize awards, also scheduled to be held in Brazil just before the COP30 summit. The King has been a prominent voice at past climate summits.</p>

          <p>With interest rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans dropping to their lowest points since 2023, homeowners may find it an opportune time to borrow against their property's value. The decline follows the Federal Reserve's recent rate cuts, making these borrowing options more affordable compared to high-APR credit cards or personal loans. However, future rate movements are not guaranteed and will depend on evolving economic conditions, including inflation. Homeowners are advised to weigh the benefits of locking in a rate now against the uncertainty of the market before making a decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has halted the execution of Robert Roberson just one week before it was scheduled, granting him a stay. Roberson was sentenced to death for the 2002 murder of his two-year-old daughter, Nikki, based on a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome. His defense team argues his innocence, presenting expert testimony that the child died from severe pneumonia exacerbated by medication, not abuse. The court has ordered a review of the case under Texas' "junk science" law, which allows convictions to be challenged if the scientific evidence used is no longer considered credible by the scientific community.</p>

          <p>As gold prices reach new highs, silver is also experiencing a significant upward trend, making it an attractive option for investors. The price of silver has nearly doubled since the beginning of the year, rising to over $50 per troy ounce, and it offers many of the same benefits as gold, such as hedging against inflation and portfolio diversification. Given its much lower entry price point, silver provides an accessible alternative for those priced out of the soaring gold market. With ongoing economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and geopolitical instability, conditions may support a continued rise in the value of precious metals. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study on the naked mole rat, the world's longest-lived rodent, has uncovered a genetic secret that may explain its nearly 40-year lifespan and resistance to age-related diseases. Researchers in Shanghai discovered that a specific protein, known as c-GAS, functions differently in these animals compared to humans. While in humans this protein can interfere with DNA repair and potentially promote cancer, in naked mole rats it actively helps mend damaged DNA strands, maintaining genetic integrity. This finding could provide valuable insights into aging and lead to new therapies for improving human health and longevity.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines anticipates that revenue from its premium travel cabins, such as first class, could eclipse sales from standard economy seats for parts of the upcoming year. The airline reported a 9% year-over-year increase in premium cabin ticket revenue in the last quarter, reaching nearly $5.8 billion, while main cabin revenue declined by 4%. CEO Ed Bastian noted that demand for higher-priced, more spacious seating shows no signs of slowing down, a key factor in the carrier's optimistic financial forecast. This trend reflects a broader industry shift as airlines add more elaborate premium seats to cater to travelers willing to pay more. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has announced its annual inflation adjustments for the 2026 tax year, revealing slightly higher income tax brackets and an increased standard deduction. While tax rates will remain the same, the income thresholds for each bracket will rise, allowing taxpayers to earn more before moving into a higher tax bracket. For 2026, the standard deduction for single filers will increase to $16,100, up from $15,750. These routine adjustments are designed to account for inflation and prevent "bracket creep," where taxpayers are pushed into higher brackets solely due to cost-of-living increases in their wages.

          <p>Following a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the mortgage rate environment has become more favorable for prospective homebuyers. Average rates for a 30-year mortgage recently hit a three-year low, and while they have risen slightly since, they remain significantly more affordable than at the start of the year. With more rate cuts anticipated, homebuyers who can secure a rate in the low-6% range are considered to be in a good position. Options like adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) or paying for mortgage points can help buyers secure even lower rates in the current market. (not investment advice)</p>
