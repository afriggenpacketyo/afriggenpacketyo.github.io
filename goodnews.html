        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have come to an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs imposed on each other, aiming to de-escalate the ongoing trade war. According to a joint statement, both countries will suspend tariffs for 90 days to facilitate negotiations, with the U.S. lowering tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% and China reducing import duties on American goods to 10%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the shared interest in avoiding economic decoupling during a news conference in Geneva. This agreement aims to break the impasse that had halted trade between the two nations, providing relief to American businesses that had suspended orders in anticipation of a tariff deal.</p>

          <p>Suffolk County, New York, has strengthened its animal cruelty laws by making it a crime for convicted animal abusers to own pets. The county legislature voted to establish a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail or a $1,000 fine, for those on the county's convicted animal abuser registry found owning pets. This expands on a 2010 law that created the animal abuse registry, with the new addition closing a loophole that previously lacked penalties for violating the pet ownership prohibition. County Executive Ed Romaine emphasized the county's commitment to protecting animals, while Legislator Stephanie Bontempi highlighted that the county will not tolerate animal abuse.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy is entering the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow as a favorite, a course where he has historically performed well, securing wins in 2021 and the previous year. The course, familiar and comfortable for McIlroy, will be set up tougher than usual, with longer rough and softened slopes on the greens to challenge the competitors. McIlroy feels confident due to his past successes at Quail Hollow and the support he receives from the Charlotte community, where he has celebrated many birthdays. Weather forecasts suggest a soft course, which would favor McIlroy's powerful driving, making him a strong contender for the championship.</p>

          <p>A student-led movement in Serbia is challenging the increasingly autocratic government of President Aleksandar Vucic, marked by a display of solidarity when Muslim students relieved protesting colleagues during Easter. Sparked by a train station collapse in Novi Sad that killed 16, the movement has grown into the largest and most extensive protest in Serbia, drawing nearly half a million people to the streets of Belgrade. Despite government attempts to quell the protests with resignations and financial incentives, the movement persists, advocating for early elections and raising international awareness of the struggle. The article emphasizes the protesters' commitment to horizontal decision-making and their determination to change Serbia for the better.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK) has announced its decision to disband and disarm as part of a new peace initiative with Turkey, marking a potential end to a four-decade-long armed conflict. The decision was revealed by the Firat News Agency, a media outlet affiliated with the group, following a party congress in northern Iraq. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, imprisoned since 1999, had previously urged the group to convene a congress and formally decide to disband, aiming to resolve the Kurdish issue through democratic politics. Firat news said the congress assessed that the PKK‚Äôs struggle had brought the Kurdish issue to the point of resolution through democratic politics, thus completing its historical mission.</p>

          <p>Shipping companies will need to adapt to new trade barriers resulting from the trade war, including tariffs and higher port fees, according to the International Chamber of Shipping. The U.S. Trade Representative announced fees targeting Chinese vessels, set to take effect in mid-October, with the goal of re-establishing the U.S. shipbuilding industry and enhancing national security. These fees include charges per net tonne for vessels owned or operated by Chinese companies docking at U.S. ports, as well as fees for Chinese-built vessels entering U.S. ports. Despite these challenges, the Chamber's secretary-general Guy Platten believes the shipping industry is resilient and will adjust to market changes.</p>

While it is not definitively classified as an addictive substance, sugar overconsumption can alter neuronal pathways in the brain, leading to cravings and withdrawal-like symptoms. The article highlights that long-term sugar overconsumption is linked to various health issues, including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. Strategies to quit sugar addiction include behavioral interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy and nutritional strategies such as reducing added sugars gradually and increasing protein and fiber intake.</p>

          <p>Kenbishi, Japan's oldest sake brand, remains committed to traditional brewing methods despite the sake industry facing declining domestic consumption. Brewing always takes place during the winter season, with brewers staying onsite for six months and consuming around 1,500 bottles of sake. Kenbishi uses traditional wooden equipment like the "dakidaru" to maintain temperature, essential for the unique taste of its sake. President Masataka Shirakashi sees UNESCO heritage listing of sake-brewing techniques as an opportunity to revive interest in Japan. Shirakashi believes that abandoning traditional brewing methods would lead to the loss of Japan's cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, detained in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity, is still a candidate in Monday's midterm elections, running for mayor of Davao City. Despite his detention, Duterte is widely expected to win, showcasing his continued popularity. Over 68 million Filipinos have registered to vote for various national and local positions, with the spotlight on the Senate race, which could determine the political future of Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte. She faces an impeachment trial in the Senate in July over accusations of plotting to assassinate President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and corruption involving her office's intelligence funds.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts are planning to bring back elk to the East Midlands, and the UK, for the first time in about 3,000 years. The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured ¬£15,000 of funding from the Rewilding Britain charity to begin feasibility studies into their return. The animals are regarded as "keystone" species which can create and maintain habitats for diverse other species. One of the major challenges was getting the public used to the idea that elk "should be here".</p>

          <p>Co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales Adrian Ramsay has launched a fresh party leadership bid with fellow Green MP Ellie Chowns. They are hoping to be elected together as co-leaders and join the contest alongside the party's deputy leader, Zack Polanski, after he launched his campaign on 5 May. Ramsay was elected as co-leader with Carla Denyer in 2021, but Denyer announced on Thursday that she would not be standing when the posts are re-elected later this year. Nominations for the leadership open on 2 June, with party members voting throughout August before the results are announced on 2 September.</p>
