          <p>China's state media has hinted at the imminent commissioning of its most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, through social media images showing 36 newly painted spaces on the flight deck for warplanes, surpassing the capacity of the country's existing carriers. Military commentator Song Zhongping suggests the new markings indicate the Fujian is preparing for commissioning and will undergo trial service to test adaptability and coordination with aircraft and weapon systems. Additional sea trials may occur before the formal commissioning by the end of the year, focusing on take-off and landing tests, and carrier group coordination exercises, ensuring the Fujian's readiness for naval operations. This represents a significant advancement in China's naval capabilities and strategic presence in the region. Optimism regarding China's military modernization is cautiously measured given geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Ventura County, California, battled two brush fires on Monday night. The Howe fire, the larger of the two, had burned approximately 40 acres in steep terrain south of Piru, with helicopters making water drops on the flames. Air tankers and additional helicopters were called in, with 140 firefighters on the scene or en route, as mild winds were expected to carry smoke eastward. Simultaneously, about 16 miles southwest, firefighters contained the Maria fire, which had burned about 15 acres south of Santa Paula, involving 140 firefighters, three helicopters, and one dozer, with crews continuing clean-up operations into the evening.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korea's SK Hynix experienced significant gains, reaching over two-decade highs, following reports that SK Group plans to construct the country's largest AI data center in partnership with Amazon Web Services. SK Hynix, a leading supplier of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), has seen its shares surge nearly 50% this year due to the AI boom, with SK Telecom and SK Broadband reportedly leading the data center initiative. While competitor Samsung also saw gains, its growth has lagged behind SK Hynix, which has become a leader in high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in artificial intelligence servers, supplying to clients like Nvidia. The market's positive reaction reflects confidence in SK Hynix's position in the rapidly expanding AI sector.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his long-awaited pitching debut for the Los Angeles Dodgers, marking his return to the mound after recovering from Tommy John surgery. Ohtani pitched one inning against the San Diego Padres, allowing one run on two hits, while also serving as the team's leadoff hitter. The Dodgers had initially planned to delay Ohtani's pitching return, but his impressive progress during batting practice and concerns about the taxing nature of simulated sessions led to an expedited timeline. The team plans to gradually increase his workload, with Ohtani likely serving as an opener once per week, building up to more innings as the season progresses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Parliament is set to debate a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs, Tonia Antoniazzi and Stella Creasy, proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent the investigation, arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment of women who terminate their own pregnancies, arguing that such investigations are dehumanizing and prolonged. Her proposal maintains punishments for medical professionals and violent partners who end a pregnancy outside existing law, receiving backing from 176 MPs and main abortion providers. The current law in England and Wales allows abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy and beyond in certain circumstances, requiring approval from two doctors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan, traditionally known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focusing on arms exports to deepen ties with allies and strengthen its defense industrial base. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba have signaled a shift in arms policy, aiming to enhance interoperability with partners by standardizing maintenance processes and creating joint training opportunities. This move is driven by security concerns and the need to develop a viable domestic defense industry, which has suffered due to reliance on U.S. weapon purchases. While Japan's current arms exports are minimal compared to countries like South Korea and China, building domestic capacity is seen as crucial for ensuring its security and reducing dependence on the U.S.</p>

The match showcased the contrasting elements of legacy football, represented by Boca's passionate culture, and the commodified nature of the FIFA Club World Cup. While Boca brought authentic energy to the game, the event highlighted questions about FIFA's intentions and the creation of client clubs to staff the show.</p>

          <p>Detroit Police Sergeant Shannon Jones, inspired by photographs of missing persons, initiated Operation UNITED, a project focused on exhuming unidentified crime victims from paupers' graves to obtain DNA and solve cold cases. Partnering with FBI Special Agent Leslie Larsen, Jones located approximately 200 cold cases dating back to 1959 and began the process of exhuming bodies and running DNA samples through online databases. Operation UNITED has resulted in 33 positive identifications, providing answers to anguished families, including Kristina Morris, whose father's remains were identified after disappearing in 1995. The success of the project has led to inquiries from other cities interested in implementing similar initiatives.</p>
