        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has launched a preview of Kiro, an artificial intelligence tool designed to assist developers in writing software code. The move places Amazon in direct competition with similar AI-powered coding assistants from Google and Microsoft. Kiro aims to streamline the development process by helping define requirements and system design before generating code, using AI models from Anthropic. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the new program has the potential to fundamentally change how software is built, with free and premium versions planned after the preview period.</p>

          <p>Shares for space infrastructure company Rocket Lab increased by 8% on Monday, continuing a strong rally that has seen the stock nearly double in two months. This recent growth is attributed to a series of successful rocket launches and a new partnership with the European Space Agency to launch navigation satellites. The company has been ramping up production to meet rising demand in the competitive space industry, now producing an Electron rocket every 15 days. Since its public debut in 2021, Rocket Lab's market value has grown to over $19 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the new academic year approaches, students face the critical decision between federal and private student loans to cover college costs. Federal loans are generally recommended as the first option due to their fixed interest rates, borrower protections, and potential for forgiveness programs. However, their strict borrowing limits often create a funding gap. Private loans can cover the remaining costs and may offer lower rates for those with good credit, but they lack the flexibility and safety nets of federal options. This article advises students to exhaust grants and scholarships first before cautiously considering private loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starbucks has announced that its corporate employees must return to the office four days a week starting in October, an increase from the current three-day mandate. In a letter to staff, CEO Brian Niccol stated the policy is necessary for the company's turnaround strategy, which focuses on improving service and simplifying operations. For employees who do not wish to comply with the new rule, Starbucks is offering a "one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment." This move is the latest step in Niccol's efforts to streamline the company and reverse slumping U.S. sales.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new blue color additive for use in food and beverages, derived from the fruit of the gardenia plant. The additive, made from the compound genipin, is approved for products like sports drinks, candy, and flavored teas. This marks the fourth naturally sourced color approved by the FDA in the last two months, aligning with a broader push to replace petroleum-based dyes in the U.S. food supply.

          <h2>Morgan Stanley Downgrades CrowdStrike Stock, Citing High Valuation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Morgan Stanley has downgraded its rating for cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike from overweight to equal weight, suggesting it is "time to take a breather" after the stock's 50% rise since April. Analysts argue that the company's high valuation already reflects lofty expectations for its future performance, leaving little room for near-term growth. Despite the downgrade, CNBC's Jim Cramer disagreed, viewing the subsequent dip as a buying opportunity. The analysis comes as investors weigh the company's strong long-term potential against concerns about its premium stock price and federal cybersecurity budget cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) being in effect for 35 years, prospective parents with disabilities continue to face significant discrimination from adoption agencies. This article highlights the story of a couple with spina bifida who were initially rejected by an agency that explicitly refused to work with parents with their condition. They eventually adopted a girl who also has spina bifida, believing their shared experience makes them uniquely qualified to care for her. The story underscores how, in practice, equal access to services like adoption is not always guaranteed for people with disabilities.</p>

          <p>Ultium Cells, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, is upgrading its Tennessee facility to produce lower-cost lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells for electric vehicles. These LFP batteries are significantly cheaper to manufacture because they do not require expensive minerals like cobalt and nickel. GM stated this move will help diversify its EV portfolio, which spans a wide range of price points. Commercial production of the new, more affordable battery cells is expected to begin by late 2027, potentially making EVs more accessible.</p>
