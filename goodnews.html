          <p>Cambodia has launched its first direct air corridor for fresh fruit to China, with a two-tonne shipment of durians arriving in Henan province. This marks a significant step in "durian diplomacy" and strengthens agricultural trade between the two nations, utilizing cold chain logistics to ensure freshness. Durian is now the fifth Cambodian fruit approved for direct export to the vast Chinese market, following bananas, mangoes, longans, and coconuts. While the development highlights growing economic ties and customs efficiency, some industry insiders express caution about the market competitiveness of Cambodian durians compared to established sources.</p>

          <p>In a significant act of cooperation with the Trump administration, Mexico has extradited 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States to face justice. The group includes prominent leaders from cartels such as "Los Cuinis," an affiliate of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), and individuals wanted for serious crimes, including the murder of a U.S. sheriff's deputy. This move is part of a broader effort by the U.S. Justice Department to dismantle dangerous drug trafficking networks. The transfer follows a similar extradition in February and comes amid ongoing pressure from the U.S. for Mexico to intensify its efforts against organized crime.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate hundreds of National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants for UCLA that were abruptly suspended. The ruling states that the administration's action violated a previous injunction that blocked the termination of such grants. The funds, part of a larger freeze of over $584 million, were suspended based on allegations of discrimination and antisemitism at the university. This legal decision marks a significant development in the conflict between the University of California and the administration over academic funding and institutional autonomy.</p>

The rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral, carrying two military satellites into a high geosynchronous orbit. This launch is a major milestone for ULA, as the Vulcan is set to replace the company's legacy Atlas and Delta rockets, ending its reliance on Russian-made engines. The primary payload included an experimental navigation satellite, NTS-3, designed to test advanced technologies for more accurate and jam-proof GPS capabilities for military and commercial use.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has introduced a one-year plan to subsidize interest costs on personal consumer loans in an effort to boost household spending and support domestic demand. Under the plan, the government will cover one percentage point of the annual interest on qualifying loans for purchases like cars and education. The policy, effective from September, aims to lower the cost of credit for families and unlock their spending potential. Officials stated the goal is to channel more funds into the consumption sector, reinforcing its role as the primary driver of China's national economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has made a surprise, unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. The offer comes after a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling suggested Google should divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the internet search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, stated that several investors have agreed to back the deal. This ambitious move highlights the intense competition in the AI sector and represents a bold attempt by a smaller player to reshape the tech landscape by acquiring a dominant platform.

          <h2>Cancer Survival Rates Improve, But Deadly Cancers Lag Behind</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 20:53:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over the past 50 years, cancer survival rates have significantly improved, with half of all patients now expected to live for at least ten years, double the rate from the 1970s. However, a new study reveals that this progress has been uneven, with survival rates for some of the deadliest cancers showing little improvement. Cancers affecting the pancreas, oesophagus, stomach, and lungs continue to have very low survival rates, widening the gap between the most and least survivable forms of the disease. Researchers attribute the disparity to difficulties in early detection and a lack of effective treatment options for these specific cancers.</p>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will add questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to the driving theory test starting in early 2026. The initiative aims to equip the 2.4 million learner drivers who take the test annually with basic life-saving skills, as drivers are often the first to arrive at the scene of an emergency. Learning materials are being updated to include information on how to perform CPR and use a public access defibrillator. The change is hoped to prevent avoidable deaths by increasing the number of people capable of providing immediate assistance in a cardiac arrest situation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has lifted the "boil water" notice for approximately 9,200 households in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch. The advisory was in place for a week after a faulty, nearly-closed underground valve disrupted water service, causing taps to run dry or slow to a trickle. With water flow restored, the DWP has declared the water safe to drink but advises residents to flush all pipes and appliances to clear out any stagnant water or sediment. Affected customers will receive a $20 credit on their bills for the inconvenience.</p>
