          <h2>Starbucks Reports Continued Sales Decline Amidst Turnaround Efforts</h2>

          <p>Starbucks has reported its sixth consecutive quarter of declining same-store sales, with a global drop of 2% that was steeper than anticipated. Despite these figures, CEO Brian Niccol expressed confidence, stating the company's turnaround plan is progressing ahead of schedule, drawing on his experience from reviving Chipotle. The article notes that while overall sales fell, North American performance was better than feared, and the company's China market saw its first same-store sales growth in a year and a half. Future plans include a $500 million investment in labor and service improvements, along with new product launches. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gap's Athleta brand has appointed Maggie Gauger, the former head of Nike's women's business in North America, as its new chief executive officer. This move is seen as a significant win for Athleta, which has struggled with declining sales and leadership turnover, and a considerable blow to Nike. The article explains that Gauger's departure comes at a critical time for Nike, as it intensifies its focus on attracting more female customers to compete with rivals like Athleta. Gauger, a 20-year Nike veteran, is tasked with reinvigorating the Athleta brand, which has failed to translate new partnerships into sustained growth among its core customer base.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Authority has settled a lawsuit that allows it to proceed with a $730-million contract to modernize its subway cars ahead of the 2028 Olympics. The lawsuit, filed by the group Jobs to Move America, alleged that Metro violated public contract laws by not enforcing worker pay and hiring standards for disadvantaged workers. As part of the settlement, Metro will pay $250,000 in legal fees and modify its contract with manufacturer Hyundai Rotem to include the required labor commitments. This resolution ensures that the delivery of new rail cars for the D Line extension remains on schedule for the games.</p>
