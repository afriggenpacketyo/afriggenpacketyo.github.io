          <h2>UK Government to Introduce New Electric Vehicle Grants to Boost Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 02:11:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars costing up to £37,000. Funded by a £650 million scheme, the initiative aims to help meet the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. However, industry experts and some drivers highlight that the primary barrier to EV adoption is the lack of sufficient public charging infrastructure, with only 82,000 points currently available for 1.3 million EVs. Critics argue the policy forces consumers into more expensive vehicles before the country is adequately prepared.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues US Can Lead AI Revolution by Leveraging Natural Gas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 02:00:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article posits that for the United States to lead the global AI revolution, it must power the massive energy demands of data centers with its abundant natural gas reserves. The author argues that relying solely on renewable energy is impractical at the required scale and that other nations like China and Malaysia are aggressively building subsidized data center infrastructure. The proposed solution involves co-locating new, independent natural gas power plants with data centers to avoid straining the public grid and raising consumer electricity costs. This strategy, supported by figures like President Trump, is presented as crucial for American economic strength and national security.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 01:44:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will update the relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) curriculum to include lessons on misogyny, consent, and the dangers of AI-generated deepfakes. The curriculum aims to help pupils identify positive male role models and understand unhealthy attitudes promoted by some online influencers. While previous proposals for strict age limits on topics have been dropped, the guidance outlines what should be covered in primary versus secondary school. The changes, which will be fully implemented by September 2026, also emphasize proactive engagement with parents, who will have the right to view all curriculum materials.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler's recent incredible success, including seven PGA Tour wins and a second Masters title, is being credited to a dramatic turnaround in his putting. A year ago, despite being the best player from tee to green, his putting statistics ranked outside the top 150. After enlisting renowned putting coach Phil Kenyon, Scheffler made key adjustments, including changing to a mallet-style putter to improve his alignment. This single change sparked a remarkable transformation, turning one of his biggest weaknesses into a strength and solidifying his position as the world's most dominant player.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations and keeping the country on track to meet its annual 5% growth target. However, underlying data reveals weaknesses, with retail sales growth slowing and the real estate slump deepening, fueling calls for more government stimulus. Despite resilient industrial output, a key price indicator showed the sharpest decline since the global financial crisis, intensifying deflationary pressures. Officials acknowledged the need to boost domestic income and support spending, while some economists argue for significant fiscal stimulus and interest rate cuts to ensure sustainable growth.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans. The protections, which shield them from deportation and allow them to work legally, were set to expire as part of a broader administration effort to curtail the program. An immigrant advocacy group sued to block the termination, arguing Afghanistan remains unsafe for return. The court's one-week stay allows both sides to file briefs, providing a brief reprieve for the affected Afghans, many of whom assisted the U.S. during its two-decade presence in the country.</p>

          <p>Former England scrum-half Matt Dawson has reflected on a controversial incident during the 2001 British and Irish Lions tour where he nearly faced expulsion. Dawson had written a critical tour diary for a newspaper, lambasting head coach Graham Henry, which caused a major stir. He now regrets his "petulant" actions, which were driven by frustration over not being selected for a key match. The article also revisits the 2013 tour, where coach Warren Gatland controversially dropped Irish legend Brian O'Driscoll for the deciding Test, a bold move that ultimately paid off with a series-clinching victory for the Lions.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with nearly 94% of new cars sold so far in 2025 being electric. In cities like Oslo, EVs now constitute up to 40% of all passenger cars on the road, resulting in cleaner air and quieter streets. This remarkable shift was driven by consistent government policies over many years, including significant tax exemptions for EVs and progressively higher taxes on polluting gasoline and diesel cars. The country has also heavily invested in a robust public charging network, demonstrating a successful model for encouraging widespread EV adoption.</p>

          <p>A district in Stockholm, Sweden, is being redeveloped into what is being called the "world's largest wooden construction project," a new city built mainly from cross-laminated timber. The developer is investing approximately $1.25 billion to construct 2.7 million square feet of homes, offices, and shops, aiming to create a showcase for sustainable urban development. By using mass timber instead of traditional concrete and steel, the project significantly reduces its carbon footprint, as the construction sector is a major global contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The first residential buildings are expected to be completed by the end of 2025.</p>

Sales of the H20 chip, which was specifically designed to comply with earlier U.S. export controls, were effectively halted in April when a new license requirement was imposed. The policy reversal is seen as a significant win for Nvidia and follows intensified lobbying by CEO Jensen Huang, who argued the restrictions were undermining American tech leadership.

This test was vital for the company to validate the rocket's structural integrity, especially the tail section, which must endure immense forces during launch and landing.

The first center, named Prometheus, is set to be operational in Ohio in 2026, with another, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. Zuckerberg stated that one of these data center clusters could cover an area nearly the size of Manhattan, reflecting the immense scale of investment required to build what he calls "superintelligence." The move underscores Meta's ambition to be a leader in AI, though it also raises concerns about the enormous energy and water consumption of such facilities.</p>

          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University suggests that animals can perceive and react to sounds made by plants, potentially revealing a previously unknown ecosystem of communication. In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were making sounds associated with distress, such as dehydration. These sounds, which are outside the range of human hearing, are produced by physical effects within the plant. The discovery opens up a vast, unexplored field of study into how animals and possibly other plants use this auditory information to make decisions.</p>
