          <p>A sophisticated phishing scam is using counterfeit Evite invitations with emotionally charged subject lines, such as "Special Celebration of Life," to trick victims into clicking malicious links. These emails are designed to perfectly mimic official Evite branding, making them appear legitimate and personal, thereby lowering the recipient's guard. Clicking the link can lead to the installation of malware, theft of personal information, and compromised login credentials. To protect against this threat, experts advise using strong antivirus software, carefully verifying the sender's email address, and hovering over links to check the destination URL before clicking.</p>

          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has dropped all charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, two British men who were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act. Prosecutors informed the court that they would offer no evidence, stating they could not continue with the case as it did not meet the required threshold for trial. Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, described the two years since his arrest as a "nightmare" and expressed relief that justice was served. The Chinese government had previously dismissed the allegations as "malicious slander" and a "self-staged political farce."</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ordered Meta to revise its privacy policies, ruling that the company violated the freedom of expression of adult content actress Esperanza Gomez by closing her Instagram account. Gomez argued the closure affected her ability to work, while Meta claimed she violated its rules on nudity. The court found Meta acted in an "arbitrary" fashion, applying its policies inconsistently and without clear justification, as similar accounts remained active. The ruling mandates that Meta adjust its terms so users are clearly aware of how to challenge content moderation decisions, setting a significant precedent in the region.</p>

          <p>A yellow weather warning for strong winds is in effect across southern parts of the UK, with gusts reaching up to 78mph on the Isle of Wight. The windy conditions are causing travel disruptions, including the closure of the M48 Severn Bridge, and have brought heavy rain to northern and western areas. Despite some reports, the Met Office has clarified that this weather system is not strong enough to be classified as a named storm, such as 'Storm Amy'. The forecast for the week remains unsettled, with more heavy rain and strong winds expected, particularly in the north of the UK by midweek.</p>

          <h2>Democratic Party Launches National Voter Registration Drive to Counter Republican Gains</h2>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee is initiating a weeklong voter registration drive, focusing on battleground House districts across the country. This effort is a direct response to recent data showing a significant shift in party registration, with Democrats losing 2.1 million registered voters from 2020 to 2024 while Republicans gained 2.4 million. The DNC plans to host 50 events in 27 states and territories, targeting locations like college campuses, stadiums, and farmers' markets. This direct involvement marks a strategic shift for the party, which has historically relied on outside groups for such registration efforts.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Steve Cohen have reintroduced legislation to ban employers from using credit checks to vet job applicants. The bill aims to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to prevent companies from requiring or requesting credit histories, a practice the lawmakers argue is discriminatory and makes no sense. Proponents of the bill highlight that denying employment based on financial history disproportionately affects people of color and women, and that poor credit is often linked to medical debt or unemployment rather than job performance. The proposed legislation seeks to create a fairer application process for all workers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new ordinance requiring landlords to ensure all habitable rooms in rental units can be maintained at 82 degrees or below. The deadline for compliance is 2027 or 2032, depending on the number of units a landlord owns, a response to the growing danger of extreme heat waves. The article suggests that strategies like improved insulation and zoned cooling, where only specific rooms are cooled, can help meet this requirement while reducing stress on the power grid. In the interim, the ordinance also grants renters the right to install their own cooling solutions without fear of eviction.</p>

          <p>Movie theaters are experiencing a surge in attendance for anniversary screenings of classic films like "Jaws" and "Star Wars: Episode III," which are often outperforming new releases on their opening weekends. This trend is seen as a way for studios to bolster thin release schedules and for theaters to attract audiences, especially during weekdays. Observers suggest this reflects a nostalgia for a time when the movie business was central to popular culture, before the dominance of streaming and social media. Distributors like Fathom Entertainment, which specialize in re-releases, have seen record-breaking revenue from this renewed interest in the communal cinematic experience.</p>
