        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uruguay's senate has passed a law to decriminalize euthanasia, making it the first country in South America to do so through legislative action rather than a court ruling. The new law permits euthanasia performed by a healthcare professional for mentally competent individuals with incurable illnesses causing "unbearable suffering," without requiring a terminal diagnosis. This move reinforces Uruguay's reputation as a socially liberal nation, following earlier legalizations of recreational marijuana, same-sex marriage, and abortion. The legislation does not permit assisted dying, where a patient self-administers medication, or allow the procedure for minors.</p>

          <p>Paxos, the blockchain company that partners with PayPal, mistakenly created $300 trillion worth of the PayPal PYUSD stablecoin due to a technical error during an internal transfer. The firm quickly identified the mistake and "burned," or destroyed, the excess tokens within approximately 20 minutes, confirming that no customer funds were affected and there was no security breach. The incident highlights that the stability of such digital currencies relies on the issuer's backing and operational integrity, not an intrinsic link to physical currency. The erroneously minted amount was more than double the world's estimated total GDP, underscoring the scale of the glitch.</p>

          <p>Ali Riley, the captain of New Zealand's national soccer team and Los Angeles' Angel City FC, is retiring at the end of the season after a celebrated career spanning five World Cups and four Olympic Games. The 37-year-old defender made the decision after a difficult year rehabilitating a chronic nerve injury while also undergoing IVF treatment and dealing with the loss of her childhood home to a fire. Riley, who also played for top clubs like Chelsea and Bayern Munich, cites the physical and emotional toll of her injury as the primary reason for her retirement. She plans to remain involved in women's sports through media and potential club ownership.</p>

          <p>California is holding its annual ShakeOut earthquake drill, urging residents to practice the "drop, cover, and hold on" technique to prepare for a major seismic event. Experts emphasize that this action is safer than running outside, as falling debris near buildings causes a significant number of injuries during earthquakes. Officials also recommend securing homes by strapping down furniture and water heaters, retrofitting older houses, and using the MyShake app for early warnings. With 70% of Californians living near an active fault, the drill aims to build muscle memory for a disaster that officials say is inevitable.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill designed to accelerate the study of psychedelic drugs for treating PTSD, depression, and other mental health conditions, particularly among military veterans. The legislation, sponsored by the nonprofit VETS, streamlines the state's approval process for studies involving Schedule 1 drugs like ibogaine and psilocybin that have already received FDA approval. This change aims to remove bureaucratic delays from the state's Research Advisory Panel, which previously stalled some studies for months. Proponents believe this will advance critical research into therapies that have shown significant promise in treating trauma-related conditions.</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu has survived two parliamentary no-confidence votes, securing his government's immediate future. The key to survival was his promise to suspend President Emmanuel Macron's highly contentious pension reform until after the 2027 presidential election, a move that successfully garnered the support of Socialist lawmakers. The first motion, brought by the hard-left, failed by just 18 votes, highlighting the fragile position of Macron's centrist alliance in the National Assembly. A second motion from the far-right also failed, but the close results underscore the ongoing political challenges facing the administration.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, with net income surging 39.1% from the previous year to NT$452.3 billion. The world's largest chipmaker beat market estimates, driven by sustained high demand for advanced processors used in artificial intelligence applications for clients like Nvidia and Apple. Citing the strength of the AI megatrend, TSMC raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range and increased its planned capital expenditure for the year. The strong performance reflects high utilization of its most advanced 3nm and 5nm chip manufacturing technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. states are currently competing for a share of a new $50 billion federal fund designed to reshape healthcare in rural communities. The Rural Health Transformation Program was created to offset the impact of Medicaid spending cuts, but federal officials are emphasizing that the money is for innovation, not just to cover hospital operating budgets. The application process has created tension between traditional hospitals, who fear being overlooked, and new technology-focused companies proposing modern solutions like AI-driven remote care. The funds will be awarded based on states' rurality and their alignment with the administration's health policy objectives. (not investment advice)</p>

The message was delivered during meetings with his French and Spanish counterparts amidst a backdrop of geopolitical mistrust, a significant trade imbalance favoring China, and ongoing trade frictions. Wang emphasized that partnership should be the proper positioning for China-EU relations.

          <p>Researchers are studying how to control programmed cell death by manipulating 'death fold' proteins, which could lead to new treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer. These proteins can trigger a cell's self-destruction, a vital process for health that goes awry in certain conditions; in Alzheimer's, brain cells die too early, while in cancer, harmful cells fail to die. Scientists at the Stowers Institute have discovered that these proteins act like reusable hand warmers, releasing energy to start a fatal chain reaction. By finding ways to inhibit this process, they hope to prevent unnecessary neuron death in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

          <p>The concept of making public bus services free is gaining traction in cities like New York, but the idea has divided transit advocates. Proponents argue that eliminating fares would increase ridership, improve equity, and speed up service by allowing all-door boarding. However, skeptics contend that the money would be better spent on improving service frequency and reliability, which research suggests are more critical factors for attracting riders. The mixed results from cities like Kansas City, which is reinstating fares after struggling to find a sustainable funding source, highlight the financial and logistical challenges of implementing a fare-free system.</p>

          <p>As U.S. health insurance premiums continue to rise, a small but growing number of employers are opting to cover the full premium costs for their workers and their families. Companies like Boston Consulting Group and startups like Zocdoc and Bartesian offer zero-premium health plans as a key benefit to attract and retain talent. While total family plan premiums now average over $25,500 annually, these employers absorb the upfront costs, believing it fosters a healthier, more productive workforce. This approach provides a significant financial reprieve for employees, though it remains a rare benefit in the American healthcare landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

The company noted that consumption in mainland China grew by single digits in the third quarter, and while a full rebound is still pending due to economic headwinds, the situation is nearing stabilization. Analysts suggest that an improving stock market and pent-up demand could be contributing to a modest recovery in consumer sentiment. However, challenges such as the property slump and high youth unemployment continue to temper expectations for a rapid turnaround. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from laying off thousands of federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling sided with two unions who argued the administration was unlawfully using the funding lapse to downsize the government for political reasons. The judge cited public statements by President Trump and his budget chief as evidence of these motivations. The administration had already begun issuing layoff notices to about 4,000 employees and had indicated plans to cut over 10,000 jobs in total while the shutdown continues.</p>
