          <p>Gold has risen to become the world's second-largest reserve asset, driven by central banks' increasing appetite for the precious metal as a hedge against inflation and a means of diversifying their holdings. According to a European Central Bank report, central banks' gold stockpiles are near levels last seen in the 1960s, making gold second only to the U.S. dollar in value terms. While China, India, and Turkey have been leading drivers of the gold rally, analysts suggest that central bank purchases may slow in the coming months. Despite a recent period of choppiness in the market, some experts advise investors to maintain exposure to gold due to expected turbulence in stocks. (not investment advice)</p>
