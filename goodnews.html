          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner in China, suggests that the country should lower its annual GDP growth target to around 4% for the next five years. This recommendation factors in potential protracted rivalry with the United States and the need to address structural issues such as property, debt, and weak market confidence. Xu argues that focusing on expanding employment and controlling the debt ratio would be more beneficial than pursuing a higher growth target. The article highlights China's increasing reliance on economic planning and the challenges it faces in maintaining economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that there has been "real progress" in talks with Iran regarding its nuclear program and suggested an announcement could be made in the next two days. Trump's statement was more optimistic than that of the Omani mediator, who noted "some but not conclusive" progress in the negotiations. The talks, which took place at the Omani Embassy in Rome, focus on curbing Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting some economic sanctions imposed by the United States.
