          <p>Adrian Ramsay, current co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, and Ellie Chowns have announced their joint bid for party leadership. They aim to succeed Carla Denyer, who is stepping down, and join the race alongside deputy leader Zack Polanski. Chowns emphasized the need for leaders at the heart of national politics, while Ramsay highlighted the party's potential to hold the balance of power. The Green Party achieved its best-ever result in the 2024 general election, winning seats in four constituencies and increasing its number of councillors for the eighth consecutive year.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the ongoing protests in Serbia against the increasingly autocratic rule of President Aleksandar Vucic, highlighting the solidarity and determination of the student-led movement. Triggered by a train station collapse that killed 16 people, the protests have grown into the largest and most extensive movement in Serbia in recent years. The government's attempts to quell the unrest through resignations and financial incentives have failed, as evidenced by a massive demonstration in Belgrade. The article emphasizes the protesters' commitment to horizontal decision-making and their efforts to raise international awareness of their struggle.</p>
