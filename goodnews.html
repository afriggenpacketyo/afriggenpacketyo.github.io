          <p>Emma Raducanu achieved a significant milestone by securing her first US Open victory since her unexpected 2021 title, defeating qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-1, 6-2. This impressive win marks a return to the second round after previous first-round exits and a withdrawal, demonstrating her growth and newfound self-assurance under new coach Francisco Roig. The British No. 1 has shown consistent performance against lower-ranked opponents, steadily rising in the rankings. This confidence-building win sets her up for a potentially tougher challenge in the next round, as she continues her journey in a tournament that has historically evoked conflicting emotions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans a significant overhaul of sentencing rules, introducing legislation that would empower courts to impose pub and travel bans on individuals convicted of crimes, as part of community sentences. These new penalties could apply to a wider range of offenses, extending beyond specific crime-related restrictions. The reforms also aim to reduce prison overcrowding by limiting short sentences and implementing a scheme for early release of well-behaved inmates, though serious offenders like those jailed for terror offenses would be excluded. While proponents believe these measures will deter crime, critics raise concerns about funding for enforcement and potential strain on probation services.</p>

          <p>The annual Notting Hill Carnival commenced with a spectacular children's parade, filling the streets of west London with vibrant costumes, music, and dance. The festivities began early with J'ouvert, where revelers were awash in bright paint and powder, marking the start of Europe's largest street party. Attendees enjoyed fast-paced drumming, elaborate floats, and diverse food stalls, celebrating Caribbean culture and community. EastEnders star Rudolph Walker and TV chef Big Zuu were among those praising the event's multicultural spirit. The carnival also included a poignant 72-second silence to commemorate the 72 lives lost in the Grenfell Tower fire, as well as those who have died at Carnival and Kelso Cochrane.</p>

The mission, which lifted off from Cape Canaveral, also included an add-on thruster kit designed to help maintain the ISS's altitude, supplementing Russian re-boost operations. This cargo includes over 2,400 pounds of crew supplies, nearly 1,000 pounds of science gear, and 50 research projects. Notably, NASA will mark 25 years of continuous human presence aboard the lab in November, underscoring the ongoing scientific collaboration and the critical role of these resupply missions.</p>

          <p>Levi Kelly, a tiny homes expert, successfully built a remarkably small, livable house measuring just 19.4 by 4 feet in his Ohio front yard for approximately $5,000. Inspired by minimalist living, Kelly transformed an old utility trailer into a "closet-sized" home featuring a compact AC/heating unit, a tilting bed, and solar-powered essentials like a mini-fridge and outdoor shower. He tested its resilience by staying in it during a snowstorm and camping with his son, proving that functional spaces can be created with minimal square footage through creative design. Kelly advises aspiring builders to prioritize their needs, suggesting slightly larger dimensions for increased comfort.</p>

          <p>R&B singer Ginuwine's performance at SeaWorld San Diego, part of a viral concert series featuring late 90s/early 2000s hip-hop and R&B stars, has garnered widespread attention and confusion. Despite the unusual venue, Ginuwine delivered a "masterclass in ageing gracefully," captivating a 3,400-person audience with his suave performance. While animal rights groups criticized SeaWorld's attempt to rebrand its image following the "BlackFish" documentary, the park asserts its shows focus on education and conservation. The article highlights the artist's dignity in an unexpected setting, offering a refreshing contrast to youth-obsessed culture and showcasing the enduring value of his artistry.</p>

          <p>SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk in 2002, has grown into a $400 billion powerhouse, becoming critical for U.S. space access and reshaping the industry. Initially struggling, the company was saved by NASA's commercial cargo contracts, which allowed it to develop the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule. Today, SpaceX dominates launch services, conducting 83% of all spacecraft launches in 2024. Its Starlink satellites provide essential internet, and its Starship rocket is key to lunar plans. This dominance has driven down costs, fostering a global community of companies with unprecedented access to space, fundamentally changing the ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Despite China's "charm offensive" on trade and significant economic ties with countries like the EU, US allies are largely resisting Beijing's efforts to secure political alignment. The article argues that centuries of shared identity, deep security integration, and cultural allegiance bind these nations "irreversibly" to Washington's strategic architecture. While economic pragmatism exists, foundational security remains an "immovable priority" for these countries. This recalcitrance fuels diplomatic appeals for restraint from allies, rather than support for China-led confrontation, highlighting an unbridgeable gap between Beijing's global ambitions and the geopolitical realities of these established relationships.</p>

EOG Resources, an oil and gas exploration company, is expanding its Utica shale position and provides a 3.4% yield, backed by a strong balance sheet. Home Depot, despite missing Q2 earnings, shows improving core business trends and offers a 2.2% yield, demonstrating resilience against tariff volatility. (not investment advice)</p>
