          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during her concert in San Francisco when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding suddenly dropped. The incident occurred while she was suspended over the audience performing her song "Roar." Videos show the singer momentarily startled but quickly recovering to continue her performance without interruption. After finishing the song and returning to the stage, she maintained her composure, demonstrating professionalism in a potentially dangerous situation during her "The Lifetimes Tour."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:05:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rising "kiss-and-fly" charges at UK airports are causing drivers to wait in unofficial areas to avoid paying fees, which have increased at over half of the country's busiest airports. At Edinburgh Airport, for example, a £6 tariff for a 10-minute stay in the drop-off zone prompts many to park in nearby lay-bys and coordinate pickups via phone. This behavior highlights public frustration with what many see as extortionate fees for a brief service, contrasting sharply with many major EU airports that offer free drop-offs.</p>

          <h2>UK Debates Merits and Drawbacks of Shortening Traditional Six-Week Summer School Holidays</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:05:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over proposals to shorten the traditional six-week school summer holiday, with various arguments for and against the change. Proponents suggest a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and help mitigate "holiday hunger" for children on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, argue the long break is essential for rest and preparation. They also fear that condensing holidays could drive up travel costs and create new logistical challenges for families.</p>

          <p>The UK's chancellor has expressed a desire to shift public savings from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares investments to boost the economy. The government is considering new advertising campaigns and targeted messages to savers, but has stepped back from immediately cutting the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs after a backlash. Experts note a significant gender gap in investing and caution that pushing inexperienced individuals into volatile markets without proper education could backfire, highlighting the challenge of changing the UK's risk-averse savings culture.

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are "strongly considering" signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, 40, previously played for the Clippers for six seasons and would bring extensive experience and playmaking ability to the roster. The potential signing aligns with the team's strategy to add more ball-handlers and playmakers to support their current stars. If he joins, Paul would likely accept a reserve role on a team aiming to compete for a championship.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharges from water companies in half by 2030, marking the first time a clear target has been set on the issue. The announcement follows public outrage over record levels of pollution in the country's rivers and coastlines, with serious incidents rising by 60% in 2024. The plan also includes measures to ban plastic-containing wet wipes and reduce phosphorus pollution. This comes amid scrutiny of water companies for paying large executive bonuses while environmental performance declines.</p>

          <p>In a research note, Bank of America analysts have described quantum computing as a potential revolution for humanity comparable to the discovery of fire. They argue the technology, which uses subatomic particles for processing, could "change everything" by solving currently impossible calculations in an instant. This could accelerate advancements in medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence, potentially leading to an "Artificial Super Intelligence." While major milestones have been achieved, the technology still faces challenges with "noise" and has yet to solve a practical, real-world problem.</p>

Over the decades, the perception of the plotters has shifted from traitors to heroes. The event remains a powerful symbol of defiance against the Nazi regime.</p>
