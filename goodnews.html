Using advanced tech to overcome his physical limitations, he has dedicated himself to helping disabled people access new tools for communication and interaction with the world. Evans' remarkable journey includes writing country songs one letter at a time and collaborating with museums to create robotic tour guides for those who cannot attend in person. His story is a powerful testament to human resilience and the potential of technology to enhance capability.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, titled "A Poem for Deep Thinkers," provides a comprehensive survey of the career of artist Rashid Johnson. The collection features works across multiple media and materials, examining complex themes such as race, masculinity, identity, and aesthetics. Johnson states that much of his art also serves as a personal reflection of his own anxieties, adding a layer of vulnerability to his powerful pieces. The exhibition offers visitors a deep dive into the influential contributions Johnson has made to the landscape of contemporary art.</p>

          <p>A mechanic in Minnesota made a surprising discovery when he found a wallet that had been lost for 11 years inside the engine bay of a 2015 Ford Edge. The wallet belonged to Richard Guilford, a retired Ford assembly plant worker in Michigan, who likely dropped it while working on the vehicle back in 2014. The mechanic, Chad Volk, successfully tracked down Guilford on Facebook and mailed the wallet back to him, complete with its original contents. Inside were $15 in cash and $250 in Cabela's gift cards, which the store surprisingly confirmed are still valid.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a hypersonic drone carrier that utilizes a novel single, rotating "scissor wing" design, an idea once explored by NASA but never fully realized. This innovative wing can pivot up to 90 degrees, optimizing its position for different speeds to maximize lift and minimize drag. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for efficient takeoff, while at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, it aligns parallel to the body. This design could overcome the traditional aerodynamic compromises between low-speed and high-speed flight performance.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island, located off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been meticulously renovated into a luxury party destination and is now on the market for £3 million. Former software CEO Mike Conner purchased the abandoned island for £555,000 in 2017 and undertook a challenging five-year restoration project to bring it back to life. The historic fort, originally built in the 1850s to defend against French naval attacks, now features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and its own nightclub. The remote location required helicopters to bring in equipment, presenting unique logistical challenges for the renovation.</p>

          <p>With food prices on the rise, parents across the UK are employing meticulous planning and creative cooking to feed their children affordably during the six-week summer holiday period. Popular strategies include buying "yellow sticker" reduced-price items to freeze for later, pre-portioning daily snacks into bags to prevent overconsumption, and organizing the fridge to prioritize items with the nearest expiration dates. Many families also rely on local food pantries and council-issued vouchers to supplement their budgets. These efforts highlight the financial pressure many households face when subsidized school meals are unavailable.</p>

          <p>A group of students about to receive their GCSE results have opened letters they wrote to their future selves four years ago as 11-year-olds. The letters, part of a time capsule project initiated by their teacher, capture their thoughts, hopes, and fears during the COVID-19 pandemic, with questions about face masks and dreams for the future. The exercise served as a poignant reflection on their journey through a secondary school education that was heavily disrupted by lockdowns and social restrictions. For many, rereading their younger selves' ambitions provided motivation and a unique perspective just before a major academic milestone.</p>

          <p>A new collection titled "Sunset Boulevard" documents the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, capturing his last major burst of creativity. The recordings, made at RCA's Hollywood studio, include his final Top 10 hit "Burning Love" and soulful ballads like "Separate Ways," which reflected his personal turmoil.
