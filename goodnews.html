          <p>LeBron James sustained a Grade 2 MCL sprain in his left knee during Game 5 of the Western Conference first-round series against the Minnesota Timberwolves, which the Lakers lost. The injury occurred after a collision with Minnesota guard Donte DiVincenzo. James, who averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists this season, left the game initially but returned to play. Despite the injury, the Lakers expect James to exercise his $52.6 million player option and play at least one more NBA season. He is the NBA's all-time leading scorer.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed resilience in April despite escalating trade tensions initiated by the Trump administration, with employers adding 177,000 jobs and the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2 percent. While the data is backward-looking, it reassured investors worried about a trade-induced economic slowdown, and the S&P 500 rallied after the report's release. However, analysts warn that the long-term effects of tariffs on the labor market will be felt in the coming months, with some companies already halting inbound orders from China. Consumer sentiment has also declined, and major banks have increased the risk of recession and higher inflation.</p>

          <p>In this guest essay, Jonathan Eig, author of ‚ÄúKing: A Life,‚Äù reflects on the relevance of Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs ‚ÄúLetter From Birmingham Jail‚Äù in the context of current political and social challenges. Eig argues that King's message of love and nonviolent resistance remains a powerful tool for combating injustice and cruelty. He highlights King's belief in the power of love to overcome hate and the importance of confronting injustice through peaceful action. The article suggests that King's example of challenging unjust laws and advocating for mercy can guide those who seek to fight back against perceived injustices in the present day.</p>

          <p>Facing a lawsuit over unpaid debt can be daunting, but several strategies can help resolve the issue, including negotiating a settlement with the creditor or debt collector. This involves offering a lump-sum payment or structured repayment plan for less than the full balance, while ensuring the lawsuit is dismissed with prejudice. Other options include working with a debt settlement company, checking for legal defenses or procedural errors in the lawsuit, and hiring a debt defense attorney. Taking swift action and understanding available options can help avoid wage garnishment and protect assets.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified antibodies in the blood of Tim Friede, a man who has injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, that can neutralize the venom of multiple deadly snake species. This breakthrough could lead to the development of a universal antivenom, addressing a significant global health problem. The antibodies, when combined with a drug that blocks neurotoxins, protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species. This research offers hope for preventing deaths and injuries from snakebites, which affect millions worldwide.</p>

          <p>President Trump has moved more slowly in nominating judicial picks during his second term compared to his first.
