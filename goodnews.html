          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on destructive bottom trawling in English waters, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the need for urgent action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The proposal, which is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and the seabed they rely upon. This initiative aligns with the UN Ocean Conference in France and follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the damaging effects of bottom trawling.</p>
