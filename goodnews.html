        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares in Japan's SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a new record after the company reported fiscal first-quarter profits that significantly exceeded analyst expectations. The strong performance marks the firm's second consecutive profitable quarter, driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, the largest since 2021. This growth was attributed to successful investments in both private and publicly listed companies, including Grab Holdings and Swiggy. The positive results are further bolstered by the anticipated public offerings of several portfolio companies, such as Lenskart and PayPay, signaling continued momentum for the investment giant.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano has reached a settlement with Disney and Lucasfilm in her wrongful termination lawsuit, which she filed after being fired from the series 'The Mandalorian' in 2021. Carano was dismissed following controversial social media posts, including one that compared the political climate for Republicans to the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but the lawsuit had sought financial damages and her reinstatement in the show. Carano's legal challenge gained significant attention after it was publicly funded by tech billionaire Elon Musk as part of his stance against cancel culture.</p>

          <p>A spokesperson for Vice President JD Vance stated that his office was not aware of a Secret Service request to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to raise the water level of a river in Ohio. The request was made to ensure safe navigation for the Vice President's security detail during a family boating trip. The Secret Service confirmed it made the decision independently during standard planning, citing operational necessity after a public safety boat allegedly ran aground during a scouting mission. The incident has drawn some criticism and comparisons to a similar situation involving former Vice President Al Gore in 1999.</p>

          <p>Gareth Ward, an Australian politician convicted last month of sexually assaulting two men, has resigned from the New South Wales parliament. His resignation came just hours before a scheduled vote to expel him from his position. Ward had launched a legal challenge to prevent his removal, arguing it was an affront to democracy, but the court dismissed his case. He is currently in custody awaiting sentencing and has stated his intention to appeal the guilty verdict. The resignation triggers a by-election for the seat he has held since 2011, ending a contentious period for the state's legislature.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that he will host the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House for a peace summit. The event is intended to produce a formal peace agreement to end the long-standing and violent conflict between the two nations over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. In his announcement, the president stated that his administration has been engaged with both sides for a considerable time to broker the deal. The signing ceremony is being framed as a historic day that could finally bring stability to the Caucasus region after years of failed diplomatic efforts by other leaders.</p>

          <p>A butterfly species native to Southern Europe, the Southern Small White, has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time. The sighting was confirmed at a nature reserve in Suffolk after a volunteer photographed the female butterfly. Experts at the charity Butterfly Conservation have been tracking the species' rapid northward expansion across Europe, which has seen it move at a rate of about 62 miles per year over the last decade. While the exact drivers are not fully understood, a warming climate is believed to be a significant factor in the species' unprecedented colonization of northern Europe.</p>

          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly millennials, are expressing fatigue with online dating and are instead turning to old-fashioned, in-person events to find partners. This trend is fueling a rise in organized singles mixers and matchmaking events, with platforms like Eventbrite reporting a 42% increase in attendance from 2022 to 2023. Many participants feel that face-to-face interactions provide a more authentic way to gauge chemistry and compatibility, avoiding the pitfalls of digital misrepresentation. This shift in dating culture coincides with a significant drop in the stock value of dating apps like Bumble, suggesting a broader desire for genuine human connection.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries 'Chimp Crazy,' has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison. She was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a federal judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka. In reality, she was hiding the celebrity chimp, who had appeared in several films, in a small cage in her basement. Animal rights group PETA, which had pursued legal action against Haddix, discovered Tonka's location and facilitated his rescue. Haddix's sentencing is seen as a victory for animal welfare advocates.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has announced that its experimental oral weight-loss drug, orforglipron, achieved significant success in a late-stage clinical trial. The once-daily pill helped adults with obesity lose an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, with an efficacy and safety profile comparable to existing injectable GLP-1 therapies. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal issues like nausea and diarrhea. The company plans to submit the drug for FDA approval later this year, potentially making a more convenient and accessible pill-based treatment available to consumers by 2026, which could be a game-changer in the weight-loss market.</p>

          <p>The UK government is drafting new legislation that would impose stricter controls on serious violent and sexual offenders after their release from prison. The proposed system would confine offenders to specific, tailored geographical zones rather than simply using exclusion zones that bar them from certain areas. This shift aims to provide victims with greater peace of mind, allowing them to travel more freely without fear of encountering their attacker. While the government plans to use enhanced electronic tagging and monitoring technology, probation officers have raised concerns that the new zones will add significant pressure to their already strained service.</p>

          <h2>Chinese EV Makers Scale Back Price Cuts Following Government Intervention</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 19:30:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers have begun to rein in the steep discounts offered to consumers, following an intervention from Beijing. The Chinese government expressed concern that an intense and prolonged price war was threatening to destabilize the country's globally leading EV industry. While the move is seen as a stabilizing force, analysts note that the root cause of the fierce competition—significant overcapacity in the market—has not been resolved. This suggests that while the most aggressive phase of the price war may be over, the environment will likely remain challenging for carmakers. (not investment advice)</p>
