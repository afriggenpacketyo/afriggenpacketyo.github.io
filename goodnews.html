          <p>Alex Palou made history as the first Spaniard to win the Indianapolis 500, triumphing over Marcus Ericsson in the final laps. The race was marked by several bizarre incidents, including Scott McLaughlin crashing during warm-up laps and Alexander Rossi's pit stop erupting in flames. Kyle Larson's attempt to complete "the double" ended in a three-car collision. Palou expressed that winning the Indy 500 was crucial for completing his career resume, which now includes three IndyCar titles in four years. </p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani took a significant step in his pitching rehabilitation by throwing a live batting practice session, 19 months after undergoing Tommy John surgery. Ohtani threw 22 pitches against hitters, reaching speeds of 94-97 mph with his fastball and incorporating his full repertoire. The session marked his first time facing live hitters in a Dodger uniform and was conducted in an empty Citi Field. While the Dodgers are cautious about setting a firm timeline, Ohtani's return to the rotation is expected after the All-Star break. </p>

          <h2>Report Indicates More Americans Now Hold Bitcoin Than Gold</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report by Bitcoin investment firm River suggests that more Americans now hold Bitcoin than gold, attributing this trend to accessibility and cultural shifts. According to the report, 50 million Americans hold Bitcoin, compared to 37 million who hold gold. The Nakamoto Project's Q3 2024 study supports these findings, indicating a generational shift in how Americans preserve wealth. The Trump administration is exploring budget-neutral strategies to fund the U.S.'s Bitcoin reserve, with one idea being the revaluation of the nation‚Äôs gold certificates (not investment advice). </p>
