          <p>Germany's new coalition government, formed by the CDU/CSU and SPD, faces significant challenges including a struggling economy, rising far-right support, and foreign policy uncertainties.

Increased border controls and refusals are planned to curb migration, while a ‚Ç¨500 billion special fund will be used for investments in schools, infrastructure, and climate protection.

          <p>An excerpt from Barry Diller's memoir, "Who Knew," emphasizes the importance of instinct over data in creative and business decisions, particularly when evaluating ideas for television and film. Diller recounts his experiences at ABC, where he championed the "Movie of the Week" concept and learned to trust his gut feeling about what would resonate with audiences. He argues that relying too heavily on research and structured information can stifle creativity and obscure the essence of a good idea, citing the success of projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" as examples of instinct-driven choices.</p>
