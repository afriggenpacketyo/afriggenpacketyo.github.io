          <p>Shedeur Sanders believes that much of the criticism he receives stems from negativity directed towards his father, Deion Sanders. Speaking to Cleveland.com, Sanders noted that the younger generation, unlike the older one, forms its own opinions and doesn't rely on past perceptions of his father. He enjoys meeting people in person and answering their questions directly, as he finds less negativity offline. Sanders is entering a crowded quarterback room with veterans and fellow rookies, and all eyes will be on him during offseason workouts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent warming toward the new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Shara, has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region. After a series of Israeli airstrikes on Syria targeting weapons and hostile groups, Trump met with al-Shara and announced plans to lift sanctions. This shift in American foreign policy has led to a decrease in Israeli strikes, raising concerns about the potential rise of an anti-Israel neighbor. Israeli officials express skepticism about al-Shara's intentions and the stability of his government.</p>

The game was paused for nearly 30 minutes, and the Southern Conference commissioner had to intervene. Samford won the game and advanced to the Southern Conference championship.</p>
