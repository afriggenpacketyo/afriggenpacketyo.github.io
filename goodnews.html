          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a strategic defense review outlining significant investments in national security, intended as a clear signal to hostile states, particularly Russia. Defence Secretary John Healey announced a ¬£1.5 billion investment in new defense factories, creating 1,800 jobs across the UK, with a focus on long-range weapons production. The review emphasizes the "immediate and pressing" danger posed by Russia and other countries like China. The government aims to strengthen the armed forces and industrial base, ensuring readiness to deter future conflicts, acknowledging the deficiencies in Western weapons production highlighted by the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>In an essay, a palliative care physician reflects on the importance of considering how one truly wishes to live, especially when faced with a terminal illness. The author shares anecdotes of patients whose perspectives shifted upon receiving a diagnosis, often leading them to reconcile their current lives with the ones they had longed for. Rather than pursuing outlandish bucket list activities, people often seek meaningful connections and experiences with loved ones. The author suggests that contemplating mortality can provide clarity and freedom to live more authentically.</p>

          <p>Despite the potential impact on its medal prospects, skateboarding powerhouse Japan has welcomed the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Governing body World Skate decided in April to institute the limit, which would have ruled some of Japan's previous Olympic medal-winning skateboarders ineligible. Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa has nevertheless endorsed the new restriction against the backdrop of increasingly severe injuries, including ligament ruptures, being reported among growing children in many countries as the technical difficulty of tricks continues to rise. The International Olympic Committee started tightening age restrictions to protect child athletes after Russian figure skating prodigy Kamila Valieva tested positive for a banned substance at the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.</p>

          <p>An amendment to Japan's Penal Code, emphasizing rehabilitation in prisons, has taken effect, marking the first change to punishment forms in over a century. Imprisonment is no longer divided into labor categories, and work is not mandatory, allowing more time for rehabilitation and education to reduce recidivism. The revised law stipulates "confinement" and "necessary work" or "necessary guidance" for improvement. The new system includes 24 programs tailored to inmates' age, characteristics, and other factors, including programs for seniors and drug abusers. Inmates will be sent to prisons offering appropriate programs, reviewed every six months for adjustments.</p>
