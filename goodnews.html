        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major technology companies like Meta and Alphabet are seeing significant returns in their digital advertising businesses, largely driven by advancements in artificial intelligence. Meta attributed its 22% year-over-year sales increase to AI-powered efficiencies in its ad system, noting a rebound in spending from Asian-based e-commerce firms. While tech giants thrive, smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest reported more lukewarm results, underscoring a trend where advertisers gravitate toward larger, more stable platforms during economic uncertainty. The robust performance is fueling further massive investments in AI infrastructure by industry leaders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold futures fell from a record high after the White House announced it would soon issue an executive order to clarify "misinformation" regarding tariffs on the precious metal. The announcement came after the Swiss Precious Metals Association raised concerns that a 39% U.S. tariff on Swiss exports was being applied to 1 kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars, potentially disrupting international gold flows. Switzerland is the world's largest gold refiner, and the uncertainty had pushed prices to an all-time closing high of $3,491.30 before the White House statement prompted a partial reversal.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) should be aware of several factors that could impact their borrowing limits this August. Key influences include fluctuating home values, as regional markets show mixed signals with some areas seeing price declines for the first time in years. A homeowner's personal credit profile is also critical, as changes in credit scores can prompt lenders to adjust available credit. Furthermore, the broader interest rate environment plays a significant role, with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts possibly leading to more favorable lending terms and higher credit limits.

          <p>Tesla has been granted a permit to operate a ride-hailing business across Texas, positioning it to compete with services like Uber and Lyft. The permit, issued by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, allows the company's subsidiary, Tesla Robotaxi LLC, to run a "transportation network company" until 2026. This formalizes and expands a limited, invitation-only service the company has been running in Austin using Model Y vehicles with a human safety supervisor. The permit notably allows for operations with or without a human driver, a key step in Elon Musk's long-stated ambition for a fully autonomous robotaxi network.</p>

          <p>A new bill, the Apeel Reveal Act, has been introduced in the U.S. House to require mandatory labeling on fruits and vegetables treated with shelf-life-extending coatings. The legislation specifically names products from Apeel Sciences, an industry leader that uses plant-based coatings to reduce food waste. Proponents of the bill, led by Rep. Marlin Stutzman, argue that transparency is essential for consumers to make informed choices about the food they eat. Apeel Sciences has stated it supports consumer transparency, noting its ingredients are FDA-approved and that its products already feature a logo for identification.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano and The Walt Disney Co. have settled a lawsuit she filed alleging wrongful termination and discrimination from the series "The Mandalorian." Carano, who was dismissed in 2021 following controversial social media posts, called the settlement the "best outcome for all parties involved." A Lucasfilm spokesperson stated the company looked forward to identifying future opportunities to work with Carano, who was well-respected by colleagues. The lawsuit, which was financially backed by Elon Musk, had sought over $75,000 in damages and reinstatement to her role as Cara Dune.</p>

          <p>Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson and the club have mutually agreed that he can leave Stamford Bridge, with Newcastle reportedly interested in the 24-year-old. Jackson trained alone on Friday and was left out of a friendly match against Bayer Leverkusen. The move is seen as beneficial for both parties, as Chelsea has already signed two new strikers, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap, for the upcoming season. The club is reportedly seeking a transfer fee of at least double the £32 million it paid for the Senegal international in 2023, and will reintegrate him if their valuation is not met.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced a significant weekly surge, crossing its 200-day moving average after the company committed to a $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, easing investor concerns about tariffs.

This move, which could become one of the largest IPOs ever, is reportedly being discussed with leaders from major investment banks as the market for public offerings heats up.

          <p>The European Union's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery, Nayara Energy, for processing Russian crude is not expected to derail progress on a long-delayed EU-India free trade agreement. Experts argue the designation is largely symbolic and that the greater pressure on India comes from the threat of U.S. tariffs, which may paradoxically push New Delhi closer to securing a deal with the EU. As India seeks to diversify its economic partnerships amid global volatility, a stable trade relationship with the EU has become increasingly attractive, making the single refinery sanction a minor issue in the larger geopolitical context.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses a record $1.21 trillion, consumers can employ several strategies to combat compounding interest charges. One effective method is transferring balances to a card with a 0% introductory APR, allowing for principal-focused payments for a promotional period. For those facing severe financial strain, many card issuers offer hardship programs that can temporarily reduce or pause interest rates. Other tactics include paying off the balance before the statement closing date to prevent interest calculation or consolidating multiple high-interest debts into a single, lower-rate personal loan.

          <p>Archaeologists from East Carolina University believe they may have discovered the wreck of La Fortuna, a Spanish privateer ship that exploded during an attack on a colonial North Carolina port in 1748. The remains were one of four shipwrecks found at the Brunswick Town/Fort Anderson State Historic Site. Wood samples suggest the vessel was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies, and its location is near where a cannon from the ship was found in 1985. The team recovered over 40 timbers to protect them from erosion, shedding new light on colonial maritime history and military conflict.</p>
