          <p>Researchers at Caltech are transforming jellyfish into "biohybrid" cyborgs by embedding them with microelectronic controllers to help explore the ocean's mysteries. These devices can stimulate the jellyfish's muscles, allowing scientists to remotely guide their movement and collect environmental data on temperature and pressure. Because jellyfish are naturally resilient, have no central nervous system, and are abundant, this low-cost, scalable approach could revolutionize ocean monitoring, making it more accessible for a wider range of scientific and conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>This reflective article analyzes the final fight between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano, framing it not just as a sporting event but as a statement on the evolution of women's boxing. The author contrasts the fight's tactical, controlled nature with the raw chaos some fans expect, arguing that true equality is the right for female athletes to win strategically, not just to entertain with brawls. It explores the contradictions within the sport, where women reclaim their bodies through risk, fighting for glory in a space still marked by objectification.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert in Niger. Scientific analysis confirmed its Martian origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the Viking space probe, making it an exceptionally rare and significant find for collectors.</p>

          <p>After four decades of conflict, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its armed struggle against the Turkish state and initiated a disarmament process. This move presents a significant opportunity for peace, though the PKK has stated that full disarmament depends on concessions from Turkey, including the release of leader Abdullah Ocalan and other political prisoners. A successful peace process could not only resolve a long-standing domestic conflict but also improve Turkey's relations with its neighbors and enhance its status in the Middle East.</p>

This shift highlights the economic pressures forcing high-end establishments to pivot from expensive banquets to more accessible offerings to maintain revenue and solve immediate survival problems.</p>

          <p>Health campaigners and a Member of Parliament are calling for cosmetic ingredient lists to be in English rather than Latin to protect consumers with allergies. The current international standard (INCI) uses Latin-based names, making it difficult for individuals to identify potential allergens like nut oils (Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis) or wheat (Triticum Vulgare). The article shares stories of people who have suffered allergic reactions, arguing that makeup and skincare products should have clear, plain-language warnings similar to food packaging to prevent potentially life-threatening situations.</p>
