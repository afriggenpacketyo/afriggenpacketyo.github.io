          <p>The European Union has provided emergency funding to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) after the Trump administration withheld $75 million in designated funds. RFE/RL, founded during the Cold War, provides non-ideological news to countries where the press is restricted. The Trump administration had sought to dismantle RFE/RL and its sister networks, citing bias. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas announced a $6.2 million grant to support RFE/RL's independent journalism, highlighting the importance of the network's reporting on Russia and Hungary.</p>

          <p>Xpeng, a Chinese electric-vehicle maker, saw its shares surge in Hong Kong following positive earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter.

Xpeng expects to deliver 102,000 to 108,000 electric cars in the second quarter, a significant jump from the previous year. The company aims to begin mass production of vehicles equipped with Level 3 autonomous driving features in China by year-end.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has implemented a new gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to ease the cost of living for consumers ahead of an upcoming parliamentary election. The subsidy will reduce the wholesale gasoline price by 7.40 yen per liter in the first week, with further reductions planned weekly until it reaches 10 yen. The program, allocated around 1 trillion yen, could last until the end of March 2026. The reintroduction of the subsidies comes before the House of Councillors election slated for the summer.</p>

Kato expressed concern about the global economic impact of Trump's tariffs, while Japan continues to oppose additional tariffs.

          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining attention as the "sell U.S." narrative gains momentum, following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America and JPMorgan have highlighted emerging markets as a promising investment opportunity, citing a weaker U.S. dollar, a potential peak in U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has outperformed the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 year-to-date. A dented confidence in U.S. assets, marked by a selloff in U.S. Treasurys, equities, and the greenback, has fueled bullishness for emerging markets. (not investment advice)</p>
