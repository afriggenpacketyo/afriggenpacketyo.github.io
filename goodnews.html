        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by implementing reciprocal tariffs, a significant blow to his economic agenda. The court determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unilateral power to impose sweeping duties. The Trump administration had invoked the act, declaring a national economic emergency to bypass congressional approval for the tariffs, citing foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment of the United States as justification. The White House has swiftly appealed the ruling, asserting that it is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. (not investment advice)</p>

Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who recently assumed his post, expressed disappointment at the comment, emphasizing efforts to release the rice effectively.

The controversial measures unveiled on "Liberation Day" in April, which included a 10% tariff on UK imports, had caused aggressive sell-offs in the stock market.
