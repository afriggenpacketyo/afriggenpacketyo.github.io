          <p>European startup founders are resisting pressure to adopt China's "996" work culture, which involves working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. The debate was sparked by venture capitalists advocating for longer working hours to compete globally, but many European founders argue that overwork is not sustainable or aligned with European values. They emphasize the importance of innovation, work-life balance, and stronger funding for European startups. Some point to successful European companies that achieved dominance through innovation and sustainable cultures, rather than overwork.</p>
