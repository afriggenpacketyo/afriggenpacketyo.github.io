          <h2>Study Suggests China's Tibetan Dam Project May Increase India's Dry-Season Water Supply</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to widespread fears in India that China's new mega-dam in Tibet could cause a water crisis, a recent study suggests it might have the opposite effect. By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, researchers found that water flow during the dry season has actually increased. Specifically, low flows in February were observed to be over 50% higher, alleviating concerns about potential droughts. This new evidence provides a more nuanced perspective on the dam's downstream impact, suggesting a potential for more stable water management rather than conflict.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek secured her sixth Grand Slam title with a dominant victory over American Amanda Anisimova in the Wimbledon women's final. Swiatek won in straight sets, 6-0, 6-0, in a match that lasted just 57 minutes, marking the first time in 114 years a player failed to win a single game in the women's final. For the 24-year-old from Poland, this is her first Wimbledon championship, adding to her four French Open titles and one U.S. Open title. The match was the first major final for Anisimova, who had a remarkable run to the championship after taking a career break in 2023.</p>

          <p>As the global space economy is projected to reach US$1.8 trillion by 2035, China is fostering a boom in its private aerospace industry, and Hong Kong is poised to play a significant role. The sector is no longer dominated by state missions, with private investment in China's aerospace industry expected to grow substantially. Companies like Beijing-based i-Space and LandSpace are already achieving major milestones, such as launching the first private rocket into orbit. Hong Kong's financial and technological ecosystem could be instrumental in supporting this next phase of growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's government is strategically promoting the development of what it terms "future industries" to establish a new economic growth model based on technological innovation. First mentioned by President Xi Jinping in 2020, this concept refers to emerging sectors with immense potential, such as humanoid robots, 6G networks, and brain-computer interfaces. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released guidelines identifying these priority areas. This national push aims to position China as a leader in foundational technologies that are expected to shape the global economy in the coming decades.</p>

          <p>Several startups, including London-based Better Dairy, are developing lab-grown cheese using a process called precision fermentation, hoping to bring it to market within a few years. The technique involves genetically modifying yeast to produce casein, the key protein in milk, which is then combined with plant-based fats to create cheese. While proponents tout the environmental benefits and potential for improved taste over current vegan options, the industry faces challenges. These include high initial costs, regulatory hurdles for "novel foods," and a recent decline in consumer demand for plant-based alternatives.</p>

          <p>A woman from Norfolk, UK, who discovered she had an older brother given up for adoption, successfully tracked him down in Australia after a years-long search. Jess Basey-Fisher learned of her brother's existence only after her mother's death and used Ancestry records to find him. The siblings, who share a striking resemblance and similar interests, connected via FaceTime before meeting in person. Their reunion was bittersweet, as her brother, Alistair, was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer shortly after they connected, prompting her to travel to Australia to support him through treatment.</p>

          <p>With the cost of package holidays soaring, families are employing creative strategies to save money on their summer vacations. One couple saved thousands by booking an all-inclusive trip to Mexico just two days before departure, finding it cheaper than European destinations. Another family saved over £3,000 by traveling off-peak and using a "kids go free" filter on travel websites. Other money-saving hacks include using home-swapping websites to trade flats for villas, collecting credit card points for flights, and house-sitting to get free accommodation both in the UK and abroad.</p>

Chelsea midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd expressed confidence that there is "something different" about the squad this year and that they can go all the way.

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, ordering officials to stop "indiscriminately" arresting people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The ruling, by U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong, bars arrests based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The order stems from a lawsuit filed by immigrants and U.S. citizens who were detained without reasonable suspicion during recent enforcement actions. The decision represents a significant legal check on the administration's intensified immigration crackdown, particularly in California.</p>
