          <p>Two hikers in New York's Adirondack Mountains called 911 to report that a third member of their party had died, only to discover that he was alive and well. The incident occurred after the hikers ingested hallucinogenic mushrooms, leading them to believe their companion had passed away. A state forest ranger responded to the call and found the two hikers in an altered mental state; the "deceased" hiker called and was not injured. The ranger escorted the two mushroom-affected hikers to a hospital and reunited the group at their campsite.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a significant blow to his economic policies, with the court ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court emphasized that the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, a power not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration has announced its intention to appeal the ruling. The court decision has sparked a positive response in global markets, with stock markets in Asia rising and the US dollar gaining against safe-haven currencies.</p>

          <p>The UK government has detailed its plans to reform the pension industry, including the creation of ¬£25 billion "megafunds" that will be directed to invest locally to stimulate economic growth. The overhaul, inspired by the successful models of Australia and Canada, aims to enhance pension pots for individuals. While seventeen of the UK's largest pension firms have already endorsed the reforms in a voluntary agreement, the government is also implementing a legislative backstop to ensure progress by the end of the decade. These changes are expected to significantly impact pension scheme operations, with the potential to improve retirement outcomes through better governance and investment diversification.

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by heightened demand ahead of potential negative effects from increased U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also rose by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. Despite U.S. President Trump imposing an additional 25% tariff on cars produced outside the United States on April 3, Toyota has stated it will not pass the tariff costs onto consumers in the United States, but analysts predict this stance may be unsustainable in the long term. For the full business year, Toyota anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit due to the tariffs and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal court has frozen most of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the levies exceed the president's legal authority. The court halted the 10% tariffs Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner on "Liberation Day" last month, as well as tariffs imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada. The Trump administration justified the tariffs by citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, but the court rejected this interpretation, stating that Congress needs to give clear authorization for the president to set tariffs. The Trump administration has announced it will appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>Remember Monday, the UK's first all-female group at Eurovision since 1999, is preparing for a busy summer following their performance in Switzerland. The trio, consisting of Holly-Anne Hull, Charlotte Steele, and Lauren Byrne, co-wrote and performed "What The Hell Just Happened?" at the 69th annual contest, finishing 19th. The group expressed their joy at the experience and are preparing to go on tour across the UK, with appearances at music festivals such as Isle of Wight, Latitude, and The Big Feastival. Their song is currently sitting at 31 in the official charts, and they are hoping to get back into the studio soon to record new music.</p>
