          <p>Asian markets saw significant gains, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index closing above 45,000 for the first time, driven by optimism from U.S.-China trade negotiations. President Donald Trump's comments about positive progress in the talks bolstered investor confidence across the region, also leading South Korea's Kospi to a new record. However, the discussions were partly overshadowed by a new "framework" deal concerning the divestment of TikTok, announced by the U.S. Treasury. While most Asian indices climbed, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 saw minor declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's state visit to the UK includes a detailed schedule of royal ceremonies and high-level political meetings. The agenda features a formal greeting and carriage procession with King Charles at Windsor Castle, a state banquet, and a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers. Key discussion topics are expected to include new UK-US investment deals in technology and energy, as well as geopolitical issues like the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The visit is meticulously planned to balance diplomatic substance with traditional pomp, though it also addresses potential points of friction like migration and free speech.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next April, based on the latest average earnings data, which would add over £500 annually to the new flat-rate pension. This increase is determined by the "triple lock" policy, which guarantees the pension rises by the highest of inflation, average earnings growth, or 2.5%. While the rise provides relief for nearly 13 million pensioners, it also brings the state pension closer to the frozen personal tax allowance threshold. This has raised concerns that more pensioners will be drawn into paying income tax in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's state visit to the UK is seen as a crucial opportunity for Prime Minister Keir Starmer to distract from a series of domestic political troubles. With his government facing low approval ratings and internal party dissent, Starmer is leveraging the visit to showcase the UK's "soft power" and secure new trade and investment deals. The visit's agenda is packed with royal pageantry designed to appeal to Trump, alongside substantive talks on technology, energy, and tariffs. Despite their political differences, Trump's apparent personal liking for Starmer may provide the British government with much-needed positive headlines and a temporary reprieve.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Baker Mayfield led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a dramatic 20-19 victory over the Houston Texans with a last-minute, 80-yard touchdown drive. The game-winning score, a two-yard run by Rachaad White with six seconds remaining, was kept alive by a crucial 15-yard scramble from Mayfield on a fourth-and-10 play. This marks the second consecutive week Mayfield has orchestrated a game-winning drive in the final minute, helping the Buccaneers start the season 2-0. The result was a reversal of fortune from the teams' 2023 meeting, where the Texans won in the final seconds.</p>

          <p>A new "Hillsborough Law" bill set to be introduced in the UK Parliament will create a legal "duty of candour," compelling public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters. The legislation, officially the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, aims to end "cover-ups" and will impose criminal sanctions for breaches. Championed by families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster, the law is also intended to apply to other scandals like the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office Horizon case. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has fulfilled a pledge to introduce the law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Women's rugby teams are increasingly adopting scientific methods to track and manage players' menstrual cycles, viewing it as a "fifth vital sign" of health. Teams like England's Red Roses and the USA Eagles use wellness apps and daily questionnaires to monitor players, allowing for adjustments in training intensity and nutrition to optimize performance. This data-informed approach helps manage symptoms like cramps and fatigue, with some teams even providing nutritional supplements like a "cramp cocktail" of vitamins and minerals. The goal is not to sideline players, but to support them through hormonal fluctuations during demanding competitions like the World Cup.</p>

The Chargers' defense stifled the Raiders' offense, holding them to just 218 total yards. Quarterback Justin Herbert contributed 242 passing yards and two touchdowns, securing a win for coach Jim Harbaugh against his longtime rival, Raiders coach Pete Carroll, and improving the Chargers' record to 2-0.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to debate and vote on a significant justice reform bill that proposes to eliminate the controversial "not proven" verdict from criminal trials. This verdict, unique to Scots law, results in an acquittal but is often seen as ambiguous and unsatisfactory for victims. To balance this change, the bill also proposes raising the jury majority required for a guilty verdict from a simple majority to two-thirds. The comprehensive legislation also includes plans for a specialized sexual offenses court and the creation of a victims and witnesses commissioner to improve their experience within the justice system.</p>

In a recently published speech, Xi outlined key tasks, with a primary focus on curbing excessive and "cutthroat" price competition among domestic firms. He urged industry associations to guide companies toward prioritizing product quality over simply offering the lowest price. This directive aligns with broader government efforts to phase out obsolete industrial capacity and foster a more stable and high-quality economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are primarily planning to use Shohei Ohtani as a starting pitcher in the postseason, but the team has not ruled out deploying him from the bullpen in certain high-leverage situations. Andrew Friedman, the team's president of baseball operations, noted that playoff scenarios are unpredictable and drew a parallel to Walker Buehler's title-clinching save in a previous World Series. While Ohtani's role as a starter is the main focus, using him as a reliever between starts remains a possibility, though it is complicated by MLB's two-way player rules, which would cause the Dodgers to lose their designated hitter.</p>
