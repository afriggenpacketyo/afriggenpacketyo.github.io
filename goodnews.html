          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to review guidance on including alternative assets in 401(k) plans. This move could allow investments like private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies to become more common in Americans' defined contribution retirement accounts. Proponents in the alternative asset industry see this as a major victory, while some financial experts express concern about the potential risks for less sophisticated investors. The order signals a significant potential shift in retirement savings strategy, building on previous guidance that permitted such investments under certain conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ad-tech company AppLovin saw its stock jump 12% following a strong second-quarter earnings report that beat analyst expectations. The company's growth has been fueled by AI technology that improves ad targeting in mobile games. CEO Adam Foroughi also suggested that the legal fallout from the Apple vs. Epic Games case will create future benefits, as developers will have more money to spend on advertising once they are no longer forced to pay Apple's high App Store fees. This positive outlook comes despite recent criticism from several short-selling firms questioning the company's technology and practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, pausing all new construction at a controversial immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling allows the facility to continue housing detainees but prevents any further building for 14 days. The decision came after environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe argued that the facility was built without required environmental impact studies, threatening a sensitive ecosystem and lands sacred to the tribe. The halt provides a temporary victory for opponents of the project while the court considers a more permanent injunction.</p>

          <p>Zach Cregger's new horror film "Weapons" is reviewed as a complex and intentionally messy narrative that splices together the perspectives of six different protagonists. The story revolves around the mysterious disappearance of an entire class of third-graders, with the film focusing on the overlapping, incomplete views of characters played by Julia Garner and Josh Brolin, among others. The review praises the film's ability to create tension and its unique structure, which prioritizes a sense of real-world chaos over a tidy resolution. While some symbolic elements feel underdeveloped, the film is lauded for its strong performances and unsettling atmosphere.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the legal circumstances under which a debt collector can freeze a consumer's bank account. It clarifies that this action cannot be taken arbitrarily; the collector must first file a lawsuit and win a court judgment against the debtor. The article also notes that certain funds, such as Social Security and disability benefits, are legally protected from garnishment even after a judgment is obtained. For those whose accounts are frozen, options include filing an exemption claim with the court or negotiating a payment plan with the collector to have the freeze lifted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes which savings vehicle could currently earn more interest on a $20,000 deposit over three months: a 3-month CD or a money market account. While a money market account may offer a slightly higher interest rate at present, its rate is variable and likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. In contrast, a CD's rate is fixed for its term, guaranteeing the return. The analysis concludes that while the money market account could technically earn a few dollars more, a CD offers predictability and is more likely to achieve the goal of maximizing guaranteed interest.

Co-founder Sam Altman described the new model as having "PhD-level" expertise on any topic, with improved reasoning and the ability to create entire software programs. The release marks another major step in the competitive AI landscape, though some ethics experts express caution. They note the growing gap between AI capabilities and effective regulation, and question whether the launch is driven more by hype than a true breakthrough in reasoning ability.</p>

          <p>A California jury has ruled that Meta violated the state's Invasion of Privacy Act by collecting sensitive user data from the period-tracking app, Flo. The class-action lawsuit alleged that Flo shared personal reproductive health information with companies like Meta and Google, despite assuring users their data would be kept private. While other defendants settled, Meta took the case to trial and lost, though the company is expected to appeal. The verdict is being hailed by the plaintiffs' lawyers as a significant message to Big Tech about the protection of digital health data and corporate accountability.</p>

          <p>This market analysis piece suggests that a recent plunge in cybersecurity stocks, triggered by a disappointing forecast from Fortinet, may be an overreaction. The article argues that the sell-off has unfairly dragged down other strong companies in the sector, like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, whose business models differ from Fortinet's. The author notes that the drop is largely due to automated, sector-based ETF trading rather than fundamental weaknesses in these other companies. The commentary indicates an interest in buying shares of these firms at their current lower prices, viewing the situation as a market inefficiency. (not investment advice)</p>
