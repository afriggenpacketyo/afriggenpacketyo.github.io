          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw gains on Monday, mirroring Wall Street's positive close, as investors reacted to China's decision to keep its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. The People's Bank of China maintained the one-year LPR at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%, diverging from the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut. This stability in China's lending rates contributed to upward movement in key indices across Japan, South Korea, and Australia, despite global economic shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erika Kirk, widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, publicly forgave Tyler Robinson, the man accused of her husband's murder, during a memorial service at State Farm Stadium. She expressed that her forgiveness was rooted in Christian faith and her late husband's principles, emphasizing love over hate. Kirk recounted the profound grief of seeing her husband's body but found comfort in a faint smile, believing he did not suffer. Her remarks contrasted sharply with President Trump's later statement of hating his opponents, highlighting a divergence in tone regarding political adversaries.</p>

          <p>Research on over 200 parent-child relationships identifies nine key practices parents employ to cultivate exceptional social skills in their children. These include openly discussing emotions, modeling empathy, fostering authentic confidence, teaching conflict resolution, validating feelings, and helping children recognize social cues. The article emphasizes that allowing children to solve conflicts independently and treating mistakes as learning opportunities also builds resilience and adaptability. Ultimately, listening more than lecturing enables children to develop into empathetic individuals prepared for healthy real-world relationships.</p>

          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK Work and Pensions Secretary, has declared that welfare reform "must happen" to better support individuals and address the escalating cost of benefits. His pledge follows the government's reversal on a policy to cut disability benefits, highlighting the pressure on the chancellor ahead of the November Budget. McFadden did not rule out tightening eligibility for Universal Credit, emphasizing the system's "unhealthy" binary divide between "fit for work" and "not fit for work." The government plans to deploy 1,000 specialist work coaches to offer voluntary support to those on sickness benefits.</p>

          <p>Scientists on Nantucket are pioneering a genetic engineering approach to combat Lyme disease by making wild white-footed mice immune to the bacteria. This innovative project, "Mice Against Ticks," aims to interrupt the infection cycle without harming the mice or the ecosystem, which is crucial as hearing is the last sense to go. Researchers at MIT are using CRISPR technology to insert an antibody gene into mouse embryos, creating heritable immunity. The plan involves releasing thousands of engineered mice, but first requires community buy-in and small-scale field trials to assess ecological impacts and ensure public voice in technology development.</p>

Founded by figures like Niall Ferguson and Bari Weiss, UATX aims to disrupt higher education's perceived echo chambers and stifle of free expression. The curriculum focuses on Western civilization, with small, seminar-style classes operating under a "Chatham House Rule" to encourage candid discussion. Despite criticism as an "anti-woke" institution, UATX asserts its mission is intellectual diversity, prioritizing merit, excellence, and intelligence in admissions, and fostering a culture where differing views are welcomed.</p>

          <p>Tens of millions of monarch butterflies embark on an epic annual migration from Mexico to Canada and the northern U.S., a journey spanning thousands of miles. A unique "super generation" of monarchs, born in late summer, can live up to nine months—nine times longer than typical monarchs—by suppressing reproductive hormones, enabling this arduous trip. Despite this natural marvel, the monarch population in Mexico has declined by 70% in 30 years due to illegal logging and the eradication of milkweed, their sole food source for caterpillars. Conservation efforts, including forest restoration and planting "Monarch Waystations," are underway to protect these charismatic insects.</p>

Having contributed to multiple plans, Yu highlights their historical role in building China's economy from a state of impoverishment. He notes that while early plans faced challenges, those since the reform and opening-up period in 1978 have largely succeeded in meeting their targets. This perspective underscores the Chinese government's long-term economic strategy and its direct impact on citizens' livelihoods.</p>

          <p>The article highlights how investments of $7,000 in each of Palantir Technologies, AppLovin, and Carvana at the start of 2023 would now be worth over $1 million combined. These companies, previously unprofitable, have seen significant financial turnarounds, driven by improved economic conditions and a focus on AI solutions. Palantir's revenue surged with AI enhancements, AppLovin achieved explosive growth and profit margins through its Axon AI platform, and Carvana successfully restructured its debt. While these stocks show impressive returns, their current valuations are noted as high, with Carvana's business still carrying risk due to low margins. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump, who described the potential investors as "American patriots," expressed confidence in their ability to manage the platform.

He believes President Trump and Kim Jong Un could resume talks due to their "degree of mutual trust." This pragmatic approach aims to reduce tensions and achieve some progress, even as Lee navigates complex relationships with the US, China, and Russia.</p>
