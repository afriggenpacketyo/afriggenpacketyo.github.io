          <p>Chinese scientists have engineered a new type of rice, dubbed "tea rice," that is enriched with catechin, an antioxidant compound found in green tea. This innovation aims to provide the health benefits of tea, such as regulating blood pressure and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, without the side effects of caffeine. Catechins, which make up a significant portion of tea's dry weight, have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. The researchers believe that this new grain could offer a convenient and caffeine-free way to consume these beneficial compounds.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays. The redesign aims to allow planes to climb quicker during takeoff and descend more smoothly, reducing aviation's climate change impacts. The changes, the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s, also intend to pave the way for new technologies like flying taxis. However, a community aviation group has warned that the plans could introduce new flight paths over previously unaffected residential areas.</p>

          <p>Catherine Duleep Singh, a British-born Sikh princess, defied social norms by living openly in a same-sex relationship in 1900s Germany and using her privilege to help Jewish families escape Nazi persecution. She provided financial support, wrote letters of recommendation, and guaranteed immigration documents, aiding families like the Hornsteins to start new lives in Britain. Catherine's story, largely untold until recently, showcases her courage and humanity in the face of extreme adversity. Her legacy is now being recognized, with an upcoming Kensington Palace exhibition highlighting her and her sisters' acts of resistance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, *The Family Dynamic*, explores how sibling relationships shape individuals, examining factors like birth order and achievements. Studies suggest that eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests, possibly due to increased parental attention. Sibling influence can be powerful, with individuals often pursuing different paths in response to their siblings' choices. The article reflects on how siblings act as mirrors, revealing both strengths and flaws, and how being known and loved by those who have witnessed every side of oneself is a beautiful thing.</p>

          <p>Germany's former foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, is nominated to become the new president of the United Nations General Assembly for a one-year term in September. Baerbock's nomination followed the change in German government and was not without internal controversy, as Germany had initially planned to nominate diplomat Helga Schmid. During her time as foreign minister, Baerbock was known for her commitment to a "value-based foreign policy" and her outspokenness on human rights issues, but her comments sometimes led to diplomatic challenges. Despite the challenges, her new role offers a significant opportunity.</p>
