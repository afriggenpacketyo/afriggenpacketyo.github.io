          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the enforcement of the Trump administration's executive order concerning birthright citizenship. The ruling came in response to a class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of immigrant families. U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante stated that the challengers were likely to suffer irreparable harm if the order was not halted. This decision represents a significant legal victory for opponents of the policy, which sought to challenge the constitutionally established right to citizenship for all individuals born in the United States.</p>

          <p>The first-ever Hermès Birkin bag, created for and owned by the late singer and actress Jane Birkin, has sold for a record-breaking €8.6 million (£7.4 million) at a Sotheby's auction in Paris. This sale makes it the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction, far surpassing the previous record. The iconic black leather bag was designed in 1985 after Birkin suggested a more practical luxury bag to the head of Hermès during a flight. The prototype, which Birkin owned for a decade, features her initials and other unique marks, cementing its historical significance in the fashion world.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has reinstated its 2025 profit forecast, signaling a stronger summer travel season than anticipated and causing its shares to jump by 11%. CEO Ed Bastian confirmed that while bookings have stabilized after an earlier dip, they remain below initial yearly projections. The airline now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $5.25 to $6.25 per share, revising an earlier, more optimistic forecast. The positive outlook is supported by strong sales of premium seats and its lucrative partnership with American Express, indicating resilience in higher-end consumer and corporate travel despite broader economic uncertainties.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced an expansion of the company's robotaxi service area in Austin, Texas, and plans to integrate the Grok AI chatbot into its vehicles. The expansion is set for this weekend, with a potential launch in the San Francisco Bay Area pending regulatory approval in the coming months. The integration of Grok, which has recently faced controversy, comes amid a challenging period for Musk, including a public feud with President Trump and the recent resignation of X CEO Linda Yaccarino. These developments aim to advance Tesla's autonomous driving and in-car technology initiatives.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the interim head of NASA, weeks after withdrawing the nomination of entrepreneur Jared Isaacman. The change in leadership comes after Trump expressed concerns about Isaacman's past political donations to Democrats and his professional relationship with Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX has major NASA contracts. Duffy will temporarily lead the space agency during a critical period focused on returning astronauts to the moon and future missions to Mars. This appointment adds Duffy to a list of Trump administration officials serving in dual roles across different government agencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Swiss law now requires food producers, grocers, and restaurants to disclose if imported animal products were sourced from animals subjected to certain procedures without anesthesia. The law mandates explicit labeling for practices like the castration of pigs, dehorning of cattle, and the force-feeding of ducks for foie gras. While Switzerland already requires pain relief for such procedures domestically, the law aims to provide transparency for imported goods. Animal advocates see the measure as a step toward informing consumers about standard, often cruel, practices in global industrial agriculture, potentially influencing purchasing decisions and industry standards.</p>

          <p>This article explores the cultural phenomenon of grocery stores like Trader Joe's, Wegmans, and H-E-B cultivating fanatical followings, transforming them from utilitarian spaces into powerful brands. Anthropologists and marketing experts suggest this trend reflects a broader shift where consumer behavior has replaced other forms of community and identity signaling. Stores achieve this by catering to specific regional, cultural, or lifestyle identities, making shopping an expression of personal values. The intense loyalty, seen in viral product crazes and long opening-day lines, shows how consumption has become a primary way people build community and define themselves.</p>

Analysts predict this abrupt deadline will trigger a summer rush for consumers to purchase or lease an EV to capitalize on the savings before they disappear. Automakers like Tesla are already urging customers to act quickly. To be eligible, consumers must take possession of the vehicle by the deadline, creating a sense of urgency that dealers will likely leverage with additional incentives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists from the University of Houston have discovered the tomb of Te K'ab Chaak, the founding ruler of the ancient Mayan city of Caracol in Belize. This marks the first time an identifiable ruler's resting place has been found in the city. The tomb, dating to around A.D. 350, was located beneath another royal burial and contained the ruler's remains along with pottery, a jadeite death mask, and other valuable artifacts. The discovery provides crucial insights into the city's early dynastic history and its complex, early connections with the central Mexican city of Teotihuacan.</p>
