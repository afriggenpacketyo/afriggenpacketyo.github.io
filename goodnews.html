Pettersen, who has been vocal about the challenges of being a working mother in Congress, asked Powell about the national debt while Sam sat on her lap. Powell thanked her and acknowledged her son at the end of her questioning. Pettersen is pushing for parental privileges for members of Congress, arguing that "Congress was not made for women."</p>

          <p>Anthropic secured a legal victory in a copyright case, with a judge ruling that its use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.

However, Anthropic will face a separate trial in December regarding its use of millions of pirated books. The ruling stems from a case filed by authors who claimed Anthropic's practices amounted to "large-scale theft."</p>
