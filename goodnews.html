          <p>The Army is investigating an incident where air traffic controllers lost contact with a Black Hawk helicopter near the Pentagon, resulting in two commercial jets aborting their landings. The loss of contact, attributed to a temporary antenna, caused confusion among air traffic controllers who struggled to pinpoint the helicopter's location. This incident adds to concerns about air safety near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, especially after a deadly midair collision earlier in the year. The NTSB was not briefed on the Army's findings and expressed disappointment at the Army for releasing investigative information through a media exclusive rather than providing it directly to them.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Sakana AI K.K., a Japanese AI startup backed by Nvidia, is advocating for the Japanese government to prioritize the development of its own AI technology for defense purposes. With increasing global instability, the company sees an opportunity to collaborate with the government on defense-related solutions. The CEO emphasized that technology plays a crucial role in bolstering IT infrastructure and cybersecurity, and AI is a core part of that. He suggests that Japan should develop its own AI for defense purposes because the United States has become more U.S.-centric.</p>

          <p>Japanese supermarket operators are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to offer consumers an alternative amidst rising domestic rice prices. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a significantly lower price than Japanese-grown rice. Other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen solid demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The decision reflects consumer interest, as they can no longer purchase rice as before due to higher prices, with the average price of rice at Japanese supermarkets reaching a record high.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has approved Nippon Steel Corp.'s plan to acquire United States Steel Corp. Trump stated that the partnership will create at least 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boon to the American economy. The move came after a panel of federal agencies screened the buyout plan in deliberations it began last month at the request of Trump. The potential acquisition by Nippon Steel, the world's fourth-largest producer in the latest tally by the World Steel Association, of the iconic but struggling American steelmaker, the 24th largest, was an issue during last year's U.S. presidential election.</p>

Joel was advised by his doctor to refrain from performing as he undergoes physical therapy. NPH is a brain condition that occurs when fluid builds up inside or around the brain, disrupting certain brain-related functions.</p>

          <p>A cargo ship ran aground in Norway, nearly hitting a cabin while its owner slept. The helmsman of the ship was probably asleep at the time of the accident, Norwegian media reported. The 443-foot NCL Salten sailed up onto shore next to Johan Helberg's wooden cabin around dawn on Thursday. None of the cargo ship's 16 crew members were injured, and Norwegian police have opened an investigation.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner is reportedly in conflict with Sir Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves over proposed budget cuts to her department. The government's child poverty strategy has been postponed until at least the autumn, according to the Guardian's front page. The paper says the move risks making it more likely tens of thousands of children may fall into poverty, adding that the delay is over concerns from Treasury officials about the cost of scrapping the two-child benefit limit.</p>

          <p>Linwood Riddick, a 79-year-old retired shop owner, earned a college degree from South Carolina State University to honor the victims of the 1968 Orangeburg Massacre. Riddick had never heard of the Orangeburg Massacre until a few years ago when he stumbled on a campus memorial. The three killed were Henry Smith, Samuel Hammond Jr. and Delano Middleton. With that, Riddick's mission was complete. And although it started as a symbolic gesture, Conyers says it'll have a very real impact.</p>
