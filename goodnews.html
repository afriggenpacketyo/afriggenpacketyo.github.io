          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has reiterated his support for lowering interest rates but stressed that the central bank must proceed with caution due to conflicting economic signals. He highlighted the current ambiguity, with the U.S. labor market showing signs of weakness while GDP growth remains robust. Waller explained that policymakers need to carefully observe which of these trends will give way before making any aggressive moves. He endorsed the Fed's current projected pace of two more quarter-point cuts by the end of the year but warned against faster reductions to avoid policy mistakes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The first phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan between Israel and Hamas details a 72-hour ceasefire, during which Hamas is expected to release 20 living Israeli hostages. In exchange, approximately 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees will be freed. The agreement also mandates a significant increase in humanitarian aid, with about 600 trucks entering Gaza daily to address famine conditions. A multinational force, overseen by the U.S., is set to monitor the truce, while Israeli forces will reposition to a new line, maintaining control over 53% of the territory as a basis for further negotiations.</p>

          <p>A high-ranking Chinese resources official has publicly advocated for the nation to assume a more proactive and influential role in the development of international rules for deep-sea mining. The official argued that as the country holding the largest number of designated mining areas, China has a strategic interest in guiding the formation of the global regulatory framework. This push is driven by the recognition that the world's seabeds contain vast reserves of critical minerals like cobalt and nickel, which are vital for emerging technologies. The move underscores China's ambition to secure its access to future resources.</p>

          <p>The National Basketball Association is making a significant return to China, its second-largest global market, by hosting two preseason games in Macao. This event represents a major step in mending a relationship that was severely damaged in 2019 by comments supporting Hong Kong protestors, which resulted in a multi-year media blackout. The NBA aims to leverage its vast Chinese fanbase, which includes over 400 million social media followers, to spur future growth as its U.S. television viewership wanes. A renewed partnership with Alibaba further signals the league's deep commitment to this crucial market.</p>

          <p>The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has formally designated Google's search and search advertising services with "strategic market status," thereby activating new regulatory powers. The designation follows a nine-month probe that concluded Google holds "substantial and entrenched market power," controlling over 90% of U.K. searches. This status is not a finding of wrongdoing but enables the CMA to impose measures aimed at fostering competition, such as mandating fairer search rankings. Google has responded with concern, suggesting that such interventions could stifle innovation and slow product launches in the U.K.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru, is set to declare his party's readiness to replace the long-dominant Welsh Labour party and form a new government. He will argue that political change in Wales is now inevitable and present Plaid Cymru as the only credible force capable of stopping the rise of Reform UK. While Plaid Cymru has historically supported Labour governments, recent polling suggests a more competitive political landscape. This strategic shift aims to position the party as a government-in-waiting, appealing to a broader electorate by promising new energy and ideas for Wales.</p>

          <p>A significant change to 401(k) regulations, part of the Secure 2.0 Act, is set to affect how high-income earners make catch-up contributions. Beginning in 2026, individuals who earned more than $145,000 from their employer in the prior year will be required to make all catch-up contributions to a Roth 401(k) on an after-tax basis. This new rule eliminates the option for an upfront tax deduction on these additional savings for this group, although their withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.

The victory highlights a significant divergence between the institute's aggressive defense of constitutional rights and the university's more conciliatory posture, which included settling with the administration over antisemitism claims.

Unaware of its immense historical value, she used the marble tablet as a garden decoration and inadvertently left it behind when she sold her home in 2018.
