          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, following the administration's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. The changes, implemented after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confirmation, included disbanding student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers and removing books addressing diversity from Naval Academy libraries. Former West Point teachers criticized these actions as indoctrination, while Trump defended them as removing "Woke Leftist Ideologues." Two protests were planned during the ceremony, highlighting the controversy surrounding the administration's policies and their impact on military education. The article also notes Trump's previous appearance in 2020, which raised concerns about his health. </p>

The owners also mentioned an interaction with Hudson about playing golf, where she preferred a "men's senior shaft."

One article highlights a mother's unwavering belief in her son's consciousness after a severe brain injury, which science eventually validated. Another explores how individuals with dementia make sense of the world, even when their perception drifts from reality. The collection raises profound questions about awareness, communication, and the ethical considerations of caring for those who cannot express themselves. </p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara is working to implement police reform and improve community relations. Despite a decline in shootings, violent crime remains a challenge, exacerbated by an officer shortage. O'Hara is focused on restoring pride within the department, adjusting arrest tactics, and enhancing community engagement. He noted that reform efforts will continue even without federal oversight, despite the Justice Department ending investigations and canceling consent decrees. A Minneapolis resident praised the changes, noting that police are using less aggressive tactics and engaging more positively with the community. </p>

Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned, utilizing an alternative power supply. The outage caused traffic lights to fail and shops to close, but power was gradually restored throughout the day. </p>

          <p>In Santiago, Chile, autumn brings ideal hiking weather on Cerro San Cristobal, a hill offering stunning views of the city and the Andes Mountains. The trail passes old stone walls and wildflowers, providing shade under peppercorn trees. Despite fog in the valley, the city's towers appear to float on clouds. The summit features a statue of the Virgin Mary, while a side path leads to panoramic views of the city and snow-capped Andes. </p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the 2025 graduating class at West Point, marking his first military commencement address of his second term. This address comes amid the administration's executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in the military. The U.S. Military Academy has disbanded cadet clubs formed around race and gender in compliance with the order. The president vowed to eliminate "woke" military generals and reinstate a merit-based system. </p>

          <p>Violent crime rates in the US have experienced a significant drop, returning to pre-pandemic levels. The FBI's 2023 crime report showed a nearly 12% decrease in murders, and early data for 2025 indicates further declines. Analysts suggest this year could have the lowest murder rate in US history. Factors contributing to the decrease include the waning pandemic, government initiatives, and community violence intervention programs. However, public perception lags behind reality, with many Americans still believing crime is on the rise. </p>

          <p>ValueAct Capital has acquired a significant stake in Rocket Companies, a financial technology firm known for its technology-driven approach to mortgage processing. Despite Rocket's competitive advantages, its share price has underperformed due to a small float, controlled ownership, and complex share class structure. ValueAct's investment is expected to help unlock value through increased float, a simpler capital structure, and leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance operational efficiency. ValueAct's expertise in corporate governance and AI could drive substantial improvements in Rocket's market position. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control. This move has been supported by Trump ally Bill Ackman, who has a significant investment in the companies. However, critics warn it could be risky and disrupt the mortgage market. The government created Fannie and Freddie to facilitate homeownership, but they were placed under federal conservatorship after the 2008 financial crisis. Opponents fear privatization could raise mortgage rates. (not investment advice) </p>
