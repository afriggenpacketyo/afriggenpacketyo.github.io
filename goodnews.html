          <h2>Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers Announces He Will Not Seek a Third Term in 2026</h2>

          <p>Wisconsin's Democratic Governor, Tony Evers, has announced he will not run for a third term, setting up the state's first open gubernatorial race in 16 years. Citing a desire to spend more time with his family after five decades in public service, the 73-year-old's decision opens a major political battle in the key swing state. His tenure was marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he utilized his veto power extensively, but also saw bipartisan success on issues like tax cuts and funding. The announcement is expected to trigger a crowded field of candidates from both parties for the 2026 election.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 14:52:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has extended a temporary pause on a lower court's ruling that would limit who can sue under the Voting Rights Act. The case originated from a challenge by two North Dakota tribal nations against a redistricting map they argued diluted Native American voting power. An 8th Circuit Court of Appeals panel had ruled that only the U.S. Justice Department, not private individuals or groups, could bring such lawsuits, a decision that would significantly weaken the landmark civil rights law in seven states. The Supreme Court's hold allows the current, more favorable map to be used in 2026 while it decides whether to take up a full review of the case.</p>

          <p>Industrial manufacturer Dover saw its shares fall despite reporting second-quarter results that surpassed expectations and raising its full-year financial outlook. The company's revenue increased by 5% to $2.05 billion, with adjusted earnings per share at $2.44, beating consensus estimates. This article suggests investors are overlooking positive signs, including record profitability margins, accelerating order bookings, and strategic investments in high-growth areas like data center cooling and biopharma. The analysis concludes that the market's negative reaction is a misjudgment and presents a buying opportunity for the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Clarifies Stance on Government Subsidies for Elon Musk's Companies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly stated he does not intend to "destroy" Elon Musk's companies by revoking their government subsidies, seeking to quell speculation amid their ongoing public feud. In a post on Truth Social, Trump expressed his desire for all U.S. businesses, including Musk's, to "THRIVE like never before." This statement comes after a period of tension where Trump had previously threatened to cut government contracts for companies like SpaceX and after Musk's companies, including Tesla, noted the potential negative financial impact of losing federal support and incentives. The White House had also recently suggested it didn't want agencies working with Musk's xAI startup.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England has taken a commanding position in the fourth Test against India, driven by a stellar all-around performance from Ben Stokes and an aggressive opening batting partnership. Stokes secured his first five-wicket haul in eight years, helping to restrict India to a total of 358, despite a courageous half-century from the injured Rishabh Pant. In response, England's openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett scored rapidly, putting on a 166-run stand that significantly reduced the deficit. At the close of day two, England stood at 225-2, well-placed to build a substantial lead and potentially win the series.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is firmly focused on the upcoming season, stating he has "moved on" from the team's Super Bowl LIX victory five months ago. Despite acknowledging the surreal feeling of receiving his championship ring, Hurts emphasized that he is not dwelling on past accomplishments and is treating the new season as a "blank canvas." This forward-looking mindset is shared by his teammates and coaching staff, who are discouraging the "defending champions" label. Hurts noted that he even received advice from Michael Jordan, who stressed the importance of resetting and pursuing the next championship with fresh intensity.</p>

          <p>The demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills is surging as more companies integrate AI into their operations, according to a report from the Brookings Institution. Over the past year, job postings mentioning AI have more than doubled, growing at an average annual rate of 29% over the last 15 years. While these roles still represent a small portion of the overall labor market, they are becoming more common in fields beyond tech, including marketing and finance, and typically offer a significant salary premium. This growth is concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley but is also spreading to other regions as AI adoption accelerates.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Potential Earnings of a 6-Month CD Versus a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 14:06:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes whether a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account is a better option for parking $25,000 in the current economic climate. Based on current rates, a CD at 4.45% would earn slightly more over six months than a savings account at 4.30%, with the added benefit of a guaranteed, fixed return. The key difference lies in flexibility versus certainty; the savings account allows penalty-free access to funds, while the CD locks in the rate, protecting against potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The decision ultimately depends on an individual's need for liquidity versus their desire to secure today's high rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reversed its decision to eliminate paper checks for beneficiaries, confirming it will continue the option for those who need it. The agency had previously announced it would transition to all-electronic payments after September 30, but it backed down following concerns raised by lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren. About 600,000 beneficiaries, many of whom are elderly or lack traditional bank accounts, still receive paper checks. While the SSA will continue to promote the security and cost-saving benefits of electronic deposits, it has committed that no one will be left behind and that paper checks will remain available.</p>

          <p>Erik and Karin Vonk have turned a retirement hobby into Richland Rum, a celebrated craft distillery in rural Georgia that has become a leader in the "rum renaissance." What sets their distillery apart is their use of fresh sugarcane juice from their own 70-acre farm, a practice used by less than 5% of rum makers globally. This "field-to-glass" approach, rooted in Erik's childhood memories of his grandfather's teachings, results in a premium product that has gained critical acclaim. The business has thrived following changes in Georgia law that allowed direct-to-consumer sales, turning their passion project into a successful and growing enterprise.</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters jumped significantly on Thursday, positioning it as the latest company to be swept up in a meme stock rally. The surge appears to be driven by retail investors on forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets, who target stocks with high short interest. The rally was also fueled by the announcement of a new marketing campaign featuring "Anyone But You" star Sydney Sweeney. With over 13% of its available shares sold short, the stock became an attractive candidate for a short squeeze, providing a reprieve for the company's stock, which had fallen about 35% year-to-date.

          <p>Despite massive offseason spending that led to predictions of domination, the Los Angeles Dodgers are approaching the MLB trade deadline with notable flaws to address. While the team still holds a top record in the National League, injuries to the pitching staff and underperformance from key players have tempered expectations. The front office's primary focus is expected to be acquiring a high-leverage bullpen arm to fix what has been an undeniable weakness. Beyond that, the team must decide whether to make other significant moves or trust that their highly-paid, veteran roster will find its form for the postseason push.</p>
