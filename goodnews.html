          <p>Former England bowler Stuart Broad has assessed Australia's Ashes team as their weakest since 2010, the last time England triumphed down under. This commentary directly challenges ex-Australia batter David Warner's prediction of a 4-0 series victory for Australia. Broad points to significant uncertainties within the Australian squad, notably the potential absence of captain Pat Cummins due to injury, and a less experienced bowling attack. He contrasts this with what he believes is England's strongest team in over a decade, suggesting a prime opportunity for Ben Stokes' side to reclaim the urn. The article emphasizes that while winning in Australia is inherently difficult, current circumstances align favorably for England, setting the stage for a compelling series.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major real estate developers are rapidly transforming into power brokers, driven by the surging demand for data, which is creating new commercial real estate sectors like "quantum real estate" and "powered land." Powered land refers to sites prepared with permits, utility commitments, and infrastructure for data centers, with an estimated 40,000 acres needed globally in the next five years. Companies like Hines are pivoting to secure power and entitlements for hyperscale sites, recognizing power rights as a scarce and valuable investable asset class. This shift highlights that the challenge is no longer just building structures but securing megawatts, making AI infrastructure the "new oil" and reshaping the real estate business for decades to come.</p>

          <p>Stellantis is overhauling its Jeep Grand Wagoneer lineup for the 2026 model year as part of a multi-year turnaround strategy for the SUV brand. The changes include updated styling, a forthcoming extended-range electric powertrain (EREV), and a simplified, less expensive model lineup under the single "Grand Wagoneer" name, eliminating the standalone "Wagoneer." This move addresses past issues like confusing dual nameplates and high initial pricing that hindered sales expectations. Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf stated the new Grand Wagoneer will start under $65,000, aiming to gain market share and drive the brand's first year-over-year sales gain since 2018.</p>

          <p>Darts prodigy Beau Greaves, 21, nicknamed 'Beau 'n 'Arrow,' made history by becoming the first woman to reach the World Youth Championship final after defeating PDC world champion Luke Littler. This victory, achieved in a thrilling decider, highlights Greaves' outstanding talent, having previously won 58 matches in a row and nine successive events in the PDC Women's Series. Despite her past skepticism about women competing against top men, this article notes that Greaves' performance, including a high average against Littler, positions her for bigger stages like the Grand Slam and PDC World Championship. Her success signals a significant moment for women in professional darts.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts the UK will be the second-fastest growing G7 economy this year, with modest growth rates of 1.3% for both this year and next, surpassing most other G7 nations except the US in 2025. This slight upgrade from previous forecasts is attributed to strong activity in early 2025 and an improved trade outlook, partly due to a new US-UK trade deal. However, the article also notes the IMF forecasts UK inflation to be the highest in the G7 in 2025 and 2026, driven by energy and utility bills, though it expects inflation to be temporary and fall to 2% by the end of next year. The global outlook is dominated by US tariffs, a weakened dollar, and potential risks from an AI tech boom, which could rival the dot-com crash in severity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study reveals a stark disconnect between Gen Z's top values—self-care, authentic self-expression, and helping people—and what hiring managers seek: achievement, learning, and hard work. Only 2% of Gen Z align with their bosses' priorities, leading to frustration for both employers and young job seekers, especially with AI threatening entry-level jobs. Suzy Welch, an NYU Stern professor, advises Gen Z to be honest about their financial needs to make sustainable career choices. While not advocating for changing core values, she suggests that if landing a job is urgent and affluence is a long-range goal, Gen Z might consider embracing "Boomer values" like delayed gratification and work-centrism for a committed period, like a decade.</p>

          <p>As Disney approaches the announcement of Bob Iger's successor, a co-CEO structure is being considered, potentially featuring internal candidates Dana Walden and Josh D'Amaro. While rival Netflix has successfully implemented this model, company insiders and corporate governance experts warn it may be unwise for Disney due to its unique circumstances. Concerns include Iger's reputation for wanting to remain the top leader, the company's past struggles with blurred control during Bob Chapek's tenure, and Disney's famously political corporate culture. The article suggests that despite the appeal of retaining top talent, a dual leadership setup could foster instability and backbiting rather than a unified vision.</p>

Obama argues that Proposition 50 will level the electoral playing field and preserve independent redistricting.
