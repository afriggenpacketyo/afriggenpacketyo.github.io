        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vinted, the popular online marketplace for secondhand clothing, originated from a simple problem faced by its co-founder, Milda Mitkutė: too many clothes in a small apartment. In 2008, she and a friend, Justas Janauskas, quickly developed a website to sell her unwanted items, which rapidly gained popularity through word of mouth. Despite early challenges, including a disastrous attempt to add commission fees, the platform expanded internationally and became Lithuania's first "unicorn" startup. The company, now profitable with over 16 million UK users, is a key player in the growing sustainable fashion movement.</p>

Sheila Chepkirui won the women's elite race, while Alex Mutiso secured victory in the men's competition.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the UN General Assembly prepares to discuss the issue, the number of countries recognizing Palestinian statehood has grown to 147, with several European nations recently shifting their positions. While most of the world acknowledges Palestine, key powers like the U.S. have historically blocked full UN membership, using their veto power in the Security Council. However, the ongoing conflict in Gaza has prompted countries like Ireland, Norway, Spain, and France to either grant or announce their intention to grant recognition, signaling a potential change in Western consensus. This diplomatic momentum continues despite strong opposition from Israel.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Powerball Data Reveals Best and Worst States for Lottery Winners After Taxes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 07:19:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of a recent record-breaking drawing, an analysis of Powerball data highlights how a winner's location significantly impacts their take-home prize. Due to varying state tax laws, a jackpot winner in a state with no lottery tax, such as Florida or Texas, would receive a substantially larger payout than a winner in a high-tax state like New York. Federal law requires a 24% withholding on winnings over $5,000, with more due at tax time, but state taxes can further reduce the final amount. The article provides a breakdown of after-tax payouts, showing the stark financial differences for winners across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest in U.S. lottery history, was won by two tickets sold in Missouri and Texas. The winning numbers drawn on Saturday night were 11, 23, 44, 61, 62, with a Powerball of 17. The massive prize accumulated after 42 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner, setting a new record for the longest run. The winners will have the choice between an annuity paid over 29 years or a lump-sum cash payment estimated at $826.4 million before taxes.</p>

          <p>England cricketer Jacob Bethell has admitted he feels he should have played more during a challenging first home summer in international cricket. The 21-year-old all-rounder, who made a strong impression in his debut Test series last winter, found himself in a limited role this season. After missing a Test against Zimbabwe due to his Indian Premier League commitments, he lost his place in the Test XI and was a spare batter for four matches against India. Bethell acknowledged the lack of match time but stated he will learn from the experience for his future career.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of federal student loan borrowers are using deferment and forbearance options to pause their monthly payments, with over a quarter of all borrowers currently in one of these statuses. While these tools can be crucial for avoiding default, they come with significant differences and potential costs. Deferment may prevent interest from accruing on subsidized loans, making it a preferable first option for those who qualify based on economic hardship or unemployment. Forbearance is more widely available but typically allows interest to accumulate, which can substantially increase a borrower's total debt over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects over half of Americans by age 40 and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. Known as a "silent killer" because it often has no symptoms, new American Heart Association guidelines recommend early treatment once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg. The recommendations stress lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, exercise, and stress reduction, with medication advised if these are insufficient. Experts emphasize that early intervention can add years of healthy life by preventing severe damage to the heart, kidneys, and brain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As surveillance technology like drones, camera traps, and bioacoustic sensors becomes ubiquitous, it is eroding the ability of animals to remain unseen, prompting philosophical questions about their right to privacy. While some species seem unbothered, others exhibit stress or avoidance behaviors when monitored, suggesting an interest in seclusion. Philosophers argue that just as humans present different selves in different contexts, many animals also engage in private behaviors, such as clandestine mating, that are now subject to human observation. This constant monitoring, especially of pets in our homes, challenges our understanding of animal welfare and may require a new ethical framework.</p>

          <p>In honor of National Grandparents Day, NPR collected advice from seasoned grandparents for those new to the role. Key themes included embracing a supporting role, being present, and not interfering with the parents' choices, even if they differ from one's own methods. Many shared that becoming a grandparent offered a "second chance" at parenting with less stress and more joy, allowing them to simply love and support the new generation. Practical tips included keeping backup supplies like diapers and snacks at their house and cherishing the unique, less-structured love that defines the grandparent-grandchild relationship.</p>

          <p>With gold prices hitting record highs above $3,600 an ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way for most people to gain exposure to gold is through low-cost, liquid exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the physical price. Owning physical gold coins or bars is generally considered less efficient due to higher transaction and storage costs. Despite the current rally, financial advisors typically recommend limiting gold allocation to a small portion, under 3%, of a well-diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

This year, world number one Sinner defended his Australian Open title, while Alcaraz defeated him at the French Open before Sinner took revenge at Wimbledon.

          <p>Observations from four major telescopes, including the Hubble and James Webb, have confirmed that the third known interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, is highly unusual. While believed to be a comet, data reveals it has the highest carbon dioxide-to-water ratio ever observed in such an object. It also became active much farther from the sun than typical comets and displays a teardrop-shaped dust cocoon instead of a distinct tail. These strange characteristics are providing scientists with a wealth of new data on objects formed outside our solar system, though its exact origins and composition remain a deep mystery.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has invalidated the state's congressional map, ruling that the Republican-controlled legislature unconstitutionally overrode the will of the voters. In 2018, Utah citizens approved a proposition to create an independent redistricting commission, but lawmakers subsequently ignored its work and passed their own heavily gerrymandered map. The court order requires the legislature to draw a new, fairer map, representing a significant victory for voting rights advocates. The ruling pushes back against a growing trend of legislatures ignoring voter-led initiatives and could create a more competitive political landscape in the reliably Republican state.</p>
