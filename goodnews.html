          <p>Costco announced stronger-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results, with both revenue and adjusted earnings per share surpassing Wall Street estimates. The company's revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $86.16 billion, driven by improved gross margins from supply chain enhancements and robust membership fee income. While comparable sales saw a slight deceleration and membership renewal rates dipped slightly, overall performance was solid despite a volatile retail environment. The company plans to accelerate its warehouse expansion in the upcoming fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Paccar, the parent company of truck manufacturers Peterbilt and Kenworth, experienced a significant jump after President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks. The president stated the measure is intended to protect American truck companies from foreign competition and market interruptions. Analysts noted that Paccar, which manufactures most of its trucks domestically, could gain a competitive advantage as the tariffs may address the price disparity with competitors producing in countries like Mexico. The new tariff is scheduled to take effect on October 1. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has suspended its recently announced unilateral export controls on certain semiconductor products to South Africa. The curbs, which would have required prior approval for shipping 47 different products including memory chips, were a response to a dispute over South Africa's demand to rename Taiwan's representative office. Following Pretoria's agreement to suspend its demand and engage in further discussions, Taipei has decided to backtrack on the planned restrictions. This move indicates a temporary de-escalation in the diplomatic tussle between the two governments.</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, has revealed plans to introduce a digital ID system that will be mandatory for anyone wishing to work in the country. The app-based system, stored on smartphones, is designed to curb illegal immigration by making it harder for individuals without legal status to find employment. While compulsory for work, the digital ID will be optional for non-workers like students and pensioners and will not be required for accessing healthcare or welfare. The proposal has drawn criticism from opposition parties over its potential effectiveness and impact on citizens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hiring a financial advisor requires understanding their payment structure, which typically falls into commission-based or fee-based models. Commission-based advisors earn money by selling specific financial products, which can create potential conflicts of interest. Fee-based models include charges based on assets under management (AUM), flat annual fees, or hourly rates, which can offer more transparent and aligned incentives. Experts emphasize that consumers should ask direct questions about how an advisor is paid to understand the services included and protect their financial returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The terrorism charge against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap, has been dismissed by a London court due to a technical error. Ó hAnnaidh, who performs as Mo Chara, was accused of displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a concert, a charge he denied as politically motivated. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was unlawful because it was not brought within the required six-month time limit, rendering the proceedings null. Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence advocacy for Gaza.</p>

          <h2>Family Offices Favor Public Stocks Over Startups for AI Investments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 07:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite high-profile venture capital deals, a Goldman Sachs survey reveals that most family offices, the investment firms of the ultra-wealthy, prefer investing in the artificial intelligence boom through public equities and ETFs. The poll found that 52% of family offices gain AI exposure through public stocks, compared to only 25% investing directly in AI startups. This preference is attributed to more reasonable valuations in public markets and the significant presence of AI-driven companies within major indices like the S&P 500. The trend indicates a more cautious, value-oriented approach to AI investing among this wealthy demographic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains the structure and significance of the EuroLeague, widely regarded as the world's second-best professional basketball league after the NBA. Established in 2000 by a group of top European clubs seeking more control, the league features a mix of permanent member clubs and wildcard entries, including a new team from Dubai. The style of play is described as more tactical and team-oriented than the NBA, with every game holding significant weight in the standings. While many players transition between the two leagues, the EuroLeague's distinct rules and intensity present unique challenges for athletes.</p>

The firm is acquiring approximately 1,000 Claire's stores in a $140 million deal, aiming to transform what it calls a "broken business, not a broken brand." The revival plan focuses on modernizing merchandising, improving employee pay and training, and launching fresh marketing campaigns that play on nostalgia. Ames Watson, which successfully turned around hat retailer Lids, intends to preserve the core identity of Claire's while updating its operations for profitability.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Faith in Housing Act, has been introduced in the U.S. Congress to override restrictive local zoning laws that prevent religious institutions from building affordable housing on their land. This "Yes in God's Backyard" (YIGBY) movement aims to address the housing crisis by utilizing the vast amounts of property owned by churches, synagogues, and mosques. The bill would require that new housing primarily serves low-income families and is open to all regardless of religious belief. This federal effort follows similar initiatives at the state level, which have faced pushback from local governments concerned about losing zoning authority.</p>

          <p>As autumn approaches, health officials are cautioning the public about a potential seasonal surge in both flu and COVID-19 cases. Distinguishing between the two can be difficult as they share many symptoms, but flu often presents more suddenly with fever and body aches. COVID-19 symptoms have evolved, now frequently resembling a cold, with a hoarse throat being a common feature of new variants. Vaccination remains the most effective defense against severe illness from both viruses, and eligible individuals, particularly vulnerable groups, are being urged to get their seasonal shots to reduce the strain on healthcare systems.</p>
