          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Current forecasts predict the storm will remain over open waters, tracking north of the Caribbean and away from major landmasses for several days. However, meteorologists anticipate it could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it moves westward. While no immediate land hazards have been issued, the system could potentially approach Bermuda next week as it continues to strengthen.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a strategic defense pact, significantly deepening their long-standing security relationship. The agreement stipulates that an attack on either nation will be considered an act of aggression against both, establishing a framework for joint deterrence. This move comes amid growing regional instability and concerns among Gulf states about the reliability of traditional security guarantees. The pact was finalized during a state visit by Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Saudi Arabia, where he met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record high, driven by gains in technology and real estate stocks, while other Asian markets showed mixed results. The rally followed the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate, a move Chairman Jerome Powell described as a "risk management cut." The Fed's announcement, which also signaled the possibility of two more cuts this year, provided a boost to investor confidence in the region. Chip-related stocks also saw gains following reports of new U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, analysts anticipate that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will adopt a cautious approach, implementing only moderate easing measures for the remainder of the year. This strategy is expected to narrow the interest rate gap between the two countries, which could help ease capital outflow pressures and provide support for the yuan. The PBOC's daily fixing rate for the yuan was set slightly weaker after the Fed's announcement, but the offshore yuan strengthened, reflecting market expectations of a restrained policy response from Beijing.

Lynn, who served as UCLA's defensive coordinator in 2023 before moving to USC, emphasized that his current focus is entirely on improving the Trojans' defense for their upcoming game. Despite acknowledging his long-term ambition to become a head coach, he stressed the importance of concentrating on his immediate responsibilities.

          <p>Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo spacecraft is cleared to rendezvous with the International Space Station after a delay caused by two premature engine shutdowns. NASA confirmed the issue was traced to overly conservative software safeguards, and the spacecraft is now scheduled to arrive Thursday morning. The Cygnus XL, carrying over 11,000 pounds of supplies and equipment, will be captured by the station's robotic arm. This mission marks the maiden flight of the larger XL version of the Cygnus vehicle, designed to deliver more cargo per launch.</p>

          <p>This article explores how music served as a crucial element in defining the atmosphere and message of various shows during New York Fashion Week's spring/summer 2026 season. Designers used carefully curated soundtracks to evoke specific emotions, from nostalgia and arousal to disorientation, thereby shaping the audience's perception of their collections. Examples include Campillo's use of a whispered poem as a mantra, Eckhaus Latta's Nuyorican-inspired beats, and Collina Strada's disorienting audio collage culminating in an operatic version of Smash Mouth's "All Star." The music provided essential context, transforming the runway into an immersive sensory experience.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages per day by eating naturally fermented fruit. Scientists measured the alcohol content of figs and plum-like fruits in the chimps' diet, finding it averaged around 0.3% by weight. While not enough to cause intoxication, the steady, low-dose exposure supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-eating habits of our primate ancestors who associated the scent of ethanol with ripe, calorie-rich food.</p>

The recommendation comes as the government prepares to announce reforms to the Send system, which has been criticized as financially unsustainable despite a rising number of children requiring legally binding support plans.</p>
