          <p>State health officials in Texas have officially declared the end of a measles outbreak that infected 762 people, the largest in the state in over three decades. The outbreak, which resulted in two deaths and nearly 100 hospitalizations, was contained after 42 days with no new cases. Despite this success, experts warn that declining vaccination rates and a record number of non-medical exemptions for schoolchildren leave communities vulnerable to future resurgences of preventable diseases.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether age limits exist for buying annuities, a popular retirement planning tool. While there are no federal laws setting a maximum age, individual insurance companies often impose their own limits, typically between 80 and 85, based on risk assessment. The piece advises that the best time to purchase an annuity depends on individual retirement strategy rather than a specific age, balancing factors like payout rates, product availability, and long-term financial goals.

          <p>Shares of Meta Platforms declined following a report that the company is planning another restructuring of its artificial intelligence team, raising concerns about its strategy despite heavy investment in AI talent. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly's stock remained stable after its competitor, Novo Nordisk, reduced the cash price of its diabetes drug Ozempic. The market's muted reaction is attributed to the fact that the price cut affects the less critical cash-pay market for diabetes, as opposed to the more competitive and lucrative market for weight-loss drugs.

          <p>In a recent interview, "Saturday Night Live" cast member Bowen Yang reflects on his journey to the show, which fulfilled a high school superlative he once considered incidental. He discusses how pop culture served as a vital tool for assimilation after moving from French Canada to Colorado and how his initial pre-med studies were inspired by a TV show character. Yang, now an Emmy nominee, also shares insights from his podcast "Las Culturistas" and the value of starting as a writer at SNL to understand the show's mechanics.</p>

According to the Kiel Institute, the U.S. has committed $130.6 billion, making it the largest single-country donor. However, when combined, European nations have contributed more, totaling $165.7 billion. The report also clarifies that aid from both the U.S. and Europe has consisted of a mix of grants and loans, countering claims that only European contributions are structured as repayable loans.</p>

The data shows that English top-flight spending dwarfs that of other major European leagues combined, with a net spend exceeding £1 billion. This trend of high investment continues to be driven by large fees for players from foreign leagues, with several clubs breaking their own transfer records this summer. (not investment advice)</p>
