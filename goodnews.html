        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sector is being reshaped by a fierce rivalry in 'instant commerce,' where platforms like Alibaba's Taobao Shangou and Meituan offer rapid delivery of goods, from meals to iPhones, often in under 30 minutes. This competition has led to significant consumer subsidies, with some items costing mere pennies as companies vie for market dominance. The battle is pushing the boundaries of on-demand services beyond food, transforming consumer expectations and logistics across the country. This evolution signifies a major shift in both online and brick-and-mortar retail strategies in the world's second-largest economy.</p>

          <p>Boxers Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence “Bud” Crawford are set for a legacy-defining super middleweight championship fight in Las Vegas. Crawford, moving up two weight classes, surprised observers by weighing in at 167.5 pounds, matching the champion Álvarez and appearing in exceptional physical condition. The bout pits Álvarez's power and experience at higher weights against Crawford's undefeated record, speed, and technical skill. This event, held during Mexican Independence Day weekend, is highly anticipated, with Crawford aiming to become the first male boxer to be an undisputed champion in three different divisions.</p>

          <p>As autumn approaches, stargazers can look forward to several notable celestial events in the Northern Hemisphere. The season begins with the autumnal equinox on September 22, leading to longer nights ideal for observation. Key events include Saturn reaching its closest point to Earth on September 21, making it appear at its brightest and largest, easily visible to the naked eye. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will peak around October 22 under ideal viewing conditions due to a new moon, promising a display of fast-moving meteors with long trails of light.</p>

          <p>Three elderly nuns in Austria, aged 82 to 88, have defiantly returned to their former convent after being moved to a care home against their will. The nuns, who are the last remaining members of the Kloster Goldenstein convent, said they were unhappy and homesick in the facility where they were placed after their community was dissolved. With assistance from former students and a locksmith, they regained access to their old apartments within the historic building. Church authorities have called the move "incomprehensible," citing the nuns' health, but the women are determined to live out their days in their lifelong home.</p>

          <p>Gustavo Dudamel has officially started his role as the music and artistic director designate of the New York Philharmonic, opening the orchestra's new season. His inaugural concert featured works with deep ties to New York City, including Bartók’s Piano Concerto No. 3 and Charles Ives’ Symphony No. 2, famously premiered by the orchestra under Leonard Bernstein. The performance also included a world premiere by Leilehua Lanzilotti, reflecting Dudamel's tradition of commissioning new music. His arrival has generated significant excitement, with hopes that his celebrity and artistic vision can reinvigorate the orchestra's prominence, much like Bernstein did decades ago.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sequel to the iconic 1984 rock-mockumentary, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," reunites the original cast for one last concert, but struggles to recapture the magic of its predecessor. While seeing the clueless band members—Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls—reunite provides some nostalgic smiles, the film's premise is weakened by the band's now-revered status. Cameos from real-life music legends like Paul McCartney and Elton John sap the satirical tension that made the original a classic. The review suggests that while the film is an agreeable but undercooked nostalgia lap, it ultimately feels more like a collection of outtakes than a fresh comedic take.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 79, a significant piece of legislation designed to address the state's housing crisis by allowing for denser housing development near public transit. The bill, which now heads to the governor's desk, overrides local zoning laws to permit multi-story buildings near bus and train stations, even in single-family neighborhoods. Proponents argue this is a necessary step to create more housing in existing communities, while critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, claim it is a one-size-fits-all mandate that strips local control. The bill gained crucial support after amendments were added to include union hiring requirements for certain projects.</p>

The discussion reportedly covered monetary policy and structural reforms at the central bank. Rieder joins a list of candidates that includes former Fed governors and economists, though his background in asset management rather than academic economics would represent a departure from tradition, similar to Powell.
