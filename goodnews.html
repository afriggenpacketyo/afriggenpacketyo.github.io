        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the importance of UK saltmarshes as vital "sinks" that store climate-warming greenhouse gases. The report calls for these muddy, tidal habitats to be included in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. Working with researchers, WWF installed greenhouse gas monitoring stations on a restored saltmarsh in North-West England, revealing that the plants absorb more carbon dioxide in the summer than they release in the winter. The UK has lost about 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860, but there is growing recognition of their role in protecting homes from coastal flooding. </p>
