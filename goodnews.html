          <p>Football legend Wayne Rooney has called for more comprehensive anti-racism education and stricter penalties for clubs whose fans engage in racist behavior. Recalling a distressing incident where a player at DC United, the MLS club he managed, was racially abused to the point of tears, Rooney emphasized the profound emotional impact of such actions. His comments follow a recent incident where a Bournemouth player was racially abused during a Premier League match. Rooney suggests that sanctions like points deductions or financial penalties against clubs are necessary to force a change in fan behavior and eradicate racism from the sport.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur's club captain, Cristian Romero, has signed a new four-year contract, committing his future to the North London club until 2029. The 27-year-old Argentine center-back has been a pivotal player since joining from Atalanta in 2021, making 126 appearances and recently captaining the team to a Europa League victory. After being linked with a potential move to Atletico Madrid during the summer, this new deal solidifies his leadership role under new head coach Thomas Frank. The extension follows a similar long-term contract signed by right-back Djed Spence, signaling stability in the club's defensive lineup.</p>

          <p>A superintendent in a low-income Pennsylvania school district is leveraging technology to make music education more accessible. By using over 30 3D printers, the district produces violins for just $50 each, a fraction of the typical rental cost, and provides them to students for free. The initiative was inspired by a video of the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra playing plastic instruments and has enabled the district to create over 200 violins in five years. The program has been met with enthusiasm from students, who report feeling more confident and empowered through their participation in a weekly 3D violin club.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) remaining attractive, experts advise savers to carefully consider their personal financial situation before investing. Key factors include ensuring a sufficient emergency fund exists in a more liquid account and evaluating the likelihood of needing the funds before the CD's maturity to avoid early withdrawal penalties. Experts also suggest comparing CD rates to other low-risk options like high-yield savings accounts and considering interest rate trends, as the Federal Reserve may lower rates soon. A CD laddering strategy, which involves spreading funds across multiple CDs with different terms, is recommended to maintain flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of its earnings report, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike received a short-term negative call from Evercore ISI, citing subdued channel checks and a premium valuation that could lead to a post-earnings stock decline. This type of pullback has been historically common for the stock, often presenting a buying opportunity. Meanwhile, industry peer Palo Alto Networks is set to report its own results, with investors watching for confirmation that its recent acquisition of CyberArk was a strategic move rather than an effort to mask slowing core business growth. The performance of these companies will provide insight into the broader cybersecurity market's health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative media network Newsmax has agreed to a $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, resolving a defamation lawsuit over the airing of false claims about the 2020 presidential election. Court documents revealed that Newsmax personnel knew the conspiracy theories about Dominion's voting machines were baseless but continued to promote them, seeing a business opportunity in catering to viewers who believed the election was stolen. This settlement follows a similar, larger case where Fox News paid Dominion $787.5 million. The resolution was reached before the case could proceed to a jury trial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by mediators from Egypt and Qatar. The comprehensive plan is said to involve a two-stage, 60-day temporary truce during which Hamas would release approximately half of the remaining 50 Israeli hostages. In exchange, negotiations would commence on a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. This development marks a potential breakthrough after previous talks stalled, although there has been no immediate official comment from Israeli officials on the reported agreement.</p>

          <p>New York City's Times Square was reopened to vehicle and pedestrian traffic after a temporary closure on Monday morning. The New York City Police Department had shut down a two-block section of the bustling area to investigate a call about a suspicious device. The closure, which lasted about an hour and a half, brought an unusual calm to the normally crowded tourist and business hub. After a thorough investigation, police determined there was no threat and allowed normal activity to resume, restoring the flow of traffic and people to one of Manhattan's most iconic locations.</p>

          <p>A U.S. special envoy has stated that Israel must now uphold its side of a ceasefire agreement after the Lebanese government took initial steps toward disarming the militant group Hezbollah. The Lebanese cabinet recently endorsed a plan to enforce a state monopoly on weapons by the end of the year, a move praised by the U.S. as a crucial first step. The envoy emphasized that this Lebanese decision requires reciprocal action from Israel, which includes ceasing violations and withdrawing from occupied areas in southern Lebanon.

          <p>Germany's Football Federation (DFB) has launched investigations into two separate incidents of racist abuse that occurred during German Cup matches over the weekend. One match involving Schalke was briefly suspended after a player reported being racially abused by fans, who then booed him for the remainder of the game. In another match, a Kaiserslautern player was insulted by a spectator who was quickly identified and removed. FIFA President Gianni Infantino condemned the incidents and called on the DFB to take appropriate action, reinforcing that there is no place for racism or discrimination in football.</p>

          <p>As Ukrainian President Zelenskyy meets with U.S. leadership, an analysis of international support reveals that while the United States is the largest single-nation donor, the combined aid from European countries has exceeded American contributions. According to the Kiel Institute, Europe as a whole has committed $165.7 billion to Ukraine since the 2022 invasion, compared to the U.S. total of $130.6 billion. The data also clarifies that both the U.S. and Europe have provided a mix of grants and loans, countering claims that European aid consists solely of loans that will be repaid. This context is crucial for discussions about future support for Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <p>In response to mounting pressure to lower medication costs, drugmaker Novo Nordisk announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug, Ozempic, for $499 per month to U.S. patients paying in cash. This price is less than half of the medication's monthly list price of nearly $1,350. The discount will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and the savings company GoodRx. This move aims to expand access for uninsured or underinsured patients and to steer them away from potentially unsafe compounded versions of the drug, which gained popularity during previous shortages.</p>
