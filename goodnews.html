          <p>Ford is recalling more than 103,000 of its F-150 pickup trucks from model years 2023 to 2025 due to a potential rear axle hub bolt failure. This defect could cause a vehicle to lose power or roll away while in park, significantly increasing the risk of a crash. While Ford has stated it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to this issue, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has identified warning signs like clicking or rattling noises. Owners will be notified and can have the rear axle shaft assemblies replaced for free at dealerships.</p>

          <p>A Minnesota woman named Yen Fang successfully transitioned from the corporate world to pursue her dream of opening a bakery, So Yen Desserts, in St. Paul. What began as a pandemic hobby of making Japanese cheesecakes evolved into a thriving business, particularly after she perfected a recipe for cream-filled brioche donuts inspired by a trip to France. After testing the market from her home to overwhelming demand, she took a leap of faith and opened her storefront last year.

          <p>Police in Chino, California, recovered $30,000 worth of stolen Labubu figurines from a home in Upland during a burglary investigation. The furry, monster-like collectibles, which retail for about $30 but can fetch much higher prices, were stolen from a local warehouse. The discovery revealed an operation dedicated to reselling and shipping the popular toys across the country. This incident is not isolated, as the soaring popularity of Labubu, sold by the Chinese-based company Pop Mart, has led to other heists in the region. The recovered figurines have been returned to their owner.</p>

          <p>The AI search startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited bid to acquire Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion, a figure higher than Perplexity's own valuation. The offer comes after a U.S. court ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly in internet search, with the Department of Justice proposing that Google be forced to divest Chrome to remedy the situation. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, stated that several investors have agreed to back the deal. This bold move highlights the aggressive competition in the AI sector and the potential for major shifts in the tech landscape following recent antitrust rulings.</p>

          <p>Wall Street is growing more optimistic about Starbucks' recovery, with analysts at Baird upgrading the company's stock and raising their price target. The increased confidence is attributed to the leadership of CEO Brian Niccol, who is implementing a "Back to Starbucks" plan focused on improving store operations and customer service. Key initiatives, such as the new "Green Apron" service model, are showing early signs of success by increasing the speed of service in test locations. This progress is leading analysts to believe the coffee giant can stabilize sales and improve profitability, justifying a premium valuation for its stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from JLL suggests that quantum computing could become the next major driver of real estate demand, similar to how artificial intelligence fueled a boom in data centers. As quantum technology advances toward commercial viability, a significant need for specialized real estate is expected to emerge within the next five years. These facilities require unique infrastructure, such as electromagnetic shielding, and are currently concentrated near research hubs like Chicago and Boston. The report predicts that a breakthrough around 2030 could trigger billions in investments, creating a new and lucrative sector for real estate development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is set to sign the Sonya Massey Act, a new law requiring more thorough background checks for police officer candidates. The legislation was inspired by the 2024 shooting death of Sonya Massey by a sheriff's deputy who had a documented history of misconduct at previous police jobs. Under the new law, law enforcement agencies must inspect all prior employment records, including performance reviews and fitness-for-duty exams, before making a final hiring decision. This reform aims to prevent officers with problematic histories from being hired by different departments within the state.</p>

          <p>Financial planners are offering advice for retirees who are required to take minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but do not need the money for living expenses. One strategy is to reinvest the funds in a brokerage account, preferably using tax-efficient assets like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Another option for charitably inclined individuals over age 70½ is to make a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct transfer to a nonprofit that satisfies the RMD without increasing taxable income. For those focused on legacy planning, the funds can also be used to contribute to a 529 college savings plan for family members. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, reported a 53% increase in second-quarter revenue in its first earnings report as a public company, driven by strong growth in its stablecoin circulation. Revenue rose to $658.1 million, and the company's stock jumped on the news, continuing a massive rally since its June IPO. CEO Jeremy Allaire attributed the success to growing recognition that blockchains and stablecoins are foundational to the future of the financial system. The positive results come as the crypto industry benefits from a more supportive legislative environment, including the recently passed GENIUS Act for stablecoins. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With ongoing inflation and market volatility, many retirees are considering annuities for a guaranteed income stream, but their safety depends on several factors. The financial strength of the issuing insurance company is paramount, as annuities are not FDIC-insured. While state guarantee associations offer a safety net, coverage is limited. The current high-interest-rate environment can provide a larger safety cushion for insurers, but the biggest long-term threat to an annuity's value is inflation eroding its purchasing power over time. Experts advise carefully selecting the right type of annuity and considering products with inflation protection features. (not investment advice)</p>
