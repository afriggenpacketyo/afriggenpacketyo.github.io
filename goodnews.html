        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has again rejected President Donald Trump's motion to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the men wrongfully convicted in the Central Park Five case. Judge Wendy Beetlestone ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP statute, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The lawsuit stems from statements Trump made during a 2024 presidential debate, where he allegedly and falsely claimed the men had killed someone and pled guilty. The five men were exonerated years ago after serving time in prison for a crime they did not commit.</p>

          <p>Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, a pioneering couple in Maryland's fight for marriage equality, are reflecting on the tenth anniversary of the Supreme Court's nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. Although their 2004 lawsuit was unsuccessful in court, their efforts helped build momentum for the cause, leading to Maryland legalizing same-sex marriage by referendum in 2012. The couple recalls the personal and legal obstacles they faced, from healthcare access to parental rights. They express concern over current efforts to roll back these protections, emphasizing the importance of continued vigilance for LGBTQ rights.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students at Johns Hopkins University has successfully designed and built a specialized printer that adds braille to beer can labels. The project was initiated at the request of Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which needed a device capable of embossing braille onto plastic labels that commercial printers could not handle. The students' invention features open hardware, making it accessible for BISM's blind and low-vision employees to operate. The new printer has already produced 400 labels for a fundraising beer, streamlining a previously manual process.</p>

          <p>Police in Phoenix, Arizona, rescued a baby who had been left alone in an apartment for several days after the infant's mother passed away. Officers were called for a wellness check by a neighbor and, upon seeing the woman unresponsive on the floor, forced entry into the home. They found the baby "visibly emaciated" on a bed and immediately rendered aid. The infant was transported to a hospital for lifesaving care and is expected to make a full recovery, while the cause of the mother's death is under investigation.</p>

          <p>Wall Street concluded a strong week with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new record highs, despite initial fears over U.S. military action in Iran. The market largely dismissed the geopolitical risks, betting that the conflict would not systemically impact the U.S. economy or corporate earnings. A key factor was the rapid decline in oil prices after an initial surge, which eased concerns about inflation and consumer spending. Investors also appear to be pricing in a higher likelihood of multiple Federal Reserve interest rate cuts by the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research on skeletons from the 9,000-year-old city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society where female lineage was paramount. A 12-year study of DNA from over 130 skeletons found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line, indicating men likely moved into their wives' homes after marriage. The findings also revealed preferential treatment for females in burials, with five times more grave goods offered to them than to males. This evidence challenges traditional assumptions about patrilineal structures in ancient societies.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor injuries after likely being bitten by a shark while swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York. The woman did not see what bit her, but experts who examined photos of the lacerations on her leg and foot believe they were caused by a juvenile sand tiger shark. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended, and patrols have been increased. Shark bites on humans are rare, with only 47 confirmed unprovoked cases worldwide last year.</p>

Zuckerberg is said to have compiled a "secret list" of desired talent and has been directly contacting candidates with lucrative compensation offers, some potentially worth up to $100 million. This hands-on effort is part of Meta's high-stakes race for AI dominance, aiming to build a "superintelligence team" to develop advanced AI systems.

Dozens of MEPs and the EU equalities commissioner attended to show solidarity with Hungary's LGBTQ community.
