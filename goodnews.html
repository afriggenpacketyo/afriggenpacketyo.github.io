          <p>European defense company stocks experienced a significant rally following comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who expressed a new, more supportive stance on Ukraine. Trump stated that Ukraine, with European support, is in a position to win back all its territory, causing shares for companies like Sweden's Saab and Germany's Hensoldt to climb. This market reaction highlights the financial sector's sensitivity to geopolitical statements from major world leaders. The gains in the defense sector occurred even as the broader pan-European Stoxx 600 index traded lower. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million lost to fraud over the past year by employing a new artificial intelligence tool. A significant portion of the reclaimed money, £186 million, was linked to fraudulent activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, including illegitimate Bounce Back Loans. The AI tool, which cross-references data across departments to identify suspicious activity, will now be licensed to other countries, including the US and Australia. While ministers have praised the technology's effectiveness, civil liberties groups have raised concerns about potential biases in government AI systems.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described a visit from a bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives delegation as an "ice-breaking journey," marking the first such trip in six years. During the meeting, Wang emphasized that China and the U.S. should be partners, not rivals, and urged Washington to respect its commitments regarding Taiwan. The visit, led by Democrat Adam Smith, is seen as a crucial step in reopening channels of communication between the two global powers. This diplomatic engagement aims to help the U.S. better understand China's positions and find a path for coexistence.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced at the UN General Assembly that China will no longer seek special and differential treatment as a developing country in future World Trade Organization negotiations. This move is intended to demonstrate China's commitment to multilateralism and free trade amid global economic tensions. Li stated that the pursuit of decoupling harms the global economy and that China, as a responsible major country, aims to support an open world economy. The decision comes as the WTO's appellate body remains non-functional due to the U.S. blocking new appointments.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed concerns about a potential AI bubble while defending the company's planned $850 billion infrastructure expansion, which includes a massive data center complex in Texas. He stated the spending is a necessary response to the exponential growth in demand for AI services like ChatGPT, which requires an unprecedented amount of computing power and electricity. Critics have pointed to a potentially circular financing model where partners like Nvidia and Oracle invest in projects and are then paid back through chip sales and leases. Altman acknowledged the risks of overinvestment but expressed confidence in the long-term societal value of the technology.</p>

          <p>Returning to his show after a suspension, Jimmy Kimmel delivered an emotional monologue addressing the controversy over his remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of the murder or to blame any specific group for the actions of a disturbed individual. He criticized threats to free speech as "anti-American" and called out President Trump for celebrating Americans losing their jobs over jokes. The return comes after a significant backlash and a debate over censorship, though some ABC affiliates owned by Sinclair and Nexstar continue to preempt the show.</p>

          <p>Ohio Senator Jon Husted, appointed to his seat in January after it was vacated by Vice President JD Vance, is preparing for a highly competitive 2026 reelection campaign. Democrats have recruited well-known former Senator Sherrod Brown to challenge him, immediately making it one of the nation's most watched races. Husted, who previously served as lieutenant governor, is aligning himself with Donald Trump to appeal to the state's Republican base. The race is seen as a key test of whether Democrats can regain ground with blue-collar voters in a state that has trended significantly Republican in recent presidential elections.</p>

          <p>The northern Chinese city of Datong successfully avoided disaster during heavy summer rains, a success attributed to a major infrastructure project completed over 15 years ago. Former mayor Geng Yanbo led an initiative to widen the city's main river and reinforce its banks, a project that was criticized at the time as wasteful due to the region's typically low rainfall. However, this long-term investment proved crucial in managing nearly 20 hours of upstream flood discharges. Economists suggest that such infrastructure spending not only enhances urban resilience but also serves as an effective short-term economic stimulus for the country.</p>

          <p>Australia's national broadcaster, the ABC, has been ordered to pay A$150,000 in penalties for the unlawful dismissal of presenter Antoinette Lattouf. A federal court found that Lattouf was taken off the air in December 2023 because of her political views after she shared a Human Rights Watch post about the war in Gaza. The judge ruled that the ABC had capitulated to pressure from a pro-Israel lobby group and sacrificed its employee. The substantial penalty is intended to ensure the broadcaster learns from its actions in a case that has sparked national debate over journalistic independence and support for diverse staff.</p>
