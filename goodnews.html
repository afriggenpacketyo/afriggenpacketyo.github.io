          <p>A recent review into abuse by grooming gangs in England and Wales reveals significant flaws in data collection, making it impossible to accurately assess the scale of the issue. The report emphasizes the lack of reliable ethnicity data for perpetrators, hindering the ability to draw national conclusions. Recommendations include a national inquiry into child sexual exploitation, mandatory collection of ethnicity data for suspects, and tightening laws to ensure adults who sexually assault children under 16 are always charged with sexual assault. The report also addresses taxi licensing loopholes that can put children at risk and calls for more rigorous licensing standards.</p>

          <p>Despite escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, financial markets have remained relatively stable, with major U.S. stock benchmarks opening higher and oil prices falling. Traders are betting that the attacks will not escalate into a broader regional conflict that disrupts the global economy. Analysts suggest that the price of oil is the most critical factor for the global economy and stock market. The biggest risk to oil prices would be the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, which could cause prices to spike above $100 a barrel (not investment advice).</p>
