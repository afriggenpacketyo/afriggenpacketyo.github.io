        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, a potential sign of de-escalation. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers earlier in the week, which had been broadcasting anti-Pyongyang messages and K-pop music. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare had recently intensified after North Korea sent trash-filled balloons into the South. While this development signals a slight easing of tensions under South Korea's new liberal president, the upcoming U.S.-South Korea military exercises could easily cause them to flare up again.</p>

          <p>Firefighting crews are making progress on the Canyon fire in Southern California, with containment reaching 28% and all evacuation orders being lifted. The blaze, which has burned over 5,000 acres in Los Angeles and Ventura counties since Thursday, saw minimal overnight activity. However, efforts were hampered by a regional heatwave, with inland areas experiencing triple-digit temperatures. The incident also resulted in a serious injury to a Kern County Fire Department battalion chief, who was airlifted to a hospital after his truck rolled over in the fire zone. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive taste test of eleven popular canned coconut milk brands has identified Simply Asia's product as the least desirable option for consumers. The review focused on texture and the integration of fat and milk, finding that the Simply Asia brand was poorly emulsified, oily, and had an unpleasant, curdled texture. Its flavor was also criticized as tasting rancid from the moment the can was opened. In contrast, higher-ranking brands, such as Target's Good & Gather, were praised for being smooth, creamy, and well-blended, offering consumers a much better experience for a similar price point.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed by scientists and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than Earth itself. The space rock, which left a dent in the floor, is believed to be a fragment from a larger asteroid that broke up in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter around 470 million years ago. This is the 27th meteorite ever recovered in Georgia, and scientists plan to officially name it the McDonough Meteorite.</p>

This marked the first NASA-sponsored crew to land in the Pacific, a change made by SpaceX to ensure any discarded debris falls harmlessly away from populated areas.

          <p>Former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea received a standing ovation and an emotional reception from over 60,000 fans upon his return to Old Trafford for a pre-season friendly. The match, featuring his new club Fiorentina, provided the Spanish keeper with a chance to say a proper goodbye, which he was not afforded after his unceremonious departure in 2023. The event reignited discussions among fans and pundits about the club's decision to replace him. De Gea's return was made more poignant as his replacement, Andre Onana, was absent due to injury.</p>
