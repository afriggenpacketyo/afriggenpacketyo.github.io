          <p>Chelsea's Cole Palmer delivered a stunning performance to secure the FIFA Club World Cup title against Paris Saint-Germain. The 23-year-old attacking midfielder single-handedly dismantled the European champions in the first half, scoring two nearly identical goals with composed, clinical finishes. Palmer then provided a brilliant assist for teammate João Pedro, effectively ending the contest before halftime with a 3-0 lead. This commanding display at the MetLife Stadium has been widely hailed as the moment Palmer launched himself into global superstardom, showcasing his exceptional talent on a major international stage.</p>

          <p>In a prepared address, financial commentator Jim Cramer advises investors to divorce their personal politics from their investment decisions regarding the Trump presidency. He posits that despite widespread personal dislike for Donald Trump, the market has shown resilience, potentially driven by individual investor confidence and a pro-business environment. Cramer suggests that factors like deregulation, a more lenient approach to mergers, and the deflationary impact of AI could outweigh the inflationary pressures of tariffs, creating a bullish environment. The article outlines his view that these elements may lead to continued stock market gains regardless of the president's controversial style. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his retirement match, WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg was defeated by Gunther, who retained the World Heavyweight Championship at Saturday Night's Main Event in Atlanta. The match saw Gunther strategically target Goldberg, even using the legend's own knee brace as a weapon after the referee was knocked down. Despite a late rally where Goldberg executed his signature Spear and Jackhammer, Gunther kicked out of the pin attempt. Gunther ultimately secured the victory by rendering Goldberg unconscious with a sleeper hold, concluding the celebrated wrestler's career with a hard-fought loss.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise album titled "Swag," a 21-track project that returns to his R&B roots and has been described as his most raw and improvisatory work to date. The album comes after a period of personal and professional tumult for the artist, including health issues and a split from his longtime manager. The music on "Swag" is characterized by spacey, cooled-out grooves and a murky, unpolished production style, with some tracks sounding like unfinished demos. Critics note the album's messy yet beautiful quality reflects a period of change in Bieber's life, aligning with the modern pop trend of pursuing idiosyncratic impulses.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans to significantly increase France's defense spending, citing growing global threats. In a speech to the military, Macron stated that annual defense expenditures will rise to €64 billion by 2027, doubling the budget from when he first took office and accelerating the original 2030 target. He argued that "to be free in this world, we must be feared," pointing to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and uncertainty from the United States as key dangers. The move reflects a broader European trend of bolstering military capabilities in response to a more volatile geopolitical landscape.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a 2022 Federal Reserve survey, a household net worth of at least $2 million was required to be in the top 10% of Americans, a figure significantly higher than the median household net worth of $192,900. The article explains that the average net worth is skewed higher by ultra-wealthy individuals, making the top percentile a challenging milestone to reach. Due to stock market gains and inflation since 2022, the current threshold to enter the top 10% is estimated to be closer to $2.2 million. Reaching this level of wealth typically requires a combination of high earnings, diligent saving, and successful investments over time. (not investment advice)</p>

The film is the first major release fully overseen by new DC co-heads James Gunn and Peter Safran, intended to launch a new era for the cinematic universe. While the domestic total was the third-largest of 2025, international sales were softer, with the $225 million film earning $95 million overseas.</p>

          <p>In a central Denver neighborhood, a former 1940s fortune cookie factory has been transformed into a unique, free-to-the-public art gallery. Founder Amanda Precourt purchased the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago and, after an eight-year renovation, opened the Cookie Factory in May. Her mission is to provide a space for community connection and personal healing through art, a practice she found important in her own life. The gallery's inaugural exhibition, "Nothing without nature," features work by artist Sam Falls and will run through September, after which a new artist will be featured.</p>

          <p>A growing number of singles are turning to artificial intelligence-powered dating assistants to help them navigate the challenges of online dating. Apps like Rizz and Keepler use generative AI to help users craft opening lines, suggest replies, and even provide advice on how to handle being "ghosted." According to a recent study, nearly half of Gen Z singles now use AI to improve their dating game, a significant increase from the previous year. While some users find the technology to be a confidence booster and a helpful icebreaker, experts caution against over-reliance, stressing that AI should supplement, not replace, genuine human connection.</p>

The 27-year-old forward has already agreed to personal terms on a five-year contract with the Premier League club.
