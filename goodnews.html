          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs on Chinese products for 90 days, following trade talks in Geneva, a move that sent stocks soaring but also raised questions about the long-term benefits of the trade war. The agreement will lower U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from as high as 145%, while China will reduce its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the shared interest in avoiding a decoupling of the two economies, and officials said they would use the 90-day period to negotiate a more lasting trade deal. American businesses, particularly retailers and manufacturers, expressed relief but remained cautiously optimistic about the future of trade relations. </p>

          <p>The Palestinian Authority has lifted its ban on Al Jazeera in the West Bank, which was imposed in January over accusations of inciting sedition and interfering in internal Palestinian affairs. Attorney General Akram Khatib announced the decision, but did not provide details on what had changed since the ban was implemented. The ban had been criticized by some Palestinians and human rights groups as an authoritarian stifling of dissent. Al Jazeera's bureau chief noted that the broadcaster's offices would not immediately reopen due to a separate closure order by Israeli authorities.</p>

          <p>News of a U.S. agreement with China to temporarily ease tariffs sent stocks soaring, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average leaping over 1,000 points.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new software update prevented a third radar outage at Newark airport when a telecommunications line failed again, according to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Duffy criticized the previous administration for not adequately equipping the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia after earlier hardware issues. Despite the system staying online, controllers stopped all traffic at Newark airport for about 45 minutes as a precaution. Duffy also announced that he would request an investigation into the move of Newark air traffic controllers from New York to Philadelphia, while also laying out an extensive plan to replace the nation's outdated air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>Actor Jon Voight and other Hollywood figures, along with labor unions and major studios, are urging President Trump to expand and extend tax incentives for film and television productions in the United States. In a letter to Trump, the signatories thanked him for supporting the industry and emphasized the need to increase domestic production to bring back American jobs. The letter called for Trump to back three tax provisions in the upcoming budget reconciliation bill, including reviving section 199 of the tax code, expanding section 181, and restoring the section 461 ability to allow companies to carry back their net operating losses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese officials, influencers and state-run media are portraying the initial trade agreement and 90-day tariff pause with the U.S. as a victory and a vindication of Beijing's negotiating strategy. They argue that their defiant public posture worked and was a major reason they were able to strike a deal with U.S. officials in Switzerland with relatively few concessions. In the eyes of the Chinese public, negotiators from Beijing appear to have convinced President Donald Trump's administration to roll back most of the 145% tariff rate that Trump imposed, and slash them to 30%.</p>

          <p>Receipts from U.S. tariffs hit a record level in April as revenue from President Donald Trump's trade war started kicking in. Customs duties totaled $16.3 billion for the month, some 86% above the $8.75 billion collected during March and more than double the $7.1 billion a year ago, the Treasury Department reported Monday. The influx in tariffs helped shave some of the imbalance for April, a month in which the Treasury generally runs a surplus because of the income tax filing deadline hitting mid-month. High interest rates are still posing a budgetary burden.</p>
