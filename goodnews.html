          <h2>Elizabeth Holmes Loses Final Appeal Attempt in Theranos Fraud Case</h2>

          <p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, has lost her bid to have her fraud conviction appeal reheard by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, effectively exhausting her options within the appellate system. Holmes was found guilty in January 2022 of deceiving investors about Theranos' blood-testing capabilities and was subsequently sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison. With this denial, her last recourse is to petition the Supreme Court to hear the case, a move that legal experts view as a long shot given the established precedent and the thoroughness of the initial trial and appeals process.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plans to discontinue tracking the costs associated with billion-dollar disasters, citing evolving priorities and staffing changes. This decision has drawn criticism from researchers and policymakers who rely on this data to understand the patterns and economic impacts of extreme weather events. Experts fear that the absence of this consistent and trusted record will hinder efforts to assess climate risks, allocate resources, and make informed decisions about infrastructure investments. The NOAA will make archived data from 1980 to 2024 available, but future disaster costs will not be tracked.</p>

The move follows Trump's promise of an 'earth-shattering' development and comes despite previous legal challenges that blocked the implementation of a similar proposal.

          <p>President Trump unveiled the framework for a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first such accord with any nation since the White House suspended some of its far-reaching "Liberation Day" tariffs last month. The Trump administration will adjust 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, and will lower auto tariffs from 25% to 10% on the first 100,000 British vehicles sent to the U.S., Trump said. In exchange, the U.K. will ease trade barriers targeting a set of products, including ethanol, beef and machinery, among other products, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said.</p>

          <p>Stocks experienced a rise on Thursday after President Trump announced a new trade agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all saw gains following the announcement. The trade deal will include increased market access for American exports, especially in agriculture, and the U.K. will eliminate non-tariff barriers that 'unfairly discriminated against American products.' A 10% baseline U.S. tax on imports from Britain and other countries will remain in place, but there are specific rates for the first 100,000 vehicles exported to the U.S. from British automakers each year.</p>

          <p>President Trump in the Oval Office with Peter Mandelson, the British ambassador, during the trade deal announcement. A trade deal with the United Kingdom announced by the White House on Thursday marked the first of its kind since President Trump launched sweeping global tariffs last month, offering a glimpse into the Trump administration‚Äôs negotiating strategy as it seeks to reset terms with trading partners around the world. The agreement, hailed by Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer as ‚Äúhistoric,‚Äù kept the U.S. baseline tariff rate on U.K. imports at 10%, while eliminating duties on British aluminum and steel and significantly lowering tariffs on a limited number of U.K. car exports.</p>
