The paperwork for the transfer has been finalized, and all parties are awaiting the completion of Zubimendi's medical examination before making an official announcement. Arsenal has been pursuing Zubimendi for several months and is also looking to strengthen their attack by signing a new center-forward, with Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres among the potential targets. The club is also in discussions to extend the contracts of key players such as Bukayo Saka and William Saliba, along with other squad members and promising young talents. </p>

          <p>The government is reviewing environmental regulations for small housebuilders in England, potentially easing Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) requirements for developments of up to nine homes. These rules currently mandate developers to compensate for any loss of wildlife habitats. The proposed changes aim to reduce costs for smaller firms and simplify the planning system, potentially allowing trained officers, instead of councillors, to approve minor projects. Ministers hope this will help achieve the government's goal of building 1.5 million new homes by 2030, while conservation groups worry about the potential impact on nature conservation efforts. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against President Donald Trump's executive order targeting the law firm WilmerHale, deeming the order unconstitutional. Judge Richard Leon issued a scathing opinion, emphasizing the importance of an independent judiciary and legal profession. The executive order criticized WilmerHale for hiring Robert Mueller, who led the investigation into potential coordination between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. The judge's decision highlights concerns about the use of presidential power to target law firms that have worked against the president's interests. </p>
