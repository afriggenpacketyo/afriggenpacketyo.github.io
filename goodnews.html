          <p>Conservative Karol Nawrocki narrowly won Poland's presidential election against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more populist and nationalist direction under Nawrocki, who was endorsed by President Trump. Prime Minister Donald Tusk's ability to fulfill electoral promises may be hindered due to Duda's veto power, and this win will further impede Tusk's agenda. Nawrocki, a 42-year-old historian, has been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, and his win has been lauded by Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban. </p>

A new company will acquire all outstanding shares of both firms, creating an entity worth around $9 billion with diverse holdings.

Brickworks shareholders will receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share.  (not investment advice)</p>
