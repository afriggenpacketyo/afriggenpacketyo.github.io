          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 14:41:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla plans to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, starting June 22, with initial rides in the Model Y limited to invited guests within a geofenced area. Remote drivers will monitor the vehicles as a backup, and the company will begin with a small number of cars before scaling up. Elon Musk has been promising a driverless taxi service for years, and analysts believe it could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization. Waymo is already operating a commercial robotaxi fleet across the U.S., making Tesla a laggard in the self-driving tech race.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist and student negotiator from Columbia University, who was arrested by ICE agents in New York City in March. The judge denied the government's motion to stay the ruling, asserting that there was no evidence to suggest Khalil's release would cause irreparable harm or that he posed a flight risk. Khalil's attorney argued that his detention was retaliatory punishment for his protected speech and viewpoint. An immigration judge in Louisiana had denied Khalil's request for asylum, but the federal judge's order supersedes that decision.</p>

          <p>Brent oil prices fell more than 2% after President Donald Trump announced he would delay a decision on whether to strike Iran, expressing hope for potential negotiations. Brent crude fell to $76.73 per barrel, while U.S. crude oil saw a slight increase to $75.18 per barrel. Trump's decision provides a two-week window for diplomacy, despite escalating attacks on Iran by Israel. The market reacted to the possibility of reduced conflict in the Middle East, a region critical to global oil supplies. (not investment advice)</p>

Tesla's Shanghai factory has produced over 100 Megapacks in the first quarter of this year, each capable of providing up to 1 megawatt of power for four hours.
