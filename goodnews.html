          <p>Germany is addressing the environmental and health risks posed by unexploded World War II munitions in its coastal waters.  An estimated 1.6 million tons of conventional munitions and thousands of tons of chemical weapons lie on the seabed.  The munitions are corroding, leaking toxic substances, and contaminating marine life.  Germany is developing an autonomous platform to retrieve and dispose of these weapons, aiming to mitigate risks and protect the environment.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have presented evidence suggesting that large language models (LLMs) can spontaneously develop humanlike cognitive abilities.  Their study, published in Nature Machine Intelligence, focuses on the LLMs' capacity to conceptualize and categorize natural objects.  This finding contributes to the ongoing debate about the cognitive potential of AI and suggests that artificial systems capable of reflecting key aspects of human thinking might be achievable.  The research opens new avenues for understanding both human and artificial cognition.</p>
