          <h2>Nvidia's Earnings Highlight China Challenges, Cloud Dominance, and AI's Future</h2>

          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report reveals a complex picture of strong growth tempered by geopolitical challenges. While the company's overall sales surged by 69%, U.S. export controls are hindering Nvidia's access to the lucrative Chinese market, potentially costing billions in lost revenue. Despite these headwinds, Nvidia's data center division continues to thrive, driven by robust demand from cloud providers like Microsoft, Google, Oracle, and Amazon, who are snapping up Nvidia's GPUs for AI applications. Looking ahead, Nvidia is betting big on AI inference, the process of using AI models to serve millions of customers, with its Blackwell chips designed to meet the growing demand for reasoning AI. Optimism surrounds Nvidia's ability to navigate challenges and capitalize on the expanding AI landscape.</p>

          <p>United Airlines and JetBlue have forged a new partnership that will allow frequent fliers to earn and redeem points on both airlines, while also involving a swap of terminal slots at New York-area airports. United will regain access to John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in 2027, acquiring seven takeoff and landing slots, while JetBlue will receive eight slots at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. This marks United's return to JFK since 2022, complementing JetBlue's extensive East Coast network. The airlines will maintain independent management and pricing strategies, and the arrangement is slated to begin rolling out this fall, pending regulatory review.</p>

          <p>After weeks of intense firefighting efforts, three major wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearing full containment, allowing for the lifting of evacuation orders issued on Memorial Day. While crews continue to battle the blazes, which have collectively burned approximately 30,000 acres, progress has been significant. The U.S. Forest Service suspects the Jenkins Creek Fire was human-caused, though the investigation is ongoing, and the Camp House Road Fire has destroyed over 150 structures. Meanwhile, air quality alerts remain in effect for the Arrowhead region due to smoke drifting from the Minnesota fires and massive wildfires just north of Minnesota in Canada's Manitoba provinces.</p>

          <p>Best Buy has lowered its full-year sales and profit outlook, citing that higher tariffs are increasing the costs of consumer electronics. CEO Corie Barry noted that the company's outlook assumes tariffs will remain at current levels and that there will be no major shift in consumer behavior. To mitigate the impact, Best Buy is increasing prices on some items as a last resort, while also focusing on improving the customer experience and growing its third-party marketplace. The company's mix of imports has shifted, with China now accounting for a smaller percentage of its merchandise compared to earlier this year.</p>

          <p>The government is fast-tracking the planning process for new reservoirs to address potential drinking water shortages in England, which could occur within a decade without new infrastructure. The decision means that final decisions on proposed reservoirs will be taken at a national level to speed up the process. While the move is intended to ensure water security, it faces potential local opposition and could still take over a decade for the reservoirs to be completed. Experts emphasize the need for managing water usage and reducing waste, alongside building new reservoirs, to address the challenges of climate change and population growth.</p>
