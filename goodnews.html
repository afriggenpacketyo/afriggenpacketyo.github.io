          <p>A viral social media post claiming to show an Iranian missile strike on Israel's Weizmann Institute has been proven false by a DW Fact Check. A reverse image search revealed the satellite photo actually depicts an Iranian missile base in Tabriz that was damaged by an Israeli attack, a fact verified by coordinates and visual evidence from Maxar Technologies. The article clarifies that while the Weizmann Institute was a target in Iran's retaliatory strikes, the widely circulated image is being used to spread misinformation by misrepresenting the event.</p>

          <h2>The Overlooked Psychological Value of Political Protest in Countering the 'Spiral of Silence'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of the "spiral of silence," a phenomenon where individuals misjudge public opinion and remain quiet, thereby reinforcing the status quo. It argues that a key function of public protest is to break this spiral by providing a visible signal of collective belief, which helps people more accurately perceive the views of their fellow citizens. Citing research on public reactions to Supreme Court rulings like Dobbs and Obergefell, the analysis shows how widespread demonstrations can correct false social realities and build common knowledge.</p>

          <p>Denmark has enacted a new law that requires women to participate in a military conscription lottery upon turning 18, a system that previously only applied to men. The period of service is also being extended from four to eleven months for all conscripts. This policy change, which follows similar moves by neighbors Sweden and Norway, is part of Denmark's broader effort to increase its defense spending and military readiness in response to heightened security tensions across Europe.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military commander has requested that 200 of the 4,000 California National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles for protest duty be reassigned to help prepare for the state's wildfire season.

          <p>Chelsea's recent transfer activities, including the pursuit of forward Jo√£o Pedro, signal a strategic shift under head coach Enzo Maresca to become more unpredictable in attack. After a season where his team sometimes struggled against defensive formations, Maresca is looking to add versatile players who can operate in different roles and create new angles of attack. This move away from relying solely on speedy wingers aims to make Chelsea's system more complex and adaptable, even if it means phasing out established players like Ben Chilwell.</p>

          <p>This analysis posits that Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary offers a hopeful blueprint for the progressive wing of the party. His success is attributed to a platform of practical socialist policies like a rent freeze and free childcare, a principled stance on foreign policy, and a campaign fueled by young, diverse volunteers rather than corporate money. The author argues that Mamdani's ability to mobilize voters around civic pride and economic stability, rather than fear, demonstrates a viable path forward for Democrats nationally.</p>
