          <p>In an interview, the United Kingdom's Ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, discussed the newly announced framework for a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K., covering sectors like steel, aluminum, cars, and beef, where the U.K. is scrapping a 20 percent tariff on U.S. beef. Mandelson expressed confidence in the deal's finalization and emphasized the importance of building a close U.S.-U.K. technology partnership, which is featured in the deal but requires further work to design. Regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Mandelson conveyed skepticism about Russia's seriousness in ceasefire proposals, while underscoring the U.K.'s support for President Trump's stance and the need for additional pressure on Russia. The ambassador highlighted the defining moment in the conflict and the necessity for Russia to match Ukraine's offer of a 30-day ceasefire for negotiations.</p>

          <p>US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the US-China trade talks in Geneva aim to de-escalate tensions, with predictions of multiple trade deals in the coming months. Lutnick referenced China's 125% retaliatory tariffs and the 145% US tariffs, indicating a desire to "reset the conversation" and Trump hailed a "total reset" in US-China trade relations. Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, suggested that relationships are being rebooted and that the Chinese are eager to "play ball and renormalise things." The UK agreement was cited as a blueprint for other deals, with 24 others in the works, and Lutnick dismissed concerns about job losses resulting from the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made "substantial progress" in trade talks held in Geneva, with details of an agreement expected to be released soon. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested that a deal had been reached that addresses the Trump administration's national security concerns regarding China's trade practices, though it remains unclear whether any tariffs will be dropped. The talks were an attempt to ease tensions following Trump's imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports, which have disrupted global supply chains and raised concerns about global economic slowdown and inflation. The discussions were led by Bessent and Greer for the United States, and He Lifeng, China‚Äôs vice premier for economic policy, with both sides expressing a desire to de-escalate the trade war.</p>

          <p>European officials are emphasizing that food safety standards are a ‚Äúred line‚Äù in trade negotiations with the Trump administration, which criticizes regulations that limit the import of American beef and other meats. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has argued that American beef is superior, but European policymakers are reluctant to allow more hormone-raised American products into the European Union. While the EU is open to some concessions to avoid a trade war, they are firm on maintaining their strict health and safety standards, particularly regarding hormone-treated beef and acid-washed chicken. The article highlights the cultural and economic factors that contribute to Europe's protectionist stance on food, including a preference for smaller family farms and concerns about fair competition.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew," TV, film, and media executive Barry Diller discusses the limitations of relying too heavily on data and research in decision-making, arguing that instinct and common sense are often more valuable. Diller emphasizes that data can only reveal past events and cannot predict future success, particularly in creative endeavors. He recalls instances where trusting his instincts led to successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," highlighting the importance of human instinct over structured information and PowerPoint presentations. He argues that overtraining the brain on data alone can be a deterrent if it's the only decision-making component.</p>

The selection of Robert Prevost, a former math major and White Sox fan from Chicago, as pope represents both continuity and change for the Catholic Church. During the Thursday Mass, the new pope spoke in Italian, Latin, and Spanish, vowing to build bridges. The appointment of Prevost was seen as surprising by many, but his experience as an evangelizer, statesman, and governor made him a strong candidate.</p>
