        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The attempted suspension of Jimmy Kimmel by ABC's parent company, Disney, inadvertently proved the continued relevance of late-night television. The move, which followed pressure related to Kimmel's satirical comments about Trump supporters, sparked a massive public outcry from artists, celebrities, and viewers, forcing Disney to reverse its decision. This event energized the late-night community, with hosts like Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers showing solidarity. The article argues that this pushback served as a crucial lesson for media companies and revitalized a genre that has been struggling to maintain its cultural foothold against modern digital media.</p>

          <p>Economists Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt have been awarded the 2025 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their foundational work explaining how innovation drives long-term economic growth. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences recognized their collective contributions, which have reshaped the understanding of technological progress and prosperity through economic history, theoretical models, and empirical analysis. Their research provides a framework for how new ideas and technologies emerge and influence economies. The prize, formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize, was the final Nobel award announced for the year.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has urged UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves to avoid "half-baked fixes" and instead implement comprehensive tax reforms in the upcoming Budget. The think tank suggests that while tens of billions could be raised without breaking manifesto promises, a more principled approach involving property and capital gains tax reform would be fairer and better for economic growth. The IFS specifically criticized stamp duty and outdated council tax valuations, arguing that systemic changes could create a better system overall. The advice comes as the government faces pressure to fill a significant financial gap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation has announced a $50 million donation to four of Atlanta's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). The 10-year commitment will fund "gap scholarships" for nearly 10,000 students at Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Morris Brown College, and Spelman College. This financial aid is designed to help students in good academic standing who have exhausted other resources to complete their degrees. The foundation, established by The Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank, aims to boost graduation rates and invest in a cycle of opportunity for students and their communities.</p>

          <h2>Lego MRI Scanner Sets Successfully Reduce Anxiety for Children in Hospitals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 05:42:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lego has announced that over one million children globally have used its specially designed MRI scanner sets to prepare for medical procedures, significantly reducing their anxiety. The sets, which are donated to hospitals and not sold commercially, allow children to learn about the intimidating machines through hands-on play. A new study found that 96% of healthcare professionals believe the models help ease children's fears, with nearly half reporting a reduced need for sedation. The initiative provides a tangible way for young patients to understand and cope with frightening medical experiences, turning a source of fear into a familiar toy.</p>

          <p>In a story of quiet generosity, Silvana Clark shares how her community college drama professor, George Meshke, secretly paid for her second semester of tuition in 1971. Facing financial hardship after her parents moved away without support, Clark was about to drop out when Meshke gruffly informed her she had received a non-existent "college drama scholarship." She only discovered the truth later when inquiring about renewing it at the financial aid office. This pivotal act of kindness enabled her to stay in school, secure a better job, and ultimately graduate, leaving a lasting impression of profound gratitude.</p>

Obama also offered a critique of some liberal messaging, cautioning against a "holier than thou" approach that can alienate potential allies. He emphasized the need for Democrats to hold firm to their convictions while acknowledging that life is messy and respecting differing viewpoints.</p>
