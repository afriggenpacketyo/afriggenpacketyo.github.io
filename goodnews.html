          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers salvaged a four-game series split against the Colorado Rockies with a 9-5 victory on Thursday. The Dodgers' offense started strong, with Freddie Freeman hitting a two-run homer in the first inning, and they continued to build their lead throughout the game. Starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw secured his eighth win, allowing three runs over 5 2/3 innings before being relieved. This win allows the Dodgers to maintain their division lead as they head into a critical weekend series against the second-place San Diego Padres.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the nearly $500 million penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud case, ruling the fine was excessive and likely unconstitutional. While the court upheld the underlying finding that Trump is liable for fraud, it determined the financial penalty was not justified by the harm caused. Non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in the state, remain in place. The New York Attorney General's office plans to appeal the decision regarding the fine to the state's highest court.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are seeking to revise a 26-year-old pricing law to combat "involution," a term for destructive, cutthroat competition that has plagued industries like solar panel manufacturing. The proposed amendment aims to prevent companies from selling products below cost and to establish a more sustainable market equilibrium. A solar panel executive expressed support for the new regulations, noting that extreme price competition has led to substantial industry-wide losses. The draft law is currently open for public feedback as Beijing works to stabilize its economy amid severe oversupply issues.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace achieved a historic milestone by winning its first-ever European match, defeating Fredrikstad 1-0 in a UEFA Conference League play-off. The victory, however, was bittersweet for fans as it coincided with the imminent transfer of star midfielder Eberechi Eze to Arsenal. Manager Oliver Glasner confirmed after the match that Eze would be leaving the club. This European campaign marks Palace's return to continental competition after 27 years and follows a triumphant year in which the team won both the FA Cup and the Community Shield.</p>

          <p>The Colorado Rapids MLS team is allowing fans to exchange jerseys of their former star player, Djordje Mihailović, for a new one following his unexpected trade to Toronto FC. The move comes as the Rapids announced the club-record signing of Paxten Aaronson as his replacement. Mihailović requested a transfer for "personal reasons" but implied in his new team's press conference that Toronto FC had a greater commitment to winning. The jersey swap program is a rare gesture by a sports team, intended to show commitment to its fanbase after a surprising and disappointing player departure.</p>

          <p>Enterprise software company Workday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates. However, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading after it issued guidance that was merely in line with expectations and warned of challenges ahead. CEO Carl Eschenbach noted pressure in its state and local government sectors due to funding slowdowns. He also highlighted uncertainty in higher education, partially linked to the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the Department of Education. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeastward into the Atlantic, away from the North Carolina shoreline. While the storm is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., it has brought tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks and is creating life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the East Coast. Storm surge warnings and some evacuation orders remain in effect for parts of North Carolina. Forecasters expect Erin to gradually weaken over the next few days, becoming a post-tropical storm by the weekend.</p>

          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated stocks. The process involves exchanging a diversified portfolio of assets for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches, with taxes on the gains not due until the ETF shares are sold. While the method can be highly effective, it has strict diversification requirements and can limit an investor's future flexibility, as their capital becomes tied up in the specific ETF.

In an interview, she candidly expressed a wish to "make a pile of cash" and be in a film that is financially lucrative, contrasting with some of her more recent, critically acclaimed but less commercial projects. Dunst, whose career spans nearly four decades, last appeared in the dystopian film "Civil War," which became studio A24's second-highest-grossing film but earned significantly less than the Minecraft adaptation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent market behavior indicates a shift in how investors are viewing potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, with value-oriented cyclical stocks now being favored over high-growth technology names. Traditionally, lower rates boost the valuation of tech stocks with high future earnings potential. However, the current focus appears to be on which companies will see immediate upward earnings revisions from a more dovish Fed, such as home improvement retailers that benefit from lower mortgage rates, rather than secular growth stories like AI that are less sensitive to rate changes.

          <p>Public records reveal that protests targeting hotels where federal immigration agents were staying during raids in Los Angeles successfully disrupted the operations. Emails from the U.S. Marines show that military officials compiled a list of "LA Hotels to Avoid" due to "harassment of ICE and CBP personnel" by demonstrators. Activists had staged "No sleep for ICE" rallies outside the hotels to pressure them to evict the agents. The documents suggest the community-led protests were an effective strategy in hindering the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the city.</p>
