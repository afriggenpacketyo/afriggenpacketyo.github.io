          <p>During Jeff Bezos's lavish wedding in Italy, some Hollywood celebrities offered contrasting reactions. Actress Charlize Theron publicly criticized the event and its attendees at a charity function, making a pointed joke about the affair. Concurrently, actress Mia Farrow highlighted the philanthropic work of Bezos's ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, sharing a post praising her for donating billions to charitable organizations. This juxtaposition sparked discussion online, with other stars like Olivia Munn and Rosanna Arquette commending Scott's significant charitable contributions.</p>

          <p>On July 1, minimum wage rates are set to increase in two states, Alaska and Oregon, as well as in Washington, D.C., and a dozen other cities and counties. According to the Economic Policy Institute, these hikes will benefit over 800,000 workers, with a significant portion being women and a disproportionate number of Black and Hispanic workers. The increases, driven by ballot measures and inflation adjustments, will provide average annual pay boosts ranging from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska. This state and local action contrasts with the federal minimum wage, which has remained unchanged at $7.25 per hour since 2009.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will rescind its digital services tax on large technology firms, a move made to restart trade talks with the United States. The decision came just before the first tax payments were due and followed President Donald Trump's threat to halt all trade negotiations over the policy, which he called a "blatant attack." The 3% tax would have affected revenues of tech giants like Amazon and Google and was expected to generate significant income for Canada. The reversal aims to de-escalate trade tensions and focus on strengthening the economic partnership between the two neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>Homeowners currently benefit from relatively low interest rates on home equity loans and HELOCs compared to other financing options like credit cards. While both products have rates in the 8% range, they function differently. HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the Federal Reserve's decisions, making them unpredictable but likely to fall if the Fed cuts rates later this year. In contrast, home equity loans usually have fixed rates influenced by the mortgage bond market, which may not move in sync with Fed adjustments. Experts suggest that while a rate drop is anticipated, its timing and magnitude remain uncertain for both loan types. (not investment advice)</p>

The revenue from this major deal is anticipated to begin in the company's 2028 fiscal year. This announcement, made ahead of a company meeting, has bolstered investor confidence, contributing to a more than 33% rise in Oracle's share price this year.

          <p>German companies are increasingly looking to Taiwan as an alternative source for drones and their components to reduce reliance on the Chinese market, which currently dominates global production. A recent report shows Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, a shift driven by cybersecurity concerns and Western pressure on China over its ties to Russia. Taiwan is actively developing a "non-red" supply chain free of Chinese influence, aiming to provide critical parts like chips and software. While a complete decoupling is unrealistic, Germany seeks to diversify its sourcing for key, high-risk components from democratic partners like Taiwan.</p>

The survey projects Brent crude will average $67.86 per barrel, though many believe price spikes will be temporary unless the conflict escalates significantly. This cautious optimism is tempered by persistent concerns over global demand and rising oil supply from OPEC+ nations.
