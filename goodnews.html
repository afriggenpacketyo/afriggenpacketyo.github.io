          <h2>Five Survive Alligator-Infested Swamp After Plane Crash in Bolivia</h2>

          <p>Five people survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon region of Bolivia after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The survivors, including three women, a child, and the pilot, stood atop the submerged plane while awaiting rescue. Pilot Andres Velarde believes petrol leaking from the plane kept the alligators at bay. They were eventually discovered by local fishermen, leading to a helicopter rescue and transport to a hospital, where they were reported to be in excellent condition.</p>

          <h2>Assisted Dying Could Account for Over 4,000 Deaths Annually Within a Decade of Legalization in England and Wales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 03:56:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK government impact assessment suggests that assisted dying could account for over 4,000 deaths annually within a decade of legalization in England and Wales, if MPs vote in favor. The assessment estimates initial low numbers, growing over time, but still representing less than 1% of all deaths. It also analyzes potential NHS savings from reduced care costs, ranging from ¬£919,000 to ¬£10.3m in the first six months, and up to ¬£59.6m after ten years. However, it also acknowledges significant costs, including staffing and training, making it difficult to determine overall financial impact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore held general elections amidst global trade tensions and domestic concerns over living costs. The People's Action Party (PAP), in power since 1965, faced a challenge from a rejuvenated opposition, with the Workers' Party seeking to build on gains from the last vote. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong sought a strong mandate to navigate the country through economic uncertainties, including potential impacts from U.S. tariffs. Voters weighed the PAP's track record against opposition calls for greater scrutiny and alternative voices in Parliament.</p>

          <h2>Man's Self-Experimentation Leads to 'Unparalleled' Snake Antivenom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 02:29:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes. The antivenom cocktail, tested on mice, showed significant protection against deadly neurotoxins. Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for snakebite victims, leading to the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies. The research is a significant step towards creating a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives each year.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to stabilize the local currency amid a capital inflow ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion to keep the Hong Kong dollar within its trading band. This intervention is the first in two years and is expected to continue if the U.S. cuts interest rates, prompting further capital inflows. The HKMA emphasized its commitment to maintaining orderly money and foreign exchange markets in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is implementing administrative reforms aimed at streamlining bureaucracy, boosting economic growth, and consolidating political power. The reforms involve merging ministries, reducing the number of provinces, and eliminating public sector jobs. The goal is to make the state more agile and redirect resources toward economic development, with the aim of achieving high-income status by 2045. The changes are also intended to address dysfunction caused by the party's anti-corruption campaign and external pressures such as potential U.S. tariffs.</p>
