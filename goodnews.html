          <p>The UK's medicines regulator has warned women using weight-loss jabs that they must use effective contraception due to potential risks to unborn babies. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro, and for a specific period afterward. Concerns have arisen that the growing popularity of these 'skinny jabs' may lead to unsafe usage or inadequate advice. The MHRA has received reports of unintended pregnancies and emphasizes the importance of consulting with a prescriber about the risks and benefits.</p>

The evacuation included homes, hotels, schools, a hospital, nursing homes, museums, office buildings, and the Messe/Deutz train station. The location was unusually prominent, near Cologne's historic center, and clearance was delayed due to one person refusing to leave their home.</p>

          <p>The 2025 NBA Finals feature the Indiana Pacers and the Oklahoma City Thunder, with analysts providing insights on each team's path to victory. The Thunder's defensive prowess and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's scoring are key to their success, while the Pacers need strong performances from Siakam and Haliburton. Some analysts believe the Thunder's superior metrics and depth will lead to a victory in five games, while others suggest the Pacers' pace and ball movement could disrupt the Thunder's rhythm. The series presents a stylistic matchup between two homegrown teams, with the coaching advantage leaning towards Mark Daigneault of the Thunder.</p>
