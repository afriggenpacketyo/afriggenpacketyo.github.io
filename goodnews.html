          <p>Germany's popular nationwide public transport pass, known as the Deutschlandticket, faces ongoing financing challenges despite its widespread use since its introduction in May 2023. Approximately 13 million people subscribe to the ticket, which allows unlimited travel on regional trains and buses across Germany for a monthly fee. While the federal and state governments jointly finance the ticket, disagreements persist over future funding contributions, with some state governments seeking to reduce their share.

          <p>Taiwan has placed China's Huawei and SMIC on its trade blacklist, further aligning with US trade policy amid growing tensions with Beijing. The two Chinese chip firms, along with their international subsidiaries, are now on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring licenses for domestic firms to ship products to them. This move reinforces existing export restrictions and tightens loopholes, potentially raising penalties for breaches. The US has already imposed significant chip export restrictions on these companies, impacting their access to critical semiconductors.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales grew at their fastest pace since December 2023, driven by government subsidies and increased consumption, providing a positive sign for the country's economy. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, surpassing analysts' expectations, while industrial output slowed to 5.8%. Fixed-asset investment expanded by 3.7%, although the contraction in property investment deepened, indicating ongoing challenges in the real estate market. The data suggests that policy support is helping to boost consumption, but further measures are needed to sustain economic recovery. (not investment advice)</p>
