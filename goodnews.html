          <p>Microsoft is expanding LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky's responsibilities, appointing him as executive vice president of Office, in addition to his current role. Roslansky will report to Rajesh Jha, Microsoft's executive vice president for experiences and devices, while continuing to report to CEO Satya Nadella for his LinkedIn duties. This change reflects Microsoft's increasing integration of LinkedIn with its other productivity tools, including Microsoft 365 and Copilot. The move also involves shifting Charles Lamanna and his team, responsible for business and industry Copilot products, into Jha's unit, underscoring Microsoft's focus on AI-driven productivity solutions.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a massive planet, TOI-6894b, orbiting a small red dwarf star, TOI-6894, a phenomenon that challenges existing theories of planet formation. The planet, slightly larger than Saturn but with half its mass, orbits its star in just over three days, making it the smallest star known to host a gas giant. Scientists are puzzled by how such a small star could form and host such a large planet, as it contradicts the core accretion theory, which suggests low-mass stars lack sufficient gas and dust to build planetary cores. The planet's unusually cold temperature, under 150 degrees Celsius, also intrigues researchers, offering potential for atmospheric observations, with the James Webb Space Telescope scheduled to study it further.</p>

          <p>Magnus Carlsen, the world's top-ranked chess player, displayed his frustration after suffering a defeat against Gukesh Dommaraju at the Norway Chess 2025 tournament. Video footage captured Carlsen slamming his fist on the table following the loss, before shaking hands with his opponent. Dommaraju expressed surprise at his victory, attributing it to a "lucky day," while downplaying the significance of Carlsen's outburst. Carlsen, who has been focusing on freestyle chess, acknowledged the pain of the loss but noted that he finds more enjoyment in the freestyle format, contrasting it with the challenges he faces in classical chess.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is monitoring a new strain of norovirus, GII.17, which may disrupt the typical seasonal pattern of outbreaks. In the past, norovirus outbreaks usually increased around December, but last year's season started in October due to the emergence of GII.17. The CDC is conducting ongoing surveillance to determine if this strain remains dominant and whether the norovirus season will continue to start earlier. Several other countries also experienced unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus after GII.17 surged to dominance, but it is not yet clear if this shift will be permanent.</p>

However, analysts caution that any improvement in relations with China may be constrained by South Korea's position within the China-South Korea-Japan dynamic and the South Korea-Japan-US alliance, requiring a delicate balancing act between Beijing and Washington.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly planning significant spending to strengthen its squad, targeting players like Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez. Wirtz is seen as a key acquisition for new manager Slot, with Liverpool prepared to pay a club-record fee for him, despite interest from Manchester City. Left-back is also an area Slot wants to strengthen, with Kerkez from Bournemouth being a key target, although no agreement has been reached yet. The potential arrival of Kerkez raises questions about the future of Andy Robertson and Konstantinos Tsimikas, as Liverpool is unlikely to need all three left-backs next season, indicating potential departures.</p>

          <p>A Reuters poll of FX strategists indicates that most emerging market currencies are expected to maintain or extend their gains against a weakening dollar in the next six months. This trend is driven by traders abandoning the U.S. exceptionalism trade, as U.S. President Donald Trump's erratic tariff policies and deteriorating fiscal outlook spark a flight from the dollar and U.S. assets. High-yielders like the South African rand and Brazilian real are up significantly this year, with expectations of continued outperformance. However, downside risks remain, including trade disruption and potential impacts on global growth (not investment advice).</p>
