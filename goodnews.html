          <p>Bulgaria has received the green light from the European Commission and European Central Bank to join the eurozone, potentially becoming the 21st member to adopt the single currency. Both institutions assessed that Bulgaria meets the necessary requirements, paving the way for euro adoption as of January 1, 2026. This marks a significant shift from previous reports that cited Bulgaria's high inflation rate as an obstacle. Joining the eurozone is expected to bring more investment, trade, stability, and prosperity to Bulgaria (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>An inquiry by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) has found that train passengers are facing unfair penalties for minor and often genuine mistakes when buying tickets. The ORR stated that Britain's fare system is "complex" and that rail firms must stop taking "disproportionate action" against travelers. The report highlighted cases where passengers were threatened with court action for accidental errors, such as choosing the wrong railcard discount or forgetting to bring their railcard. Rail Minister Lord Peter Hendy acknowledged that "ham-fisted prosecutions" were punishing innocent passengers and that the government plans to simplify ticketing.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced ¬£15 billion in transport infrastructure investments across mayoral authorities in the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. The funds will support tram, train, and bus projects, with a focus on improving regional connectivity and reducing disparities. The move marks a shift away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the south-east. The investment aims to boost economic growth in areas that have been historically underserved, addressing concerns about regional inequalities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that changes to winter fuel payments, aimed at expanding eligibility, will be implemented this year. This represents a U-turn on a previous policy that limited the payment to those on pension credit. The move follows criticism of the original policy's impact on pensioners and Labour's poor performance in recent local elections. Details on the specific changes and eligibility criteria remain unclear, with further information expected in the autumn Budget.</p>
