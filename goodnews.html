          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 01:05:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk confirmed Tesla has entered into a $16.5 billion contract with Samsung Electronics for the supply of advanced semiconductors. The deal, effective until the end of 2033, is for Tesla's next-generation AI chips, with production slated for Samsung's new facility in Texas. Musk highlighted the strategic importance of this partnership, suggesting the final value could exceed the initial figure as Tesla will assist in optimizing manufacturing efficiency. This agreement is crucial for Tesla's AI and autonomous driving ambitions and provides a significant boost to Samsung's foundry business. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent trade agreement between the European Union and the United States, while averting a broader conflict, leaves several key issues unresolved. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on many EU goods but maintains a steep 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, creating disappointment in sectors like Germany's auto industry. Uncertainty persists around specific product categories, and the deal creates trade disparities on the island of Ireland. Analysts note that the agreement is a high-level political accord, with President Trump retaining the ability to alter terms, leaving tariffs much higher than historical levels.

          <h2>UK Government Not Planning Bank Holiday to Celebrate Lionesses' Euro 2025 Victory</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 00:58:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the England women's football team's historic Euro 2025 victory against Spain, Downing Street has indicated there are no plans for a celebratory bank holiday. This decision aligns with the precedent set after their 2022 win and the men's 1966 World Cup victory. While a homecoming parade is scheduled, the government appears to be weighing the economic cost of an extra day off, previously estimated at over £1 billion. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner will host a special reception for the team, but calls for a national holiday, previously supported by Keir Starmer, will likely go unheeded.</p>

          <p>Authorities in the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen have implemented new rules mandating leniency for researchers and companies whose state-funded innovation projects fail. The policy states that if mistakes are made without misconduct or abuse of power, and reasonable corrective actions are taken, the individuals and units involved should not be punished or have their future funding applications hindered. This move is designed to encourage innovators to "boldly explore uncharted territories" and take risks necessary for significant scientific breakthroughs. The rules apply to all universities, hospitals, and companies receiving government financial aid for technological innovation.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a trade agreement that sets a 15% tariff on most European goods, avoiding a threatened 30% rate but falling short of the EU's initial goal of zero tariffs. European leaders have cautiously welcomed the deal for providing stability, with Italian and Irish prime ministers calling it a positive development that protects jobs. However, Germany's powerful BDI industry federation criticized the pact as an "inadequate compromise," highlighting that the 15% rate will still have significant negative effects. The agreement also leaves a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum in place, adding to the mixed reactions from across the bloc. (not investment advice)</p>
