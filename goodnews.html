          <p>Germany's new government, led by Katherina Reiche, is amending the "Building Energy Act" to prioritize energy supply alongside climate protection, potentially weakening previous climate goals. Reiche aims to abolish the operating ban on pre-1991 gas boilers and construct new gas-fired power plants, sparking criticism from energy experts who argue for greater investment in renewable energy sources. Despite concerns, the government has committed ‚Ç¨100 billion of a ‚Ç¨500 billion infrastructure investment program to climate protection, with high expectations placed on Environment Minister Carsten Schneider to drive climate foreign policy.</p>

Conservative estimates suggest that over 500,000 of these voters supported Dan, accounting for a large proportion of his lead over his opponent, George Simion. This outcome highlights the importance of these groups in Romanian politics and their commitment to liberal democracy and Romania's Euro-Atlantic path, despite Hungarian PM Viktor Orban's backing of the anti-Hungarian candidate.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers to lower prices for consumers, aiming for a retail price of 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms. This initiative comes as soaring rice prices are impacting households amid rising inflation. The government plans to release 300,000 tons initially and is exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution. However, analysts note that the limited reserve may not significantly impact overall rice prices.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's financial system is crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan, particularly amid geopolitical tensions and discussions on de-dollarization. Businesses are seeking to diversify from the US dollar and are increasingly interested in using the yuan for trade and investment, according to Mary Huen Wai-yi. Hong Kong provides the necessary tools and capabilities, including settlement, payment, hedging, and swaps, to facilitate yuan-denominated transactions and investments. This trend aligns with China's long-term strategy to mitigate risks and assert financial independence.</p>
