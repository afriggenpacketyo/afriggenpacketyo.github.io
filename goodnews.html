          <p>England women's football manager Sarina Wiegman is adapting her successful coaching style as she aims for a third consecutive European Championship title. Wiegman states she has learned to worry less and let some issues resolve themselves, focusing on maintaining high standards through principles rather than strict rules. She emphasizes the importance of clear and honest communication with her players, a directness she attributes partly to her Dutch background. Despite the tough decisions required by her role, she describes herself as a caring person, which she finds can be a challenging trait in professional sports management.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has taken firm control of the second Test against England, largely thanks to a monumental score of 269 from captain Shubman Gill. His performance anchored India's first-innings total of 587, the highest score by an Indian batter in England. In response, England's top order crumbled, leaving them at 77-3 by the close of day two, with their key batters dismissed cheaply. Facing a massive deficit, England's aggressive "Bazball" strategy is set for its most difficult test yet as they try to avoid a series-leveling defeat at Edgbaston.</p>

          <p>An American woman, Aleese Lightyear, relocated from New York City to Chengdu, China, and now lives comfortably on an annual salary of $30,000. Previously earning $100,000 in TV production, she felt overworked and was living paycheck to paycheck in the expensive city. In China, she works 18 hours a week as a university teacher, receives benefits like a housing stipend, and saves up to $1,000 a month. Despite challenges like cultural adjustments and being a person of color in a homogeneous society, she reports feeling safer and having a vastly improved work-life balance compared to her life in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Williams Formula 1 driver Alex Albon believes his strong performance this season is being highlighted by having the highly-rated Carlos Sainz as his teammate and benchmark. While Albon has decisively outperformed Sainz in both points and qualifying, he attributes this to his car's suitability to his driving style, a factor he feels is often overlooked in F1. Albon also discusses his team's long-term ambitions, stating that while he doesn't expect to fight for wins next year, he realistically anticipates Williams will be competitive at the front of the grid by the 2028 season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners looking to borrow $150,000, the initial monthly payments for a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) are currently almost identical due to similar average interest rates. However, the long-term cost can differ significantly because home equity loans have fixed rates, providing predictable payments, while HELOCs have variable rates that fluctuate with market conditions. A drop in market rates could make a HELOC cheaper over time, whereas a rise would increase payments. Homeowners must weigh the stability of a fixed-rate loan against the potential savings or risks of a variable-rate HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey reveals that nearly two-thirds of Germans believe the legal age for supervised alcohol consumption should be raised from 14. Currently, 14-year-olds can legally drink beer or wine if accompanied by a guardian. The poll also found that over half of respondents support increasing the purchasing age for beer and wine from 16 to 18, aligning it with the age for hard liquor. These findings come amid ongoing calls from doctors' associations and politicians to implement stricter health policies to curb alcohol consumption, especially among young people, due to significant health risks.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq achieved multiple record highs in a holiday-shortened trading week, continuing the market's recovery from an April sell-off. The technology sector was the primary driver, with Nvidia's market capitalization soaring to nearly $3.9 trillion. A stronger-than-expected June jobs report indicated economic resilience, though it may temper arguments for immediate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Following the Fed's stress tests, several major banks, including Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, announced dividend increases, further boosting market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>
