          <p>A China-led international research team analyzed seismic waves from "marsquakes" using data from NASA's InSight lander, revealing a zone in the Martian crust that suggests the presence of water-saturated rock. This underground layer, located between 5.4km and 8km deep, could contain a substantial amount of water, potentially matching Mars' missing water. If confirmed, this discovery could reshape our understanding of Mars' water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet. The InSight lander, which arrived on Mars in 2018, played a crucial role in detecting these subtle ground movements.</p>
