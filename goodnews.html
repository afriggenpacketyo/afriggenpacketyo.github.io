          <p>The UK's Labour government has announced plans to scrap 201 organizations that oversee and run parts of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the move aims to simplify a complex system, focusing resources on "more doers and fewer checkers." Among the bodies to be abolished are Healthwatch England, a patient advocacy group, and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers, as part of a new 10-year health strategy.</p>

          <p>While digging trenches in Lima, Peru, utility workers unexpectedly discovered a 1,000-year-old mummy with its dark brown hair still intact. Archaeologists believe the well-preserved female remains date back to the pre-Inca Chancay culture, which thrived from 1000 to 1470 A.D. The discovery highlights the rich archaeological heritage of the Lima region, where experts say it is common to find such pre-Hispanic funerary remains due to the area's long history of human habitation.</p>

          <p>Former heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder made a successful, albeit understated, return to boxing by stopping Tyrrell Herndon in the seventh round.

While the performance was dominant, it lacked his signature explosive power, with Wilder indicating a desire to become a more well-rounded fighter as he aims to rebuild his career and seek major fights.</p>

          <p>A top economist at China International Capital Corporation argues that China holds a "comparative advantage" in the global race to develop stablecoins. The reasoning is that established third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay already function similarly to stablecoins, being pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and operating under a mature regulatory framework. This perspective suggests that China's existing digital payment infrastructure provides a strong foundation for its ambitions in the evolving digital currency landscape. (not investment advice)</p>
