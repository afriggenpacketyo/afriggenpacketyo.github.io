        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage application volume experienced a notable increase, reaching its highest level in over a month, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index, with an additional adjustment for the Memorial Day holiday. Refinance applications rose significantly, and purchase applications also climbed, potentially due to increased housing inventory. Despite economic uncertainty, homebuyers appear to be capitalizing on loosening housing inventory in some markets, even as interest rates remain relatively stable. The market awaits new inflation data and trade talk outcomes, which could influence bond market movements and subsequently affect mortgage rates. Optimism surrounding potential market stabilization is tempered by ongoing economic uncertainties, making future trends difficult to predict. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have banned teaching antisemitism in public schools, arguing it was an attack on educators. Hobbs stated the bill placed unacceptable personal liability on educators and staff, exposing them to costly lawsuits. The bill would have prohibited teachers from promoting antisemitism or actions that create a hostile environment, with violators personally responsible for damages in lawsuits. Opponents of the bill claimed it would silence those speaking out on Palestinian oppression and threaten teachers' ability to provide a full account of the Holocaust. The governor's veto reflects a concern for protecting educators from undue legal risks and ensuring a balanced approach to addressing antisemitism.</p>

          <p>The article examines the increasing number of professional soccer divisions in the United States, questioning whether the market can sustain the rapid expansion.
