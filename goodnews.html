          <p>Navin Khanna of New Jersey has pleaded guilty to leading a sophisticated criminal enterprise that stole catalytic converters across multiple states. The ring generated over $600 million by selling the stolen parts to a metal refinery, which extracted valuable precious metals like platinum and palladium. This plea is a major development in a case that came to light after a routine traffic stop in Oklahoma uncovered a truck filled with the stolen devices. Khanna now faces a potential prison sentence of up to 17.5 years for his role in the nationwide scheme.</p>

          <p>Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of "South Park," have finalized two major deals with Paramount Global valued at a minimum of $2 billion over five years. One agreement gives Paramount's streaming service, Paramount+, exclusive global rights to the show for $300 million annually. A separate production deal extends their contract through 2030, guaranteeing their company at least $250 million per year to produce new episodes. The negotiations were complex, involving a temporary pause by Paramount's prospective buyer, Skydance Media, but ultimately secured one of the most lucrative deals in television history.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos held a private meeting at the White House last week that lasted for over an hour. While the specific topics of discussion were not disclosed, the meeting signals a warming relationship between the two, who were often at odds during Trump's first term. In recent months, Bezos has reportedly sought to improve ties with the administration, especially as his company Blue Origin competes with Elon Musk's SpaceX for government contracts. This meeting occurs amid a notable falling out between Trump and Musk, creating a potential opening for Bezos to gain influence.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has drawn public attention for his unusual choice of attire during a strenuous hike in Arizona. Despite temperatures exceeding 90°F, the 71-year-old climbed Camelback Mountain near Phoenix while wearing dark blue jeans, a decision that baffled fellow hikers and social media users. This is not the first time Kennedy has been noted for exercising in denim. The incident has raised some concerns about heat safety, as public health guidelines, including those from his own department's CDC, recommend loose, lightweight clothing in extreme temperatures to prevent heat-related illness.</p>

          <p>A new student loan repayment option, the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), has been established through recently passed federal legislation. This income-driven plan will become available by July 2026 and will calculate monthly payments as a percentage of a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10%. The plan also introduces a $10 minimum monthly payment and offers loan forgiveness after 30 years. As other repayment plans are phased out, RAP will become one of only two options for new borrowers, alongside a standard repayment plan.</p>

          <p>Venture capital investment in U.S. artificial intelligence startups reached a massive $104.3 billion in the first half of the year, nearly matching the total for all of 2024. Major deals for companies like OpenAI and Anthropic drove the fundraising boom, with AI now accounting for almost two-thirds of all U.S. venture funding. However, the market for exits, such as acquisitions and IPOs, tells a different story, with only $36 billion realized in the same period. This indicates a trend where significantly more capital is flowing into AI companies than is being returned to investors through liquidity events. (not investment advice)</p>
