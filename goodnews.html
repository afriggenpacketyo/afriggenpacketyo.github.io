          <p>Mitch Brown, a former Australian Football League (AFL) player, has made history by becoming the first openly gay or bisexual man in the league's 129-year history. Brown disclosed that the immense pressure of hiding his sexuality played a significant role in his decision to retire from professional play. He expressed hope that his public announcement would cultivate a more accepting and safe environment within the sport for others to openly share their identities. The article underscores the prevailing "hyper-masculinity" and frequent homophobic comments Brown experienced during his career, signaling a potentially transformative moment for cultural shifts in Australian men's sports.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its Starship rocket in its 10th test flight, overcoming previous explosive failures and achieving several critical developmental milestones. The more than 400-foot rocket successfully deployed eight mock Starlink satellites, relit its Raptor engine in orbit, and stress-tested its heat shield for reusability. The Super Heavy booster also made a controlled splashdown in the Gulf Coast, followed by the spacecraft's splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This success is a significant step for SpaceX's commercial ambitions and NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use Starship for crewed lunar missions by mid-2027, and aligns with Elon Musk's long-term Mars colonization goals.</p>

          <p>China's embattled property market is exhibiting tentative signs of recovery, with major developers like China Resources Land and Sunac reporting improved financial results. State-owned CR Land saw its first-half net profit rise by 16.2% to 11.9 billion yuan, driven by strong property development and robust retail sales from its malls. Privately owned Sunac also significantly narrowed its interim loss by 14.4% to 12.8 billion yuan, benefiting from reduced operating and financing costs. These positive earnings are largely attributed to proactive government stimulus measures and a noticeable rebound in retail consumption, signaling a potential turnaround after a prolonged period of significant debt and tepid sales in the sector.

          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled a remarkable miniature 10th-century ivory figurine, now believed to be the first "portrait" of a Viking ever discovered. The tiny 1.2-inch piece, originally found in Norway in 1796 and subsequently forgotten in archives, depicts a meticulously well-groomed man featuring an imperial mustache, a braided beard, and a neatly styled hairstyle. Curator Peter Pentz suggests this figure, possibly a board game piece representing a king, could even be King Harald Bluetooth, as elaborate hairstyles were indicative of wealth and status during the era. Its detailed carvings and unique, smiling expression distinctly set it apart from other, more simplistic Viking depictions.</p>

          <p>China has successfully conducted tests on a novel residual heat removal system, significantly enhancing the meltdown-proof capabilities of its next-generation nuclear power plants designed for radioactive waste recycling. The China Institute of Atomic Energy hailed this as a breakthrough in developing fourth-generation nuclear plants, which feature a closed-loop fuel cycle utilizing integral fast reactors. These advanced reactors employ high-energy neutrons and liquid metal coolants, making them highly fuel-efficient and capable of breeding additional fissile material from spent fuel for reuse within the same facility. This innovation represents a crucial step towards safer and more sustainable nuclear energy, promising reduced waste and improved operational security.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a narrowed decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, indicating a notable recovery after several months of steeper drops, and signaling the initial success of Beijing's campaign against intense price wars. Profits for major industrial firms fell 1.7% in the first seven months of the year, with the mining sector facing a significant plunge, while manufacturing and utilities saw encouraging improvements. Statistician Yu Weining attributed these narrower declines to governmental policies aimed at recovering consumer price levels, which subsequently boosted company profitability. Analysts suggest the "anti-involution" campaign is both an economic and political maneuver, though persistent deflationary pressures may continue until further industry consolidation occurs.

          <p>Britain's Jacob Fearnley secured his inaugural US Open main-draw victory, demonstrating resilience against nerves and a vocal heckler to defeat Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut in a challenging four-set late-night match. The 24-year-old Scot, who has experienced a rapid ascent in the world rankings, battled service game inconsistencies and recorded 16 double faults during high-tension points but effectively regrouped in the decisive final set. This significant win now sets the stage for a second-round rematch against German third seed Alexander Zverev, whom Fearnley has encountered twice previously this year. The achievement completes a full set of Grand Slam victories for Fearnley, despite his relative inexperience at the sport's highest echelons.</p>

          <p>US Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley is grappling with a "ridiculous" and "controversial" decision as he contemplates selecting himself for the team, a move that would be unprecedented for a playing captain in 62 years. Bradley, a highly-ranked American golfer who narrowly missed the last Ryder Cup selection, is tasked with announcing his six wildcard picks a month before the biennial contest against Europe. While his deep passion for the American cause is clear, his dual role as captain and potential player raises questions about the team's optimal strategy to reclaim the trophy. This highly scrutinized decision underscores the unique challenges Bradley faces in balancing his personal aspirations with the team's success.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw delivered another masterful performance on the mound, pitching five innings of one-run ball to secure his fifth consecutive victory as the Dodgers triumphed over the Cincinnati Reds 6-3. Despite a notably diminished fastball, the 37-year-old left-hander impressively retired 14 consecutive batters, employing a creative and varied mix of pitches, including his slider, curveball, and new splitter, to effectively keep the Reds' entirely right-handed lineup off-balance. The Dodgers' offense steadily contributed throughout the game, erasing an early deficit and decisively breaking the game open with a four-run rally in the sixth inning. This crucial win maintained the Dodgers' one-game lead in the tightly contested National League West, underscoring their strong late-season momentum.</p>

          <p>A time capsule, buried by Diana, Princess of Wales, at Great Ormond Street Hospital in 1991, has been successfully opened, revealing a fascinating collection of artifacts intended to represent life in the 1990s. The lead-encased wooden box, initially slated for retrieval centuries later, was unearthed to accommodate the construction of a new children's cancer center. Among the diverse items, chosen by children who won a Blue Peter competition, were a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator, a pocket TV, and a passport. Despite minor damage, the objects remain largely intact, offering a unique historical snapshot and highlighting Princess Diana's compassionate involvement with the hospital as its president.</p>

          <p>A recent report from SAP Concur reveals a contrasting trend in travel to the United States: while leisure travel has declined this year, business travel to the country remains robust and even registered a slight increase. The U.S. emerged as the leading destination for global business travelers in the first half of 2025, capturing 15% of all business air travel bookings, a figure significantly higher than other nations. This pattern, corroborated by data from additional travel firms, suggests that the prevailing negative travel sentiment impacting other global regions is not affecting corporate interests in the United States. The article underscores the enduring resilience and appeal of the US as a premier business hub amidst broader global economic shifts.</p>
