          <p>Recent social media images and state media hints suggest that China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, may soon be commissioned. New satellite images reveal 36 newly painted spaces on the flight deck for warplanes, exceeding the capacity of China's existing carriers. Military commentator Song Zhongping suggests the Fujian is preparing for commissioning and will undergo trial service to test adaptability and coordination with aircraft and weapon systems. Further sea trials and carrier group coordination exercises may occur before the Fujian formally enters service by the end of the year, marking a significant advancement in China's naval capabilities.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Ventura County, California, battled two brush fires on Monday night, with the Howe fire being the larger of the two, having burned approximately 40 acres in steep terrain near the Santa Clara River.

Simultaneously, firefighters contained the Maria fire, which burned about 15 acres along the river bottom south of Santa Paula, with about 140 firefighters, three helicopters, and one dozer involved in the effort. Clean-up operations continued into the evening after the Maria fire was contained.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump made limited progress in resolving tariff disagreements during their summit, raising doubts about a swift, mutually beneficial agreement to protect Japan's auto sector. Ishiba emphasized that any potential deal should benefit both nations, with ongoing ministerial talks aimed at achieving such an agreement. The U.S. granted Japan a 90-day reprieve from tariffs, but Ishiba did not confirm discussions about a possible extension. Despite the tariff policy, Japan has been increasing investment and production in the United States, a point the Japanese side has been seeking to convey to Trump, and Japan exported around 1.38 million vehicles to the United States in 2024.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his long-awaited pitching debut for the Los Angeles Dodgers, marking his return to the mound after undergoing Tommy John surgery in September 2023. Ohtani pitched one inning, allowing one run on two hits, while reaching 100 mph with his fastball, and he received a standing ovation as he took the mound. Initially, the Dodgers planned to delay Ohtani's pitching return until after the All-Star break, but Ohtani's impressive live batting practice sessions and concerns about the toll of simulated sessions led to an accelerated timeline, and the Dodgers are open to having him pitch one or two innings initially.</p>

          <p>The UK House of Commons is set to debate a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with Labour MPs Tonia Antoniazzi and Stella Creasy proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. The current law in England and Wales deems abortion illegal but permits it up to 24 weeks of pregnancy under certain conditions, requiring approval from two doctors. Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent the investigation, arrest, or imprisonment of women who terminate their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals and violent partners who end a pregnancy outside of the existing law, and her amendment has received support from 176 MPs and main abortion providers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan, traditionally known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focusing on the global arms exports market, driven by security concerns rather than solely profiting from rising global defense spending. The shift aims to deepen ties and improve interoperability with allies and partners by standardizing maintenance processes and creating joint training opportunities. Japan also seeks to develop its defense industrial base, which has been in poor condition, and exports will enable economies of scale needed to make domestic production more viable, and the Trump administration's more transactional approach will oblige them to pay for much more of their own defense, or defense equipment supplied by the U.S.</p>
