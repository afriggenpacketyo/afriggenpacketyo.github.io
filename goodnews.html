          <p>A small plane carrying skydivers crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, injuring all 15 people on board. The pilot reported engine trouble and attempted to return to the airport but was unsuccessful, crashing in a wooded area. Injuries ranged from minor to critical, but officials noted it was remarkable that there were no fatalities. The same aircraft was involved in a previous incident in 2023 where it sustained substantial damage during a landing, a detail now part of the investigation.</p>

          <p>Following Clayton Kershaw's 3,000th career strikeout, this opinion article argues that he has cemented his status as the greatest pitcher in the history of the Los Angeles Dodgers, surpassing even Sandy Koufax. The author contends that while Koufax had a period of unparalleled dominance, Kershaw's longevity and sustained excellence over 18 seasons give him the edge. The piece highlights Kershaw's superior numbers in several career categories and his role as the foundational leader of the current successful era of Dodgers baseball. It acknowledges his postseason struggles but frames them within the context of far more opportunities than Koufax had.</p>

This boom, the strongest since 2021, positions the city to potentially become the world's top listing destination. The revival is driven by several factors, including regulatory support from Beijing for mainland companies to list in Hong Kong, a slower pace of listings in mainland China, and ample market liquidity.

          <p>Rock icon Ozzy Osbourne is set to perform one last time with his original Black Sabbath bandmates at a farewell show in their hometown of Birmingham. The 76-year-old frontman, known for pioneering heavy metal and a notoriously wild lifestyle, has faced numerous health issues, including Parkinson's disease and spinal injuries. The concert, titled "Back to the Beginning," is being hailed as a major event in rock history, featuring influential bands like Metallica and Slayer. The show serves as a final bow for a musician who defined an era of rock 'n' roll excess and music.</p>
