          <h2>Potential SALT Deduction Relief in Trump's Tax Package Could Benefit High Earners</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As discussions intensify regarding President Trump's policy agenda, changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction could offer relief to higher-income individuals. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act imposed a $10,000 limit on SALT deductions, which is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress acts. While Trump previously enacted the SALT cap, he has since expressed support for its reform, and lawmakers are considering various updates, including a potential increase to the deduction limit. This article highlights that any changes will be part of a broader tax package negotiation, but a higher SALT deduction could significantly impact taxpayers in high-tax states.

          <p>Early results from local elections in England show Reform UK making significant gains, including taking a seat from Labour in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election by a narrow margin. Andrea Jenkyns of Reform UK has become the first mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, marking a notable victory for the party. While Labour has retained several mayoralties, Reform came in second in those races, indicating a shift in the political landscape. This article emphasizes the growing influence of Reform UK and its potential to disrupt the established political order in Britain, particularly concerning immigration issues.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party achieved a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election, seizing a seat from the Labour Party, signaling a potential rise in the party's influence. Reform's candidate, Sarah Pochin, won by just six votes in Runcorn and Helsby, a constituency previously considered safe for Labour. The article suggests this victory, coupled with potential gains in mayoral and local council elections, could accelerate the country's shift toward a more polarized, multiparty system. The article also notes that immigration has become a central issue, with Reform capitalizing on local tensions and anti-incumbent sentiment.</p>

          <p>Cities in California are rapidly changing their approach to homelessness, using tiny home shelters and stricter enforcement of anti-camping bans. The Grants Pass v. Johnson Supreme Court ruling has emboldened cities to break up encampments and expand interim housing options. San Jose and San Francisco are leading the way, with mayors like Matt Mahan and Daniel Lurie pushing for more temporary housing units and increased arrests for those refusing shelter. The article notes that while critics worry about a two-tiered housing system, the speed and cost-effectiveness of tiny homes make them an attractive solution for elected officials facing political pressure.</p>

          <p>The Scottish government has dropped plans to introduce a new misogyny law before next year's Holyrood election, citing insufficient time to address complex legal definitions. Instead, ministers will amend existing hate crime legislation to include protections based on sex. The decision comes after a Supreme Court ruling on the definition of a woman and amid ongoing debates about gender politics. This article highlights the government's shift away from bespoke legislation for women, opting instead to strengthen hate crime laws, and also notes the shelving of plans to ban conversion therapy, seeking a UK-wide solution.</p>
