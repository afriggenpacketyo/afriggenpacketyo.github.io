          <p>During the recent U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska, a personal letter from former First Lady Melania Trump was delivered to Russian President Vladimir Putin. In the letter, she makes an emotional appeal for peace, emphasizing the shared innocence and dreams of children worldwide, regardless of their nationality or political circumstances. She urges Putin to protect future generations, stating that such an action would transcend political divisions and serve all of humanity. The letter concludes with a powerful plea, suggesting he has the power to implement this vision for global child safety.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump-Putin summit, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff announced that Russia has agreed to allow the U.S. and European nations to offer Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's Article 5. This collective defense-style guarantee would be a significant concession from Moscow, which has long opposed Ukraine's NATO aspirations. The development is seen as a potential breakthrough in peace negotiations, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calling it a historic decision. However, this shift comes as reports suggest President Trump may press Zelenskyy to cede the Donbas region to Russia, a condition Kyiv has consistently rejected.</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, who won New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, is now focusing his general election campaign on appealing to voters outside his party. In a recent speech, Mamdani emphasized his vision for a more affordable city where local government meets the "material needs" of all residents, referencing stories of non-Democrats who wished to support him. This broader appeal follows a period of intense scrutiny over his past stances and personal wealth. He faces a general election contest against former Governor Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who are both running as independents.</p>

Gabriel later clarified his statement, explaining that he considers the media to be the "entertainers" while he and his teammates are the "competitors," each with a job to do. Both third-round pick Gabriel and fifth-round pick Sanders are competing for a starting role on the team.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly intensifying to a powerful Category 5. The storm is currently churning in the Atlantic north of the Caribbean, with forecasters noting it is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," which can cause temporary fluctuations in strength. While not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, its large size is forecast to generate dangerous rip currents along the Southeast coast. A tropical storm warning has been issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands as Erin continues its path.</p>

Officials from Germany, France, the UK, and the EU will attend to present a united front and ensure European security interests are represented in the peace negotiations. The talks come after a US envoy revealed Russia made a "game-changing" concession to allow NATO-style security guarantees for Ukraine. However, Zelenskyy remains skeptical of Moscow's intentions and is pushing for a ceasefire before any final deal is negotiated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in relationship studies, the happiest long-term couples maintain strong connections by regularly discussing five key topics that many others neglect. These include checking in on the state of their relationship, showing curiosity about each other's current interests and passions, and talking about future dreams, both practical and whimsical. They also create a safe space to share fears and stressors, and they engage in spontaneous, playful conversations about random thoughts. These daily habits foster intimacy, prevent misunderstandings, and ensure both partners continue to grow together.</p>

          <p>A U.S. envoy has revealed that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during his summit with President Donald Trump to allow the United States and its European allies to offer Ukraine robust security guarantees. These protections would resemble NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause, a significant shift in Russia's long-held opposition to such arrangements for Ukraine. The concession is being called "game-changing" and is expected to be a central topic during upcoming talks between Trump, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and European leaders. This development sheds new light on the substance of the Alaska summit, which was previously short on specific details.</p>
