        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked President Trump's attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants, determining that the situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion." The Trump administration had been using this obscure law to deport suspected members of the Tren de Aragua gang, some of whom were later transferred to a supermax prison in El Salvador, prompting legal challenges over due process and the definition of "invasion." The court acknowledged the government's right to remove migrants under other legal authorities but insisted on adequate notice, potentially satisfying due process requirements with a seven-day warning. The ruling highlights the ongoing legal battles surrounding the administration's immigration policies and the application of historical wartime laws in modern contexts. </p>

          <p>The British media is focused on several key stories, including the arrest of comedy writer Graham Linehan for allegedly inciting violence through gender-critical posts on X. Several outlets criticized the police's handling of the arrest. Other headlines address Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez's criticism of Europe's response to the Gaza conflict and growing pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves due to rising UK borrowing costs. Additionally, reports suggest the Prime Minister is considering digital identity cards for UK citizens to reduce small boat crossings, while Sainsbury's plans to trial facial recognition technology to combat theft and violence against staff. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Protests targeting tourists are increasing in frequency and size, reflecting growing anger among residents who feel displaced and negatively impacted by overtourism. Demonstrations have occurred in cities like Mexico City, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Venice, and Lisbon, with protesters expressing sentiments like "Gringos leave" and "Tourists go home." While travelers may be the visible target, experts argue that policy gaps and a lack of community involvement in tourism development are the root causes. Some propose solutions like reducing short-term rentals, imposing higher taxes on tourists, and including local communities in tourism planning to create more sustainable and regenerative travel experiences. </p>

The fire, which ignited north of West Sunset Boulevard, prompted a swift response from the Los Angeles Fire Department, including water drops from helicopters. While the fire burned one car, no structures were affected, and residents were instructed to shelter in place as crews worked to achieve full containment. The rapid response and effective firefighting efforts prevented significant damage and ensured the safety of nearby residents. </p>

          <p>Australia's economy expanded more than anticipated in the second quarter, reaching its fastest growth rate since September 2023, driven by domestic spending. The country's GDP grew by 1.8% year-over-year, surpassing expectations and the previous quarter's growth, with household and government consumption contributing significantly. Despite this growth, public demand was flat due to a decline in public investment, and the Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut rates by 25 basis points to 3.6%. The central bank also sounded a more optimistic note regarding the global economy and domestic private demand, although it reduced its economic growth forecast for the year to 1.7%.

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill mandating that schools notify families and teachers when immigration enforcement authorities are present on campuses, addressing concerns amid the Trump administration's deportation policies.

Supporters of the bill emphasize the importance of ensuring students feel safe and protected, especially given increased immigration enforcement activities near schools. The legislation, which awaits Governor Newsom's signature, is part of a broader effort by Democratic-led states to protect immigrants and maintain schools as safe places for learning. </p>

          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, former chief of staff to Sir Keir Starmer, has challenged the government's plan to limit a civil service internship scheme to students from working-class backgrounds. Gray questioned the evidence behind the decision, arguing that exposure to people from diverse backgrounds is beneficial. The government's plan, set to begin in 2026, aims to attract more working-class young people to the civil service by prioritizing those from lower socio-economic backgrounds for internships and subsequent entry to the Fast Stream program. Critics argue that the new rules could discriminate against children of certain professions and reduce the range of talent in the civil service. </p>

A data breach in 2022 exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who applied to move to the UK, leading to the creation of the Afghanistan Response Route.
