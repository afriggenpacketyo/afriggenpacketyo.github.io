          <p>Faith Salie discusses the U.S. Treasury's decision to cease making new pennies due to the cost exceeding their value. She acknowledges the penny's inefficiency but laments its loss, highlighting its historical significance and cultural symbolism. The penny featured Lady Liberty in 1792, and later President Lincoln's face, designed by a Lithuanian-born Jewish immigrant, Victor David Brenner. Salie argues that the penny serves as a reminder that things might be looking up and represents a tangible promise of luck in a world increasingly dominated by virtual currency.</p>
