          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump as much as 14% during its Hong Kong trading debut, reflecting strong investor demand. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion, reportedly the largest global listing in 2025. CATL intends to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients. Despite a revenue drop earlier in the year due to competition in China's EV market, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year-over-year, demonstrating its continued dominance in the sector.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., China saw a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April. This is in contrast to market concerns about rising Treasury yields and Moody‚Äôs downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this shift reflects a broader trend of investors moving away from U.S. dollar assets since the start of the trade war. Bank of America analysts noted that a weaker U.S. dollar and China's economic recovery are contributing factors.</p>

          <p>Japan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, affirmed that Tokyo is sticking to its demand for the elimination of U.S. tariffs in bilateral trade negotiations. Akazawa stated that Japan would not rush into a trade deal if it risked harming the country's interests. The U.S. imposed tariffs on various goods, including automobiles, car parts, steel, and aluminum, with Japan facing a 24% tariff rate starting in July. Japan is considering a package of proposals to gain U.S. concessions, including increased imports of U.S. corn and soy, and technical cooperation in shipbuilding.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government will launch offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization. The Environment Ministry will commission the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study seaweed behavior at considerable depths and assess the environmental impact of carbon capture projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon, compared with 34 tons absorbed by coastal plants in fiscal 2023.</p>

          <p>China cut its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction since October, as it seeks to boost its economy. The People's Bank of China trimmed the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. The rate cuts are part of a broader package of stimulus measures, including reductions to the lending rates and the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserves. The Chinese offshore yuan has strengthened against the U.S. dollar, providing room for monetary easing.</p>

          <p>A new UK-EU deal, intended to improve trading ties, underscores the ongoing complex relationship between the UK and its closest neighbors. While the government touts the deal as a significant improvement, some Brexiteers criticize it for accepting "dynamic alignment" with EU rules, potentially ceding some power. The deal's specifics, including costs, defense cooperation, and youth travel, are still being negotiated. Despite the government's "reset," the UK's relationship with the EU remains uneasy, with the trajectory of future governments potentially altering the current path toward closer ties.</p>

The legislation aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Despite some Democratic support, Sen. Elizabeth Warren expressed concerns that the bill puts consumers at risk and enables corruption. The measure moved forward in a 66-32 vote, with some Democratic holdouts now backing the bill after negotiators returned to the table.</p>
