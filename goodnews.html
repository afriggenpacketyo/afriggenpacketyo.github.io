          <h2>Bitcoin Price Reaches New All-Time High Above $120,000</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 11:08:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high, trading above $120,000, fueled by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and growing institutional demand. The rally comes as the U.S. Congress prepares for "Crypto Week," a series of deliberations on bills aimed at creating a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. Analysts attribute the price surge to long-term institutional buyers and increased investor confidence due to emerging policy clarity. Some experts project Bitcoin could reach even higher valuations by the end of the year, though potential U.S. Federal Reserve policies remain a risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Weigh In on Optimal Certificate of Deposit Terms for July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 11:02:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve potentially cutting interest rates later this year, experts are advising savers on the best Certificate of Deposit (CD) strategies. Some analysts suggest that short-term CDs remain attractive, as banks are offering competitive rates in anticipation of future rate drops. Others argue for locking in current high yields with longer-term CDs before rates potentially fall. For those uncertain, a "CD ladder" strategy, which involves spreading deposits across multiple terms, is recommended to balance access to funds with securing long-term yields. High-yield savings accounts are also presented as a flexible alternative to CDs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will send sophisticated Patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine to help the country defend against Russian aerial attacks. In a new arrangement, the European Union, with Germany specifically agreeing to fund at least two batteries, will pay the United States for the weapons. The announcement coincides with a visit by a U.S. special envoy to Kyiv and a shift in President Trump's tone, who recently expressed disappointment with Vladimir Putin. This move marks a significant renewal of U.S. military support, following a previous pause in arms shipments to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Ultium Cells, the joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, announced an upgrade to its Spring Hill, Tennessee, facility to manufacture lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells. These LFP batteries are significantly cheaper to produce than standard lithium-ion cells because they do not require expensive minerals like cobalt and nickel. This strategic move is intended to help GM scale production of more affordable electric vehicles and diversify its EV portfolio. Commercial production of the new, lower-cost LFP cells is expected to begin by late 2027.</p>

          <p>A court in the Netherlands has ordered the confiscation of approximately $112 million in criminal assets from Jos Leijdekkers, a notorious drug lord known as "Chubby Jos." Leijdekkers, who was sentenced in absentia to 24 years for murder and cocaine trafficking, is currently a fugitive and believed to be hiding in Sierra Leone. The seized assets were determined to be profits from his extensive cocaine trafficking operations and large-scale gold purchases. He remains on Europol's most-wanted list, and his alleged ties to high-level officials in Sierra Leone have sparked international speculation.</p>

          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy has stated that winning this week's Open Championship at Royal Portrush in his home country would be as, or even more, emotional than his career Grand Slam-clinching Masters victory. Reflecting on his missed cut at the same venue in 2019, McIlroy says he is now a "completely different person" and better prepared to handle the pressure and embrace the home crowd's support. After a disappointing start in 2019, he feels he is now a better player who can manage his game more effectively, expressing his desire to perform well for his supporters.</p>

          <p>China's exports of rare earth elements surged by 60% year-on-year in June, reaching their highest level in over a decade. The 7,742 tonnes exported marks a significant jump from the previous month and the same period last year. Analysts suggest this could be an early sign of a thaw in trade tensions, possibly linked to recent reports of China issuing six-month export licenses to select American manufacturers. The increase also follows statements from China's Ministry of Commerce about improving export approval processes for European countries, indicating a potential relaxation of previous controls on these critical minerals.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that ownership could be transferred to its postmasters through a mutual model. This initiative is part of a "fresh vision" aimed at transforming the organization's culture and restoring trust following the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. The consultation will also explore what future services the Post Office should offer, particularly banking services, as traditional banks close high street branches. The government has committed to maintaining the current network size of 11,500 branches.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's social media post suggesting he was considering revoking Rosie O'Donnell's citizenship, legal experts have affirmed that such an action would be unconstitutional. The 14th Amendment establishes that all persons born in the United States are citizens, and the president has no authority to unilaterally strip this right from a native-born American. While naturalized citizens can have their status revoked under specific circumstances like fraudulent application, the process for a native-born citizen to lose citizenship is strictly voluntary. The president's threat is seen as legally baseless and part of a long-running feud with the actor.</p>

          <p>As gold trades near record highs, financial experts are analyzing the factors that will influence its price for the remainder of 2025. Key drivers identified include strong consumer behavior, with new buyers entering the market, and persistent geopolitical risks that enhance gold's role as a safe-haven asset. Additionally, "sticky" inflation continues to make gold an attractive hedge against rising prices for consumers and central banks alike. While some analysts believe gold will hold its value, others see potential for further upside if global instability or economic risks increase. Silver is also mentioned as a more affordable alternative for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sex therapist with over two decades of experience explains that intimacy is crucial for a thriving relationship and is about more than just physical connection. The article identifies four surprising factors that can quietly kill intimacy: phones, which signal a lack of presence; unresolved feelings about an ex, which occupy emotional space; a negativity bias, which leads to self-rejection; and an unmanaged stress response, which can shut down desire. For each obstacle, the therapist offers practical advice, such as setting screen-free zones, processing past relationships, challenging negative thoughts, and communicating openly with a partner about stress triggers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A communication coach and former journalist argues that the common empathetic response of saying "I've been there, too" is often counterproductive because it shifts the focus to your own story. To show true empathy, the article suggests several alternative strategies based on deep listening. These include being fully present with open body language, repeating a meaningful word the speaker used to encourage deeper reflection, and getting comfortable with silence to allow the speaker space. The most powerful tool recommended is simply saying "Tell me more," which empowers the speaker and fosters a more authentic connection.</p>
