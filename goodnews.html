This marks the first time in his career that Alcaraz has reached the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam without dropping a single set, showcasing his consistent and dominant form. At 22, he also became the youngest man in the open era to reach 13 Grand Slam quarter-finals. The article also notes Jessica Pegula's return to form and Daniil Medvedev's split with his long-time coach.</p>

          <p>Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev has spoken out against a $3,000 fine he received for using profane language during his second-round match at the U.S. Open. Rublev argued that players should not be penalized for words spoken to themselves in the heat of competition, distinguishing it from directing foul language at an official or another person. He asserted that such expressions are a normal part of high-stakes sports and do not warrant financial penalties when they are self-directed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lewis Hamilton has been given a five-place grid penalty for the upcoming Italian Grand Prix at Monza. The penalty was issued because he failed to slow down sufficiently under double yellow flags before the start of the Dutch Grand Prix. This setback adds to a challenging weekend for Ferrari, where both Hamilton and his teammate Charles Leclerc crashed out of the race in separate incidents. The penalty means Hamilton will start no higher than sixth in his first race at Monza as a Ferrari driver.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued an emergency order to stop the Trump administration from deporting hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came after advocates filed a lawsuit arguing the plan was illegal and deprived the minors of their right to seek asylum and other legal protections. The judge's order was issued as planes were reportedly being prepared for departure, forcing officials to deplane the children and return them to government care. The administration claimed it was reuniting children with families, a narrative disputed by the children's lawyers.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Arsenal 1-0 in a closely contested Premier League match at Anfield, with Dominik Szoboszlai scoring the winning goal from a brilliant 83rd-minute free-kick. The game was largely a tactical and cautious affair, with Arsenal's conservative approach failing to break down Liverpool's defense. The result extends Arsenal's winless streak at Anfield to 13 league games. For Liverpool, the victory represents a significant early-season statement against a team expected to be a primary title challenger.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The deal is expected to support 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership will create a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates, significantly strengthening NATO's northern flank. The agreement is seen as a major victory for the British defense industry over international competitors.</p>

          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital marine ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. Over 13 years, a team led by The Bay Foundation has cleared over 80 acres of "urchin barrens" by smashing nearly 5.8 million voracious purple sea urchins. This allowed the giant Pacific kelp, which had declined by 80%, to regrow rapidly. The restored "forgotten forest" now provides critical habitat for hundreds of species and serves as a model for marine conservation efforts globally.</p>
