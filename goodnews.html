          <h2>Study Suggests Neanderthals Used Advanced Fat Extraction Methods 125,000 Years Ago</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 21:06:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reports that Neanderthals in modern-day Germany were engaged in a sophisticated food preparation process to extract and consume animal fat around 125,000 years ago. Archaeologists discovered clusters of fractured animal bones at a site called Neumark-Nord, which they have termed "fat factories." Researchers believe Neanderthals systematically smashed marrow-rich bones and boiled the fragments to skim the calorie-dense grease from the water's surface. This evidence suggests a high level of resource management and planning, pushing back the timeline for such advanced nutritional strategies by nearly 100,000 years.</p>

          <p>Despite a hard-fought loss to world number one Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon, British tennis player Emma Raducanu is drawing significant confidence from her performance. Raducanu expressed disappointment but also pride in her ability to compete toe-to-toe with a three-time major champion, a sign she is closing the gap with the sport's elite. The match, which captivated the Centre Court crowd, demonstrated her improved consistency and mental fortitude. Sabalenka herself praised Raducanu's play, predicting the former US Open champion would soon return to the top 10 rankings.</p>

          <p>A recent emotional appearance by a UK politician has sparked a broader conversation about the acceptability of crying in the workplace. The article explores whether showing such emotion is viewed as a professional liability or a sign of emotional intelligence and strength. While some still see it as a weakness, particularly for women or senior leaders, many experts and individuals now argue that it reflects authenticity and humanity. Progressive employers are encouraged to foster a supportive environment, recognizing that acknowledging employee emotions can lead to greater motivation and productivity in the long run.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in the fight against climate change, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the deep ocean. These animals feast on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface in Antarctica before migrating deep underwater, where they burn their fat reserves, effectively sequestering the carbon for centuries. Scientists calculate this process removes as much carbon from the atmosphere as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater amount than previously understood. The discovery highlights the critical but often overlooked role of these creatures in regulating the global climate.</p>

          <p>The comprehensive legislation signed by President Trump will introduce significant financial changes for many Americans by making the 2017 tax cuts permanent and adding new provisions.

It also creates temporary deductions for tip income, overtime pay, and auto loan interest. However, the package also eliminates consumer tax credits for electric vehicles and home energy efficiency, and it enacts major cuts to social programs like Medicaid and food stamps, affecting millions of lower-income households.

          <p>Germany began its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the win was a positive start, the team's performance was marred by an injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the pitch in tears after a knee injury in the first half. Given Gwinn's history with two previous ACL injuries, her availability for the rest of the tournament is now in serious doubt, casting a shadow over the victory. The team was also noted as being wasteful in front of goal, suggesting they will need to be more clinical against tougher group stage opponents.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks has shared advice on five "toxic" foods he avoids feeding his own children to promote lifelong health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts and sugary cereals for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs because of sodium and nitrates. He also warns against deep-fried foods, which contain inflammatory compounds. Instead, he recommends alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fresh fruit, lean proteins, and using an air fryer to achieve a healthy crunch, emphasizing a proactive approach to nutrition.</p>

England's innings was a story of two extremes, with a massive opening partnership of 137 followed by a stunning collapse of nine wickets for just 31 runs. Despite a chaotic fielding performance with multiple dropped catches, a crucial bowling spell from Lauren Filer turned the game back in England's favor, setting up a tense finish.</p>

          <p>In a spectacular performance against India, England's Jamie Smith scored 184 not out, registering the highest-ever Test score by an England wicketkeeper. This epic innings, achieved just a year after his debut, surpassed the record held by his mentor, Alec Stewart, and solidified his role as an aggressive and powerful number seven batsman. The 24-year-old's rapid rise and ability to dominate attacks have drawn comparisons to Australian legend Adam Gilchrist. While still early in his career, Smith's talent and impact suggest he has the potential to become one of England's greatest-ever wicketkeeper-batters.</p>
