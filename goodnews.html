          <p>A team of climate experts, dismissed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) by the Trump administration, is reviving the popular climate.gov website under a new, independent domain. The original government site was effectively dismantled, with staff fired and its homepage redirected, following a broader effort to cut funding for climate science and renewable energy projects. The new platform, climate.us, aims to restore censored information, including data on the disproportionate impacts of climate change, and operate free from political interference to provide trusted climate facts to the public.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants fell to an 0-2 season start after a heartbreaking overtime loss to the Dallas Cowboys, but the team displayed significant improvement and offensive firepower. Despite committing numerous costly penalties, quarterback Russell Wilson had a standout performance with 450 passing yards and a strong connection with rookie receiver Malik Nabers. Although the loss dims their early playoff hopes, the team's newfound competitiveness and exciting play suggest a more 'watchable' and promising season ahead, offering a glimmer of hope for the fanbase after years of poor performances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data from China's central bank indicates a continued shift of household savings into the country's stock market, suggesting the recent equity rally could be sustained. In August, deposits at non-banking financial institutions, such as brokerages and mutual funds, rose by 1.17 trillion yuan. This trend is driven by low interest rates on traditional bank deposits, pushing investors toward the capital market in search of better returns. With the earnings yield of major Chinese companies outperforming government bonds, the rotation into stocks appears to be solidifying. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is considering a pioneering initiative to repurpose retiring coal-fired power plants into nuclear facilities, a project known as 'Coal-to-Nuclear' (C2N). Proposed by a top state-owned energy firm, the plan aims to replace coal boilers with advanced fourth-generation molten salt reactors. This strategy would leverage existing infrastructure, such as turbines and grid connections, to accelerate decarbonization while preserving valuable assets. With a significant number of coal plants nearing retirement, this approach could offer a direct path to cleaner energy, particularly in coastal regions.</p>

Atlanta's offense was powered by running back Bijan Robinson, who rushed for 143 yards, while their new kicker, Parker Romo, successfully converted all five of his field goal attempts. The game's only touchdown came late in the fourth quarter from Falcons running back Tyler Allgeier.</p>
