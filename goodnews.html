          <p>Moody's has downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over the increasing federal debt and interest costs, marking the last of the major ratings firms to remove the US's triple-A status. The agency noted that successive administrations have failed to reverse ballooning deficits and interest costs, leading to a diminished capacity to repay debts. This downgrade could potentially lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and impact financial markets, although past downgrades have had limited long-term effects. The agency expressed concern that the 2017 tax cuts, if extended, would add trillions to the federal deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as a fast-moving wall of dust reduced visibility to near zero, causing travel disruptions and power outages. The National Weather Service reported significantly reduced visibility on major interstates, and ground stops were briefly implemented at O'Hare and Midway airports. Showers and thunderstorms combined with the dust storm resulted in reports of "mud rain" in some areas. Some schools closed due to power outages following severe weather events. Cooler, dry weather is expected to settle in for the weekend, followed by a rainy pattern next week.</p>

          <p>The Japan Meteorological Agency is considering incorporating artificial intelligence into its weather forecasting systems to improve accuracy through deep learning. A new team has been established to combine AI predictions based on historical data with existing numerical forecasting models. The AI system will analyze vast amounts of data to generate more accurate forecasts for temperature, rainfall, and typhoon paths. Human forecasters will still oversee the AI predictions and issue final weather reports and disaster alerts. The agency also plans to use deep learning to process observational data from the Himawari-10 weather satellite.</p>

Residents speculate that the statue may have been vandalized or melted down for cash, with little belief that the act was politically motivated. The statue, which had replaced a wooden version set on fire in 2020, was commissioned by an American artist and had been derided by locals for its unesthetic appearance. The town has capitalized on its connection to Ms. Trump through branded products.</p>

Fishing rights are another sticking point, with the EU calling for an extension of the current post-Brexit deal, while UK fishing groups are seeking changes.

          <p>Tesla has amended its corporate bylaws to restrict shareholders' ability to sue the company for breaches of fiduciary duty, requiring a minimum ownership of 3% of outstanding shares to initiate a derivative proceeding. This change leverages a Texas state law, where Tesla is incorporated, making it significantly more difficult for individual shareholders to bring lawsuits against insiders. The move follows a Delaware court decision that rescinded Elon Musk's 2018 CEO compensation package, prompting Tesla to relocate its incorporation to Texas. Tesla is appealing the Delaware court's decision.</p>
