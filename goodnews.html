          <p>Alibaba has engineered a new generation AI foundation model, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B, that delivers top-tier performance while being significantly smaller and more cost-efficient than its predecessors. This technological advancement allows the model to perform some tasks ten times faster than previous versions and reduces training costs by 90 percent, estimated at under $500,000. The innovation stands in stark contrast to competitors like Google's Gemini Ultra, which had an estimated training cost of $191 million. This development marks a significant step toward making powerful AI more accessible and economical.</p>

The initiative aims to develop new regulations and foster partnerships with private companies to advance electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for cargo delivery and emergency services. This move is intended to establish the United States as a global leader in this emerging aviation technology, potentially creating high-paying manufacturing jobs and boosting economic opportunity through innovation.</p>

          <p>In response to a historic drought that severely restricted vessel traffic, the Panama Canal Authority is proceeding with significant infrastructure investments to ensure future operational stability. The plans include constructing a land bridge with a natural gas pipeline to move energy products without using the canal's locks, as well as building a new dam and tunnel system to supplement the canal's freshwater supply. These ambitious projects are designed to mitigate the impacts of climate change and secure the canal's critical role in global trade for decades to come. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Proposal to Remove Contactless Payment Limits Raises Concerns About Overspending</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's financial regulator has proposed allowing banks to set their own limits on contactless card payments, or remove them entirely, sparking a debate about consumer behavior. While the move would increase convenience, some economists and consumer advocates warn that eliminating the PIN requirement for larger purchases could lead to more impulsive spending and an accumulation of debt. The discussion also touches on security concerns and the potential for economic abuse, though banks have indicated that customers would likely be able to set their own personal spending thresholds.

          <p>German customs officials have arrested two men at the port of Hamburg after discovering over 400 kilograms of cocaine concealed in more than 20 sports bags. The seizure occurred after vigilant dock workers noticed the men acting suspiciously and alerted authorities, who intervened as the suspects attempted to leave in a car. The incident underscores Hamburg's status as a major European hub for drug trafficking, with law enforcement officials warning of a "cocaine surge" in Germany as the European market becomes more concentrated for international smugglers.</p>

          <p>The long throw-in is making a comeback in the Premier League, with Brentford FC mastering it as a potent tactical tool.

Manager Keith Andrews has embraced the strategy, which was famously used by Stoke City's Rory Delap, arguing against any "snobbery" in the game and emphasizing that any legal tactic that creates an advantage is a valid part of modern football.</p>

A recent memorandum of understanding between the two regions opens avenues for collaboration across finance, trade, and tourism. The article argues that Hainan's free trade port can leverage Hong Kong's world-class financial infrastructure, legal services, and global connectivity to attract and manage capital flows. This partnership could enhance the regional competitiveness of southern China by combining Hainan's duty-free ecosystem with Hong Kong's high-end services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Earl Richardson, the former president of Morgan State University who led a transformative legal battle for equitable funding for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), has died at 81. He was the visionary behind a 15-year lawsuit against the state of Maryland that resulted in a historic $577 million settlement in 2021 for four of the state's HBCUs. Richardson's tireless advocacy exposed systemic underfunding and led to what is known as "Morgan's Renaissance," which included doubled enrollment and significant campus expansion during his tenure, leaving a lasting legacy for higher education.</p>
