          <p>Negotiating teams from the U.S. and China concluded two days of trade talks in Switzerland with both sides citing "substantial progress," though specific details were scarce. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent mentioned that more information would be released soon, while Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng emphasized the importance of dialogue in resolving differences. The discussions included the creation of a new consultation mechanism involving senior officials from both countries. While investors may react positively, businesses are awaiting more concrete information before making decisions, as this is far from a finalized agreement.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark will stop covering Zepbound in July, favoring Wegovy for weight loss, despite research indicating Zepbound's superior effectiveness. This decision, driven by secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, aims to lower drug prices for employers by 10-15%. Patients like Ellen Davis, who has lost 85 pounds on Zepbound, express frustration over being forced to switch to a less effective medication. Doctors prefer Zepbound for most patients due to its dual-hormone mechanism, but Caremark defends its decision as a cost-saving measure, offering a case-by-case exception process for those who need an alternative.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A head-to-head trial comparing weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy revealed that Mounjaro is more effective, leading to a 20% weight reduction compared to Wegovy's 14% after 72 weeks. The trial, funded by Mounjaro's manufacturer Eli Lilly, involved 750 obese individuals and found that Mounjaro resulted in greater waistline reduction and better blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. Researchers suggest both drugs have a role, but Mounjaro may be more beneficial for those needing to lose the most weight. In the UK, private sales of tirzepatide (Mounjaro) are already surpassing semaglutide (Wegovy).</p>

Martin, a "Stop the Steal" advocate, was criticized for his political activism and controversial social media posts. Pirro's nomination has received support from some Republicans, but some former prosecutors express concern about her ability to transition from TV pronouncements to the Justice Department's standards of proof.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has expressed reservations about implementing a consumption tax cut as a measure to combat inflation, citing potential strain on state finances. Senior officials within his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have largely dismissed the idea as the coalition government prepares an economic package ahead of the House of Councillors election this summer. The current consumption tax is set at 8 percent for food and beverages and 10 percent for other items, and its reduction is being weighed against other economic strategies.</p>

Saudi Arabia has already committed to investing $600 billion in the US, and the UAE has pledged $1.4 trillion over the next 10 years, though some analysts view these figures with caution.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is considering donating a jumbo jet for President Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane. The plane, a 747-8, would need to undergo security checks before being accepted and is intended for temporary use. A U.S. official confirmed that the possible transfer is under review, but no decision has been made. Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres has urged an ethics review of the potential gift, citing its estimated value and potential violations of federal ethics regulations.</p>
