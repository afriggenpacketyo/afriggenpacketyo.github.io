          <p>A teenager from Nashville has gained viral attention on TikTok after documenting her journey flying home from Austin, Texas, with an unusual carry-on item: over 200 flour tortillas from the popular Texas supermarket chain H-E-B. She revealed that bringing back tortillas in bulk is a family tradition, allowing them to freeze and enjoy the beloved product for months. The video sparked amusing comments from fellow Texans and admissions from others who have also transported H-E-B goods to destinations as far as Europe and Asia. The teen noted that TSA agents were unfazed by her tortilla-filled backpack, suggesting it may be a common occurrence for them.</p>

          <p>Retired England cricket legend James Anderson has strongly advocated for pace bowler Jofra Archer to play in the upcoming third Test against India at Lord's. Archer, who has been sidelined from Test cricket for over four years due to a series of injuries, recently made his red-ball comeback for Sussex. Anderson, England's all-time leading wicket-taker, believes it is too crucial a game not to include Archer, stating that waiting to build up his overs could be too late in the series. The series is currently tied 1-1, and Archer's return to the England squad for the second Test has heightened anticipation for his potential impact.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 11:08:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wimbledon officials have implemented changes to the Hawk-Eye electronic line-calling system to prevent future mistakes after a significant "operator error" occurred during a fourth-round match. The ball-tracking technology was accidentally deactivated for a key point, leading to a controversial decision by the umpire to replay the point, which drew criticism. In response, the All England Lawn Tennis Club has removed the ability for operators to manually turn off the system, ensuring that such a human error cannot be repeated. The umpire involved was confirmed to have followed existing protocols but was given a rest day following the incident.</p>

          <p>With CD rates remaining attractive, financial experts are advising savers on whether to choose short-term or long-term options. Some experts lean toward 1-year CDs, which offer flexibility and the chance to reassess as the Federal Reserve is projected to cut rates within the next 18 months. This option is ideal for those with short-term savings goals. Conversely, 5-year CDs are recommended for individuals who don't need immediate access to their funds, such as those nearing retirement, as they can lock in current high yields for a longer period. The consensus is that the best choice depends on an individual's financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Men's National Team lost 2-1 to Mexico in the Concacaf Gold Cup final, but the tournament is being viewed as a productive exercise for the American squad. Competing with what was effectively a B-team due to the absence of many star players, the USMNT rediscovered its intensity and fight. The performance of younger, less-tested players has put pressure on established veterans and may have altered the calculus for the 2026 World Cup roster. While Mexico deservedly won with its A-team, the U.S. demonstrated significant growth and created new competition for roster spots, which could be more valuable than the trophy in the long run.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Extend Bereavement Leave for Miscarriages Before 24 Weeks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 10:14:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to extend statutory bereavement leave to parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, paid leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. The new proposal would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, recognizing the grief and loss associated with early miscarriages. Campaigners, including Labour MP Sarah Owen and broadcaster Myleene Klass, have praised the move as a huge step forward in acknowledging this type of loss as a bereavement rather than an illness. The exact details of the policy will be determined following a consultation, but it aims to ensure no one has to return to work before they are ready.</p>

          <p>AI cloud computing giant CoreWeave has announced it will acquire data center provider Core Scientific in a $9 billion all-stock transaction. The deal is a strategic move for CoreWeave to vertically integrate its operations, giving it ownership of Core Scientific's extensive data center infrastructure and significant power capacity, which is critical for large-scale AI development. This acquisition is expected to enhance operating efficiency and eliminate over $10 billion in future lease obligations for CoreWeave. Following the announcement, shares of both companies fell, though Core Scientific's stock had previously rallied on reports of the potential deal, reflecting the booming demand for AI infrastructure.

          <h2>Communication Experts Offer Advice on the Right and Wrong Ways for Bosses to Apologize</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 09:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Effective apologies from leaders require timeliness, full responsibility, and genuine empathy, according to communication experts. A boss's apology should acknowledge what went wrong and present a clear plan to fix the issue and prevent its recurrence. Waiting too long can signal a lack of care, while speaking too quickly without a plan can erode credibility. Experts stress that leaders must sound human and show vulnerability without making the apology about themselves. Using passive language, reading from a script without emotion, or failing to take ownership can make an apology seem disingenuous, ultimately harming trust and company morale.</p>
