          <p>President Trump announced that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning TikTok's U.S. operations, which would likely involve a sale to American investors like Oracle. However, Chinese state media presented a more cautious view, stating that Beijing welcomes negotiations but emphasizes compliance with Chinese laws, particularly regarding the app's powerful algorithm. The ownership and control of this algorithm remain a major point of contention in the negotiations. The discussions reflect ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China over technology, national security, and trade, with a final, signed agreement yet to be formalized.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict the system will intensify, likely becoming a hurricane by the weekend. Currently, Gabrielle's projected path keeps it over open waters, away from the Caribbean islands and other landmasses. However, it may pass east of Bermuda early next week as it continues to strengthen. Authorities are monitoring the storm's development, but no immediate land-based hazards have been announced.</p>

          <p>A major trade fair in Nanning, China, is highlighting a strategic shift by Chinese companies, which are increasingly targeting Southeast Asian markets to offset slowing demand from Europe and the United States. Many exporters view the region's rapidly growing economies and large, young consumer base as a significant opportunity for expansion. This pivot reflects a broader adjustment in global trade dynamics, as Chinese manufacturers seek new growth avenues. Companies attending the fair are using it as a crucial platform to connect with buyers and establish a stronger foothold in these promising markets.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump against The New York Times, citing procedural issues with the complaint. The judge ruled that the 85-page filing was excessively long and used improper language more suited for a "political rally" than a legal document. While the ruling did not address the legal merits of Trump's claims, it instructed his lawyers to file a revised, more professional complaint within 28 days. The lawsuit alleged that several articles and a book by the newspaper were intended to harm his 2024 presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of major investments in the UK by U.S. tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google is being positioned as a potential catalyst for the British economy. Tech leaders, including Nvidia's Jensen Huang, have expressed strong optimism about the UK's potential as an "AI superpower," citing its deep history in scientific research. However, the enthusiasm is met with some skepticism, including from former Deputy PM Nick Clegg, who warned that Britain might just be picking up "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table." This influx of capital highlights a strategic alignment with the U.S. on technology policy and could define the UK's economic future for years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Cillian Murphy, reflecting on his long-running role as Tommy Shelby in "Peaky Blinders," has emphasized the stark difference between himself and the "psychopathic gangster" he portrays. As a film sequel to the acclaimed series is set to be released by Netflix, Murphy calls the experience of playing the character for nearly a decade a "gift and a privilege." While details of the upcoming film's plot remain secret, he attributes the show's enduring success to its powerful writing and its emergence at a specific cultural moment.
