          <p>Concerns surrounding ultra-processed foods are prompting retailers and food brands to offer more products with fewer ingredients, driven by the growing popularity of books and documentaries on the subject. Plant-based brand THIS has launched a Super Superfoods range in response to consumer hesitation about processed meat alternatives, but nutritionists warn against assuming all ultra-processed foods are unhealthy and that simply reducing ingredients can lead to the omission of fortified nutrients. Experts suggest that food manufacturers can simplify formulas and use novel processing technologies to create less processed products while maintaining nutritional value, and this article explores the debate surrounding ultra-processed foods and the trend toward simpler ingredient lists.</p>
