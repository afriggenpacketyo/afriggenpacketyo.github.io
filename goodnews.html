          <h2>JJ Spaun Leads US Open After First Round; McIlroy and Scheffler Struggle</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 20:20:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JJ Spaun took the lead at the US Open after the first round at Oakmont, finishing four under par with a bogey-free round. Rory McIlroy, who previously beat Spaun in a playoff at The Players Championship, struggled with a four-over 74 after a promising start. Scottie Scheffler also faced challenges, ending three over par with five bogeys, while Thriston Lawrence of South Africa trails Spaun by one stroke. Other notable players, including Brooks Koepka, Im Sung-jae, and Kim Si-woo, finished at two under, and Robert MacIntyre described the course as incredibly difficult. The dry weather expected for Friday is anticipated to make the course even more challenging for the remaining rounds. The article also mentioned Patrick Reed making an albatross. The event is very much up in the air, as it is just the first round. The tournament has a long way to go and the author is more or less reporting the status of the game, rather than directly reflecting on the events of the game, so there is a moderate level of optimism.</p>

          <h2>NHS to Offer World-First 'Trojan Horse' Therapy for Blood Cancer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 20:05:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS in England will be the first to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy for the blood cancer myeloma, a treatment that delivers toxic drugs directly inside cancer cells. This advanced chemotherapy, known as belantamab mafodotin, has been shown to halt myeloma for nearly three times longer than current therapies, reducing side effects. Paul Silvester, one of the first patients to receive the treatment, reports that it has been "life-changing," allowing him to enjoy a normal life and plan future adventures. The therapy works by binding a lethal chemotherapy drug to an antibody that targets and is absorbed by cancerous plasma cells, releasing the drug to kill the cancer. This therapy has a very positive outlook, with the chance to improve the lives of many people.</p>

          <p>Shinjiro Koizumi, Japan's farm minister and son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, has returned to the political spotlight by launching a push to lower rice prices. This move is reminiscent of his father's reformist approach, aiming to alleviate household burdens amid rising costs. Koizumi's efforts include releasing government stockpiled rice at about half the market value through direct contracts with retailers. His actions have drawn attention to controversial issues in the agricultural sector and boosted his popularity, potentially positioning him as a strong contender in upcoming elections. This is a positive outlook, as this politician is attempting to make the lives of the people better.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles city officials have granted a curfew exemption for ticket holders of indoor events and performing arts venues downtown, including the Music Center, allowing evening performances to proceed. This decision comes as Mayor Karen Bass' curfew approaches its third night, and arts organizations have reported a decline in patrons. While some events have been canceled or postponed due to planned protests, L.A. Opera and Center Theatre Group will continue with their scheduled performances. The exemption aims to support the arts community and provide entertainment despite the ongoing civil unrest. The events are still able to proceed, which is a positive outlook.</p>
