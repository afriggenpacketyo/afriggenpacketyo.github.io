          <p>The Trump Organization has announced the launch of Trump Mobile, a cellular phone plan costing $47.45 per month, offering unlimited talk, text, and data, along with roadside assistance and telehealth benefits. The company also plans to sell a "T1" smartphone, priced at $499, featuring a gold-colored metal case etched with an American flag. This venture follows Trump's pattern of capitalizing on his political career by licensing his name for various products, such as watches and sneakers. The plan's name, "The 47 Plan," and its price are references to Trump's current term as the 47th U.S. president. The new phone will have Trump's campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again."

          <p>The European Space Agency's Proba-3 mission, consisting of two spacecraft flying in precise formation, has achieved a groundbreaking observation of the sun's corona by creating an artificial solar eclipse. The mission involves two spacecraft flying 150 meters apart, with one casting a shadow over the other to block the sun's light. This allows scientists to study the solar corona, the sun's outer atmosphere, closer to the solar rim than ever before. Scientists hope to unravel mysteries such as why the corona is much hotter than the sun's surface and to improve understanding of solar weather, which can affect telecommunications satellites and power grids on Earth. </p>
