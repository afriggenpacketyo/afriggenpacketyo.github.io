          <p>The UK's prosecution service has dropped all charges against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, who were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act. Prosecutors informed the court they could not continue with the case, leading to not guilty verdicts for both men. The arrests in March 2023 had drawn significant attention, as Cash had connections to several Conservative MPs and was involved with Parliament's China Research Group. The defense noted that colleagues had expressed disbelief at the allegations, and the men now face the challenge of rebuilding their lives.</p>

          <p>Africa's engagement in space technology has shifted from hosting foreign infrastructure to developing its own sovereign capabilities, including designing and launching satellites tailored to the continent's specific needs. The recently inaugurated African Space Agency (AfSA) in Cairo aims to foster collaboration among nations with varying levels of space program maturity, from established players like Egypt and Nigeria to newer ones like Kenya and Rwanda. This renewed focus is on practical applications, such as using satellite data to manage flooding, improve agriculture, and provide connectivity. The partnership also reflects geopolitical dynamics, with significant investment and strategic support coming from both Europe and China.</p>

          <p>The National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta is undergoing a major, privately-funded expansion, positioning it to continue its educational mission independent of governmental influence. The nearly $60 million renovation adds new galleries and interactive experiences designed to encourage visitors, especially children, to engage in activism and social justice. The center's leadership emphasizes that its focus on teaching the history of nonviolent movements for freedom is a patriotic and inspirational American story. This expansion comes at a time of national debate over how American history, particularly regarding race and injustice, should be taught.</p>

          <p>Nepal's first female prime minister, Sushila Karki, has appointed three new ministers to her interim government, which is tasked with organizing new elections by March. The new administration was formed after the previous government collapsed following massive street protests last week that resulted in dozens of deaths. Karki, a former Supreme Court chief justice known for her anti-corruption stance, faces the challenge of meeting the demands of young protesters while managing established political interests. The appointments are a crucial step toward restoring stability and rebuilding government institutions destroyed during the recent violence.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence commemorated the fifth anniversary of the Abraham Accords, celebrating them as a historic achievement of the Trump administration. He argues the peace and normalization agreements between Israel, the UAE, Bahrain, and later Morocco and Sudan, have proven resilient even through regional conflicts. Pence credits the success to a policy of strength and unapologetic support for Israel, which encouraged Arab nations to find common cause with the Jewish state. He criticizes the current administration for not expanding the accords and calls for a renewed push to include more nations, particularly Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a church near the Utah Valley University campus held services focused on community healing and processing trauma. The lead pastor at CenterPoint church addressed the tragedy directly, encouraging congregants to choose love over hate and emphasizing unity despite political differences. The church provided counseling resources and held a special session led by therapists to help people cope with the grief and loss of safety. The services highlighted the deep impact of the violence on the local community and the long journey of recovery that lies ahead for its residents.</p>

          <h2>Experts Question Health Claims of Magnesium Lotion for Sleep</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A social media trend promoting magnesium lotion as a sleep aid and remedy for various ailments is gaining popularity, but scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking. Dermatologists point out that the skin is a barrier, not a sponge, and there is little proof that magnesium can be effectively absorbed topically. Any perceived benefits are more likely attributable to the act of massage or the moisturizing properties of the lotion itself, creating a powerful placebo effect. While sleep experts agree that using the lotion is likely harmless, they do not recommend it, as supplements are unregulated and proven medical treatments exist for conditions like restless legs syndrome.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to receive a second state visit to the UK, an honor described as historic and unprecedented for a U.S. president. The visit, extended by King Charles through Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is seen by analysts as a strategic diplomatic move by the UK. It leverages Trump's well-known fascination with the royal family, which stems from his mother's admiration for Queen Elizabeth II, to strengthen bilateral ties and influence the president on key issues. The visit will include a carriage procession and a state banquet at Windsor Castle, events designed to appeal to Trump's affinity for pomp and circumstance.</p>

The discussions are expected to pave the way for Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit Seoul for the upcoming APEC summit, which would be his first visit since 2014. This diplomatic engagement offers an opportunity for Beijing and Seoul to recalibrate a relationship that had become strained under South Korea's previous administration, which had more closely aligned with Washington.

The original government site, a key source of climate information for millions, was effectively dismantled after staff were fired and its content was altered to align with the administration's political agenda. The new, non-profit site, climate.us, aims to restore the censored data and continue providing the public with trusted, unbiased information on climate change, free from political interference.

          <p>Although the New York Giants fell to 0-2 after a thrilling overtime loss to the Dallas Cowboys, the team displayed a newfound competitiveness that was absent in their opening game and much of the last decade. Quarterback Russell Wilson delivered a sensational performance, throwing for 450 yards and connecting repeatedly with star rookie receiver Malik Nabers. Despite being undone by costly penalties and a last-second interception, the offense showed significant fight and dynamism. While the team's playoff hopes are already slim, the entertaining performance offered a rare glimpse of progress and hope for the franchise's long-suffering fanbase.</p>

          <p>Data from China's central bank indicates that a recent rally in the country's stock market may have further room to grow, as household savings continue to flow out of traditional bank deposits and into equities. In August, deposits at non-banking financial institutions, such as brokerages and mutual funds, saw a significant increase for the second consecutive month. This trend is driven by low interest rates on savings accounts, which are pushing investors to seek better returns in the capital market. With the earnings yield of major listed companies significantly outpacing government bond yields, stocks are becoming an increasingly attractive asset class. (not investment advice)</p>
