          <p>The U.S. Congress is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that seeks to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation aims to provide consumer protections and clear rules for the $250 billion market, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. Proponents argue that regulated stablecoins could facilitate faster and cheaper financial transactions, while critics point to risks such as the potential for de-pegging from their underlying asset.

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved a $14 million settlement for Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. Torres was convicted in 2001 despite having a strong alibi and evidence, including a cast on his arm, that would have made the crime unlikely. His conviction was vacated in 2021 after efforts from the California Innocence Project and the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit revealed significant flaws in the original investigation, including suggestive questioning of witnesses and failure to disclose exculpatory evidence.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of approximately 2,000 California National Guard members from federal duty in Los Angeles, about half of the total force deployed. President Trump had federalized the troops over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom to respond to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests. Newsom, who had sued the administration over the deployment, called for the remaining troops to be sent home, labeling their presence a political maneuver. The Trump administration maintained the deployment was necessary to quell disorder and protect federal agents.</p>

          <p>An independent review in the United Kingdom has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be renamed "assistants" to avoid confusing patients. The review, prompted by safety concerns and several tragic patient deaths, also calls for standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The report found that a lack of a clear national plan for these roles led to confusion and instances where PAs were used to fill gaps in medical posts without appropriate oversight.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act, a comprehensive immigration reform bill. The legislation proposes a "Dignity Program" that would offer a seven-year pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. for at least five years, pass background checks, and pay restitution. The bill also includes funding for border security, reforms to the asylum system, and protections for sensitive locations like schools and hospitals from enforcement actions. The reintroduction comes amid heightened scrutiny of the Trump administration's mass deportation program.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set for a major £50 million renovation project that will require it to close for five years starting in 2027. The ambitious plan involves temporarily relocating 1,300 plants, including a 250-year-old cycad, and replacing 16,000 panes of glass. A key goal of the project is to make the iconic Victorian glasshouse, which houses a tropical rainforest, net-zero in emissions by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps. The extensive work is necessary to repair the ironwork, which has rusted due to the hot, humid conditions inside.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an ad for Trip drinks after finding it made unauthorized health claims. The advert suggested its cucumber and mint drink, which contains magnesium and other supplements, could "help you feel calm" and reduce stress and anxiety. The watchdog ruled that this language implied the product could treat health conditions, a claim not permitted for food products on the official UK register. The ASA also found the ad's claim of "0g added sugar" to be inaccurate, ordering that the ad must not appear again in its current form.</p>

In exchange, Trump said the U.S. will gain "full access" to Indonesian markets, with the country agreeing to lower its own tariffs on American products. He also stated that Indonesia has committed to purchasing $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. The agreement is one of several deals emerging after the White House issued tariff threats to numerous countries earlier this year. (not investment advice)</p>

Kim, who was executed for insurrection, has remained a divisive historical figure, with some viewing him as a killer seeking power and others as a hero who ended a dictatorship. The retrial, sought by his family, will delve into the circumstances of the assassination and Kim's claim that he acted to prevent further bloodshed under Park's increasingly ruthless rule.</p>

This change reflects President Trump's growing frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to negotiate a peace deal in good faith. The move is seen as a way to increase U.S. leverage and compel Moscow to the negotiating table, while also deterring further aggression.</p>
