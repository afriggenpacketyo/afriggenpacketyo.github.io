          <p>Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka has advanced to the US Open semifinals after her opponent, Marketa Vondrousova, withdrew due to injury just before their scheduled quarter-final match. This walkover sets up a highly anticipated rematch of last year's final against American fourth seed Jessica Pegula. Pegula secured her spot in the semifinals with a commanding straight-sets victory over Barbora Krejcikova, continuing her impressive run in the tournament without dropping a single set.</p>

          <p>Investors reacted positively to the federal court's remedies in the Google search monopoly case, causing Alphabet's stock to jump 8% in extended trading. The ruling avoided the harshest penalties proposed by the Department of Justice, such as the forced sale of the Chrome browser or its Android operating system. While Google must loosen its grip on search data and is barred from exclusive default search engine contracts, the market perceived the outcome as a significant win for the tech giant, avoiding a disruptive divestiture of key assets.

          <p>The government in England is planning to introduce a new law that would prohibit the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16. The proposed ban, which would apply to shops, cafes, and online sales, is a response to concerns from parents and health experts about the negative health effects of these drinks on children. With some popular beverages containing more caffeine than two cups of coffee, officials aim to address issues like headaches, sleep problems, and heart-rate abnormalities in young people.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposal to force Google to sell its Chrome browser in a major antitrust case. While Google can keep Chrome, the judge ordered the company to end its exclusive default search engine contracts and share some search index and user interaction data with rivals. The ruling, which is the most significant in a tech antitrust case in over two decades, also establishes a committee to monitor Google's compliance for six years, though it falls short of the full divestiture sought by the government.</p>
