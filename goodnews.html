          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 03:16:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government in England and Wales is planning to reform licensing rules to shield pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, and processes for new businesses would be streamlined. This initiative aims to revitalize the struggling hospitality sector, reverse the trend of pub closures, and support outdoor dining and drinking. While the Labour government touts the changes as cutting red tape, the Conservative opposition has criticized the move as hypocritical given other economic pressures on the industry.</p>

          <p>Ghanaian President John Mahama has launched a "24-hour economy" initiative aimed at transforming the nation's economic landscape and creating widespread employment. The plan proposes that various industries operate in three eight-hour shifts daily, keeping the economy active around the clock to move Ghana from an import-based system to self-sufficiency. While the policy targets key sectors like agriculture and manufacturing and could create millions of jobs, it faces significant hurdles. Economists point to the need for substantial funding, estimated at around $4 billion, and challenges related to infrastructure, such as reliable power, and securing private sector buy-in.

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have announced a daily "tactical pause" in military activities in three specific areas of Gaza to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid. The suspension of operations is scheduled to occur for ten hours each day in Al Mawasi, Deir al Balah, and Gaza City, and will continue until further notice. This decision, made in coordination with the United Nations and other international aid groups, is intended to create secure corridors for convoys to distribute essential food and medicine.

          <p>A mother from Apple Valley, California, has experienced an extraordinary coincidence: all four of her children were born on the same date, July 7th. Nauzhae Drake, 26, gave birth to her first child on 7/7/2019, followed by subsequent children on the same date in 2021, 2022, and most recently, 2025. None of the births were induced, and none were due on that specific date, making the occurrence statistically improbable. A mathematics professor noted that the odds are incredibly low, comparing it to being far less likely than winning the Powerball lottery multiple times. The family celebrates the shared birthday as a unique and joyful event.</p>
