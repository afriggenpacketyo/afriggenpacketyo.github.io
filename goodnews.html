After sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS, they are the first defending champion to return to the World Series in 16 years. They will face the Toronto Blue Jays, whose last championship was in 1993 when they themselves repeated as champions.

          <p>Zhi Dong Zhang, a Chinese citizen known as "Brother Wang" and accused of being a major fentanyl trafficker, has been extradited from Cuba to the United States. The transfer was facilitated by the Mexican government, where Zhang had previously escaped house arrest. U.S. authorities allege he ran a significant drug trafficking and money laundering operation, coordinating fentanyl importation from Mexico and working with the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels. This extradition is part of a broader U.S. effort to pressure Mexico and China to curb the flow of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals.</p>

          <p>A coalition of over 20 nations supporting Ukraine has committed to "take Russian oil and gas off the global market" to increase economic pressure on Russia and hinder its war efforts. The announcement followed a summit in London hosted by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, where leaders also discussed using frozen Russian sovereign assets to finance Ukraine's defense. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attended, reiterating the need for pressure, though no new commitments for long-range missiles were made. The pledge aims to further choke off funding for Russia's military operations.</p>

          <p>A judge has ordered the S&W Atlas Iron & Metal recycling facility in Watts, Los Angeles, to permanently cease operations and pay $2 million in penalties. For decades, the scrap yard, located next to Jordan High School, has been a source of community concern due to toxic dust, explosions, and flying shrapnel endangering students. The owners pleaded no contest to criminal charges related to hazardous waste handling after a compressed gas canister exploded on the first day of school. The ruling is seen as a major victory for environmental justice in a community long affected by industrial pollution.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has partnered with activist investment firm JANA Partners to acquire a combined 9% stake in Six Flags Entertainment. The move makes them one of the largest shareholders in the amusement park company, which has struggled with debt and declining attendance since its 2024 merger with Cedar Fair. JANA Partners intends to push for changes to enhance shareholder value and improve the guest experience. Kelce, a self-proclaimed lifelong fan of the parks, brings significant celebrity influence, which analysts believe could help revitalize the brand's image.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is scheduled to travel to China next month as part of the U.S. administration's effort to combat the international supply of fentanyl precursor chemicals. The trip underscores the administration's policy of holding China accountable for its role in the U.S. opioid crisis. The visit follows recent U.S. indictments against Chinese companies and individuals allegedly involved in manufacturing these chemicals. President Trump has stated that addressing the fentanyl issue will be a top priority in his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>With two months until Christmas, retailers are preparing for a holiday shopping season marked by more cautious and price-sensitive consumers. Executives from companies like Kohl's and Academy Sports and Outdoors note that shoppers are starting earlier and are more responsive to promotions, often making more trips but with smaller purchases each time. In response, retailers are launching their holiday marketing campaigns earlier than usual and adjusting discount strategies. Despite concerns over a potential government shutdown and tariffs, industry leaders expect inventory levels to be normal, though they anticipate a trend of consumers "trading down" to lower-priced private brands.

          <p>Quincy Cross, who is serving a life sentence for the 2000 murder of 18-year-old Jessica Currin in Mayfield, Kentucky, has been granted a new evidentiary hearing. The decision, made nearly 25 years after the crime, will allow his lawyers to present new evidence, including recanted testimony from a key witness who now claims she lied at the original trial. The Kentucky Innocence Project, which is representing Cross, believes this evidence could lead to his conviction being vacated. In a notable development, the fathers of both the victim and the convicted have joined forces to seek justice and uncover the truth.</p>

          <p>Intel reported a return to profitability in the third quarter, ending a six-quarter streak of losses, driven by strong demand for its client computing chips used in PCs and laptops. This was the company's first earnings report since the U.S. government acquired a 10% stake. While the core chip business showed robust growth, the company's foundry business, which manufactures chips for other firms, saw a slight revenue decline and has yet to secure a major customer. Intel's cash position has significantly improved following recent investments, and the company noted surprisingly strong sales of its older-generation hardware. (not investment advice)</p>

With the Federal Reserve widely expected to announce another quarter-point interest rate cut on October 29, rates may see further downward pressure.

The endorsement came after Mamdani committed to being a "mayor for all New Yorkers," potentially easing concerns from the party's more moderate wing about his progressive policies. Mamdani remains the frontrunner against independent Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p>
