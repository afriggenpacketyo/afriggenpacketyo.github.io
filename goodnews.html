        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exporters appear to be largely insulated from the costs of tariffs imposed by former US President Donald Trump, absorbing an estimated 9% of the burden. Research from CICC, a top Chinese investment bank, suggests that US importers are primarily compressing profit margins rather than fully passing costs to consumers or shifting them entirely to exporters. This analysis indicates Chinese goods possess a strong competitive edge and significant bargaining power in the trade relationship, highlighting the complex dynamics of international tariffs and supply chains.</p>

          <p>The Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa, shut down in 2020, is moving forward with plans to restart operations by the end of the decade. This initiative, driven by the unprecedented increase in electricity demand from AI data centers, makes it one of the few mothballed US reactors in a position to come back online. NextEra Energy, the plant's owner, is seeking lucrative power purchase agreements, similar to Microsoft's support for the Palisades plant, to bring over 600 megawatts of clean energy back to the grid. This article highlights a significant shift in the nuclear industry's prospects.</p>

          <p>Meta announced it will introduce enhanced guardrails for its AI chatbots, specifically blocking them from engaging with teenagers on sensitive topics like suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders. This decision follows a US Senate investigation into reports of AI products potentially having 'sensual' chats with minors. The company will now direct teens to expert resources instead of engaging in such conversations. Child safety advocates, while welcoming the move, emphasize the need for robust safety testing *before* products are released to market, highlighting ongoing concerns about AI's impact on vulnerable users.</p>

          <p>California, a leader in EV adoption, is underutilizing its abundant solar energy by primarily charging vehicles overnight with natural gas. This article advocates for shifting EV charging to midday at workplaces, where the grid is flush with solar power, potentially cutting emissions by an additional 80%. Research at UC San Diego shows that informing drivers can slightly alter habits, but stronger incentives like electricity pricing based on real-time generation costs are needed. Policy focus should extend beyond charger numbers to network quality and functionality.</p>

While some advocate for prioritizing STEM skills, many tech leaders surprisingly suggest that moral and interpersonal traits like empathy, judgment, and character will be most valuable as AI democratizes IQ. This article argues that liberal education, with its emphasis on engaging with foundational texts and fostering dialogue, is uniquely suited to cultivate these deeply humanizing skills, preparing students to think critically and live well in an increasingly technologized world.</p>

          <p>ScotRail has permanently abolished peak rail fares, making weekday travel significantly cheaper for passengers across Scotland. This policy, championed by the Scottish Greens and announced by First Minister John Swinney, aims to encourage commuters to switch from cars to trains, offering environmental benefits and substantial financial savings, with some routes seeing nearly 50% fare reductions. While a previous trial had limited success in increasing passenger numbers to self-finance the scheme, the government expects the annual cost to be between £40m and £45m, covered by the ScotRail budget.</p>
