          <p>Beijing's police authority plans to liquidate cryptocurrencies confiscated in criminal cases through licensed exchanges in Hong Kong, potentially boosting the city's virtual asset hub ambitions. The municipal Public Security Bureau in Beijing is partnering with the China Beijing Equity Exchange to sell seized cryptoassets through regulated platforms in Hong Kong, converting proceeds into yuan. This marks the first instance of a mainland agency detailing a process for disposing of confiscated cryptoassets within Hong Kong‚Äôs virtual asset regime. Mainland China enforces a strict ban on crypto trading, making the handling of seized assets complex, with billions of dollars in crypto awaiting disposal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts are questioning Apple's AI strategy as the company's initial efforts with Apple Intelligence have been underwhelming compared to competitors like OpenAI, Google, and Meta. Investors are eager to see how Apple plans to catch up in the rapidly transforming tech industry, especially as some executives suggest AI could eventually replace the iPhone. Apple Intelligence's initial features were criticized, and a key improvement to Siri was delayed, leading to class-action suits. Apple may need to acquire a company or partner with others to bolster its AI capabilities, though the company possesses advantages in chip design and unified memory.</p>

The central bank noted that the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path, though monetary policy will remain tight to reach the 4% inflation target.
