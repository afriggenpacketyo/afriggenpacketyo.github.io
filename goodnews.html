This deal marks one of the largest private capital investments in a UK national interest project.

          <p>The People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, has cautioned against an "addiction" to blind card packs and blind boxes among the country's youth. The newspaper called for strict identity verification to curb the "out-of-control consumption" of these items by minors, arguing that the allure of "unknown surprises" hides "commercial traps" that induce impulsive spending. This warning reflects regulations enacted four years ago to prevent online gaming addiction among teenagers. The purchase of blind boxes carries an element of gambling, augmented by varied designs and rarity levels, fueling the desire to collect entire sets. </p>
