          <p>The UK and the European Union have reportedly reached an agreement to reset relations following Britain's exit from the EU in 2020. The deal includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 2038, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership. Both sides will also work towards a youth mobility scheme allowing young people from the UK and EU to work, study, volunteer, or travel in each other's countries for a limited time. The agreement also explores the potential use of e-gates by UK passport holders in European airports, which could reduce long queues for British travelers.</p>

          <p>As Britain and the European Union hold their first summit since Brexit, analysts describe it less as a reunion and more as exes working together for the sake of their children. While some Britons see Brexit as a chance to control borders, others view it as an economic setback. With the war in Ukraine and a shift in US alliances, both sides are realizing they need each other more than anticipated. The summit focuses on smaller issues like fishing rights and youth mobility, while larger issues like the single market and freedom of movement remain off the table.</p>

This would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to ¬£1,720, down from the current level of ¬£1,849.
