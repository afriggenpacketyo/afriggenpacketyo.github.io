        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>King Charles's long-held urban planning ideas, once controversial, are now inspiring the next generation of 12 new towns to be announced by the UK government. These developments will emphasize walkability, environmental sustainability, and "gentle density" through terraced housing and mansion blocks, rather than high-rises. Experts note a shift in architectural consensus towards designs sensitive to local place and public preference, moving away from past "ego-driven" modernism. The King's own projects, like Poundbury, showcase these principles, aiming to create communities with quality public spaces and affordable housing, addressing past new town shortcomings.</p>

          <p>Oberlin High School in Ohio hosts "Men's Work," a program led by Johnny Cole of Hey Brother and teacher David Reese, offering teen boys a unique forum to openly discuss their struggles and the role of men today. The initiative addresses the emotional push-and-pull boys experience, often lacking adult male role models for emotional expression. It also challenges messaging from the "manosphere" that students encounter online, which can promote unhealthy ideals like steroid use. The program aims to provide a more supportive path forward, acknowledging the authentic pain young men feel while fostering healthier self-expression and identity.</p>

          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is intensifying his rhetoric against Reform UK, describing it as an "enemy" and a project detrimental to the country. Ahead of the Labour Party Conference, Starmer emphasized the need to win this "battle for the soul of this country," acknowledging Labour's past failures to address immigration concerns. He is also enthusiastically embracing the idea of a state-mandated digital ID, believing public comfort with sharing personal data online has shifted. Despite a petition against digital ID garnering over a million signatures, Starmer aims to deliver incremental improvements and convince voters that Reform's embrace would be a significant mistake.</p>

          <p>At a Philadelphia Phillies game, nine-year-old Jameson Pennings, after successfully catching a foul ball, made a heartwarming decision to gift it to Donna Morey, a fellow fan celebrating her 80th birthday. Jameson overheard Morey's daughter attempting to get a ball for her, and recognizing the slim odds for an older fan, he approached her with his prized possession. He thoughtfully explained his reasoning, noting that she was significantly older and likely wouldn't attend many more games, whereas he had numerous future opportunities to catch another. Morey was profoundly moved by the boy's selfless act, describing it as a symbol of goodness, and Jameson affirmed that he felt happier having made the gesture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records related to Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean, an event that has captivated public interest for decades. While the widely accepted theory is that Earhart ran out of fuel and crashed, other unproven theories persist, including one suggesting she was on a spy mission and captured by the Japanese. A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands had urged the declassification, citing credible accounts of Earhart being spotted on Saipan. Experts largely dismiss the spy theory, calling it "nonsense" and reiterating the fuel shortage as the most probable cause.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is slated to address several hundred senior U.S. generals and admirals in an exceptionally rare gathering at Marine base Quantico, Virginia, next week. According to U.S. officials, Hegseth plans to convey his vision for restoring the "warrior ethos" to the military and unveil new standards aimed at achieving this objective. Only officers in command positions, along with their senior enlisted advisers, are being summoned from across the globe for this unusual event. Concerns have been raised regarding the substantial security requirements and considerable travel and lodging expenses involved in bringing together such a large number of high-ranking officers, with the Pentagon planning to record the meeting for public distribution.</p>

          <p>Team Europe established a commanding 5½-2½ lead over the USA on the opening day of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage, positioning themselves strongly for their title defense. Europe effectively executed their strategy for a fast start, dominating both the morning foursomes with a 3-1 score and the afternoon fourballs with a 2½-1½ advantage, successfully quieting the notoriously boisterous New York crowd. Historical statistics heavily favor teams that lead after the first day, particularly those with strong foursomes performances, suggesting Europe is now the strong favorite. Despite US captain Keegan Bradley's defiant stance, Europe's cohesive play, exemplified by Jon Rahm's crucial two points, has generated significant optimism for securing their first away victory since 2012.</p>

          <p>Massachusetts police have concluded that a couple's story regarding finding a six-month-old female Yorkshire Terrier abandoned by the roadside was, in fact, a hoax. The husband and wife initially left the puppy at a convenience store, falsely claiming they discovered it in a cage with a "free" sign. Subsequent review of surveillance footage by Police Chief Kyle Heagney exposed the fabrication: the wife had acquired the dog from a co-worker, but her husband refused to keep it, prompting them to invent the abandonment narrative. While no charges will be filed against the couple, the puppy, found to be in good health, is now under the care of Attleboro Animal Control and will be placed for adoption, attracting significant public interest.</p>

          <p>As China progresses with drafting its 15th five-year plan, the critical role of Hong Kong as a "superconnector" between mainland China and global markets is being closely re-evaluated. Despite previous uncertainties, Hong Kong's economy has demonstrated significant resilience, evidenced by a rising stock index, a surge in fundraising activities, and its growing attractiveness to international businesses and talent. Analysts predict that Beijing's forthcoming socio-economic development blueprint will be instrumental in shaping Hong Kong's future economic trajectory, directly influencing policy decisions and the allocation of resources. The city's distinctive position is expected to be reinforced as China's broader economic strategy evolves, thereby solidifying its indispensable function in both regional and global finance.
