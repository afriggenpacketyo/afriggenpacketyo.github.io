          <p>President Trump highlighted an agreement between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, asserting that the deal would keep U.S. Steel headquartered in Pittsburgh and bring American jobs. He stated that Nippon would invest $14 billion in U.S. Steel, allocating funds to increase production in Pittsburgh and modernize facilities across several states, promising no layoffs or outsourcing. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel would remain "controlled by the USA," though specifics on the ownership structure were not detailed, and that he had rejected previous offers from Nippon until realizing their commitment to investing in America. The agreement, first announced on Trump's social media, aims to create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the economy over 14 months, despite his previous opposition to the sale during the 2024 campaign.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. would double its tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% to boost the local steel industry and decrease reliance on China. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Trump stated the move would ensure U.S. Steel's survival, reflecting on how his 25% steel tariffs in 2018 had "saved" the company. He also mentioned a $14 billion investment in the area's steel production through a partnership between U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, though details remain unclear. The announcement comes amid a court battle over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs, with an appeals court allowing them to continue after a lower court ordered the administration to halt the taxes.

The photos were commissioned by Harvard professor Louis Agassiz for research to prove white superiority, and the case sparked debate about universities' historical links to slavery.
