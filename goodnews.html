          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Prison in May, has been captured in Atlanta after a months-long manhunt. His arrest followed a brief standoff and was the result of a coordinated multi-agency operation. The escape, which occurred through a hole behind a toilet, was attributed by the sheriff to prison staffing shortages and significant design flaws in the facility, which was built in 2016.</p>

          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting indicate a strong consensus among officials to lower interest rates, primarily due to concerns about a weakening labor market. The main point of discussion was not whether to cut, but by how much, with a narrow majority favoring two more quarter-point reductions by the end of 2025. The documents reflect a shift in the balance of risks, with most participants judging that downside risks to employment had increased more than upside risks to inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

The move, aimed at boosting home ownership and social mobility, was a surprise highlight of her first conference speech as leader. Badenoch stated the estimated £9 billion annual cost would be covered by planned savings from cuts to welfare, foreign aid, and the Civil Service, framing it as a key policy to create a fairer society.</p>

          <p>Priscilla has weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm as it moves parallel to Mexico's Baja California Sur peninsula. The storm is generating large swells and gusty winds, prompting a tropical storm watch for the region from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro. According to the National Hurricane Center, Priscilla is expected to continue weakening over the next two days but will still likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coast.</p>

The article notes that while gold can perform well during periods of uncertainty, its 30-year annualized return of 7.96% is lower than the S&P 500's 10.67%. Equities are presented as a more reliable hedge against inflation because they generate earnings and pay dividends, which compound over time, unlike the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains single-purpose reverse mortgages, a lesser-known financial tool for homeowners aged 62 and older. Unlike more common reverse mortgages, these loans are restricted to one specific, lender-approved expense, such as property taxes or essential home repairs. Typically offered by state or nonprofit agencies for lower-income seniors, they feature lower costs but have limited availability and strict usage rules. The loan balance becomes due only when the homeowner sells, moves out, or passes away.</p>
