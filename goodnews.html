          <h2>Commentary Explores How New Film "Materialists" Reflects Modern Dating's Economic Realities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 05:00:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The author reflects on the new Celine Song film, "Materialists," which portrays dating through a transactional and capitalistic lens. The film, starring Dakota Johnson as a pragmatic matchmaker, explicitly links romance with financial security, a theme that reportedly dismayed some older audience members. However, the author argues this depiction accurately mirrors the current dating landscape, where economic pressures and the logic of dating apps have turned relationships into a form of "emotional capitalism." The article suggests that societal issues like wealth inequality, rather than individual cynicism, are driving this trend, making financial stability a pragmatic consideration in modern love.</p>

          <p>Australia has officially granted asylum to Ted Hui, a prominent pro-democracy activist who fled Hong Kong in 2020 amid criminal charges related to the 2019 protests. Hui, who had a HK$1 million bounty placed on him by Hong Kong police, confirmed that he and his family received the protection visas. In a statement, he expressed gratitude to the Australian government while also highlighting the bittersweet reality of being a political refugee unable to return home. He also urged Australia to increase its efforts to support other Hong Kong activists who remain imprisoned for their political beliefs.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, secured a 41-24 victory over Argentina in their Rugby Championship opener, a win that propelled them back to the number one spot in the world rankings for the first time in four years. The All Blacks established a strong first-half lead with tries from Sevu Reece, Ardie Savea, and Cortez Ratima. Although Argentina mounted a spirited second-half comeback, reducing the deficit to seven points, two late tries from substitute Samisoni Taukei'aho sealed the win for New Zealand.

          <h2>Personal Essayist Describes Finding New Appreciation for Renaissance Art Through Life Experience</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 03:00:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal reflection, the author recounts how her perception of Renaissance art transformed from youthful indifference to a profound connection shaped by life events. Initially dismissing the genre as unrelatable, she found new meaning in the works of artists like Caravaggio and Piero della Francesca after experiencing trauma and pregnancy. The essay connects this personal journey to a new Jenny Saville exhibition, which draws heavily on Renaissance masters to explore themes of motherhood. The author concludes that lived experiences, such as grief, love, and parenthood, can unlock the deep emotional resonance of historical art, making one more open to being moved by both beauty and pain.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has stepped in to end a strike by Air Canada's flight attendants less than 12 hours after it began, forcing both the airline and the union into binding arbitration. The work stoppage had already started to disrupt travel for tens of thousands of passengers during the peak summer season. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu cited the need to avoid risks to the economy as the reason for the intervention. The union, representing 10,000 flight attendants, criticized the move as a violation of their right to strike and accused the government of rewarding the airline's unwillingness to negotiate fairly on key issues like pay.</p>

          <p>After finishing second for three consecutive seasons, Arsenal is believed to be in a strong position to win the Premier League, having invested £190 million in new players over the summer. Key additions like midfielder Martin Zubimendi and striker Viktor Gyokeres are expected to strengthen the team's core and increase its goal-scoring threat. Manager Mikel Arteta has focused on building squad depth to ensure consistent performance and has implemented a more direct, faster-paced attacking style. With a squad of players largely in their peak years, expectations are high for the club to secure a major trophy this season.</p>

          <p>A cold case detective details the undercover operation that led to the capture of Bryan Patrick Miller, the "Zombie Hunter" killer responsible for two murders in the 1990s. In 2015, Detective Clark Schwartzkopf met Miller at a Chili's restaurant under the pretense of discussing Miller's local "Zombie Hunter" persona. The true purpose was to covertly obtain his DNA from a water glass. Although initially skeptical that the mild-mannered Miller could be the killer, the DNA proved to be a direct match to evidence found at the crime scenes. Miller was subsequently arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death in 2023 for the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas.</p>

          <p>Beijing's National Museum of China is currently hosting an exhibition of works by renowned 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, with a focus on his "Russianness." The exhibition, organized in collaboration with Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, showcases paintings and sketches from key periods of the artist's life within the Russian Empire. This cultural event carries geopolitical undertones, as Ukraine also claims Repin (known there as Illia Riepin) as part of its national cultural heritage. The deliberate framing of the artist's identity by the Russian and Chinese institutions highlights the ongoing cultural dimension of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the legendary West Hollywood restaurant that bears his name, has passed away at the age of 90 in his native Belgrade, Serbia. A former professional soccer player and actor, Tana opened his classic Italian restaurant in 1964, and it quickly became a favored late-night spot for Hollywood's elite, from Elizabeth Taylor to George Clooney. Known for its checkered tablecloths, clubby atmosphere, and discreet service, the restaurant became an L.A. institution. Though he sold the establishment in 2009, his legacy endures as the restaurant continues to be a beloved fixture in the city's dining scene.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Reconsiders Decades-Old "85% Rule" for Setting Road Speed Limits Amid Safety Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 00:00:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-standing principle known as the "85% rule" is being re-evaluated by federal and state transportation officials for its role in setting speed limits across the U.S. The rule suggests that a road's speed limit should be set at the speed that 85% of drivers travel at or below, effectively letting drivers dictate the limit. However, safety advocates argue this creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, increasing risks for all road users, especially pedestrians. In response to a rise in traffic fatalities, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that other factors like road use and crash frequency should also be considered.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a decisive 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, capitalizing on a series of defensive and strategic blunders by their rivals to retake sole possession of first place in the National League West. The Padres' sloppy play was evident early, with three runners caught stealing by Dodgers catcher Will Smith in the first two innings alone. A costly error by center fielder Jackson Merrill and a lack of control from starting pitcher Dylan Cease allowed the Dodgers to build a 5-0 lead quickly. The win also clinched the season series for the Dodgers, giving them a crucial tiebreaker advantage over the Padres.</p>
