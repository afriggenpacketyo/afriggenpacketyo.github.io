          <p>Gerard Comeau fought back after being fined for bringing too much beer into his province in Canada. Although he lost the legal battle, his actions may yet win the war by prompting changes to interprovincial trade regulations. The case has highlighted the restrictions on the movement of goods between Canadian provinces, potentially leading to reforms. This situation could foster a more unified national market and reduce barriers to trade within Canada.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back the Snack Wrap to its U.S. menus after a nine-year absence, starting July 10. The popular item, consisting of a tortilla filled with chicken, lettuce, and cheese, was discontinued in 2016 due to kitchen preparation complexities. The company launched a promotional webpage, snackwrapfiles.com, showcasing fan enthusiasm and a Change.org petition with nearly 19,000 signatures. The revived Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in Ranch and Spicy flavors, with simplified recipes for faster service, and prices will vary by location.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has established one of the most successful public, universal pre-K programs in the U.S., offering free pre-kindergarten to all 4-year-olds. The program was initiated through legislation closing a loophole in kindergarten funding, and it has become highly popular. Other states can learn from Oklahoma's success by focusing on the 'how' rather than the 'why,' ensuring the child care industry remains afloat, developing appropriate curriculum, and building enough facilities. The program's popularity stems from its accessibility and benefits to both children and working parents.</p>

          <p>Despite efforts to reduce reliance on Russian energy, the EU has increased imports of Russian fertilizer since the invasion of Ukraine. Russia's share of EU fertilizer imports has grown to about 30%, with imports rising by over 33% in 2024. The EU is now planning to impose tariffs on fertilizers imported from Russia and Belarus, gradually increasing them to 50% by 2028. This move aims to reduce dependency on Russian fertilizer and promote alternative sources and more sustainable practices, however, farmers' groups are not happy because they feel the EU has not done enough to develop realistic, affordable alternatives to Russian fertilizer.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) proposes setting zero-emission sales targets for manufacturers starting in 2027, increasing to 90% by 2036. While gas-powered appliances would still be available, manufacturers would face surcharges, and these fees will be used to fund an incentive program for zero-emission appliances. This plan aims to reduce air pollution and improve public health, however, opponents worry about costs for consumers and strains on the electric grid. (not investment advice)</p>
