          <p>Former professional footballer Troy Deeney has announced his selections for the Premier League's Team of the Week, highlighting several players for their exceptional performances. Among those praised were Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai for his defensive solidity and a 'magic' free-kick, and Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi for his leadership and a 'wonderful finish'. Deeney also commended players like Bournemouth's David Brooks, who he named the best player on the pitch against Tottenham, and Chelsea's Joao Pedro, whom he considers the signing of the summer so far for his immediate impact.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has stated that the club must retain captain Marc Guehi to ensure a successful season, amid transfer interest from Liverpool. Guehi, who has one year left on his contract and scored in a recent victory, has been the subject of an improved £35 million bid. Glasner emphasized that a suitable replacement for the crucial defender has not been found and that there is an agreement with the chairman to only sell Guehi if a replacement is secured. The Premier League transfer window is set to close shortly.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao has premiered her new film, “Hamnet,” an adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s novel about William Shakespeare's family and the death of their son. In an interview, Zhao described the period after her Marvel film “Eternals” as a “very painful fire,” which led to a profound personal change and influenced her more intimate approach to this new project. The film, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, has received a rapturous response at the Telluride Film Festival, marking a return to the smaller-scale, character-driven storytelling that defined her earlier acclaimed works like “Nomadland.”</p>

The Tivy Antler varsity team's season opener against Del Rio was held at Antler Stadium, the same venue that had served as a volunteer hub and memorial site following the natural disaster. The traditional Friday night football event provided a much-needed sense of unity and tradition for residents as they continue to rebuild from the widespread damage.</p>

          <h2>Financial Expert Dave Ramsey Advises Against Using a HELOC to Pay Off Daughter's Car Loan</h2>

          <p>A 61-year-old woman sought advice from financial expert Dave Ramsey after financing a $27,000 car for her daughter, who has since failed to refinance it and has accumulated traffic tickets. The mother was considering using a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or her Social Security to pay off the debt. Ramsey strongly advised against this, stating that the act had hurt, not helped, her daughter by putting her in a vehicle she couldn't afford. He recommended selling the car, covering any loan shortfall, and helping her purchase a much cheaper, more manageable vehicle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from deporting hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The emergency order came just as planes were reportedly being prepared for takeoff in Texas. Lawyers for the children argued that the government's plan to remove them without allowing them to pursue asylum claims or other legal protections was illegal. The judge justified the extraordinary measure by noting the government's decision to execute the plan during the early hours of a holiday weekend, ordering that the children be returned to government custody.</p>

          <p>Chef Gordon Ramsay announced that he was recently diagnosed with skin cancer and has undergone surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from the side of his face. The host of "Hell's Kitchen" shared photos of the bandage and stitch marks on social media, using the experience to urge his followers to wear sunscreen. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer and is rarely life-threatening, with a very high cure rate when detected and treated early. Ramsay previously used a bicycle accident to publicly advocate for wearing helmets.</p>

This arrangement was reportedly affirmed by President Trump during a meeting with Ukrainian and European leaders.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Bitcoin's price holding steady, market analysts are pointing to a significant increase in accumulation by both institutional and retail investors, suggesting a potential breakout is brewing. Research from Bitwise indicates that corporate adoption has accelerated, with demand from treasuries and other institutions now absorbing new supply at a rate roughly six times faster than it is produced. Simultaneously, data shows that accumulation across all wallet sizes, from small holders to whales, has reached its highest level since April, indicating broad-based buying pressure across the market.
