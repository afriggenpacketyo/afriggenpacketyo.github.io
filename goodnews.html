          <p>In a highly anticipated NBA Summer League matchup, the Dallas Mavericks, led by number one draft pick Cooper Flagg, secured a narrow 87-85 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. The game came down to the final seconds, with the Lakers' Bronny James missing a potential game-winning three-pointer. Despite the win, Flagg had a difficult shooting night, scoring 10 points on 5-for-21 shooting, which he described as one of the worst games of his life. The contest featured several direct matchups between the two prominent young players, providing an early glimpse into their professional careers.</p>

          <h2>Experts Suggest 'Bridge Strategy' to Maximize Social Security Retirement Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 10:37:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are highlighting the significant long-term value of delaying Social Security claims until age 70, which can substantially increase monthly payments. To make this delay feasible, a "bridge strategy" is recommended, where individuals fund their initial retirement years through other means, such as personal savings or annuities. This approach helps retirees secure a higher, inflation-protected income stream for life, although many Americans still claim benefits early at age 62, permanently reducing their payments. The article emphasizes that while delaying is generally beneficial, the decision depends on individual health and financial circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has become the second-largest investor in Throne Sport Coffee, a brand specializing in ready-to-drink coffee with lower sugar and added protein. Mahomes, who is also the brand's lead spokesman, explained that his coffee habit began functionally in his first NFL year but evolved into a genuine appreciation for the beverage. He was drawn to Throne as a healthier alternative to traditional sugary coffee drinks, aligning with his focus on nutrition as a professional athlete. The investment places Mahomes in the rapidly expanding multi-billion dollar ready-to-drink coffee market.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March. This sale coincides with a massive surge in Huang's personal wealth, which has grown by over $29 billion in 2025, placing his net worth nearly on par with that of Warren Buffett. The growth is fueled by Nvidia's soaring stock price, as the chipmaker recently became the first company to exceed a $4 trillion market capitalization. The company's dominance in providing the essential hardware for the booming artificial intelligence industry continues to drive its unprecedented financial success.</p>

Following successful trials by FIFA at the Club World Cup, the league has initiated discussions with the International Football Association Board (Ifab) for approval. If sanctioned, the cameras, which are mounted on the referee's ear, could be tested in the Premier League's US-based Summer Series. Broadcasters are reportedly enthusiastic about the technology, which offers a unique and immersive perspective on the speed and skill of the game.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin has soared to a new record high, surpassing $118,000, driven by a massive influx of capital into cryptocurrency-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion, signaling strong institutional interest. The rally was also fueled by a wave of short liquidations and broader market optimism, including expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy. This price surge marks a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency, as investors anticipate further growth from corporate adoption and potential new crypto legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy has weighed in on the possibility of Keegan Bradley serving as a playing captain for the U.S. Ryder Cup team, suggesting it reflects a fundamental difference between the American and European approaches. McIlroy believes the U.S. team is more "player-led," which can be a weakness in high-pressure situations, as seen in their previous loss in Rome. In contrast, he praised Europe's model of having a single, empowered figurehead like captain Luke Donald, who provides a clear focal point for the team. While acknowledging Bradley's strong performance, McIlroy expressed his view that the concept of a playing captain is flawed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive new study analyzing 23 years of data has found that emergency vaccination programs have been remarkably effective, reducing deaths from major diseases by approximately 60%. The research, which covered 210 outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, cholera, and measles across 49 countries, also found a similar reduction in the number of infections. Beyond the life-saving impact, the study highlights significant economic benefits, estimating that these vaccine rollouts generated savings of around $32 billion by averting deaths and disability. The findings underscore the critical value of rapid vaccination responses in managing global health crises.</p>

          <p>In an interview with Tucker Carlson, financial personality Dave Ramsey challenged the common belief that using credit cards is harmless if the balance is paid off monthly, calling it a "great lie." Ramsey asserted that data shows the vast majority of people, 78%, do not pay off their balance each month, leading to significant debt. He argued that even for disciplined users, spending with plastic psychologically encourages 12-18% more spending than using cash. Ramsey, who advocates for a debt-free lifestyle, uses only debit cards and contends they offer the same functionalities without the inherent risks and marketing-driven pitfalls of credit cards.

          <p>Levi Strauss & Co. has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance, signaling strong consumer demand for its products even as it navigates economic uncertainty from new tariffs. The denim maker now projects full-year revenue growth between 1% and 2%, a significant improvement from its previous forecast. While the company sources very little from China, it faces potential cost increases from tariffs on other manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia, which it plans to partially absorb for now. The positive outlook is driven by strong direct-to-consumer sales, growth in its women's apparel category, and successful premium pricing on new products. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration will now consider drug affordability as a key criterion when granting new "national priority" vouchers that can significantly speed up the drug approval process. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary confirmed the change, aligning with the Trump administration's stated goal of lowering prescription drug costs for Americans. The program, which can reduce review times to as little as one month, is designed to incentivize development in areas of national interest, such as domestic manufacturing and cures for major diseases. It remains unclear how the FDA will assess affordability, as drug prices are typically set after a product receives market approval.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 09:00:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the persistent lack of a powerful, unified movement demanding comprehensive childcare reform in the United States, despite widespread struggles with affordability and access. The author points to historical divisions, a cultural tendency to view childcare as a private family matter, and an under-resourced advocacy ecosystem as key barriers. While other developed nations have created robust public systems, the U.S. failed to pass a major federal bill in the 1970s, entrenching the issue as a personal problem. The piece notes, however, that new, energized parent-led organizing groups and increased philanthropic funding may signal a potential shift in political will.</p>
