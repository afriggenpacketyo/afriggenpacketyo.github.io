          <p>China's National Space Administration has released new images of the Earth and the moon captured by its Tianwen-2 spacecraft. The probe, which is reported to be in good working condition, took the photos from a distance of over 12 million kilometers. This development comes as Chinese researchers on the ground are simultaneously testing autonomous robots in lava caves to simulate future lunar exploration missions. The mission showcases China's advancing capabilities and ambitions in space exploration.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 06:26:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea's recent transfer activity, including the pursuit of forward Jo√£o Pedro, reflects new head coach Enzo Maresca's desire to make the team's attack less predictable. Maresca's system often eschews traditional full-backs in favor of numerical superiority in the midfield, which sometimes left wingers isolated last season. By acquiring versatile attackers like Jo√£o Pedro, who can play in multiple positions and link up play, the club aims to create different modes of attack. This strategy is designed to better break down defensive opponents and share the creative and goal-scoring burden across the squad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare will now block AI crawlers from scraping website data by default, a move that could significantly impact how AI models are trained. The new policy requires website owners to explicitly opt-in to allow AI bots to access their content, aiming to give creators more control and potential for compensation. Cloudflare argues that AI crawlers break the traditional internet model by using content without directing traffic or revenue back to the original source. This change could hinder the ability of AI companies like OpenAI and Google to harvest the vast amounts of data needed for their large language models.</p>

          <p>This opinion article analyzes the successful New York City mayoral primary campaign of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, suggesting it holds valuable lessons for the national Democratic party. The author argues that Mamdani's victory was built on a practical platform addressing affordability, moral integrity on foreign policy, and a focus on civic pride over fear. The campaign successfully mobilized a diverse coalition of young, working-class voters by championing progressive policies and grassroots organizing, which ultimately overpowered a well-funded opponent. The piece posits that Mamdani's approach provides a model for a more inspiring and effective Democratic party.</p>

          <p>Residents of Leavenworth, Kansas, a town with a long history of prisons, are actively opposing a plan by private prison firm CoreCivic to reopen a facility to hold immigration detainees. Citing the facility's troubled past, which included understaffing, violence, and alleged sexual assaults, local organizers, city officials, and even former prison employees are pushing back. A state judge has temporarily sided with the city, ruling that CoreCivic needs a new permit to operate. The community's resistance highlights a grassroots effort to prevent the return of a company they believe is incapable of running a humane and safe facility.</p>

          <p>Amid trade tensions with the U.S. and E.U., China has unveiled new tax breaks designed to encourage foreign companies to reinvest their profits within the country. The policy allows foreign firms to deduct 10% of the reinvested amount from their onshore taxes, with unused credits available to be carried forward. This move is part of a broader government strategy to restore investor confidence and signal that China remains open for business. The incentives apply to capital injections and equity acquisitions and can be claimed retroactively for investments made since the start of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California is exploring a proposal to move all its undergraduate campuses from a quarter system to a semester system, a move that would align the entire system under a common academic calendar. Proponents argue it would streamline transfers, joint programs, and access to internships, which are often designed for semester schedules. However, the potential change faces criticism over the significant cost, estimated between $288 million and $371 million, and concerns from faculty about increased workload. The debate highlights the tension between systemwide cohesion and the financial and logistical challenges of such a large-scale transition.</p>

The effort involves convincing cities, counties, and even nearby oil and gas operations to adopt dark-sky-friendly lighting, showcasing a successful model for protecting a vanishing natural resource.</p>

          <p>Inflation in the euro zone rose slightly to 2.0% in June, precisely meeting the European Central Bank's (ECB) target for the first time in an extended period. This figure, up from 1.9% in May, was in line with economists' expectations and was driven partly by a pickup in services inflation. The ECB's chief economist stated that the bank's cycle of interventions to lower inflation from its peak is now considered "done." This data reinforces expectations that the central bank will hold interest rates steady in its upcoming July meeting before a potential final cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting this month, approximately 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales will see their energy bills decrease by about 7% under the new price cap set by the regulator Ofgem. A typical household's annual bill will drop by around ¬£129, providing some relief to consumers. However, prices remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, and analysts forecast only a small additional drop in October, with little sign of major decreases in the coming years. Ofgem is encouraging consumers to shop around for fixed-rate deals to gain more certainty over their future payments.</p>
