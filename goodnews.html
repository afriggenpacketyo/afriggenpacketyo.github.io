          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that consumer prices in the U.S. rose by 0.1% in May, which was less than the 0.2% economists had anticipated. The annual inflation rate stood at 2.4%. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also came in lower than expected at 0.1% and 2.8% respectively. Weakness in energy prices and declines in vehicle and apparel prices helped offset increases in other areas. While the report is reassuring, some experts caution that tariff-driven price increases may take a few more months to appear in CPI data, and Vice President JD Vance called on the Fed to cut interest rates.

          <p>WhatsApp is backing Apple in its legal fight against the UK Home Office regarding user data privacy. WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart stated that the case "could set a dangerous precedent" by potentially encouraging other nations to weaken encryption. Apple initiated legal action after the Home Office requested access to the data of its global customers for national security reasons. Critics argue that this request would compromise the privacy of millions of users. WhatsApp has applied to submit evidence to the court, emphasizing its commitment to challenging any law or government request that weakens encryption.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. has reached a trade deal with China, following negotiations in London. While details are scarce, Trump said the "framework deal" still requires final approval from himself and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Under the agreement, China would maintain its current 10% tariffs on goods imported from the U.S., while the U.S. would keep 55% tariffs on Chinese imports. The U.S. also seeks the resumption and increase of rare earth element shipments from China, while offering to allow Chinese students to continue attending U.S. colleges and universities.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% on an annual basis in May, slightly cooler than expected, indicating that President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted consumer prices. Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, increased by 2.8% over the past 12 months. The inflation rate was likely tempered by a sharp decrease in gasoline prices, which fell 12% in May compared to the previous year. Experts anticipate the Federal Reserve to maintain current interest rates until later in the year, closely monitoring when Trump's tariffs will be reflected in inflation data.

To secure a good savings account rate, it is advisable to choose a high-yield savings account, explore online banks, and compare different accounts to find the most favorable terms.

Money will be allocated for renewal projects in 350 communities, such as improvements to parks, swimming pools and libraries, but this will be offset by rises in council tax.

          <p>The article discusses the right of protesters to wear masks, despite President Trump's opposition. It argues that while civil disobedience involves openly breaking the law and revealing one's identity, lawful protest occurs in a different media context. The risk of personal retribution from the Trump administration makes hiding one's identity an understandable act of caution. The Supreme Court has previously defended the right to stay anonymous, declaring it a means to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation. The author concludes that the decision to reveal or conceal their identity should be up to individuals engaged in lawful protest.</p>

He argues that the party needs to focus on making work pay and giving power to people rather than relying on handouts. Murphy suggests policies such as a higher minimum wage, stronger labor unions, and the deconcentration of economic power. He also acknowledges the need for Democrats to address the social revolution and engage in a more deliberate conversation with men about their post-feminism identity.</p>

          <p>China is walking a fine line in U.S. trade talks, balancing its leverage in limiting access to rare earth supplies with the desire to maintain its reputation as a reliable supplier. The country seeks to avoid overplaying its hand, recognizing the importance of stable trade relationships. This careful approach reflects China's broader strategy in managing its economic and political interests amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <h2>Annuities: Safety Amid Market Crashes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 08:59:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirement experts weigh in on the safety of annuities during market crashes, noting that different types of annuities offer varying levels of protection. Fixed annuities are generally considered the safest option, providing a guaranteed interest rate and set payment. Variable annuities carry more risk due to their exposure to market fluctuations, while fixed indexed annuities offer a balance between potential returns and principal protection. Deferred income annuities can provide guaranteed income for life, regardless of market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Inflation Steady as Trump's Tariffs Await Full Impact</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 08:57:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inflation remained relatively stable last month, with consumer prices up 2.4% from a year ago, as President Trump's tariffs have not yet fully impacted the economy. The price of eggs continued to fall, as the nation's flock of egg-laying hens slowly recovered from a widespread outbreak of avian flu. Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler warned that Trump's tariffs could reverse some of the progress that's been made on inflation over the last two years. The central bank is widely expected to hold interest rates steady again when Fed policymakers meet next week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. inflation rose 2.4 percent in May, reflecting the initial impact of President Trump‚Äôs tariffs. The reading indicates a limited effect from the tariffs on overall inflation. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) data suggests that the broader economy is experiencing moderate price increases despite the implementation of trade measures. The report offers insights into the current economic landscape and the potential consequences of trade policies.</p>
