          <p>The United States and Japan have finalized a significant trade deal, which includes lowering U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports from 25% to 15%. President Trump announced the agreement, stating it also involves a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and opens Japanese markets to American goods like rice and trucks. The deal is seen as a political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and has already caused a surge in Japanese automaker stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office has advised Chinese firms to deepen their integration within Southeast Asian economies. This recommendation comes as the U.S. cracks down on transshipments, with the Trump administration announcing steep tariffs on goods diverted through countries like Vietnam to avoid levies on Chinese products. By becoming more ingrained in local ASEAN economies, Chinese companies could better shield themselves from unpredictable U.S. tariff policies and contribute more directly to regional growth.

Originally the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy frigate that fought in the American War of Independence, it was later sold and repurposed as a whaling ship. The identification was made through a combination of dendrochronology, archival research, and a community-led effort by local islanders. The ship wrecked in 1788, and its surviving timbers are now being preserved with plans for a permanent display.</p>
