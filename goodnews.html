          <h2>Semaglutide Shows Promise in Reversing Liver Disease in Clinical Trial</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 05:00:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine revealed that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of liver disease. Participants with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) experienced significant improvements after receiving semaglutide, traditionally a treatment for type 2 diabetes. The study found that 62.9% of participants had less inflammation and fat accumulation in their livers compared to 34.3% in the placebo group. The researchers are planning to gather data for up to five years to determine semaglutide's impact on long-term liver complications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Five people survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The pilot, Andres Velarde, landed the craft near the Itanomas River, where the survivors stood on top of the plane surrounded by alligators. They were eventually rescued by a helicopter after being discovered by local fishermen. The survivors ate cassava flour one of the passengers had brought and believed petrol leaking from the plane had kept the predators at bay.</p>

          <h2>Man Bitten 200 Times Creates 'Unparalleled' Snake Antivenom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 02:29:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Antibodies found in Friede's blood have shown protection against fatal doses from various snake species in animal tests. This research, detailed in the journal Cell, identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that could target neurotoxins and is a step toward a universal antivenom.</p>

          <h2>Hong Kong Monetary Authority Intervenes Amid Capital Inflow</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to weaken the local currency, buying US$6.005 billion and selling HK$46.539 billion. This intervention occurred due to a recent influx of capital into the city's bourse, pushing the Hong Kong dollar above its trading band against the U.S. dollar. Further interventions are anticipated if the U.S. Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, prompting additional capital inflow to Hong Kong.</p>
