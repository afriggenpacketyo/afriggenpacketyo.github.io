          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export agreement, a £10 billion deal to supply Norway with at least five Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support approximately 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates. The deal was seen as a major victory for the British defence industry over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the U.S. government from deporting a group of ten unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala. The ruling came after lawyers argued the administration's plan would bypass legal protections designed for these minors. The plaintiffs, aged 10 to 17, entered the U.S. without guardians and are currently in government custody. Their lawyers contend that U.S. law protects them from expedited removal and that they could face significant harm if returned to Guatemala.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri secured a controlled victory at the Dutch Grand Prix, a race marked by multiple incidents and safety cars. His teammate, Lando Norris, was forced to retire from a comfortable second place with just seven laps remaining due to an oil leak, a potentially decisive moment in their private title fight. The unexpected retirement extended Piastri's championship lead to 34 points. Red Bull's Max Verstappen inherited second place, while French rookie Isack Hadjar claimed his first-ever podium finish in third place.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty, 80, has released a new album of re-recorded Creedence Clearwater Revival hits after a decades-long legal battle to regain control of his own music. For years, Fogerty did not own the rights to the classic songs he wrote and performed, a painful experience that led him to stop performing them publicly. Encouraged by his wife, Julie, he eventually bought back his catalog and recorded the new versions with his sons, who are part of his touring band. Fogerty reflected on the process of revisiting iconic tracks like "Proud Mary" and the joy of finally owning his musical legacy.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the ten-year anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy, prompted by wars in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, fundamentally reshaped German society and politics. A decade later, the nation is taking stock of both its successes and failures in integration. While many refugees have found employment and built new lives, challenges remain, and the issue continues to fuel political debate and the rise of the far-right.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White has opened up about the daunting task of playing music icon Bruce Springsteen in the upcoming film "Deliver Me From Nowhere." The movie focuses on the period when Springsteen was creating his stark 1982 album, "Nebraska." In a recent interview, White discussed his initial anxieties, his process of learning to sing and play guitar like Springsteen, and finding a personal connection to the artist's feelings of emotional turmoil. He revealed that receiving approval from Springsteen himself was crucial in giving him the confidence to fully inhabit the role.</p>

          <p>Austrian company FlyNow Aviation has successfully completed the first untethered flight of its eCopter, a personal electric helicopter designed for urban air mobility. The company aims to make this form of travel accessible to everyone, rather than operating as an exclusive air taxi service. This development is a step toward more sustainable aviation, as air travel is a significant contributor to global carbon pollution. FlyNow plans to begin commercial cargo operations by 2027, with passenger flights potentially following after extensive further testing and refinement of the technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have resolved a long-standing debate in biology by identifying the comb jelly as the first animal to diverge from the common ancestor of all animals. For years, scientists debated whether the first split was the sea sponge or the comb jelly. Using a new technique analyzing the arrangement of genes on chromosomes, scientists compared these animals to their closest non-animal relatives. The results showed that the comb jelly's genetic structure had changed the least from the original ancestor, indicating it was the first to branch off on the tree of life.</p>

          <h2>Exhibition Highlights How Three Hawaiian Princes Introduced Surfing to the U.S. Mainland</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, is shedding light on the origins of surfing in the United States. In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes demonstrated the sport at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River while attending a nearby military school. They crafted boards from local redwood trees and impressed locals with what was then called "surfboard swimming." This event is now recognized as the moment the royal sport of Hawaii was introduced to the American mainland, 140 years ago, providing a key piece of cultural history.</p>
