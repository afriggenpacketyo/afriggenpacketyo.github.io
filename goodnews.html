          <p>Japan aims to reduce the estimated death toll from a potential megaquake in the Nankai Trough by around 80% over the next 10 years, according to government and ruling party sources.

          <p>Toyota Industries is facing criticism from investors, including domestic shareholders, regarding a $33 billion buyout offer from its parent company, Toyota Motor. Shareholders voiced concerns that the offer undervalues the supplier's intrinsic value and strengthens the Toyoda family's control over the group.
