          <p>A new study reveals that parents in Europe, particularly mothers, often experience lower life satisfaction compared to child-free individuals, yet find greater meaning in life. The research, based on data from the European Social Survey, highlights that factors like family policy and gender equality significantly impact parental satisfaction levels. Scandinavian countries, with robust childcare, financial support, and parental leave policies, show smaller differences in satisfaction between parents and non-parents. The study underscores the importance of societal support and gender equality in enhancing the well-being of parents and recognizing children as a shared responsibility.</p>

Bakeries are adapting by offering "limited edition" items and focusing on high-quality ingredients and skilled staff, although rising costs present challenges. The trend is fueled by the "lipstick effect," where consumers are willing to spend on small luxuries even during economic downturns, supporting local businesses and driving innovation in the food industry.</p>

          <p>Ethan Hedges hit two home runs to lead USC baseball to a 6-4 victory over Saint Mary's in the NCAA tournament, advancing the Trojans to the Corvallis Regional final. Hedges, who had been in a slump, broke out with the go-ahead long ball, powering USC closer to their first super regionals appearance since 2005. Pitcher Mason Edwards delivered an efficient performance, and Caden Hunter secured his first save, contributing to the team's resilient effort. The Trojans are now one win away from advancing to the super regionals.</p>

          <p>Perth-based AVZ Minerals has suspended its arbitration case against the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) following encouragement from the US to resolve a dispute over the Manono lithium project. The US is backing KoBold Metals, funded by tech billionaires, to acquire AVZ's stake and invest US$1 billion in the project. This move aims to counter China's Zijin Mining, which controls the northern section after Congo revoked AVZ's rights in 2023. The US is seeking to secure critical minerals in Congo and challenge China's dominance in the country.</p>
