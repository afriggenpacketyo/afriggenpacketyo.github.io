          <h2>China's Exports Surpass Expectations in June Following US Trade Truce</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 23:09:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a significant 5.8% year-on-year increase in June, exceeding market predictions. This acceleration is attributed to exporters capitalizing on a temporary 90-day tariff truce with the United States to expedite shipments. Imports also saw an unexpected rise of 1.1%, contributing to a monthly trade surplus of nearly $114.8 billion. Despite ongoing trade tensions, China's trade performance has remained robust through the first half of the year, signaling some resilience in its export-oriented economy.</p>

          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a symbol of women's rights in France, has been awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for her courageous public testimony against her ex-husband and 50 other men who had drugged and sexually assaulted her over a decade. Her insistence on a public trial shocked the nation and was instrumental in pushing for legal reforms, including a new bill that incorporates the lack of consent into the criminal definition of sexual assault. Pelicot's advocacy has been widely praised for empowering survivors and challenging societal norms.</p>

          <p>On the one-year anniversary of the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, President Donald Trump released a statement reflecting on the event. He credited divine intervention for his survival and reaffirmed his political mission, while honoring the first responders and citizens who acted heroically during the chaos. Trump paid special tribute to Corey Comperatore, the rally attendee who was killed while protecting his family. The incident, which raised serious questions about Secret Service protocols, remains a significant and somber moment in recent political history.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, successfully avoiding a technical recession after a 0.5% contraction in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was largely driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry issued a caution, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks for the second half of the year, primarily due to unclear U.S. tariff policies. This economic data precedes an upcoming monetary policy decision by the country's central bank.</p>

          <p>Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, has indicated a readiness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market shows signs of slowing. In a recent interview, Bailey stated his belief that the path for interest rates, currently at 4.25%, is downward. He pointed to signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay increases, which could help reduce inflation. This statement comes as the UK economy shows signs of contraction, adding pressure on the government to stimulate growth.</p>
