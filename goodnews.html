          <p>Air Canada has announced plans to resume flight operations after the Canadian government intervened in a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, forcing both parties into binding arbitration. The strike, which began on Saturday, had stranded over 100,000 travelers during the peak summer season. While the airline is working to stabilize its schedule over the next week, the flight attendants' union has stated that demonstrations will continue, as they still seek a fairly negotiated contract rather than an arbitrated settlement.</p>

          <p>Following a summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff announced a significant diplomatic development, claiming Russia has agreed to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine an "Article 5-like" security guarantee. This type of protection, which mirrors NATO's collective defense principle, has been a key demand from Ukraine and was previously a major point of contention with Moscow. Witkoff described the concession as "game-changing" for the ongoing peace negotiations, suggesting it could serve as a viable alternative to Ukraine's formal NATO membership.</p>

          <p>Icelandic singer and cellist Laufey has captivated a large and devoted young audience by skillfully blending modern pop sensibilities with the sounds of classical music and jazz. In a recent interview, the 26-year-old artist discussed how her unique musical style, which she calls a "mishmash," is rooted in her childhood influences, including Golden Age musicals and her parents' diverse musical tastes. Her approach has led to sold-out concerts, a Grammy Award for her album "Bewitched," and a growing reputation for making older genres accessible to a new generation.</p>

          <p>In a significant display of solidarity, leaders from the European Commission, NATO, France, and Germany announced they will join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his upcoming meeting with President Trump in Washington. This collective move is seen as an effort to ensure European perspectives are central to any peace negotiations and to support Ukraine's position following President Trump's bilateral summit with Vladimir Putin. The united front aims to prevent a repeat of a previous contentious White House meeting and reinforce the transatlantic alliance's commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty.</p>

          <h2>VAR Disallows Eberechi Eze's Free-Kick Goal Due to Attacking Player in Wall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 10:06:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A stunning free-kick from Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was disallowed following a VAR review, causing initial confusion among fans. The decision was made because a Palace player was positioned less than one meter away from the Chelsea defensive wall as the kick was taken. This action violates a rule introduced in the 2019-20 season, which is intended to prevent attacking players from interfering with the wall and causing delays. The referee announced the specific rule infringement to the crowd, confirming the goal was correctly chalked off.</p>
