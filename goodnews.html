          <p>Sean Dickson guided Somerset to a dramatic victory over the Bears in the T20 Blast quarter-final with a stunning late-game performance. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson hit two sixes and a four to secure the win with just one ball to spare, finishing with an unbeaten 71 from 26 balls. Despite a strong start from the Bears, who set a target of 190-6, Somerset's victory marks their record-equalling 11th appearance at the T20 Blast finals day, continuing the Bears' streak of last-eight defeats. The win was a remarkable comeback after Somerset's run chase appeared to be faltering.</p>

          <p>The recent NFL game between the Chargers and Chiefs in São Paulo, Brazil, is a key component of the league's strategy for sustained global growth rather than a one-off event. The NFL is focused on year-round engagement in international markets, with teams now holding rights in various countries and a record seven international games scheduled for the season. Despite American football's niche status in soccer-dominated Brazil, the game drew nearly 50,000 fans, demonstrating the potential for expansion. The league's approach includes media deals, like one with Brazil's Globo, to build a lasting international fan base and establish itself as a global sport.</p>

Guo was held after landing his single-engine plane without proper authorization while attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents for charity. He was released after agreeing to pay $30,000 in penalties, donate his raised funds to a Chilean childhood cancer foundation, and accept a three-year ban from the country. His lawyer argued the landing was due to poor weather, describing the subsequent arrest and detention as an overreaction by authorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England defeated Andorra 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier, but the performance was widely seen as lackluster and failed to inspire confidence under new manager Thomas Tuchel. An own goal and a header from Declan Rice secured the victory, maintaining England's strong position in their group without conceding a goal in the campaign. However, critics noted a lack of creativity and momentum, with some arguing the team has regressed since the last European Championship. The uninspiring play was evident as thousands of fans left Villa Park well before the final whistle, highlighting concerns ahead of a tougher match against Serbia.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured pole position at the Italian Grand Prix by setting the fastest lap in Formula 1 history, surpassing a 2020 record held by Lewis Hamilton. Verstappen's lap averaged 164.466 mph, a feat achieved due to the current cars' lower drag, a resurfaced Monza track with better grip, and other technical factors. This achievement breaks a long-standing benchmark at a circuit known for high speeds. Despite the record, Verstappen remains cautious about his chances in the race, acknowledging McLaren's typically stronger race pace this season but expressing optimism based on his car's long-run performance in practice.</p>

          <p>The UK government is advising citizens to "keep their cool" during a nationwide test of its emergency alert system scheduled for Sunday at 3:00 PM BST. Compatible mobile phones will emit a siren-like sound and vibrate for ten seconds, displaying a test message, even if on silent mode. This is the second national test of the system, which is designed to warn the public of life-threatening situations like extreme weather or terror attacks. The government aims to ensure the system's effectiveness after a previous test revealed technical glitches, while domestic abuse charities have reissued advice for victims with concealed phones.</p>

          <p>A 200-pound bear named Okan has become a viral sensation in Turkey after footage showed him being treated for an upset stomach caused by eating too much fruit. The bear was taken to Istanbul University’s veterinary facility, where he underwent scans and tests before being released back to his wildlife park in good health. This was not Okan's first instance of fruit-related indigestion, as he received similar treatment three years prior. Workers at the Park of Istanbul Nature and Life Complex are now carefully monitoring his diet to prevent future incidents, while visitors enjoy seeing the now-famous bear back and playful.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses secured their place in the Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia, extending their winning streak to 30 consecutive Tests. Despite a shaky start where Australia scored first and dominated possession, England recovered to score seven tries, with Sadia Kabeya and Kelsey Clifford each scoring twice. The win sets up a quarter-final match against Scotland, but England faces injury concerns for key players Ellie Kildunne and Hannah Botterman. The initial struggle against the seventh-ranked Wallaroos may offer encouragement to England's top rivals as the tournament enters the knockout stage.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order authorizing sanctions and other punitive measures against countries that wrongfully detain American citizens. The order creates a "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, similar to the state sponsor of terrorism list, which can trigger penalties like economic sanctions and visa restrictions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the unprecedented action is designed to impose new consequences on governments that use Americans as bargaining chips. According to the Foley Foundation, at least 54 Americans were wrongfully detained in 17 countries during 2024, highlighting the scale of the issue.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is continuing a government reshuffle, with several ministers moving from the Home Office following Yvette Cooper's shift to the Foreign Office. The changes were prompted by the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and are seen as an attempt by Starmer to reset his government's agenda. Key appointments include new ministers at the Home Office to focus on illegal immigration and a new Labour Party chair. The reshuffle also brings new faces into the business and treasury departments, including a successful businessman appointed to the House of Lords to serve as a minister.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has chosen his home state of Delaware as the site for his presidential library and museum. A 13-person governance board, including former top aides like Antony Blinken and Steve Ricchetti, has been approved to oversee the project. The Joe and Jill Biden Foundation stated the library will be a space for history, learning, and civic leadership. While Biden has deep roots in Pennsylvania, he ultimately selected Delaware, the state that launched his extensive political career. The library's fundraising team now faces the challenge of securing significant private funding for the legacy project.</p>
