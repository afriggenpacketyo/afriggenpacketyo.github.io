          <p>U.S. asset management giant Apollo is set to provide a ¬£4.5 billion ($6 billion) loan to U.K. nuclear project Hinkley Point to address a funding shortfall. The construction of the Hinkley Point C plant, the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain in decades, has faced delays and budget increases. Apollo will provide an investment-grade, unsecured debt financing package for the project at an interest rate below 7%.

Just before Luxon's arrival, Wellington suspended funding to the Cook Islands over its deepening ties with Beijing. Xi stated that cooperation should be given "a more prominent position" in the relationship, suggesting exploration of collaboration in technological innovation, climate change, and infrastructure development.</p>

          <p>The musical "Parade" tells the story of Leo Frank, who was wrongly convicted of murdering a young employee in 1913 Georgia. Director Michael Arden's Tony-winning revival at the Ahmanson Theatre explores themes of antisemitism and systemic bias in the judicial system. The production uses a neo-Brechtian staging to seamlessly transmit the historical background, allowing the focus to be on the human figures caught in the snares of American bigotry and barbarism. The production's timeliness is disconcerting, as it delves into systemic bias in our judicial system and the power of a wily demagogue to stoke atavistic hatred for self-gain.</p>
