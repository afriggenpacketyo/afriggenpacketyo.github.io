          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively. The former co-stars of the 2024 film *It Ends with Us* have been engaged in a legal dispute for several months, with a trial initially scheduled for the following year. Judge Lewis Liman dismissed Baldoni's countersuit, which included allegations of extortion and defamation, after Lively filed a complaint accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment and initiating a smear campaign against her. The judge's decision brings an end to this chapter of the legal battle between the actors.</p>

          <p>The UK government's decision to largely reverse cuts to winter fuel payments has raised questions about its spending plans and fiscal rules. The government initially planned to restrict payments to only pensioners receiving pension credit, but reversed course after criticism. Now, all pensioners will receive the payment, clawed back in the following tax year from individuals earning ¬£35,000 and above. This change will cost ¬£1.25 billion, requiring the Treasury to address a gap in the government's finances in the next budget. The savings from this new plan are lower than initially projected, leading to adjustments in the government's fiscal strategy.</p>

Volatility refers to how much a stock's price fluctuates, while diversification means spreading investments across multiple asset classes to manage risk. Investment horizon is the period one expects to keep money invested before needing it, aligning with specific investing practices.

However, this article argues that there is value in men publicly and unabashedly expressing their love. It is a by-product of social media's tendency to reduce behaviors to caricature and the monetization of identities. The author suggests that embracing vulnerability and sharing love should be encouraged, even if it invites skepticism or eye-rolls, as it enriches personal connections and challenges societal norms.</p>
