          <p>Ahead of an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting, U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff held discussions with senior Ukrainian officials in New York. The meeting focused on providing a status update on the war with Russia and reaffirming the goal of bringing both nations to the negotiating table to end the conflict. Witkoff's diplomatic approach has been praised by various U.S. and foreign officials as a constructive step toward brokering a peace agreement, despite criticism from some quarters regarding his experience. This diplomatic push continues even as Ukraine faces renewed large-scale attacks from Russia.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has prevented the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the United States. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's injunction, arguing that the administration likely overstepped its authority in trying to terminate the protections. The ruling provides temporary relief for Venezuelans who fled their country's severe political and economic crisis. The Department of Homeland Security, under the Trump administration, had argued that conditions in Venezuela had improved enough to end the temporary program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An excerpt from Dr. Sanjay Gupta's upcoming book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," details innovative research into chronic pain that focuses on the brain as both the source and solution. The article highlights a shift toward "reverse translational research," where scientists study patients' real-world experiences to identify objective biomarkers for pain. This approach has led to groundbreaking trials using deep brain stimulation (DBS) to predict and intercept pain signals before they are fully experienced. While not yet widely available, these advancements demonstrate that pain circuitry is measurable and treatable, offering new hope for millions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung's first summit with President Trump was marked by a friendly and personal tone, easing concerns about potential friction between the two leaders. Lee's preparatory efforts, which included studying Trump's negotiation style, appeared to pay off as key proposals, such as a plan to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry, were well-received. Despite the positive start, analysts caution that significant unresolved issues remain, including the formal details of a new trade agreement and the cost-sharing arrangement for U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. The long-term stability of the relationship will depend on navigating these complex negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of large, historic "trophy" ranches in the American West are being put on the market for the first time in generations. High-end brokers report that as families expand and heirs become geographically scattered or disinterested in ranching, many are choosing to sell these legacy properties. The demand for such ranches remains strong, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect, with wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a connection to nature. This trend reflects a significant generational transfer of wealth, as properties that have been in families for over a century are now being sold, often for tens of millions of dollars.</p>

          <p>With interest rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remaining high, savers can earn significant returns on their money with minimal risk. A $30,000 deposit in a CD could currently earn anywhere from over $300 for a three-month term to more than $6,700 for a five-year term. The article explains that the fixed-rate nature of CDs makes them an attractive option for those seeking predictable growth, especially with potential future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. However, it also cautions that funds are locked in for the duration of the term, making them less flexible than high-yield savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>YouTube and Fox have successfully negotiated a new distribution deal, ensuring that Fox channels like Fox News and Fox Sports will remain available on the YouTube TV streaming platform. The agreement was reached after a brief standoff where YouTube warned subscribers that it might have to drop the channels due to Fox's demand for significantly higher fees. A blackout would have caused subscribers to miss major sporting events, including a highly anticipated college football game and the start of the NFL season. While the financial terms were not disclosed, the resolution is a positive outcome for the platform's 9.4 million subscribers.</p>

          <p>Canadian author Miriam Toews's new memoir, "A Truce That Is Not Peace," delves into her motivations for writing in the wake of the suicides of her father and sister. The book examines how the act of writing serves as a way to continue her conversations with her lost loved ones and to seek a form of coherence in the face of unspeakable grief. Drawing inspiration from the poet Christian Wiman, Toews explores how literature can help one live with painful memories without being entirely consumed by them. The article suggests that for Toews, writing is not about finding closure but is a vital process of honoring her past and keeping her family's memory alive.</p>

In an interview, Carpenter explained that the album was written during a difficult personal period and that her songwriting is a way to process her experiences, including her sexuality. The original album cover, which depicted her in a kneeling position, was intended to be open to interpretation about control and the lack of it. Carpenter stated that while some critics misunderstood the image, her fans and family understood its intended meaning and context within the album's themes.</p>

          <p>A record $30 billion is expected to be legally wagered by Americans on the upcoming NFL season, an 8.5% increase from the previous year, according to the American Gaming Association. Major sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings are preparing for their busiest period, but they face increasing competition from both licensed rivals and illegal offshore betting sites. In response to the growth of unlicensed gambling, which costs states an estimated $4 billion in tax revenue, law enforcement is stepping up its crackdown. Recently, Los Angeles filed a lawsuit against an online casino operator, and attorneys general have urged federal action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British Cycling has issued an apology after its website's automated content filter censored the name of the Welsh village of Three Cocks. The village, located in Powys, was listed as "Three *****" in the details for a junior road race it hosted over the weekend. A spokesperson explained that the system's "overly sensitive filters" had inappropriately decided to "spare our blushes." The organization acknowledged the humorous side of the incident, which brought national attention to the event, and promised to review its systems to prevent technology from overriding common sense in the future.</p>
