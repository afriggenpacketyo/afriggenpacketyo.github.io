          <p>A New Jersey federal judge issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from deporting or continuing to detain Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist from Columbia University. Judge Michael Farbiarz barred the administration from removing Khalil based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that his presence posed a risk to foreign policy. The judge stayed the injunction to allow the Department of Homeland Security time to appeal the decision. The ruling is a blow to the administration's efforts to deport Khalil, who has been detained since March, but the government can still pursue deportation for other reasons. The ruling is a blow to the Trump administration's efforts to deport Khalil.</p>

          <p>Oracle's shares surged after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, signaling accelerated cloud growth. The company expects cloud infrastructure revenue to increase by over 70% in fiscal year 2026 and projects revenue exceeding $67 billion. Oracle announced partnerships with Cleveland Clinic, G42, and IBM, and SoftBank is acquiring Oracle-backed chip design startup Ampere. Chinese online retailer Temu is also moving infrastructure to Oracle's cloud. These factors have boosted investor confidence in Oracle's future prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on the foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The judge issued a preliminary injunction, stating that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged and his speech was being chilled, causing irreparable harm. However, the ruling does not prevent the administration from pursuing deportation for other reasons, such as alleged omissions on his green card application. The case highlights the ongoing debate over the administration's use of foreign policy concerns to justify the deportation of pro-Palestinian activists. The judge found that the government is almost certainly detaining Khalil right now because of the Rubio determination, and not due to issues with his green card application.</p>

          <h2>Trump Softens Stance on Chinese Students After Vowing to Revoke Visas</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has seemingly softened his stance on Chinese students studying in the U.S., stating that they are welcome after previously threatening to revoke their visas. This shift comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested the U.S. would aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or who studied certain "critical fields." Universities depend on the tuition fees paid by international students and see Chinese and other foreign students as integral to their academic operations. The potential shift has exacerbated growing uncertainty at universities, which have been dealt a barrage of actions under Trump. The decision to allow Chinese students to come here is part of the importance of the United States being a draw for students from everywhere.</p>
