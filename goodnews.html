          <p>Dell Technologies has pledged to contribute $1,000 to so-called Trump accounts for new children of its employees, matching potential government contributions under a proposed savings program for newborns. CEO Michael Dell announced this commitment at a White House roundtable with President Donald Trump, while Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs chief David Solomon expressed support for the plan, which is part of a Republican-backed budget bill. The program, previously known as "Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement" or "MAGA Accounts," would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. The bill faces pushback in the Senate from fiscally conservative Republicans. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Canada has pledged to meet NATO's 2% defense spending target by March of next year, years ahead of previous commitments. Prime Minister Mark Carney announced the military buildup, citing the need to address multiplying threats from hostile governments, terrorist entities, and cyber criminals. The plan includes investing in new submarines, aircraft, ships, and other equipment to improve military preparedness. Canada's defense spending was 1.4% of its GDP in 2024. </p>

          <h2>The Necessity of Critical Minerals for Clean Energy Transition</h2>

          <p>The clean energy transition hinges on the availability of critical minerals such as lithium, copper, and cobalt, which are essential for producing, storing, and transmitting electricity without greenhouse gases. Demand for these minerals is projected to increase significantly by 2040, driven by the growth of electric vehicles, batteries, and renewable energy technologies. However, the uneven distribution of these minerals and potential supply chain disruptions pose challenges. Efforts are underway to diversify sources, develop alternative materials, and improve mining efficiency to ensure a sustainable supply of critical minerals for the clean energy transition. </p>

          <h2>Premiership Chiefs Critique R360 Rugby Plans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 15:00:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premiership bosses have expressed concerns about the proposed R360 rugby event, questioning its feasibility and potential impact on the existing rugby structure. The plans, which involve running in two blocks from April to June and August to September, could clash with domestic rugby in Europe. There are concerns that any R360 recruits would risk their Test career, given England's contractual obligation to pick players from Premiership clubs. With upcoming tournaments like the Nations Cup and Club World Cup, there are fears that the start-up competition could undermine recent gains in the sport. </p>
