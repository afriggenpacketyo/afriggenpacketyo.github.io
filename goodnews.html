          <p>Following Pete Rose's reinstatement to Major League Baseball, a debate has ignited regarding his eligibility for the Baseball Hall of Fame, despite his lifetime ban for betting on baseball games. Some argue that Rose's on-field achievements, including being the all-time Hit King, warrant his inclusion, while others maintain that his actions compromised the integrity of the game. The article emphasizes that the Hall of Fame should honor his accomplishments as a player, and that his personal failings should not overshadow his greatness. The Classic Baseball committee is not scheduled to meet until December 2027 to determine Rose‚Äôs fate.</p>

          <p>A government minister in the UK has confirmed that they are actively pursuing a deal with the EU to allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports, aiming to reduce border queues and improve travel efficiency. The negotiations are occurring ahead of a UK-EU summit in London, where broader agreements on trade, security, and youth mobility are also expected. The deal has sparked concerns from some Conservative MPs who fear it could lead to the UK becoming a "rule taker" by aligning with EU standards, potentially undermining British sovereignty.</p>

          <h2>RSV Hospitalizations in Babies Drop Dramatically Due to New Preventative Measures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 07:00:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CDC study indicates a significant decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies under seven months old, attributed to the widespread availability of a vaccine for pregnant individuals and a monoclonal antibody treatment for infants. Hospitalizations decreased by as much as 56% compared to pre-pandemic RSV seasons, with newborns experiencing a decrease of up to 71%. However, older children did not see the same benefit, suggesting that the shots are indeed behind the decrease in hospitalizations for younger children. The study underscores the impact of preventative measures in protecting young infants from severe illness.</p>

          <p>Two volumes of the 2,300-year-old Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, the earliest known in China, have returned to Beijing after 79 years abroad. The manuscripts, dating back to the Warring States Period, were illegally excavated in 1942 and acquired by an American collector before being gifted to the Smithsonian in 1992. The repatriation followed diplomatic efforts and the Smithsonian's new ethical returns policy. Volume I, a larger and more complete work, remains privately owned, and efforts are underway to facilitate its return to China.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in Southern California have successfully performed the first human bladder transplant, marking a significant advancement in treating debilitating bladder conditions. The procedure was conducted on a 41-year-old man who had lost bladder capacity due to cancer treatments. Doctors plan to conduct four more transplants as part of a clinical trial to assess the procedure's long-term outcomes. The transplant offers a potential alternative to traditional bladder removal methods that involve repurposing bowel tissue, which can lead to complications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An essay discusses how Desi Arnaz, the Cuban immigrant and bandleader, challenged racial barriers in early television and revolutionized the entertainment industry. The author argues that Arnaz's success, despite initial resistance from network executives, demonstrates the importance of diversity and inclusion in creating culturally relevant and successful content. Arnaz's innovations, such as filming ‚ÄúI Love Lucy‚Äù and owning the show's negatives, transformed the television business model and paved the way for greater representation of Latino stories in popular culture. His story is a reminder that embracing differences can lead to groundbreaking achievements.</p>
