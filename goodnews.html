          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that he has assembled a group of "very wealthy people" ready to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. This development comes amid the ongoing uncertainty over the platform's future, governed by a 2024 law requiring its Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest or face a ban due to national security concerns. Trump, who recently extended the divestiture deadline, stated he believes Chinese President Xi Jinping would likely approve such a deal. The fate of any potential sale remains complex, as it would require navigating both U.S. regulations and securing approval from Beijing.</p>

          <p>Sumo wrestler Onosato, recently promoted to the sport's highest rank of yokozuna, has declared his ambition to win the upcoming Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament. Achieving victory in a debut tournament as a grand champion is a rare feat, accomplished by only six wrestlers in history. The 25-year-old is the first Japanese-born wrestler to reach the rank since 2017 and feels a strong connection to his hometown, which was affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake. He hopes his success in the ring will bring energy and inspiration to the people of his home prefecture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has announced the conditional resumption of seafood imports from Japan, partially lifting a blanket ban that was imposed in 2023. The prohibition was enacted in response to Japan's release of treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. According to the new customs notice, the measure will allow shipments of aquatic products from most of Japan to resume. However, the ban will remain in effect for ten key prefectures, including Fukushima, Tokyo, and several others in the surrounding region. The move signals a potential, albeit limited, de-escalation of trade tensions between the two Asian powers over the issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax on large technology companies just one day before the first payments were due. The reversal came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was terminating all trade discussions with Canada in response to the tax, which he argued unfairly targeted American firms. Ottawa's move was made "in anticipation" of resuming negotiations for a comprehensive trade arrangement. This decision marks a significant de-escalation in a brewing trade dispute between the two closely-linked economies, allowing for the resumption of critical economic and security talks.</p>

          <h2>Studies Investigate Why Electric Vehicles Are More Likely to Induce Motion Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon now being studied by researchers. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs are a primary cause. In particular, the regenerative braking systems, which convert kinetic energy back into electrical energy to charge the battery, can result in low-frequency deceleration that provokes queasiness. This issue of passenger health and comfort is becoming a key area of focus for automotive engineers as they work to refine the driving experience in the new generation of vehicles.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has voiced serious concerns about the new, expanded 32-team FIFA Club World Cup, stating it could potentially "destroy" his team's 2025-26 season. He highlighted the relentless schedule and the minimal rest period for players as a major issue that could lead to exhaustion and negatively impact their domestic campaign. While acknowledging that his club must follow the rules of the competition, his comments align with those of other top managers who have criticized the increasing fixture congestion in elite football. Guardiola's main focus for the tournament is to manage his players' recovery.</p>
