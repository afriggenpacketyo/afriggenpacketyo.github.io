          <p>Experts are planting over 1,000 nursery-grown elkhorn coral juveniles in Florida Keys to combat the severe decline of coral reefs. Florida Keys have lost 90% of their healthy coral cover in the last 40 years due to climate change. The corals, spawned at the Florida Aquarium, are being acclimatized and distributed to research partners for planting at designated offshore sites.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth, causing pain from cold or dental work, can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Yara Haridy, an evolutionary biologist, discovered that structures in ancient invertebrate armor resembled vertebrate teeth, indicating a shared function of sensing. By examining modern-day fish embryos, she found nerves in tooth-like scales, suggesting that ancient fish used their armor to sense their surroundings. This research explains why humans experience toothaches, connecting it to our evolutionary history.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief has stated that the bloc is committed to securing a trade deal with the US based on "respect" rather than "threats," following US President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from the EU. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic emphasized the importance of mutual respect in EU-US trade relations and affirmed the EU's readiness to defend its interests.
