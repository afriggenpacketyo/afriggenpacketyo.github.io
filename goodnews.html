          <p>An excerpt from Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," details a shift in chronic pain research toward a "bedside to the bench" approach. This method prioritizes patients' real-world experiences to guide laboratory studies, a reversal of the traditional research process. The article highlights groundbreaking work at UCSF where scientists have successfully mapped the unique neural signatures of chronic pain in individuals' brains. This has enabled them to predict pain bursts and use deep brain stimulation to interrupt the signals, offering a potential future where pain is objectively measured and treated with precision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising credit card debt in the U.S., this article outlines several debt relief strategies for individuals facing financial hardship. Options range from traditional debt consolidation loans, which combine multiple debts into one payment, to debt management plans offered by credit counseling agencies that negotiate lower interest rates. The piece also covers debt forgiveness programs, where companies negotiate to reduce the total amount owed, and internal forbearance programs from credit card issuers. Each option has different qualification requirements based on factors like credit score, income, and the level of financial distress, requiring careful consideration of the associated trade-offs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of multigenerational, large-scale ranches in the American West are being listed for sale as heirs find it difficult to manage the properties or prefer to cash out their inheritance. High-end brokers report a significant increase in inventory for these so-called trophy properties, driven by family disagreements and a generational shift away from ranching life. Demand remains strong, partly due to the "Yellowstone" effect, with wealthy buyers seeking privacy, vast open spaces, and a connection to nature. These legacy properties often command premium prices due to their history, acreage, and surrounding undeveloped public lands.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With current interest rates, a $30,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) can generate significant returns, offering a predictable and less volatile alternative to the stock market. Depending on the term length, earnings can range from over $300 for a three-month CD to more than $6,700 for a five-year CD. The article notes that locking in a high, fixed rate now is advantageous as it protects savings from anticipated future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, it also cautions that the main drawback is the lack of liquidity, as funds are inaccessible without penalty until the CD matures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Differentiates California's State Police Surge from Federal Troop Deployments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 12:20:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that California Governor Gavin Newsom's deployment of state highway patrol officers is fundamentally different from President Trump's use of the National Guard. While both actions aim to address public concerns about crime, Newsom's strategy involves using trained police officers for targeted, data-driven enforcement in partnership with local agencies. In contrast, the use of military troops is framed as a tool of repression that is less suited for civilian law enforcement. The article suggests Newsom's move acknowledges the need for enforcement but remains within a broader state framework that also emphasizes police reform and rehabilitation programs.</p>

          <p>Fox Corporation and YouTube have successfully negotiated a new distribution deal, ensuring that channels like Fox News and Fox Sports will remain available on the YouTube TV streaming platform. The agreement averts a potential blackout that could have occurred after the previous contract expired, which would have impacted subscribers ahead of major sporting events. While the financial terms were not disclosed, the negotiations were reportedly contentious, with YouTube initially stating that Fox was demanding significantly higher fees than comparable partners. The resolution is a positive outcome for the platform's roughly 9.4 million subscribers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canadian novelist Miriam Toews's new memoir, "A Truce That Is Not Peace," delves into the profound question of why she writes, linking her craft to the suicides of her father and sister. The book examines how writing has become a way for her to process grief and continue a form of conversation with her lost family members. Drawing inspiration from other writers, particularly poet Christian Wiman, Toews explores the idea that literature can help give coherence to a life marked by tragedy without offering false closure. The article suggests her work is an attempt to honor her past and, in a way, keep her family's memory alive.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter has released her seventh album, "Man's Best Friend," and discussed its creation and the viral debate surrounding its original cover art in an interview. She described the songwriting process as collaborative and a way to channel personal experiences, including topics related to her sexuality. The controversial cover, which depicted her kneeling with a hand on someone's thigh, was intended to be open to interpretation about control and vulnerability. Carpenter also spoke about her friendship with Taylor Swift, with whom she toured and is featured on an upcoming song, expressing her long-held admiration for the fellow artist.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could disproportionately benefit certain stocks, particularly in the housing and financial sectors. Companies like Home Depot could see increased demand from a revitalized housing market, while financial firms such as Capital One may profit from higher consumer spending and loan activity. The article also notes that high-yield dividend stocks, like those of Bristol Myers Squibb, could become more appealing to investors seeking returns greater than those from lower-yield government bonds. However, the ultimate impact depends heavily on the bond market's reaction to the Fed's policy shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A record $30 billion is projected to be wagered legally by Americans on the upcoming NFL season, according to the American Gaming Association. This forecast represents an 8.5% increase from the previous year, highlighting the continued rapid growth of the legal sports betting market. Major operators like FanDuel and DraftKings are preparing for their busiest period, but they face increasing competition from other brands and a significant threat from unlicensed offshore sportsbooks. In response, state and local prosecutors are beginning to crack down on these illegal operations to reclaim lost tax revenue.</p>

Despite these challenges, airlines like American and United are preparing to fly approximately 7 million passengers over the weekend. For those traveling by car, gas prices are slightly lower on average than last year, providing some relief for road trippers.</p>

          <p>The Spanish government has canceled a €10 million contract that would have expanded the use of Huawei's fiber-optic technology in a public network spanning the country. The digital transformation ministry intervened at the last minute to block the deal, citing the need to protect Spain's "strategic autonomy." This decision aligns Madrid more closely with directives from the European Union, which has urged member states to remove high-risk vendors like Huawei from their critical 5G networks due to security concerns. The move reverses a recent trend where Spain had been increasing its reliance on the Chinese tech giant's equipment.</p>
