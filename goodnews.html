          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, emerged victorious at the 2025 Scripps National Spelling Bee after previously being a runner-up. Zaki correctly spelled "eclaircissement" to secure the win, collapsing on stage in excitement after spelling the final letters. The competition was intense, with Zaki facing off against other accomplished spellers in the final rounds after multiple misspellings from his competitors, and he ultimately prevailed after a calm and collected performance. This win marks Zaki as only the fifth runner-up in the bee's history to return and claim the top prize, a feat last achieved in 2001. The Scripps National Spelling Bee is an annual competition that brings together students from across the United States to test their spelling prowess with increasingly challenging words. The event showcases the dedication and academic talent of young spellers from around the country.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to resume importing seafood from Japan after a two-year ban imposed due to concerns over the discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing, with exports set to begin once China completes its necessary procedures. The agreement is based on China's participation in water sampling missions as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and Japan will need to register fishery processing facilities with Chinese authorities and ensure seafood is inspected for radioactive substances.</p>

          <p>Japan has stated that it has no intention of purchasing defense equipment from the United States in exchange for the easing of tariff measures. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani emphasized that tariff negotiations and security issues are separate matters, and equipment purchases will be based on what is necessary for Japan's peace and defense. This statement follows comments from Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggesting that defense equipment purchases could help reduce the trade deficit, potentially serving as a bargaining chip in bilateral talks.</p>

She contends that Britain cannot afford their economic approaches and needs leaders who do not treat economics like entertainment.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's time in the Trump administration is ending after 129 days as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), marked by significant cuts to federal spending and numerous controversies. DOGE claims to have saved $175 billion through asset sales, lease cancellations, and workforce reductions, although a BBC analysis found some figures lacked evidence. Musk's presence in the White House has also raised questions about potential conflicts of interest, given his companies' business dealings with the U.S. government, and his work led to the elimination of many USAID programs, impacting international aid efforts.</p>
