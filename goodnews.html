          <p>The Bank of New York Mellon will act as the primary custodian for the reserves backing Ripple's new U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD. This partnership aims to enhance regulatory compliance and institutional credibility for Ripple amid growing interest in stablecoins from major corporations. The collaboration is seen as part of a broader trend of traditional financial institutions engaging with digital assets, spurred by a shifting U.S. regulatory landscape. Ripple has also recently applied for a national banking charter and a Federal Reserve master account to further integrate into the traditional financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Nvidia's market capitalization surpassed $4 trillion, making it the first company ever to achieve this milestone and solidifying its position as the world's most valuable public company. The surge in value is attributed to the immense demand for its hardware, which is essential for the generative artificial intelligence boom. Founded in 1993, the company has seen exponential growth, crossing the $2 trillion mark in February 2024 and $3 trillion just one month prior to this new record. Nvidia is the decisive leader in producing the graphics processing units that power the large language models driving the current AI revolution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent diving expedition to the ancient Antikythera shipwreck, dating to the first century BCE, has successfully retrieved significant artifacts and portions of the vessel's structure. Led by the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece, the team recovered a rare set of the ship's hull planks and frame, offering valuable insights into ancient shipbuilding techniques. Divers also discovered fragments of a marble statue of a nude male and a terracotta mortar used for food preparation. The wreck, located near Crete, continues to be a rich source of historical information, having previously yielded statues, jewelry, and human remains.</p>

          <p>An investigation into viral social media posts has found several claims about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to be unproven, misleading, or fake. One prominent but unsubstantiated claim alleged that deportees were being thrown from planes into the ocean, a theory not supported by flight tracking data experts. Another viral video used out-of-context images from unrelated migrant tragedies in Libya and Bangladesh to depict ICE operations. The article also identified a widely viewed video of a supposed ICE raid as an AI-generated fake, highlighting the spread of misinformation surrounding immigration enforcement.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Clarifies New Bill Provides Tax Deduction for Seniors, Not Elimination of Social Security Tax</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill signed by President Trump does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits, contrary to some claims, but instead introduces a new temporary deduction for seniors. The legislation provides a "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes below certain thresholds, which applies to all income, not just Social Security. Policy experts clarify that while this provides relief for many, it is not a repeal of the tax on benefits. Critics also note the measure primarily benefits higher-income seniors and could increase financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary is being analyzed as a sign of a generational shift, driven by a sophisticated social media campaign. The 33-year-old Democratic socialist utilized platforms like TikTok and Instagram with influencer-style content, celebrity cameos, and distinct branding to engage a younger, online electorate. His campaign, endorsed by figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, focused on radical proposals and created viral moments to build a coalition of voters. This strategy reflects a broader trend of politicians using new media to bypass traditional channels and connect directly with voters.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the added benefit of locking in a fixed rate for a set term. While national average yields for one-to-five-year CDs are below 2%, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some one-year CDs yielding around 4.40% APY. Due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs currently provide higher returns than long-term ones. To secure the best rates, consumers should compare offerings from online banks, which typically have lower overhead costs and can offer more competitive yields than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions.

          <p>Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com has announced a $1.4 billion "Double Hundred Plan" to bolster key brands on its platform, escalating the competition in China's on-demand delivery sector. The initiative aims to boost sales of select brands by providing increased traffic, marketing incentives, and better after-sales service. This move positions JD.com to more aggressively challenge market leader Meituan and fend off rival Alibaba, which recently engaged in a price war and announced its own subsidy program. The battle for market share comes as the industry's combined daily delivery orders have surged past a new high of 200 million.</p>

          <p>A top official from China's economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, has stated that the country must maintain significant investment in megaprojects to drive economic growth. This statement comes amid speculation about how Beijing will boost domestic consumption to counter the effects of the U.S. tariff war. While large-scale investment was a key driver of past growth, such as the 2009-2010 stimulus package, it also led to a substantial increase in debt, particularly from local governments. The official emphasized the necessity of continued investment to improve livelihoods in a nation where per capita GDP recently surpassed $13,000. (not investment advice)</p>

The Falepili Union Treaty allows up to 280 Tuvaluans annually to live, work, or study in Australia with a path to permanent residency, independent of specific job or course requirements. This "special mobility pathway" is designed to provide a dignified safety net for a population facing displacement, with over 3,000 people already applying for the first round.

These programs include business installment agreements, which allow for monthly payments, and an Offer in Compromise (OIC), which can settle debt for a lower amount in cases of severe financial hardship. Other options are obtaining a temporary "Currently Not Collectible" status to pause collections, or seeking penalty abatement to reduce or remove certain penalties.

Despite being without eight of their international players, the Brumbies remained competitive throughout the match, scoring four tries and exposing some defensive weaknesses in the Lions' performance.
