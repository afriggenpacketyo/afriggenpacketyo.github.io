          <p>Tripadvisor's Transparency Report 2025 indicates that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the amount detected in 2022. The increase in detections is attributed to Tripadvisor's evolving policies against incentivized reviews and improvements in their detection systems, which rely on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback. Paid reviews, often originating in Asia, are considered the most pernicious type of fake submissions, and Tripadvisor uses various techniques, including AI and behavioral biometrics, to identify and penalize violators. The company admits they will never reach absolute perfection in catching fake reviews but that they are getting better at detecting them every year.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a delay in the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, pushing the deadline from June 1 to July 9 to allow for further negotiations. This decision followed a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a commitment to serious negotiations. Trump's initial threat to impose the tariffs had caused market instability, particularly concerning potential tariffs on Apple products, but the extension offers a window for the U.S. and EU to reach a trade agreement, as both parties affirmed their commitment to swift and decisive talks.</p>

          <p>Wendy Cutler, vice-president of the Asia Society Policy Institute, provides insights on the US-China trade relationship following recent landmark talks and tariff reductions. While the recent tariff truce between the US and China exceeded expectations, Cutler believes that the 90-day window for securing a tariff-free deal is short and will face challenges. She expects ups and downs in bilateral relations and believes that progress is being made on fentanyl, but substantial hurdles remain in addressing US concerns regarding excess capacity, subsidies, and transshipments.

          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting: A New Approach to Raising Successful Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 17:59:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" has emerged as a promising approach to raising successful children. This style focuses on being deeply attuned to a child's emotional needs, building emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without judgment, respond without shaming, and view "bad" behavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. The article emphasizes that emotionally safe parenting is about creating a safe space for children to express big emotions and show up as their authentic selves.</p>

          <p>South Korea's upcoming presidential election is critical for restoring domestic stability and navigating complex geopolitics following the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol. The country is deeply divided, and the ruling People Power Party (PPP) has struggled to find a stable presidential candidate.
