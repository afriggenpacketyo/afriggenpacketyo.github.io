        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is launching a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting the UK economy by focusing on key sectors and reducing energy costs for businesses. The plan includes measures such as scrapping green levies, which could cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses, and providing discounts on network charges for energy-intensive firms. Additional initiatives involve upskilling British workers, attracting global talent through visa reforms, streamlining planning processes, and increasing research and development spending, including ¬£2 billion for AI. Prime Minister Starmer emphasized that this strategy will provide long-term certainty for businesses, while critics have raised concerns about the cost of net zero and the potential impact of the Employment Rights Bill on growth.

          <p>A woman is facing a conflict with her neighbors after building a fence on her property to prevent their children from trespassing and causing disturbances. While the fence resolved the issues with the children, the neighbors now claim they struggle to fit two cars in their driveway due to the fence's placement. The woman is seeking advice on whether she is being unreasonable to decline their request to move the fence further onto her property, which would impact her own parking space.</p>
