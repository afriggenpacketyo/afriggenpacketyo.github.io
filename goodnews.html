          <h2>UK Government to Extend Bereavement Leave for Early-Stage Miscarriages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 05:28:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, paid leave is only available for pregnancy loss after the 24-week mark. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will give people essential time to grieve without needing to use sick leave. Campaigners and politicians have praised the move as a significant step forward in recognizing early-stage pregnancy loss as a true bereavement, helping to address a long-held societal taboo.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 05:00:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts suggest that exercising in the morning can be particularly effective for weight loss, but only if it is balanced with adequate sleep. Research indicates that individuals who work out between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. tend to have a lower BMI and smaller waist size. However, wellness professionals emphasize that sacrificing sleep for an early workout can be counterproductive, as rest is crucial for muscle recovery and overall progress. They advise that getting seven to eight hours of quality sleep is essential for the body to repair and for a fitness routine to be truly successful.</p>

          <p>Oscar Black, a 15-year-old from County Armagh, has made history by becoming the youngest person to swim the North Channel solo, a challenging route from Northern Ireland to Scotland. He completed the swim in 16 hours and 38 minutes, covering a distance of 46km (28.5 miles) due to strong currents, far more than the direct 35km route. During the arduous journey, Black battled numerous jellyfish stings and difficult currents, describing it as more of a mental than a physical challenge. His remarkable feat of endurance has been celebrated as an inspiring athletic achievement.</p>

          <p>In Los Angeles' Skid Row, a new care campus is embracing harm reduction principles to tackle the intertwined crises of homelessness and addiction, a stark contrast to the tougher, more punitive approaches gaining favor elsewhere. The facility provides not only addiction treatment and housing services but also clean syringes, drug testing strips, and naloxone for those not ready to quit using drugs. Proponents argue this evidence-based approach saves lives, prevents the spread of disease, and builds trust that can eventually lead individuals toward recovery. This initiative places Los Angeles at odds with a national trend toward forced treatment and criminalization.</p>

          <p>A major effort is underway across the United States to locate and document potentially millions of unplugged and abandoned "orphan" oil and gas wells. These relics of past drilling operations pose significant environmental threats, leaking methane—a potent greenhouse gas—and other toxins into the air and water. While over 100,000 have been documented, experts believe the true number is much higher, with many predating modern regulations. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has allocated billions to this cause, funding state, tribal, and academic groups to hunt for these wells using historical records, drones, and fieldwork to address this lingering environmental problem.</p>

          <p>Amid growing claims from social media influencers and public figures that seed oils are harmful, nutrition scientists are clarifying the existing evidence. Critics argue that oils like canola and soybean are inflammatory due to their omega-6 fatty acid content and refining processes, but many researchers disagree. They point to numerous studies showing that replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats from seed oils improves health outcomes, such as lowering bad cholesterol. Experts largely agree that the main issue is not the oils themselves but their prevalence in ultra-processed foods, recommending a focus on a balanced diet rich in whole foods instead.</p>
