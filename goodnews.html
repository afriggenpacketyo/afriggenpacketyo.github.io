          <p>The Trump administration's successful strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities were likely achieved through misdirection and deception, with the announcement coming abruptly after indications of a two-week delay. Fox News reported that the movement of B-2 stealth bombers towards Guam was likely a misleading tactic to suggest the decision had been postponed. The article details how the element of surprise and the control of information played a crucial role in the operation's success. The strikes followed heightened concerns about Iran's nuclear program after stalled negotiations with the U.S., and Israel's preemptive strikes on Iran's nuclear and missile infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Wicknell Chivayo, a wealthy Zimbabwean businessman, has captured national attention through his practice of gifting cars and cash to individuals he deems patriotic. Recipients range from musicians and religious figures to those loyal to the ruling Zanu-PF party, with Chivayo bestowing Mercedes-Benzes, Range Rovers, and cash gifts worth thousands of dollars. While open about his spending, Chivayo faces scrutiny regarding the source of his wealth, particularly in a country where many struggle financially.

The city is benefiting from its role as a platform for Chinese tech companies to raise funds and connect with international markets, with over 100 enterprises planning public listings.

          <p>Congressional Republicans, along with at least one Democrat, immediately praised President Trump's decision to strike three sites in Iran. Senators Lindsey Graham and John Cornyn lauded the action, while Senator Katie Britt called the bombings "strong and surgical." Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated his support for Trump's actions, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said the military operations should remind adversaries that Trump means what he says. Breaking from his Democratic colleagues, Senator John Fetterman also praised the attacks, citing Iran's role as a leading sponsor of terrorism.</p>

        </div>

          <p>Financial and corporate analysts have given their perspectives on the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites. Mark Spindel of Potomac River Capital anticipates initial market alarm and higher oil prices due to uncertainty. Jamie Cox of Harris Financial Group suggests oil prices will level out as Iran loses leverage for a peace deal. Mark Malek of Siebert Financial believes the action will be positive for the stock market if it is a one-time event, though the Strait of Hormuz remains a risk. Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital notes the added risk to energy prices and potential impact on inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. Judge Indira Talwani struck down a policy change that could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars in research funding, arguing the move threatened critical work in technology fields. The ruling addressed "indirect" costs, such as building maintenance and computer systems, which the Trump administration sought to cap at 15% of direct research costs. The University of California estimated the change would have cost it nearly $100 million a year.</p>
