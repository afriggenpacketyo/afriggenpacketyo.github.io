        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new thriller "Relay," directed by David Mackenzie, presents a smart and paranoid narrative centered on Ash, a solitary off-the-grid fixer played by Riz Ahmed. Ash specializes in helping potential whistleblowers disappear or negotiate settlements with powerful entities, using a text-telephone relay service for traceless communication, which keeps identities secret. The article praises the film's unique premise, moving beyond the typical assassin trope to explore cynical choices in an online world. As Ash aids a rattled biotech scientist, Sarah, the film builds a dizzying cat-and-mouse chase, while subtly revealing Ash's own vulnerabilities and questioning his chosen crusade.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) is actively working to prevent the extinction of over 20 species housed on its 32,000-acre Northern Virginia grounds. Scientists at SCBI study reproduction, ecology, genetics, and migration with the goal of reintroducing species like the Przewalski's horse and black-footed ferret back into their natural habitats. Despite the success stories, conservation biologists express concern over species disappearing at alarming rates, emphasizing the cascading effects of losing even one species within an ecosystem. The institute's crucial work, including preparing 60 ferret kits for release into the Colorado wild, highlights ongoing global wildlife preservation efforts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is significantly altering geopolitical alignments across former Soviet states, as evidenced by a US-brokered peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia. This US involvement, alongside Azerbaijan's strengthened ties with Turkey and Central Asian nations, signals a potential decline in Russia's traditional influence in the region. Tensions between Russia and Azerbaijan, exacerbated by incidents like a downed plane and alleged oil depot attacks, further underscore this shift. Other ex-Soviet states, like Tajikistan, are also openly challenging Moscow's authority, while China quietly expands its economic and security presence, creating a multi-vector foreign policy landscape.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is set to experience a 30C heatwave on bank holiday Monday, contributing to what is expected to be one of the hottest summers on record. This warm spell, driven by the remnants of Hurricane Erin, will be short-lived, with unsettled weather, including wind and rain, expected from Tuesday. While large crowds are anticipated for events like Notting Hill Carnival and music festivals, travelers may face disruption due to ongoing rail strikes and engineering works. The prolonged dry periods this summer have already led to hosepipe bans and concerns for one of the worst harvests on record, with climate change making such hot weather more frequent and intense.</p>

          <p>An Air Canada flight en route from Toronto to Las Vegas was forced to make an emergency landing at Chicago's O'Hare Airport due to a disruptive passenger. The Federal Aviation Administration reported the incident occurred Friday night, with the crew notifying authorities of the disturbance. Although the situation was resolved and no arrest was made, the flight experienced a three-hour delay before continuing to its destination. This event contributes to over 1,000 unruly passenger incidents reported by airlines this year, highlighting ongoing challenges in air travel.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech hinting at potential interest rate cuts ahead spurred a significant Friday rally on Wall Street, particularly benefiting cyclical, economically sensitive non-tech stocks. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new all-time high, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also rallied, though the latter ended the week with a loss due to its tech-heavy composition. Analysts noted that lower rates primarily benefit consumer discretionary sectors, as opposed to tech giants whose fortunes are more tied to AI advancements. Companies like DuPont, Home Depot, and TJX Companies saw strong gains following Powell's remarks and positive earnings reports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester City suffered a 2-0 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur, prompting questions about manager Pep Guardiola's goalkeeping choices. On his home debut, James Trafford delivered a jittery performance, contributing to Tottenham's second goal with a loose pass. This raises concerns about the long-term successor to Ederson, who was benched amid transfer rumors linking him to Galatasaray. Trafford, a recent £27m signing, struggled in a young City lineup, leading to speculation about whether Guardiola will revert to Ederson or pursue other options like Gianluigi Donnarumma.

The original name, "Mohrenstrasse," carried overt racist connotations linked to the 18th-century practice of enslaved Africans in Germany.

This request arises because management hired the replacement just weeks before Alex's retirement date, leaving insufficient time for proper handover. The article advises Alex to consider the impact on his Social Security benefits, as working while collecting benefits before full retirement age can temporarily reduce them.

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has erupted again, marking its 31st display of molten rock since December, with lava shooting 100 feet into the air across its summit crater floor. The eruption, contained within the Halemaumau Crater, poses no threat to homes and offers spectacular views for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain the continuous spattering and lava fountains are due to magma rising through narrow vents, building pressure like a shaken Champagne bottle. While the eruption's future is uncertain, it continues a pattern of repeated lava fountain episodes seen only a few times in 200 years, offering a powerful connection to Native Hawaiian traditions.</p>
