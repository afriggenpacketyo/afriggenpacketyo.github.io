          <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar is poised to deliver a speech criticizing President Trump's use of executive power, framing it as an overreach that undermines the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. Klobuchar, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, intends to argue that Trump's administration disregards legal norms and harms small businesses, farmers, and consumers through tariffs. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's actions, asserting their commitment to prioritizing Americans and utilizing executive powers constitutionally. Klobuchar's remarks come amid ongoing debates within the Democratic party about challenging Trump's policies and charting a future course after recent electoral setbacks.</p>

Waymo released a software update in November 2024 to address the issue, and deployed it across its entire fleet by December 26, 2024. The company has plans to expand to a dozen more cities.</p>

          <p>A Consumer Reports investigation revealed that Kroger stores are overcharging customers for items marked as being on sale, with expired discount tags leading to inaccuracies at checkout. The investigation, stemming from allegations by Kroger employees, found price tag errors on over 150 grocery items, resulting in an average overcharge of $1.70 per item. Kroger disputes the findings, claiming the errors are nominal and infrequent, but consumer advocates and analysts suggest the pricing mistakes erode customer trust. The problem of overcharging is not unique to Kroger, with other retailers facing similar allegations.</p>

          <p>President Trump is revisiting the idea of tying U.S. drug prices to those in other high-income countries, a concept previously considered but ultimately rejected by Senate Democrats and the Biden administration during negotiations for the Inflation Reduction Act. Democrats feared that moderate senators would not support the bill if it included measures referencing foreign countries. Trump officials believe they have the authority to pursue actions to push drugmakers to lower prices within Medicare and the private market. Legal challenges are expected, with some arguing that the courts will likely have the final say on the legality of the plan.</p>

          <p>Legal challenges to President Trump's tariffs could put the president on a collision course with a Supreme Court that he shaped, as his use of emergency power to unilaterally impose the levies could run into legal doctrines championed by the conservative justices to limit executive authority. The lawsuits argue that the tariffs violate the major questions doctrine and the nondelegation doctrine. Under the major questions doctrine, Congress must give clear authorization for a federal agency to decide an issue of major political or economic significance.</p>

          <p>With the nation's aviation infrastructure under scrutiny, following a series of paralyzing communications and radar outages at some of the country's busiest airports, there has been increased discussion about the latest innovations in radar technology.

Though it seems like thoroughly modern technology, the application dates back to the late 19th century.</p>
