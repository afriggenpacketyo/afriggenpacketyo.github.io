          <p>Dr. Vinay Prasad is returning to his leadership position at the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research just over a week after his departure. His resignation followed intense pressure, notably from far-right influencer Laura Loomer, who launched a targeted campaign against him. Prasad's initial short tenure was marked by controversy, particularly regarding the agency's handling of a Sarepta Therapeutics gene therapy drug. At the FDA's request, Prasad, an oncologist and past critic of certain COVID-19 policies, has agreed to resume his role overseeing vaccine and gene therapy regulation.</p>

          <p>Following an impressive NFL preseason debut with the Cleveland Browns, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders confronted ESPN reporter Tony Grossi about his coverage. In a video, Sanders sarcastically asked the reporter if he would ever write something positive, claiming his coverage had been consistently negative. Despite the confrontation, which ended in a laugh, Grossi later praised Sanders' performance on-air, stating he was "outstanding" and had increased pressure on the other quarterbacks. The interaction highlights the intense media scrutiny on Sanders, who has faced criticism since being drafted.</p>

Her debut occurred during the first game of a doubleheader between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins, where she served as the first base umpire. The 48-year-old, who has been umpiring in the minor leagues since 2016, received a warm ovation from the crowd when shown on the stadium's video board.

          <h2>The Evolving Portrayal of Kashmir in Bollywood Cinema</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 14:28:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis explores how Bollywood's depiction of Kashmir has shifted from a romantic paradise to a politically charged conflict zone. Early Indian films used the region as a scenic backdrop for love stories, largely ignoring its political realities. However, the rise of militancy in the late 1980s transformed its cinematic image, with movies like "Roja" (1992) framing it as a battleground for Indian patriotism. Recent films, such as "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370," are described as aligning more closely with government narratives, reflecting the changing political landscape and a more statist perspective in the film industry.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, a significant de-escalation measure. This action follows South Korea's own removal of its speakers, which had broadcast anti-Pyongyang messages and K-pop music across the border. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare had recently intensified tensions, with the North blasting irritating sounds in response. This move signals a potential easing of hostilities under South Korea's new liberal government, although tensions could rise again with upcoming US-South Korea military drills.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been dated to 4.56 billion years ago, making it older than our planet. A University of Georgia geologist examined fragments of the space rock, which created a fireball seen across two states in June. The analysis revealed the meteorite originated from a larger asteroid that broke up approximately 470 million years ago in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Scientists plan to officially name the rock the McDonough Meteorite.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts from the Crew-10 mission have safely returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean after a five-month stay aboard the International Space Station. The SpaceX Dragon capsule, carrying NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, landed off the coast of San Diego. This mission marked the first time a NASA-sponsored crew landed in the Pacific, a change made by SpaceX to ensure debris falls harmlessly. During their mission, the crew conducted over 200 scientific experiments in microgravity.</p>

          <p>Developers have completed a $104 million project to convert the abandoned 19th-century campus of St. John's College in Brooklyn into a luxury apartment building named The Hartby. The historic property, which had been deteriorating for decades, was acquired through a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent St. John the Baptist church. The renovation preserved original architectural elements while creating 205 modern apartments, including 62 designated for affordable housing. The project successfully repurposed a neglected landmark, creating income for the church and new housing for the neighborhood.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial planner who developed the famous "4% rule" for retirement savings, has released updated advice for today's retirees. His research now suggests that a more diversified portfolio allows for a safe initial withdrawal rate of 4.7%, higher than the original 4%. Bengen argues that many retirees are too conservative and could spend more by implementing strategies like annual rebalancing and tilting portfolios toward small-company stocks. He emphasizes that inflation is the greatest threat to retirement portfolios and that his 4.7% figure represents a worst-case scenario (not investment advice).</p>
