          <p>South Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix is ready for mass production of its next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM4) chips, crucial for artificial intelligence computing, including Nvidia's future Rubin architecture. This development places the company significantly ahead of competitors like Samsung Electronics and Micron Technologies, having completed its internal validation processes. SK Hynix's shares surged over 7% on the news, reflecting its strong market leadership and the robust demand for HBM, which accounted for 77% of its recent record operating profit and revenue. The company anticipates doubling its HBM sales for the current year.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by International Workplace Group indicates that Gen Z employees are at the forefront of AI adoption in the workplace, actively coaching older colleagues on using these new tools. Almost two-thirds of younger staff are providing hands-on guidance, fostering a significant knowledge exchange that nearly half of all employees believe is bridging generational divides. This intergenerational collaboration allows senior directors to focus on higher-value tasks and is credited with unlocking new business opportunities. The report underscores AI's role in enhancing efficiency, saving employees an average of 55 minutes daily, and improving collaboration within hybrid teams.</p>

          <p>The four-year mystery of a wedding crasher at Michelle and John Wylie's Ayrshire wedding has been amusingly resolved, thanks to an internet sleuth. The couple had spotted a tall, puzzled man in their wedding photos but couldn't identify him for years. It was revealed to be Andrew Hillhouse, who mistakenly arrived at the wrong venue, believing it was another wedding two miles away. He only realized his error when the bride walked down the aisle but felt too committed to leave. His comical attempt to blend in and avoid group photos became a memorable tale for his actual wedding party, adding a unique twist to the day's events.</p>

          <p>New Housing Secretary Steve Reed has unequivocally committed to the government's target of building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, advocating a "build baby build" strategy to tackle the nation's housing crisis. Reed, who recently took over the housing brief, warned of potential sanctions for developers who drag their feet on projects, although details remain unspecified. Industry leaders, however, caution that achieving this goal presents a "huge challenge" amidst mounting pressures from rising regulatory costs and planning delays. Despite a recent dip in new home construction, applications have seen an increase, and planning reform legislation is advancing.</p>

This independent review, initiated after a BBC investigation, seeks to identify any outstanding lines of inquiry, which Baroness Lawrence views as the "last opportunity" for complete justice. The College of Policing's team will scrutinize information held by the Metropolitan Police, including BBC reports that named a sixth suspect and highlighted police failings. The Met has reaffirmed its commitment to prosecuting all individuals responsible for Stephen's death, emphasizing the enduring pursuit of accountability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become the leading foreign investor in Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), with commitments totaling US$8.4 billion between 2019 and 2024, accounting for 16% of all investment in the cluster. This significant Chinese involvement includes backing for a light-rail line, an "aerotropolis" design, and potential property development, with China Railway Construction Corporation participating in a high-speed railway project. While Thailand remains the largest overall investor, China's increasing financial footprint highlights its expanding economic influence in Southeast Asia. The railway, though started seven years ago, still requires five more years for completion, indicating a long-term strategic partnership. (not investment advice)</p>
