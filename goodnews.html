          <p>A US special envoy stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause. This potential concession, described as "game-changing," emerged from a summit with President Trump and could provide a path to ending the war without formal NATO membership for Ukraine, a long-standing Russian objection. European and Ukrainian leaders have welcomed the development but are seeking more details on how such an agreement would be implemented and what roles the US and EU would play in practice.</p>

          <p>Several European and NATO leaders are set to join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House for critical discussions with President Trump. This unified front is seen as an effort to support Zelenskyy and ensure Europe has a voice in any potential peace deal, following a Trump-Putin summit from which the Ukrainian leader was excluded. The move demonstrates Europe's commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and aims to prevent a repeat of a previous contentious meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy, underscoring the high stakes of the negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Early results from Bolivia's presidential election indicate that no candidate will secure an outright majority, setting the stage for the country's first-ever presidential runoff. Centrist senator Rodrigo Paz emerged as the surprise leader, ahead of right-wing former president Jorge Quiroga, while the candidate for the ruling Movement for Socialism (MAS) party performed poorly. This election could mark a significant political shift, ending nearly two decades of dominance by the leftist MAS party, which has been weakened by internal divisions and the disqualification of former president Evo Morales.</p>
