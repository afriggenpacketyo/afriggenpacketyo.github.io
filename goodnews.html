          <p>Sanae Takaichi's rise to power in Japan has sparked concerns about a potential weakening of the yen, echoing past trade tensions with the U.S. Takaichi, an advocate of "Abenomics," favors loose monetary policy, which could push the yen lower and raise import costs for Japanese households. While analysts believe Takaichi will initially proceed cautiously to avoid straining relations with Washington, a prolonged period of yen weakness could revive criticisms of unfair trade practices. Experts anticipate the Bank of Japan to eventually raise interest rates to curb inflation, potentially forcing Takaichi to adjust her policies. The economic trajectory of Japan will have a great impact on global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>World leaders have expressed support for the initial phase of a Gaza peace agreement between Israel and Hamas. The agreement aims to secure the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, facilitate the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and enable the entry of humanitarian aid. UN Secretary-General António Guterres hailed the deal as a "momentous opportunity," while other leaders emphasized the need for all parties to uphold their commitments. Residents in Gaza celebrated the news, expressing hope for an end to the conflict and a chance to rebuild their lives, as the world looks towards the implementation of the deal.</p>

          <h2>China Tightens Export Rules for Rare Earths</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has tightened its export rules on rare earths, critical elements for high-tech manufacturing, citing national security concerns. The new regulations formalize existing restrictions on processing technology and unauthorized overseas cooperation. These measures are likely to block exports to foreign arms manufacturers and some semiconductor firms, impacting the US, which lacks processing facilities. China's dominance in rare earth extraction and refining could further strain trade relations with the US, as it clarifies the specific technologies and processes that are restricted, affecting mining, smelting, and recycling.</p>

          <p>The new chair of the independent football regulator, David Kogan, has identified Sheffield Wednesday's financial struggles as a "significant problem". The club has faced repeated failures to pay players on time, leading to restrictions from the English Football League. Kogan expressed "sympathy" for the club's supporters and indicated that the regulator is seeking powers to investigate and intervene in such situations. While forcing an owner to sell would be a last resort, the regulator aims to work with owners to resolve issues and ensure the stability of clubs.</p>
