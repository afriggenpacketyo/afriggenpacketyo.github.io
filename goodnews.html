          <p>During a traffic stop in central Ohio, police encountered a pet raccoon named "Chewy" holding a glass methamphetamine pipe in its mouth while sitting in the driver's seat. The officer searched the vehicle and discovered methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and additional used methamphetamine pipes. The driver, Victoria Vidal, was arrested and charged with drug possession and paraphernalia charges. The raccoon was unharmed, and Vidal had the necessary documents to legally own the animal, as permits are required in Ohio to keep raccoons domestically.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ordered the Trump administration to transfer Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts Ph.D. student, from a detention facility in Louisiana to Vermont. Ozturk was arrested after her student visa was revoked, with authorities citing her involvement in associations that allegedly undermined U.S. foreign policy. The court's decision mandates the transfer within a week, setting the stage for a bail hearing in Vermont. Ozturk's lawyers are challenging her arrest as a violation of the First and Fifth Amendments, arguing that the revocation of her visa and subsequent detention are unjust.</p>
