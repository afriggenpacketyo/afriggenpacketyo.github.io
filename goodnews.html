          <p>The UK government will not make immediate changes to the £20,000 tax-free allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), according to a BBC report. Chancellor Rachel Reeves had been expected to announce a reduction to encourage more investment in stocks and shares. A Treasury spokesperson stated the government's ambition remains to ensure savings deliver better returns and drive UK investment. Discussions with financial institutions about potential reforms are expected to continue, but for now, the existing rules for tax-free savings will remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese firm Envision Energy has commissioned the world's largest plant for producing green hydrogen and ammonia in Chifeng, Inner Mongolia. This initial phase of the project is capable of producing 320,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually, a key component in decarbonizing heavy industries. The company's CEO, Zhang Lei, highlighted the project as a major technological milestone, demonstrating that scalable, clean energy alternatives are now operational. Envision plans to begin exports later this year and aims to expand production to 1.5 million tonnes per year by 2028.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that the new "one in, one out" migrant returns agreement with France is robust enough to withstand legal challenges. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant returned to France after arriving in the UK via a small boat, Britain will accept one person who has made a legal claim in France. Cooper asserted the plan, developed with support from the EU, will act as a deterrent and is part of a broader strategy to target illegal work. The opposition has criticized the deal as a "gimmick."</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic has cancelled a scheduled practice session, raising fitness concerns ahead of his highly anticipated Wimbledon semi-final match against world number one Jannik Sinner. Djokovic, 38, had an awkward fall during his quarter-final victory and has not definitively confirmed his fitness. His opponent, Jannik Sinner, has also been dealing with an elbow injury but stated he would be "100% fit" for the match. The cancellation casts some doubt on Djokovic's condition as he prepares to face a much younger rival for a place in the final.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actor Ewan McGregor's application to replace the roof on his £2 million historic mansion in Scotland has been denied by the Perth and Kinross Council. His architects argued the existing lead roof was "beyond repair" and vulnerable to theft, proposing a modern single-ply membrane as a replacement. However, the council ruled that the proposed materials and methods would not preserve the C-listed building's special architectural character. McGregor, who bought the 18th-century villa in 2023, had previously received approval for other renovations, including a new garage and master bedroom.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway saw a significant 54% year-on-year increase in June, contrasting sharply with a sales slump across much of the rest of Europe. The surge was largely driven by the popularity of the revamped Model Y, which meets Norwegian demand for large, practical, and competitively priced electric vehicles. This success comes despite a backlash in some European markets over CEO Elon Musk's political activities. A Norwegian survey found 43% of EV drivers would not buy a Tesla for political reasons, yet the brand's market share remains remarkably strong in the country.</p>

          <p>In a major environmental restoration effort, China has blown up approximately 300 dams and closed numerous small hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the Yangtze. This action aims to save the habitats of rare and endemic fish species that have been severely impacted by the dense network of dams. For decades, these structures have blocked water flow, restricted migration routes for fish, and reduced suitable spawning grounds. The project is seen as a critical step to preserve the last refuge for many unique aquatic species in the upper Yangtze basin.</p>
