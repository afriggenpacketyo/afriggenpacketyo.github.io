          <p>Volkswagen is intensifying its efforts to dominate the European electric vehicle market by launching a new family of affordable, compact EVs. The company recently unveiled its ID. Cross Concept car, which is expected to have an entry price of around €25,000 and will be available next year. CEO Oliver Blume stated that Volkswagen, already the market leader in Europe with a 28% share, is leveraging improved software and a unified battery cell concept to strengthen its competitive edge. This strategic push comes as European automakers face increasing pressure from Chinese competitors.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has extended its gold-buying streak, increasing its holdings to 74.02 million ounces in a strategic move to diversify its reserves away from US dollar-backed assets. This action aligns with a global trend where central banks are seeking alternatives due to geopolitical risks and concerns about the dollar's long-term stability. For the first time since 1996, foreign central banks now hold more gold than U.S. Treasuries, signaling a significant potential rebalancing of global assets. A recent survey shows 95% of central banks expect global gold reserves to continue rising. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA) announced a significant 23% drop in new asylum applications during the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year. This decline was primarily driven by a remarkable 66% reduction in applications from Syrians. The agency attributes this change not to EU policy but to the ouster of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, which has fostered hopes among displaced Syrians of returning home to rebuild their communities. Germany, previously the top destination for asylum seekers, saw the largest individual decline in applications among member states.</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened higher at the start of the week, with investor attention focused on a critical no-confidence vote in France against Prime Minister Francois Bayrou. The vote, which Bayrou is expected to lose, was triggered by ongoing political disputes over approximately €44 billion in budget cuts aimed at reducing the national deficit. Despite the political uncertainty in France, major European indices like Germany's DAX and the UK's FTSE showed early gains, while U.S. stock futures remained stable ahead of key inflation reports.

          <p>Private equity giants are aggressively recruiting fundraising and investor relations talent from Wall Street, signaling a strategic shift as raising new capital becomes more difficult. After a slowdown in dealmaking due to rising interest rates, firms are investing heavily in professionals who can secure commitments from limited partners, viewing these roles as crucial for survival and future growth. This "talent war" has even prompted investment banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan to implement new rules to prevent their junior analysts from being poached by these firms.

          <p>Norwegians are voting in a close parliamentary election where the future of the nation's long-standing wealth tax has become a central campaign issue. The center-left bloc, led by incumbent Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre's Labor Party, supports keeping the tax, which levies up to 1.1% on significant assets. In contrast, right-wing opposition parties, including the Conservatives and the populist Progress Party, are campaigning for its reduction or complete abolition, presenting a stark ideological choice for voters in one of the world's wealthiest and most egalitarian countries.</p>

          <p>Following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's announcement of his intention to resign, former economic security minister Sanae Takaichi and current agriculture minister Shinjiro Koizumi are leading the polls as potential successors. If chosen, Takaichi would become Japan's first female prime minister, a development some political analysts believe the public is ready for. The leadership change comes as the nation grapples with a cost-of-living crisis and the political fallout from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's recent election losses, which weakened Ishiba's position.</p>

          <p>The board of Tottenham Hotspur has issued a firm statement confirming that the Premier League club is "not for sale" after its owner, ENIC, unequivocally rejected two preliminary expressions of interest. The announcement aims to quell speculation about a potential takeover, which had intensified following the recent departure of long-serving executive chairman Daniel Levy. The club clarified that ENIC, which holds a nearly 87% stake, has no intention of selling its interest in the North London team, providing stability after a period of change.</p>

          <p>Germany's coach Julian Nagelsmann has faced criticism for his comments following his team's 3-1 World Cup qualifier victory over Northern Ireland. Nagelsmann described Northern Ireland's style of play as reliant on "a lot of long balls" and "not brilliant to watch," which former Northern Ireland international players Stephen Craigan and Chris Brunt labeled as "disrespectful." The pundits pointed out that Germany also frequently employed long-ball tactics during the match and suggested Nagelsmann's comments were a deflection from his own team's unconvincing performance against a well-matched opponent.</p>

This victory makes Alcaraz the second-youngest man to win six major titles and the first to win multiple Grand Slams on all three surfaces before turning 23, cementing his place at the top of men's tennis.</p>

          <p>A debate over which English football star was superior at age 17, Wayne Rooney or Michael Owen, has gained traction online after Owen asserted he was better. Rooney has now responded diplomatically, stating that he looked up to Owen and that they were very different types of players. Owen supported his claim with statistics, noting he won two Premier League Golden Boots and scored 18 league goals in a season before turning 19, compared to Rooney's six, sparking a nostalgic discussion among fans about two of England's most celebrated strikers.</p>
