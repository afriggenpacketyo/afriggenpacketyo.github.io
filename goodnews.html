          <p>President Trump has reportedly approved Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, touting it as a partnership that will create at least 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boost to the U.S. economy. Both steelmakers welcomed the decision after a review by federal agencies, which began last month at Trump's request. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel will remain in America and keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh, with the bulk of Nippon Steel's investment occurring over the next 14 months. Nippon Steel applauded Trump's action and committed to protecting American workers and national security.</p>

          <p>As geopolitical tensions rise and discussions about de-dollarization increase, Hong Kong's financial system is becoming crucial for China's efforts to internationalize the yuan. Mary Huen Wai-yi, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks, noted that businesses in Qatar are eager to leverage the yuan using Hong Kong's financial tools. Hong Kong offers a large yuan pool and various capabilities, including settlement, payment, and hedging, providing businesses with comfort as they consider investments. This trend reflects a broader shift towards alternatives to the U.S. dollar in international trade and investment, aligning with China's long-term strategy to assert financial independence.</p>

          <p>NHS England plans to open specialist mental health crisis centers across England over the next decade to reduce overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These centers will be open to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, providing specialist staff to treat people in acute mental distress. NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hailed the new model of care, stating that it will provide the right support in the right setting and speed up access to appropriate care. However, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expressed skepticism, emphasizing the need for proper funding and robust testing of the model before national rollout.</p>

          <p>The Army confirmed that air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter near the Pentagon, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in early May. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna's location, prompting the Pentagon's tower to delay landing clearance for the Black Hawk helicopter. Federal Aviation Administration controllers aborted the landings of two jets out of caution, citing conflicting positional data from legacy tracking systems. The Army stated that its initial review found no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic, but the NTSB expressed disappointment at the Army releasing investigative information through the media rather than directly to them.</p>

Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a lower price than Japanese-grown rice, while other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen solid demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The decision reflects consumer interest in more affordable options, with Aeon aiming to increase overall rice consumption by offering customers freedom of choice. The average price of rice sold at Japanese supermarkets reached a record high, partly due to a poor harvest in 2023.</p>

          <p>As the UK prepares to ban disposable vapes starting June 1, many vapers are stockpiling in anticipation of the new regulations. The ban aims to reduce environmental impact and curb youth vaping, but some ex-smokers worry about the change in taste and the convenience of rechargeable alternatives. Retailers are seeing a surge in sales of disposable vapes as customers stock up, while concerns rise that some vapers may return to smoking if they cannot access disposable options. Baroness Claire Fox, who quit smoking with the help of disposable vapes, criticizes the ban as counter-productive and prioritizing environmental concerns over public health.</p>

The departures follow an executive order from Trump that sharply limited the firm's interactions with the government, which was later rescinded after Paul Weiss agreed to compromises, such as auditing its hiring practices and dedicating funds to pro bono legal services. The deal between Paul Weiss and the Trump administration proved controversial in the legal community, with some firms choosing to sue the administration instead.</p>

          <p>China has officially greenlit the construction of the Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal, a 767-kilometer waterway connecting the inland province of Jiangxi to the coastal powerhouse of Zhejiang. This mega-project, estimated to cost $44.4 billion, aims to enhance inland water transport and integrate less-developed regions with wealthier coastal hubs. The canal, capable of accommodating 1,000-tonne vessels, is projected to handle around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually, facilitating the transport of resources from Jiangxi to Zhejiang's seaports.</p>

          <p>Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap performed at their biggest festival headline gig, just days after a band member was charged with a terror offence. Liam √ìg √ì hAnnaidh was charged for allegedly displaying a flag in support of a proscribed organization. The band denied the offence, calling it "political policing" and urged fans to be "on the right side of history." The concert followed a smaller "secret" set the night before and saw fans wearing Irish and Palestinian flags. Critics have called the group dangerous upstarts, while supporters defend their freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming to make it available in stores at 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. The initiative seeks to address mounting criticism over rising rice prices that are hurting households amid inflation. The government plans to release 300,000 tons initially and may provide additional supplies if necessary. Koizumi intends to publish weekly retail rice prices by region and examine distribution channels to ensure broad access to the low-priced rice.</p>
