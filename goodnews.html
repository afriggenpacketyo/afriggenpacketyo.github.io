          <p>Tesla plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, a city already hosting autonomous vehicle testing by companies like Waymo and Amazon's Zoox. Austin's appeal lies in its tech-friendly environment, affordable housing, and favorable regulations. Tesla's approach relies on camera-based systems, differing from Waymo's sensor-heavy model. However, Tesla has faced delays in delivering self-driving technology, and faces regulatory hurdles despite Texas's generally favorable stance. The success of robotaxi services in Austin could influence the future of autonomous vehicle regulation nationwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns that a large federal government could be detrimental under a leader like Donald Trump, the author argues that a strong government with oversight is essential. The principal issue with the Trump presidency is not the power of the federal government but rather the lack of sufficient oversight. A robust state is necessary to cater to the needs of its citizens and respond to crises effectively. Strengthening oversight mechanisms and checks and balances, rather than shrinking government, is crucial for protecting against abuse of power.</p>

          <p>Vietnam has abolished its long-standing two-child policy to address a declining birth rate and shrinking working-age population. The Vietnamese lawmakers passed new amendments to the Population Law, leaving it up to families to decide how many children they want to have. The Ministry of Health warned that the national fertility rate has dropped to 1.91 per woman, which is the lowest in Vietnam's modern history. The country is also facing challenges with an aging population.</p>
