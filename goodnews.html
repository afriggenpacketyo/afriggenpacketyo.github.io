          <p>A federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement, which will allow US colleges to pay athletes millions of dollars, marking a significant shift in college sports. The agreement allows schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and provides $2.7 billion over the next decade to former players previously barred from revenue. This settlement addresses the long-standing debate over compensating college athletes, who generate substantial revenue for their institutions, primarily through football and basketball. The changes are expected to professionalize college athletics, affecting recruitment, program offerings, and the overall landscape of the NCAA, as the agreement may lead to some athletes losing their spots on teams.

          <p>A federal judge approved the House v. NCAA settlement, paving the way for college athletes to be directly paid for the first time, marking a new era for college sports. NCAA's top division schools will be allowed to directly pay athletes, capped at $20.5 million per school, and over $2 billion will be paid to former college athletes who were not allowed to earn money while in school. The settlement arose from three lawsuits challenging the NCAA's amateurism tradition, which banned schools from compensating players beyond scholarships. The settlement establishes a third-party clearinghouse to review licensing agreements for fair market value, which is expected to face legal challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump could provide a respite for Asian countries caught in the rivalry between the two nations. The call, described as "very positive" by Trump, eased the predicament of countries relying on trade with both powers. However, analysts suggest the detente might complicate their calculations on balancing relations between the two superpowers. The relationship between the two powers has become more fragile than ever, making this call a tentative step back from the brink.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong remains China's undisputed hub for global finance, surpassing Shanghai, as mainland companies increasingly turn to Hong Kong's stock exchange for capital infusions. Despite the presence of mainland exchanges, Hong Kong offers better access to international capital and strong connectivity to global markets, making it an attractive choice for companies seeking offshore funding. The city's appeal has grown since the summer of 2024, as companies like AICT choose Hong Kong for its financial advantages and its role as a launching pad for international expansion. This trend highlights Hong Kong's continued importance as a global financial center.</p>

The discussions explore the possibility of a trade agreement between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump during the upcoming G7 summit. Japan seeks the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and has presented a package of proposals to strengthen supply chains and expand imports of U.S. farm products.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is targeting Japan's rice policy due to escalating public grievances over soaring rice prices, aiming to overhaul the decades-old production adjustment system before a crucial national election. With rice prices doubling, Ishiba seeks to boost rice production, countering opposition parties pitching a consumption tax cut. Despite the official end of the "acreage reduction policy" in 2018, production adjustments continue with subsidies for feed rice, but Ishiba now pursues a consumer-focused approach to lower prices. The Prime Minister's efforts come as opposition parties urge a consumption tax cut to stimulate household spending amid prolonged inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A unique monster character called "Labubu," a rabbit-like plush toy created by Chinese maker Pop Mart, has become a global hit, attracting long lines and fervent fans. The character, designed by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, is inspired by a Nordic elf and features pointed ears and serrated teeth. Much of Labubu's popularity stems from celebrity endorsements and a clever marketing strategy, including selling collectibles in "blind boxes." The global success of Labubu reflects China's transformation from a toy subcontractor to a creator of original products, with Pop Mart shares valued significantly higher than Sanrio Co., the company behind Hello Kitty.</p>
