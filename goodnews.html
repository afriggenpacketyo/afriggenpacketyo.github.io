          <p>An excerpt from the forthcoming memoir by retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, titled "Life, Law & Liberty," offers a glimpse into his formative years and judicial philosophy. In the prologue, Kennedy reflects on how his upbringing in Sacramento and the American West shaped his understanding of equality, liberty, and freedom. He discusses his unexpected journey to the Supreme Court, becoming one of only 116 justices in U.S. history, and the immense responsibility that came with the role. The memoir promises to explore how his Western perspective influenced his interpretation of the Constitution on some of the nation's most pivotal cases.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White is taking on the role of music icon Bruce Springsteen in the new film "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere." The movie focuses on the creation of Springsteen's deeply personal 1982 album, "Nebraska," a period when the musician was reportedly at an emotional low despite his rising fame. White, known for his award-winning performance in "The Bear," delves into the complexities of portraying The Boss, emphasizing the need to perform with exhaustion to capture Springsteen's on-stage persona. The actor also reflects on his own struggles and how he found a familiar feeling in Springsteen's description of being an observer in his own life.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy shared his concerns about the current state of the nation's highest court, describing some of its opinions as "a little bit too personal and confrontational." The 89-year-old former justice, who often served as the crucial swing vote on landmark cases involving abortion rights and same-sex marriage, reflected on his career ahead of the release of his memoir. Kennedy lamented the potential erosion of civility and ethics in public discourse, warning that it puts democracy in danger. He also stood by his past decisions, including those that have since been reversed by the current court.</p>

First opened in 1957 by Freddie and Ollie Carter, the Pacoima establishment served as a vital community hub during an era of heavy segregation in the San Fernando Valley. Now 94, co-founder Ollie Carter attended the ceremony with her family and longtime clients, celebrating the shop's historical significance in the post-World War II development of the local African American community. The plaque permanently protects Stylesville, ensuring its place in the city's history is officially documented and preserved.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has confirmed that Hamas is holding 20 living hostages and that their release is anticipated within the next 24 hours. This development marks a significant step towards a potential peace agreement in the region, prompting President Donald Trump to travel to Israel and Egypt to mark the occasion. Vance stated that while final confirmation awaits their physical return, the U.S. is on the cusp of a major diplomatic success. He also clarified that while U.S. troops from Central Command will help monitor the ceasefire, there is no intention for American forces to be deployed on the ground in Gaza.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds AI-Generated 'Workslop' Is Damaging Workplace Productivity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 10:00:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has identified a phenomenon called "workslop," where AI-generated content appears competent but lacks the necessary substance, ultimately harming productivity. The Harvard Business Review article reports that over 40% of U.S. employees have received such content, contributing to a growing distrust in AI tools. While technology companies are often blamed for releasing unproven products, the article argues that the ultimate responsibility lies with employers. It suggests that failures are often due to a lack of investment in proper training, clear AI policies, and concrete plans for implementation, rather than flaws in the technology itself.</p>

          <p>Director Kathryn Bigelow's latest thriller, "A House of Dynamite," presents a harrowing scenario in which the U.S. government has only 19 minutes to respond to an incoming nuclear missile. The film, praised for its authenticity, dramatizes the immense pressure on a president, played by Idris Elba, who must make a world-altering decision with limited preparation. Bigelow and screenwriter Noah Oppenheim consulted with military experts, including a retired lieutenant general, to ensure the depiction of the response protocol was as realistic as possible. The film serves as a stark reminder that despite the end of the Cold War, the threat of nuclear conflict remains a terrifying reality.</p>

          <p>Brooke Cooper, 33, has become the first female general manager in the Boston Red Sox franchise history, leading their Triple-A affiliate, the Worcester Red Sox. Her path to the role was not direct; she was initially rejected for an internship with the team at age 20. Undeterred, she applied again two years later as an MBA student and was hired, starting her career by managing merchandise in the team store. Cooper's story highlights perseverance and a passion for baseball, as she climbed the ranks from an intern to a key leadership position in a male-dominated industry, overcoming what she describes as imposter syndrome along the way.</p>

          <p>A feature explores why the United States has such a rich history of modern invention, tracing the spirit back to figures like Thomas Edison. Rather than a lone genius, Edison fostered a collaborative "invention factory" at Menlo Park, a model for systematic innovation. The article interviews entrepreneurs from the show "Shark Tank" and author Steven Johnson, who attribute America's success to a combination of factors. These include a pioneering spirit inherited from immigrants, a financial ecosystem with robust venture capital, government support for research, and a cultural acceptance of failure as a step toward success.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's Mayor Gong Zheng announced that the city will eliminate all foreign investment restrictions in its manufacturing sector. This move is part of a broader effort to deepen reforms and open the Chinese market to overseas companies, particularly in fields like electric vehicles, biotechnology, and value-added telecommunications. The mayor emphasized that openness is Shanghai's greatest advantage and assured that foreign-funded manufacturers would be treated equally in government procurement processes. The policy aims to support foreign companies in participating in and building both upstream and downstream supply chains within the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses the common question of whether it is possible to separate art from the artist, specifically concerning J.K. Rowling and the Harry Potter universe. The author argues that it is acceptable to continue engaging with the series, despite Rowling's controversial views on transgender issues and problematic elements within the books themselves. The column suggests that the core positive message of the books—rejecting supremacy and discrimination—can still be valued. It recommends that fans critically interrogate the content in a community setting, transforming their engagement into a socially conscious act rather than simply trying to offset guilt through financial donations.</p>

          <p>Scotland's First Minister, John Swinney, has asserted that the precedent set in 2011 should secure a second independence referendum if his Scottish National Party (SNP) wins a majority in the next Holyrood election. After the SNP's majority win in 2011, the UK government agreed to the 2014 referendum. Swinney argues this established a clear basis for a new vote, despite the current UK Labour government's opposition. The SNP conference recently backed a strategy to treat the next election as a de-facto poll on independence, a move Swinney believes puts the party in a strong position to negotiate.</p>
