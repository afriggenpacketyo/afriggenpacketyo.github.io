          <p>The United States and China have agreed to de-escalate their trade tensions, adhering to a previous truce. Negotiators from both countries announced the agreement following high-level talks in London, signaling a commitment to the Geneva consensus. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the framework reached would be presented to President Trump for approval, with similar expectations for Chinese President Xi Jinping. The agreement also addresses Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports to the U.S. and potential rollbacks of U.S. tech sales restrictions to China. Optimism surrounding the agreement is tempered by the need for both presidents' approval before implementation.</p>
