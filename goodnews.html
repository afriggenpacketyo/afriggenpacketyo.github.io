          <p>Amid global uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariffs and strained relationships with Western allies, Defense Secretary Hegseth pledged to reinforce America's security partnerships in Asia. Speaking at a security forum, Hegseth emphasized the importance of maintaining strong alliances in the region. This statement signals a rare moment of continuity in security partnerships, contrasting with the Trump administration's often disruptive foreign policy approach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Corporate buzzwords are often used to convey pithy meaning, but studies show that using jargon impedes trust. Gen Zers are especially vulnerable, as they may lean into buzzwords and cling to them like corporate life rafts. Employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon, and new words buzz all the time. The author suspects buzzwords are really about people using poetry to distract from the fact that all they're doing is trying to make money, because that's all most buzzwords are ‚Äî metaphors.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a volatile week, influenced by President Trump's comments on China's trade agreement and inflation data. Nvidia's strong earnings report and guidance boosted its stock, while Salesforce faced concerns over its focus on AI. The Federal Reserve's cautious approach to monetary policy, as indicated in its May meeting minutes, added to market uncertainty. The S&P 500 gained nearly 2% during the holiday-shortened week and jumped more than 6% in May, but tariffs and inflation remain key factors impacting market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who worked with 3,000 young adults shares five simple rules for raising successful kids. The rules include following your instincts, following your culture, following your kid, focusing on enjoyment, and being your real self. The psychiatrist advises parents to trust their instincts, embrace their cultural traditions, and pay attention to their child's unique interests. The psychiatrist also advises parents to focus on enjoyment rather than obsessing over developmental milestones, and to be authentic rather than striving for perfection.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix, outperforming his McLaren teammate Lando Norris. Piastri's advantage suggests that a rule change aimed at restricting the flexing of front wings for aerodynamic gain has had no effect on McLaren. The rule change was introduced by governing body the FIA after intensive lobbying by Red Bull, who - along with Ferrari - hoped it would peg back some of McLaren's performance. Piastri said the rule change had limited impact on McLaren and the way they prepared their car for the race.</p>
