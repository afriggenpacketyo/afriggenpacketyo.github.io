          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed the Genius Act, creating the first major federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The bipartisan legislation aims to provide consumer protections and clear operational rules for the $250 billion market, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. Proponents believe this will foster innovation in digital payments, while some financial institutions like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are already exploring how to integrate the technology.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto has emerged as a dependable ace for the team, a transformation he attributes to his high-pressure experiences during last season's playoffs. After an inconsistent rookie year, Yamamoto delivered a crucial, scoreless performance in a winner-take-all game against the San Diego Padres, which he says was a major source of confidence. Now an All-Star, the Japanese right-hander has become a stabilizing force in the Dodgers' rotation, demonstrating significant growth in both his technical skills and his mental fortitude on the mound.</p>

          <p>Netflix announced strong financial results for the second quarter, with revenue rising 16% to $11.1 billion and net income increasing by 46%.

Netflix also raised its full-year revenue forecast, signaling confidence in its strategy. The company noted its ad-supported tier is gaining traction, with expectations to nearly double ad revenue in 2025.</p>

          <p>To commemorate its 70th anniversary, Disneyland has unveiled a new attraction, "Walt Disney — A Magical Life," which notably features the park's first audio-animatronic figure of Walt Disney himself. The show aims to present the company's founder as the visionary behind the global enterprise, using what creatives call their most lifelike robotic figure to date. While the creation has generated excitement, it has also sparked debate, with some family members expressing concern that it could reduce Disney's legacy to that of a theme park character rather than a real person.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed the GENIUS Act, the country's first significant standalone legislation regulating cryptocurrency, specifically targeting stablecoins. The bill's passage followed a period of intense political drama where some Republican lawmakers initially blocked its progress before President Trump intervened to secure the necessary votes. The legislation, which now heads to the president's desk, establishes formal rules for stablecoin issuers, including reserve requirements and anti-money laundering provisions. Proponents believe it will cement the U.S. as a leader in digital assets and fundamentally change commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has overturned the 2017 fraud conviction of Mark Johnson, a former HSBC foreign exchange trader who was jailed for allegedly manipulating currency rates. Johnson had been found guilty of 'front-running' a $3.5 billion currency trade for a client, a practice his defense argued was a standard risk-management technique known as 'pre-hedging'. After a nine-year legal battle, which included serving time in U.S. and U.K. prisons, his conviction was thrown out following a 2023 court decision that invalidated the law used to prosecute him, resulting in a full acquittal.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the history of air travel, tracing its journey from a source of wonder and awe in the early 20th century to the often frustrating experience it is today. While a "golden age" of glamorous flying is often imagined, the reality was that mid-century air travel was more expensive, dangerous, and less comfortable than modern flights. The author argues that deregulation, cost-cutting measures, and increased security have contributed to its decline in quality. Ultimately, the piece suggests that flying's transformation into a mundane, everyday technology is a natural cycle for any major innovation.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced its intention to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 for all U.K. elections, a key promise from the Labour Party's recent campaign. The move, part of a broader package of democratic reforms, would enfranchise approximately 1.6 million teenagers. Proponents argue that 16-year-olds who can work, pay taxes, and join the army should have a say in government. While the change is likely to pass in Parliament, it remains a divisive issue, with critics questioning the maturity of younger voters and the potential political impact.</p>

The physician noted that all test results were normal and that the president remains in excellent overall health.

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg and other top Meta executives have agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders who sought $8 billion in damages over the company's handling of user privacy violations. The lawsuit, filed in 2018 after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, alleged that executives' actions led to massive fines and legal costs for the company. The settlement amount was not disclosed, but the agreement was reached just as the trial was beginning in a Delaware court. This resolution allows the defendants, including Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg, to avoid testifying under oath.</p>
