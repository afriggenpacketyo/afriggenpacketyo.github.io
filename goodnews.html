          <p>Chinese issuers, including struggling developer Seazen Group, are significantly increasing their activity in the offshore dollar bond market, marking the highest issuance level since 2022. Seazen, once a top-ten builder, is seeking another bond deal after a US$300 million offering earlier this year, aiming to refinance existing debt and support general corporate purposes. This renewed interest signals a reopening of financial channels that closed during China's property crisis and economic slowdown, as companies find more favorable refinancing terms. Total dollar note sales from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau have reached approximately US$80 billion in 2025, a 21% increase from the previous year, indicating a potential rebuilding of investor trust in the sector.

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue indicated that a highly anticipated meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping is more likely to occur next year rather than this fall. While Trump had previously suggested a meeting around a multilateral summit in South Korea next month, followed by reciprocal visits, the Chinese readout of their recent call did not include such details. Perdue's comments came during a rare visit by a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers to Beijing, where discussions included the potential presidential meeting and resolving differences over TikTok. The ambassador emphasized that the relationship between the two leaders is currently "very good and very encouraging."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding previously frozen at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). U.S. District Judge Rita Lin granted a preliminary injunction, asserting that the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by suspending grants without specific details or proper procedures. This ruling follows a prior injunction that restored $81 million to UCLA from the National Science Foundation. The frozen funds, primarily medical research grants from the National Institutes of Health, were suspended over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action, with the administration seeking a $1 billion payment from UCLA.</p>

          <p>Former Premier League manager Sam Allardyce observes that modern football is increasingly adopting the direct, set-piece-focused style he pioneered decades ago, often to criticism. Alladyce notes a shift away from possession-based play towards long balls, big strikers, and strategic set-pieces, which he believes were ahead of their time. He highlights examples like Manchester United and Chelsea using long passes, and the growing importance of set-piece coaches, as seen with Arsenal. Allardyce also discusses his past practice of watching games from the stands for a better overview, a tactic now used by coaches like PSG's Luis Enrique, suggesting a cyclical nature to footballing philosophies.</p>

          <p>Laura Weir, the new CEO of the British Fashion Council, highlights resilience as a crucial leadership trait for navigating the fashion industry's current challenges, including tariff uncertainty and economic slowdowns. Weir, formerly Selfridges' creative director, took the helm as President Donald Trump imposed "reciprocal" tariffs on over 180 countries, significantly impacting key manufacturing bases for fashion. She expressed optimism about working with American counterparts to explain the tariffs' impact on designers' commercial viability. A survey of business leaders supports her view, with over 60% identifying resilience as the most important quality for navigating economic uncertainties, emphasizing the need for open dialogue and inclusive leadership.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris's memoir, "107 Days," details pivotal moments from her recent, unsuccessful election campaign, attributing the loss partly to insufficient time and agitation from President Joe Biden's staff. She recounts a distracting pre-debate call from Biden, who questioned rumors about her support in Philadelphia, which she found self-serving and ill-timed. Harris also reveals her preference for Pete Buttigieg as a running mate, but felt their combined identities would be a liability, and found Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro had "unrealistic expectations" for the Vice President role. Additionally, she reflects on a gaffe during "The View," where her inability to name anything she'd do differently from Biden became a damaging soundbite for the Trump campaign.</p>

          <p>British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel Fattah has been freed and reunited with his family after nearly six years of imprisonment in Egypt. A prominent political prisoner, Abdel Fattah was pardoned by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi following a request from the National Council for Human Rights. His release comes after extensive advocacy, including a prolonged hunger strike by his mother, and international pressure. Abdel Fattah, who gained prominence during the 2011 uprising, had been arrested in 2019 and convicted of "spreading false news." His family expresses immense joy, though uncertainty remains about his ability to travel to the UK to be with his son.</p>

          <p>Zheng Yongnian, dean of public policy at Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, advocates for China to create a unique foreign relations knowledge system, distinct from Western frameworks. This initiative aims to more effectively explain China's foreign policy and global role to the world, bolstering Beijing's push for global influence and intellectual autonomy. Zheng's call aligns with China's Global Governance Initiative, which promotes a multipolar, inclusive global order based on sovereign equality and multilateral cooperation. The argument posits that international relations have been predominantly viewed through a Western lens, and a China-centric approach is crucial for its strategic objectives.</p>

          <p>Writer Jack Thorne lauded the "remarkable" journalists who uncovered widespread phone hacking in the media, ahead of ITV's new drama "The Hack." Thorne, known for "Adolescence," initially perceived the scandal as solely about journalistic misconduct but now recognizes it as a troubling nexus between the press, politics, and police. The series will depict the story from the perspectives of investigative reporter Nick Davies and police detective Dave Cook. Thorne emphasized the bravery of these journalists in holding their own industry accountable, contrasting it with the Post Office Horizon IT scandal where journalism struggled for public traction until dramatization.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Introduces Megablock for Large-Scale Renewable Energy Storage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 21:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has launched the Megablock, an advanced grid-battery upgrade designed to accelerate large-scale renewable energy projects. Comprising four Megapacks around a transformer, the Megablock requires minimal connections, promising to simplify electrical work and enable deployment of one gigawatt-hour of storage in just 20 days. Despite challenges in its EV sales this year, Tesla's energy-storage division, particularly the Megapack, has been a success, powering the world's largest wind farm and France's largest storage system. This innovation is crucial for integrating renewable energy into the grid and offers potential benefits for EV owners charging at home, marking a significant step in sustainable energy infrastructure.
