        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's High Court has ruled that PPE Medpro, a company associated with Baroness Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman, must pay £122 million in damages for breaching a government contract during the COVID-19 pandemic. The court found that the surgical gowns supplied by the firm for NHS workers did not meet the required sterility standards, rendering them non-compliant with the agreement. This judgment follows a lengthy legal battle initiated by the Department of Health and Social Care to recover funds paid for the unusable equipment. The case has intensified scrutiny over the government's "VIP lane" for procurement and has led to calls for Baroness Mone to be stripped of her peerage.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security and SSI benefits will continue to get their monthly payments on schedule. This is because the program is funded through a permanent appropriation that does not require annual renewal by Congress. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is affected, which will lead to the furloughing of some staff and the suspension of non-essential services. As a result, recipients may face delays in tasks such as benefit verifications, earnings corrections, and obtaining replacement Medicare cards until the shutdown is resolved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor Company reported an 8.2% increase in its third-quarter U.S. sales, largely propelled by strong demand for its electric vehicles and large SUVs. Sales of all-electric models surged by 30.2%, setting a new quarterly record, with the Mustang Mach-E seeing a 51% jump compared to the previous year. This sales boost is partly attributed to consumers purchasing EVs ahead of the expiration of federal tax incentives at the end of September. The overall auto market is expected to show growth for the quarter, reflecting a trend of increased EV adoption across the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Healthcare experts are highlighting the critical importance of the Medigap open enrollment period for Americans turning 65 and enrolling in Medicare Part B. This one-time, six-month window allows new enrollees to purchase any Medicare supplemental insurance (Medigap) plan without being denied coverage or charged higher premiums due to pre-existing health conditions. Missing this period can result in being locked out of affordable supplemental coverage later in life, potentially leading to significant out-of-pocket medical expenses. With healthcare costs rising, understanding and utilizing this enrollment window is a crucial step for seniors to ensure predictable health expenses in retirement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Cleveland Browns have announced that rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel will make his first NFL start, replacing veteran Joe Flacco for their upcoming game against the Minnesota Vikings in London. The decision comes after the team's 1-3 start to the season, during which the offense has struggled significantly, ranking near the bottom of the league in scoring. Flacco's performance has been poor, with a low passer rating and multiple interceptions. The move to Gabriel, a third-round draft pick, also brings attention to fifth-round pick Shedeur Sanders, who remains the team's third-string quarterback but has generated considerable interest.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer, Kevin Scott, revealed that the company's long-term strategy is to primarily use its own custom-designed chips in its data centers for artificial intelligence workloads. This move would reduce Microsoft's dependence on current market leaders like Nvidia and AMD, giving it greater control over the optimization of its entire system, from silicon to networking and cooling. While Microsoft currently relies heavily on Nvidia's GPUs, it has already developed its own chips, such as the Azure Maia AI Accelerator. This vertical integration strategy reflects a broader trend among major tech companies to create specialized hardware tailored to their specific AI needs.</p>

          <p>The Oktoberfest festival in Munich reopened to the public on Wednesday evening after being temporarily shut down for several hours due to a bomb threat. The threat was linked to a suspect in a deadly house fire who was found to have written a note mentioning the event. Munich's mayor announced the reopening after police, using bomb-sniffing dogs, conducted extensive searches of the festival grounds and found no immediate danger. The incident began early Wednesday when a house fire, believed to be arson, led to the discovery of explosive devices and the death of the suspect, prompting the precautionary closure.</p>

          <p>Internet access was restored across Afghanistan on Wednesday after a nationwide shutdown of over 48 hours that was imposed by the Taliban government without explanation. The blackout severely disrupted daily life, crippling digital communications, banking services, and even air traffic control systems. The restoration of service came as a surprise to residents, and the Taliban has remained silent on the reason for both the shutdown and its reversal. The incident drew condemnation from the United Nations, which warned that the outage was exacerbating the country's severe humanitarian crisis and threatening its economic stability.</p>
