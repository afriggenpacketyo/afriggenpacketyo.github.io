          <p>A Harris's hawk, known for dive-bombing around 50 residents of Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has been given a permanent home with a local falconer. The hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," was captured last month after causing injuries, including one instance where a man was hospitalized. Falconer Wayne Housden has been training the bird and spent around ¬£1,000 building an aviary to stabilize him. Housden plans to keep the hawk full-time and hopes to release him in the autumn, ensuring he won't be abandoned again.</p>

Despite later pleading guilty to felonies and receiving a pardon from President Trump, Giuliani emphasized Kerik's unwavering love for the country and commitment to service.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, known for owning Tesla and SpaceX, once served in the US government as head of the Department of Government Efficiency.

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the importance of UK saltmarshes as crucial "sinks" that sequester climate-warming greenhouse gases. These tidal habitats lock away carbon in layers of mud, making them unsung heroes in the fight against climate change. WWF is advocating for the inclusion of saltmarshes in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals to incentivize their restoration and protection. The UK has lost approximately 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860, with many drained for agriculture.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has begun deliberations on legislation that would allow married couples to keep separate surnames, marking the first debate on the issue in 28 years. Despite growing public support, passage of the opposition-backed bills is unlikely during the current Diet session due to reluctance from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. A revision to the Civil Code is required to enable couples to maintain different family names after marriage, a practice largely abandoned by women. Recent polls show that 71% of respondents support the dual family-name system.</p>
