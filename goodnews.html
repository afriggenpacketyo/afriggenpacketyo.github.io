The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an estimated 31,800 new HIV infections in the United States in 2022.

          <p>The U.S. government is planning to build an $8.5 million insect dispersal facility in Texas to combat the spread of New World screwworms. The facility will breed millions of sterile New World screwworm flies, which will be released into the wild to mate with females and prevent them from laying eggs in wounds. The initiative aims to protect live cattle and other animal imports from the devastating pest. The USDA also plans to spend $21 million to convert a facility in Mexico into one for breeding sterile screwworm flies. New World screwworms can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, and, in rare cases, people.</p>
