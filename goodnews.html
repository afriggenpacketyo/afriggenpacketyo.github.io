          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order that seeks to lower U.S. drug prices by tying them to lower prices in foreign countries, a policy dubbed the "most favored nation" approach. The order aims to address the disparity in drug costs, which are significantly higher in the U.S. compared to other developed nations. The White House expects drugmakers to offer discounts in response to the administration's efforts to address prices abroad, and the order directs the HHS Secretary to set clear targets for price reductions. Shares of U.S. drugmakers fell in premarket trading following the announcement.</p>

          <p>Crude oil futures jumped 4% following an agreement between the U.S. and China to slash tariffs, easing trade tensions between the world's two largest petroleum consumers. The agreement, which will remain in place for 90 days, saw the U.S. reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 30%, while China lowered tariffs on American goods to 10%. Low oil prices had been pressuring U.S. shale oil producers, who need prices around $65 per barrel to drill new wells profitably.

          <p>Financial experts say that paying off a $30,000 debt in one year is possible with a strategic plan and discipline, emphasizing the importance of creating a consistent repayment schedule. They suggest making significant savings changes, such as downsizing a vehicle, to free up more cash. Lowering interest rates through balance transfer credit cards or debt consolidation loans is also crucial. Boosting income through raises or part-time jobs can further accelerate debt repayment, but it's important to address underlying spending patterns to avoid accumulating debt again.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have announced an agreement to cut reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, with both sides recognizing the importance of a sustainable, long-term, and mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship. The U.S. and Chinese representatives convened for talks in Geneva, Switzerland, this weekend in a bid to establish the basis for negotiations in a broader potential trade deal. President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff measures announced in April touched off a spiralling trade war between the two economic giants, roiling markets and prompting fears of a recession in the U.S.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Democratic Alliance (DA) is challenging new employment equity laws in court, arguing they are unconstitutional and economically harmful. The Employment Equity Amendment Act imposes strict hiring targets for non-white employees, aiming to boost the hiring of Black people and other groups. The DA claims the act violates anti-discrimination clauses and gives the state too much regulatory power, while supporters see it as essential for transformation and addressing historical inequalities. The court's ruling is pending, with the debate highlighting the complexities of balancing equity and economic growth.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury jet from the royal family of Qatar for use as Air Force One, raising questions about the legality of the move. The administration will retrofit the plane for Trump's official capacity, and it is set to be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation after his term. The move comes amid delays and budget overruns in modernizing the existing Air Force One aircraft, with Trump expressing frustration and weighing alternatives earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent characterized the recent trade agreement with China as a step towards the U.S. reducing its reliance on Chinese products for strategic necessities. While a generalized decoupling from China is not desired, Bessent emphasized the importance of resilient supply chains for critical medicines, semiconductors, and steel. The agreement, a 90-day pause, will see reciprocal duties halted, with a 10% tariff and a 20% charge related to fentanyl remaining in place. Bessent also noted that Chinese officials are now serious about assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of precursor drugs.</p>
