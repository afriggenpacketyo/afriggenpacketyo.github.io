        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is calling on the financial sector to adopt a more positive narrative about investing in stocks and shares to help stimulate economic growth. In a speech, she argued that the focus has been too heavily on risks rather than potential benefits, and announced the government is working with regulators to provide better support for would-be investors. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to encourage the movement of savings from cash ISAs into UK investments. The move aims to boost the economy without resorting to unpopular tax hikes amid current economic contractions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author and podcaster Jennifer Romolini, a self-described "reformed workaholic," discusses her approach to finding peace and purpose in Los Angeles after a high-pressure career. She emphasizes emotional regulation, community, and intentional self-care over the commodified, performative aspects of the wellness industry. Romolini shares her favorite local spots for tranquility, such as the Bellevue Recreation Center and the Philosophical Research Society, and discusses her new podcast "Extended Scenes," which explores redefining success in the second half of life. Her journey reflects a shift from chasing external validation to cultivating internal calm and creative fulfillment.</p>

          <h2>Massive Martian Meteorite, Largest Piece of Mars on Earth, Heads to Auction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 16:49:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, is being auctioned by Sotheby's with an estimated value of $2 million to $4 million. The rock, designated NWA 16788, was discovered in Niger in 2023 after traveling an estimated 140 million miles through space, likely dislodged from the red planet by an asteroid impact. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, accounting for only about 0.6% of all meteorites found on our planet. This particular piece represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on Earth, offering a significant opportunity for scientific study.</p>

          <p>At the inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit at Carnegie Mellon University, former President Donald Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy firms will invest over $90 billion in the state. The investments are aimed at developing a new artificial intelligence economy by leveraging Pennsylvania's tech sector and energy resources, including the construction of power-intensive data centers. The event, hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, brought together top industry executives and administration officials. While promoted as a major economic boost, the summit also drew protests from activists concerned about its focus on corporate interests and fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>General Motors announced it will add production of its popular gas-powered Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado, and GMC Sierra vehicles to its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan, starting in 2027. The move is intended to meet strong and persistent customer demand for these models. The Escalade is currently built in Texas, while the trucks are also produced in Indiana; this expansion adds capacity rather than replacing existing lines. This decision builds on GM's recent $4 billion investment in U.S. facilities and notably allocates a plant previously slated for electric vehicle production to internal combustion engine vehicles.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a trade agreement with Indonesia, reducing a planned 32% tariff on its goods to 19%. In exchange, Trump stated that the U.S. will gain "full access" to Indonesian markets and that the country has agreed to purchase billions in American energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing jets. The deal is the latest to emerge after the administration threatened dozens of countries with high tariffs earlier this year. Terms of the agreement were not immediately confirmed by Indonesian officials, and it follows a pattern where deals with other nations have left key issues unresolved.</p>

          <p>This article explores the best age to buy an annuity, concluding there is no single answer as it depends on individual financial goals and circumstances. Generally, older buyers receive higher payouts due to shorter life expectancies, but financial advisors often recommend the 60-70 age range as a balanced window. For deferred annuities, buying earlier in one's 50s allows more time for tax-deferred growth. Key factors to consider include immediate versus future income needs, personal health, risk tolerance, and the potential benefits of "laddering" annuities by purchasing them at different times.
