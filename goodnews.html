          <h2>Homeland Security Secretary Suggests Potential Changes to TSA Liquid Rules for Air Travel</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:34:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags. Speaking at a conference, Noem stated she is questioning all current TSA procedures, including the 3.4-ounce limit for liquids, and suggested it could be the next major policy change. This follows the recent immediate removal of the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes during security screening. While no specific details or timeline were provided, the potential reform stems from the deployment of new CT scanners that provide more detailed 3D images of baggage contents.</p>

          <p>Members of Congress from both parties set aside political divisions to play in the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game, a charity event benefiting the Young Survival Coalition. The organization supports young adults diagnosed with breast cancer, a cause deeply personal to many participants, including co-founder Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a survivor herself. Unlike the partisan men's baseball game, the women's event features a single unified team of lawmakers competing against a team of female journalists known as the "Bad News Babes." The game, now in its 17th year, has successfully raised nearly $5 million for the cause, providing a rare moment of unity on Capitol Hill.</p>

          <h2>Scientists to Analyze 1.5-Million-Year-Old Ice Core for Climate Change Insights</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:18:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An ice core, potentially over 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in the UK, where it will be melted to study Earth's ancient climate. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the sample contains trapped air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash that hold clues about temperature, wind patterns, and atmospheric composition from a previously unknown period. Scientists hope the analysis will provide crucial data on the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, a mysterious period when Earth's glacial cycles changed dramatically. This research could revolutionize understanding of natural climate shifts and help predict future responses to human-caused warming.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June Amid Declining Rice Prices</h2>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food costs, decreased to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and aligning with economists' expectations. The drop was partly attributed to an easing in rice price inflation after the government released stockpiles, though overall inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. This data arrives as the nation faces economic growth concerns due to potential U.S. tariffs and cost-of-living issues. While persistent inflation could support an interest rate hike, some analysts believe the central bank will wait until 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK to Implement Stricter Affordability Checks for 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Services</h2>

          <p>New regulations in the United Kingdom, set to take effect next July, will require 'Buy Now, Pay Later' (BNPL) providers to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The move, overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), aims to bring the largely unregulated sector in line with other forms of credit and protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt. As a result, some shoppers may be denied this form of credit, and the process will include clearer information on fees, cancellation rights, and the potential impact on credit ratings. The FCA estimates the rules will save consumers £1.8 billion over a decade.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in a class-action lawsuit brought by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders regarding the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. The lawsuit alleged that officials, including Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg, failed to protect user data and violated a 2012 FTC consent decree, leading to massive fines and legal costs. Shareholders were seeking to have the defendants personally reimburse Meta for an estimated $8 billion in associated expenses.

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced that his country will lift its veto on the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had been holding up the unanimous approval required from all 27 member states due to concerns about a separate EU plan to halt Russian gas imports by 2028. Fico stated that Slovakia received guarantees from the EU regarding its future gas prices and supply, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade. The new sanctions target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including measures to further restrict Russian oil and gas revenue and cut more banks from the SWIFT payment system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a medical explanation of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), the condition President Trump was recently diagnosed with. CVI is a common circulatory issue, affecting up to 40% of the U.S. population, where damaged valves in leg veins hinder blood return to the heart, causing blood to pool and leading to symptoms like swelling and varicose veins. According to vascular surgeons, the condition is generally not serious and is often managed with non-surgical treatments like compression stockings and lifestyle changes. In more advanced cases, skin discoloration or ulcers can occur, but for most patients, the symptoms are mild and treatable.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army has awarded a $43.5 million contract to Epirus for its advanced Leonidas high-power microwave (HPM) air defense system. This technology is designed to counter unmanned aircraft, including drone swarms, by emitting an electromagnetic field that disrupts and disables their electronics. The system is intended to provide critical low-altitude defense for military installations and formations, addressing the growing threat of 'Trojan Horse' drone attacks. The investment follows successful prototype deployments and will fund the delivery of two new-generation systems for further testing, with potential for a formal Army acquisition and deployment for homeland and overseas defense.</p>

          <p>Nine-time NBA All-Star Damian Lillard is reportedly finalizing a three-year, $42 million contract to return to the Portland Trail Blazers, the team where he spent his first 11 seasons. The deal is said to include a player option and a no-trade clause. Lillard, who was waived by the Milwaukee Bucks earlier in the month, chose to return to Portland despite interest from other playoff contenders. He is expected to miss the entire upcoming season while recovering from surgery for a torn Achilles tendon sustained during last season's playoffs, but his return solidifies a new core for the rebuilding Trail Blazers.</p>
