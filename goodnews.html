        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Athletics Championships in Tokyo began under grueling conditions, with temperatures climbing to 30°C and humidity exceeding 90%. Despite the heat, Japanese race walker Hayato Katsuki secured a bronze medal in the 35km event, marking a celebratory moment for the host nation. This event is particularly significant as it welcomes spectators, unlike the 2020 Olympics held in the same city under pandemic restrictions. The extreme weather has prompted organizers to reschedule marathon start times and raised concerns for athlete safety, with several competitors requiring medical attention after their races.</p>

          <p>In a stunning high school football game, Corona Centennial defeated the nation's top-ranked team, Mater Dei, with a final score of 43-36. Centennial dominated the first half, leading 33-7, largely by forcing multiple turnovers from Mater Dei. Although Mater Dei mounted a dramatic 29-0 comeback in the third quarter to take the lead, Centennial rallied in the final quarter to secure the historic victory. This marks Mater Dei's first loss to a Southern Section opponent other than St. John Bosco in a decade, significantly altering the landscape of Southern California high school football for the season.</p>

          <p>Line dancing is shedding its old-fashioned image and enjoying a significant revival, becoming a popular trend among younger generations, largely thanks to social media platforms like TikTok. The renewed interest is also fueled by the crossover success of country-pop artists such as Sabrina Carpenter and Dasha, whose songs have inspired viral dance challenges. Enthusiasts note that the community has become more diverse, with modern line dancing classes incorporating music from various genres, not just country. This cultural shift has transformed the activity from a niche hobby into a mainstream social and fitness phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Pre-orders for Apple's new iPhone 17 series have seen exceptionally strong demand in China, setting new sales records on major e-commerce platforms. On JD.com, sales in the first minute surpassed the entire first-day volume of last year's iPhone 16 series. The high demand caused technical difficulties on Apple's official website, and in-store pickup slots in major cities like Shanghai were fully booked within minutes. As of Saturday morning, customers in Guangzhou face wait times extending into mid-October, indicating robust consumer interest in Apple's latest devices despite a competitive local market.</p>

          <p>A state minister from Bavaria, Germany, has indicated that the region remains open to and welcomes investment from Chinese companies, despite broader economic tensions between the European Union and China. Commemorating a 50-year history of political engagement with Beijing, the minister emphasized that protectionism is not the solution to achieving European economic resilience. The statement highlights a pragmatic approach to international economic relations at the state level, contrasting with the more cautious stance often seen at the federal and EU levels. Bavaria continues to view China as a key economic partner alongside the U.S. and Japan.</p>
