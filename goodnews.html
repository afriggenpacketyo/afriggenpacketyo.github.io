          <p>Spinner Liam Dawson has been selected for England's Test team to face India, marking his first appearance in this format in eight years. The 35-year-old left-armer replaces Shoaib Bashir, who is sidelined with a broken finger. Dawson's inclusion is seen as a move to bolster England's lower-order batting, as his first-class average surpasses that of some top-order players. This unexpected recall comes after a long period away from the Test side, during which England played 102 matches, highlighting a significant return for the experienced Hampshire player.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest pilot performed what he described to passengers as an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 military aircraft during a landing approach in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot stated that air traffic control, which operates visually at the airport, did not provide a warning about the converging military plane. He apologized for the sudden turn, explaining it was the safest option given the bomber's speed and proximity. The Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Air Force are both investigating the incident, which involved a flight with 76 passengers and four crew members.</p>

          <h2>Understanding IRS Rules: Tax Filing Extensions Do Not Delay Payment Deadlines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 11:23:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies a common misconception about IRS tax extensions, emphasizing that they only provide more time to file tax returns, not to pay the taxes owed. The deadline for payment remains April 15, and failing to pay by this date results in penalties and interest, even if a filing extension has been granted. To avoid these charges, taxpayers should estimate their liability and pay as much as possible when requesting the extension. For those unable to pay their full bill, the IRS offers options like installment agreements and an Offer in Compromise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has dismissed a legal challenge against the expansion of the Wimbledon tennis grounds, allowing the All England Club's plans to move forward. The proposal aims to nearly triple the site's size by developing the former Wimbledon Park Golf Club, adding 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium. A local campaign group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued the development was unlawful because the land was protected for public recreation. The judge ruled that the planning authority's decision was a rational judgment, though the campaign group has indicated it may appeal the ruling.</p>

          <h2>Market Analysts Discuss Potential for Gold to Reach $3,500 Amid Economic Factors</h2>

          <p>Experts are divided on whether the price of gold can reach the $3,500 per ounce threshold by the end of July, after its rally stalled near $3,400 in April. Some analysts believe a significant move is unlikely without a major economic catalyst, such as a Federal Reserve interest rate cut or increased global instability. Others note that gold can be volatile and that developments in trade policy could provide the necessary push. Key factors influencing gold's short-term performance include central bank purchasing activity, geopolitical tensions, inflation data, and the strength of the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave climbed over 7% after the company revealed plans for a $1.5 billion bond sale. The capital raised from the notes, which are due in 2031, will be used for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. This move follows a successful $2 billion debt offering in May that was heavily oversubscribed and a recent announcement of a $6 billion AI data center project in Pennsylvania. Since its Nasdaq debut in March, CoreWeave's stock has more than tripled, reflecting strong investor confidence despite some concerns about its debt levels. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's football across Europe, as seen in Euro 2025, nations in Eastern and parts of Southern Europe have struggled to keep pace. This article explores the reasons for this disparity, citing a lack of investment, inadequate infrastructure, and persistent cultural biases that view football as a "man's game." Experts note that the collapse of state-sponsored sports after the fall of communism and the rise of right-wing politics emphasizing traditional values have also hindered development. However, initiatives from UEFA and increased budgets are beginning to show positive results, offering hope for future growth.</p>

          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has warned that public service media (PSM) is under a "serious threat" and has called on YouTube to give more prominence to content from broadcasters like the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4. The report highlights that children now watch significantly more YouTube than all public service channels combined, risking the future of PSM if this trend continues. Ofcom suggests that the government should consider legislation to ensure the visibility of PSM content, particularly news and children's programming, on major online platforms to help it reach younger audiences and remain relevant.</p>

          <p>This article explores the persistent and dangerous problem of bird strikes at airports, a challenge that costs the airline industry hundreds of millions of dollars annually. It details the wildlife management efforts at Boston's Logan International Airport, where teams use pyrotechnics, air cannons, and habitat modification to deter birds from flight paths. The piece also delves into the history of forensic ornithology, which began after a fatal 1960 crash at Logan, and explains how identifying bird species from remains helps engineers design safer aircraft. Despite these efforts, the risk of catastrophic strikes remains a constant concern.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the unusual but sometimes necessary practice of using sunscreen on animals, from zoo elephants to household pets. Vets and zookeepers explain that animals with light-colored or sparse fur, like certain dog breeds, white cats, and even pigs, are susceptible to sunburn and skin cancer. The practice is a human solution to problems often created by humans, such as selective breeding for appearance or keeping animals in unnatural environments. While applying sunscreen to a cat can be a challenge, it can prevent serious health issues for vulnerable animals exposed to intense sun.</p>
