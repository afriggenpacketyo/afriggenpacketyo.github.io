          <p>Former President Donald Trump attended a New York Yankees game against the Detroit Tigers, marking the anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Prior to the game, he met with the team in their clubhouse and delivered a speech, an event that manager Aaron Boone described as an honor. This was Trump's first appearance at a Major League Baseball game since the 2021 World Series. The event featured heightened security, particularly in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, with Secret Service and sniffer dogs present throughout Yankee Stadium to ensure safety.</p>

          <p>Following a session where all major stock indexes reached record levels, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued against market pessimism, suggesting that positive economic indicators will continue to drive growth. He acknowledged that factors like national debt and geopolitical tensions fuel bearish sentiment but contended that individual company performance can overcome these broader concerns. Cramer pointed to a strong IPO market and Oracle's recent rally as evidence of underlying market strength. He advised that money managers who remain bearish risk underperforming and losing investors if they do not adapt to the current bullish environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Angel Studios, the distributor behind the successful film "Sound of Freedom," made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ANGX. The company, which focuses on "values-based storytelling," went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Founded by the Harmon brothers, Angel Studios evolved from a movie-filtering service into a content production and crowdfunding platform with its own streaming service. The studio's content slate is determined by its 1.5 million "Angel Guild" members, reflecting its unconventional, community-driven approach to entertainment production and financing.</p>

          <p>Stock prices for Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance saw significant increases following reports that Paramount Skydance is preparing a takeover bid for its rival. The potential acquisition would consolidate major media assets, including CNN, HBO, and the Warner Bros. film studio, under one umbrella. This move comes shortly after the completion of Paramount's own merger with Skydance, led by David Ellison. The reported deal signals further consolidation within the media industry as companies adapt to the streaming era and navigate political scrutiny from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Toronto International Film Festival featured several potential awards contenders, including competing biopics about professional fighters from the 1990s. Benny Safdie's "The Smashing Machine," starring Dwayne Johnson as MMA fighter Mark Kerr, was noted for its conventional approach, while David Michôd's "Christy" earned praise for Sydney Sweeney's portrayal of boxer Christy Martin. Other notable films included Nia DaCosta's dynamic adaptation of "Hedda Gabler" starring Tessa Thompson and Guillermo del Toro's faithful yet unique take on "Frankenstein." The festival also highlighted Baz Luhrmann's Elvis Presley concert film "EPiC," celebrating the musician's Las Vegas performances.</p>

          <p>A Scottish couple, Michelle and John Wylie, have finally solved the four-year-old mystery of an unknown man who appeared in their wedding photos. After their initial inquiries among family and friends yielded no answers, a recent appeal to an internet content creator successfully identified the man. It was revealed that the guest, Andrew Hillhouse, had accidentally attended the wrong wedding after being given the incorrect venue by his partner. Realizing his mistake only when the bride walked down the aisle, he felt too committed to leave and was even included in a group photograph before quietly departing.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's new striker, Yoane Wissa, has demonstrated remarkable determination throughout his career, particularly after surviving a traumatic acid attack at his home in 2021. The incident, which occurred just before his move to the Premier League, could have ended his career, but he showed a strong will to recover and succeed. His recent £55m transfer from Brentford to Newcastle was contentious, as Wissa publicly pushed for the move, souring his legacy with some Brentford fans. However, his on-field performance and development made him a key target for Newcastle.</p>

The proposed legislation would have reduced the tax burden on the sale of newly constructed commercial and apartment buildings to address concerns that the original measure slowed housing production. The bill was pulled just before its first committee vote due to the need for further amendments, with plans to reintroduce it in January.

          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced a bizarre incident during the first round of the BMW PGA Championship that he believes ultimately helped his score. After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes just before a weather delay, his ball was apparently stolen by two spectators. When play resumed, the missing ball allowed him to take a penalty drop instead of playing a more difficult provisional ball. Fitzpatrick suggested this saved him at least one stroke, contributing to his six-under-par 66 score. He finished the day two strokes behind the leaders.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have declined to their lowest point in nearly a year, with the average 30-year rate now at 6.35%. This drop is attributed to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. The article advises potential homebuyers and those considering refinancing to evaluate whether to act now or wait for potentially lower rates, acknowledging the risk that rates could rise again. For homeowners, refinancing could be beneficial if current rates are at least a percentage point lower than their existing mortgage, though closing costs must be considered.
