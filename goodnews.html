          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 07:20:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chancellor has announced that changes to the winter fuel payment will be implemented this year, allowing more people to qualify for the allowance. This decision reverses a previous policy that limited the payment to those on pension credit, a move widely criticized after local elections. While details on the specific changes and eligibility criteria remain unclear, the government aims to address concerns from charities and MPs regarding pensioners with slightly too high incomes who were affected by the previous policy. The pensions minister clarified that the payment will not revert to a universal system benefiting all pensioners, including millionaires, but eligibility will be expanded, with further details expected in the autumn Budget. Optimism for the economic situation has resulted in this partial reversal of the measure. </p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back the Snack Wrap to its U.S. menus starting July 10, after a nine-year hiatus due to preparation complexities. The revived Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in Ranch and Spicy flavors, a change from the original version that offered grilled or fried chicken with various sauce options. Customers have been actively petitioning for the return of the Snack Wrap, with one Change.org petition garnering nearly 19,000 signatures. The company has acknowledged the significant role of social media in influencing the decision to resurrect the popular menu item. </p>

          <p>Oklahoma has successfully implemented a universal pre-kindergarten program, offering public elementary school to all 4-year-olds regardless of income. The program's success is attributed to a combination of motivated individuals and strategic legislation that closed a loophole and addressed concerns from private childcare facilities. The program avoids the common issues of bankrupting private childcare by allowing public schools to contract existing qualified providers. Other states can learn from Oklahoma's focus on the 'how' rather than the 'why,' emphasizing the importance of keeping the childcare industry afloat, developing an appropriate curriculum, and building sufficient facilities to feel the benefits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite efforts to reduce imports of Russian gas and oil, the European Union has increased its purchases of Russian fertilizer since the invasion of Ukraine. Russia's share of EU fertilizer imports has grown to about 30%, raising concerns about dependence on Russia and undermining fair competition for European producers. The EU plans to introduce tariffs on fertilizers imported from Russia and Belarus, gradually increasing them to 50% by 2028, to encourage sourcing from alternative markets or increasing the use of organic fertilizer. While fertilizer producers support the tariffs, farmers' groups are concerned about the lack of affordable alternatives to Russian fertilizer.</p>

The Chelsea captain, who has 88 caps for England, expressed that it would not be fair to take the place of another player who is fully ready to contribute. Bright's decision follows the retirements of Mary Earps and Fran Kirby, marking a significant setback for the Lionesses.

The inner section of the Oort Cloud resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy. This discovery, relying on data and simulations, challenges the previous understanding of the Oort Cloud's shape and could provide clues about the orbits of distant comets.</p>

The announcement contained a provision that if the deal is not finalised by 9 July, the UK's steel tariff rate would be hiked to 50%. The UK government agreed to cut tariffs on some US beef products and ethanol - a renewable fuel made from crops.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that a sustained signal in the brain, following an experience, is crucial for generating an emotional response. The study, involving air puffs to the eye, found that an initial sensory phase is followed by a sustained phase in emotion-related circuits. Disrupting this sustained phase with ketamine blocked the emotional response, indicating its importance in linking experience and emotion. While the study provides insights into the neural basis of emotion, some researchers argue that the sustained signal may be involved in other cognitive processes as well.</p>

The proposed rules would set zero-emission sales targets for manufacturers, distributors, and installers, starting in 2027 and increasing to 90% by 2036. While the rules are intended to improve public health, opponents argue that they will strain the electric grid and increase costs for consumers.
