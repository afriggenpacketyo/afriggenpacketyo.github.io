          <p>The Kansas City Chiefs clinched their first win of the season, overcoming a sloppy initial performance to defeat the New York Giants 22-9. Despite a stagnant first half where key passes were dropped and the offense struggled, quarterback Patrick Mahomes rallied the team, finding a rhythm and exploiting the Giants' secondary. He connected with Tyquan Thornton for a touchdown and set up another score, while the Chiefs' defense effectively shut down Russell Wilson, limiting him to 160 passing yards. This crucial victory shifts Kansas City's record to 1-2, providing a much-needed morale boost as New York remains at 0-3.</p>

          <p>China's five-year plan functions as the nation's overarching roadmap, meticulously guiding its social and economic development over distinct five-year periods. This foundational document, a model initially adopted from the Soviet Union, establishes specific quantitative development goals across diverse sectors and delineates strategic priorities for critical industries. Beijing has consistently published these plans since 1953, with a brief hiatus, and they have been pivotal in China's remarkable journey from extreme poverty to its current status as the world's second-largest economy and a leading technological powerhouse. The plans are crucial for understanding the country's long-term national direction and aspirations.</p>

          <p>Rachael De Foe, a Singaporean professional, dramatically increased her annual income to $220,000 by transitioning from a traditional nine-to-five public relations job to fractional work. Experiencing burnout in her previous agency roles, she launched her company, Redefy, in 2020, capitalizing on the pandemic-driven need for more flexible and leaner communication solutions. As a fractional head of communications, she now manages the overall strategy for multiple clients on a part-time basis, granting her significant autonomy over her hours and client selection. This career shift has not only boosted her earnings but also provided a more fulfilling and sustainable work-life balance, allowing her to avoid the pressures of a single employer.</p>

          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), maintained its benchmark one-year loan prime rate (LPR) at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5% for the fourth consecutive month. This decision came despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent 25-basis-point interest rate cut, defying some expectations for further stimulus. The PBOC's move aligns with economists' forecasts, suggesting authorities are holding off on major stimulus amid a recent stock market rally, even as economic data indicates fatigue, including slowed retail sales and industrial output growth. The one-year rate impacts most new and outstanding loans, while the five-year rate affects mortgages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kelsey Mitchell delivered a playoff-career high of 34 points, leading the Indiana Fever to a surprising 89-73 victory over the top-seeded Las Vegas Aces in Game 1 of their WNBA semi-final series. The Fever, despite facing a late third-quarter rally from the Aces, responded with an 11-0 run to secure a decisive lead. Mitchell, who was fifth in MVP voting, shot an impressive 52.2% from the floor, setting the tone for Indiana's offense. This win spoiled A’ja Wilson’s celebration of becoming the WNBA’s first four-time MVP, as the Aces suffered their first home loss since August 2.</p>

          <p>China's GJ-11 'Sharp Sword' unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an advanced system in the People’s Liberation Army, appears to be adapted for crucial roles in intelligent warfare. Recent observations of the drone, specifically its visible folding wing hinges, suggest a naval variant, possibly the GJ-21, is being developed for deployment on aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships. Images resembling the UAV's wing profile were also featured on the emblem of China's first Type 076 amphibious landing ship, informally known as a "drone carrier." These indicators collectively imply the GJ-11 could become the world's first operational ship-based stealth combat drone.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that parents who raise children with exceptional social skills often employ nine key practices focused on emotional safety and authentic connection. These include openly discussing feelings, modeling empathy in daily interactions, and fostering genuine confidence through trust and encouragement. Crucially, they teach children how to repair relationships after conflict, validate their feelings, and help them recognize social cues. Furthermore, these parents allow children space to resolve conflicts independently, treat mistakes as learning opportunities, and prioritize listening over lecturing. These approaches build resilience and compassion, preparing children for healthy real-world relationships.</p>

          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK Work and Pensions Secretary, has declared that welfare reform "must happen" to ensure people receive necessary support and to address the escalating cost of benefits. His pledge follows the government's reversal on a flagship policy that would have cut nearly £5bn from disability and health-related benefits. McFadden aims to offer skills and employment support to 3.7 million working-age individuals currently on sickness benefits, challenging the "binary divide" of the current system. While not ruling out tightening eligibility for Universal Credit, he emphasized that the current system is "unhealthy" and contributes to rising benefit costs.</p>

          <p>Scientists on Nantucket, a region with a high Lyme disease rate, are exploring genetic engineering of wild mice to reduce the transmission of the tick-borne illness. The "Mice Against Ticks" project, led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, aims to introduce a gene that makes mice immune to Lyme, thus preventing ticks that feed on them from becoming infected. This novel approach, which utilizes CRISPR technology, would speed up evolution by passing immunity generationally without harming the mice or the ecosystem's food chain.
