          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White is set to star as Bruce Springsteen in the upcoming film "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere," which focuses on the creation of the 1982 album "Nebraska." In an interview, White discussed the challenges of embodying the iconic musician, particularly during a period of significant mental health struggles for Springsteen. The actor, known for his role in "The Bear," shared his own experiences with mental health and how they helped him connect with the role, emphasizing his focus on capturing the artist's emotional depth rather than attempting a perfect imitation.</p>

          <p>A recent study has highlighted the growing issue of "workslop," AI-generated content that appears complete but lacks substantive value, which is reportedly harming productivity. While artificial intelligence tools are often blamed, this article argues that the responsibility lies with employers who fail to properly implement the technology. The author contends that without adequate training, clear policies, and specific plans for using AI, businesses are setting their employees and the technology up for failure. True productivity gains require investment in the people using the tools, not just the software itself.</p>

Her journey began with a rejection for a team internship, but she successfully applied again two years later while pursuing her MBA. Cooper steadily climbed the ranks from a minimum-wage merchandising intern to various marketing and management roles within the organization. Her promotion is a significant milestone in Minor League Baseball, where only 14 of 120 teams were led by female general managers in the 2025 season.</p>

          <p>This article explores why the United States has historically been a hub for major inventions, from the light bulb to the internet. It credits figures like Thomas Edison, who pioneered the "invention factory" model by assembling diverse teams of experts to foster collaborative creation. The piece also highlights a unique American culture that encourages risk-taking, provides a robust financial ecosystem like venture capital, and destigmatizes failure, allowing entrepreneurs to learn and try again. This combination of collaborative spirit, financial support, and resilience is presented as a key driver of the nation's innovative success.</p>

          <h2>Child Development Expert Identifies Seven Parenting Habits That Undermine Mental Strength in Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 09:24:25 EDT</div>

          <p>A parenting expert outlines seven common habits that can lead to mentally weak children, based on a study of over 200 parent-child relationships. These include rescuing kids from every struggle, modeling perfection instead of accountability, and silencing their big emotions. The author advises parents to instead allow children to face age-appropriate challenges, apologize for their own mistakes, and validate feelings to build emotional resilience. Fostering autonomy through small choices and teaching the value of rest are also highlighted as crucial for developing mentally strong individuals who can regulate emotions and rebound from setbacks.</p>

          <p>Voters in Portugal went to the polls for municipal elections, with the mayoral race in Lisbon drawing particular attention after a recent streetcar crash killed 16 people. The incumbent mayor, Carlos Moedas, has faced public outcry over the incident but has refused to resign, stating it was a mechanical failure and not a political one. While the crash is a notable issue, many voters indicate that their decisions are more influenced by pressing local concerns such as the housing crisis, traffic congestion, and trash collection. The election pits Moedas, of a center-right coalition, against his center-left challenger, Alexandra Leitão.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses the conflict of loving the Harry Potter series while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's views on transgender issues. The author argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that the books' core message of rejecting supremacy and discrimination is valuable, despite their flaws and the author's personal stances. Instead of simply "offsetting" purchases with donations, the columnist suggests engaging with the material critically and in community, using the problematic elements as a catalyst for discussion and real-world action. This approach allows fans to reclaim the positive aspects of the story while actively grappling with its complexities.</p>
