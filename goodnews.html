          <p>An expedition team from Purdue University is preparing to investigate a "visual anomaly" in a lagoon on the remote Pacific island of Nikumaroro, believing it could be Amelia Earhart's lost Electra 10E aircraft. The object, visible in satellite imagery dating back to 1938, aligns with a theory that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan landed and were marooned on the island in 1937. Researchers will use sonar and magnetometers before attempting to dredge the object for identification. If confirmed, Purdue University, which originally funded the plane, hopes to bring the historic aircraft back to its campus in Indiana.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of a deadly mass shooting at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Michigan, a fundraiser was established to support the wife and children of the accused shooter. The organizer, a fellow church member, cited a religious duty to care for the afflicted, noting the family is also a victim of the tragedy and has a son with serious medical needs. The initiative, hosted on GiveSendGo, has raised over $285,000, with many donors expressing forgiveness and support. The attack, which killed four people, was allegedly carried out by an individual who hated the Mormon faith.</p>

          <p>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has identified the remains of U.S. Navy Fireman 1st Class Edward D. Bowden, who was killed during the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Bowden, 29, was one of over 100 crew members who died aboard the USS California. His remains were among those buried as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu. Using modern dental, anthropological, and DNA analysis, the DPAA successfully identified Bowden as part of a project started in 2018 to identify the ship's remaining unknown sailors. He will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.</p>

          <p>Mariah Carey has confirmed the existence of an unreleased duet she recorded with Michael Jackson but stated that its release is currently blocked by his estate. Speaking on a recent talk show, Carey expressed her frustration, explaining that the track is a reinterpretation of one of Jackson's classic songs featuring her vocals. She believes the estate is holding the song for a larger planned release, possibly in conjunction with the upcoming biopic about the late pop star. Carey praised the unreleased track, noting that everyone she has played it for has had an overwhelmingly positive reaction.</p>

          <p>A recent decline in mortgage rates has provided financial relief for homebuyers, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.34% from 6.93% in January. For a $700,000 loan, this drop translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $4,351, which is about $273 less per month compared to the start of the year. Over the full 30-year term, this lower rate could save a borrower nearly $100,000 in total interest payments. The article also explores refinancing options for current homeowners, cautioning them to consider closing costs, which can range from 2% to 5% of the loan amount. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After struggling to conceive, Bay Area resident Marissa Chase was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common and often underdiagnosed cause of infertility affecting one in ten women. Her doctor explained that many women with PCOS do not ovulate regularly, making natural conception difficult without treatment. After receiving care at a fertility clinic, Chase successfully had two children and is now sharing her story to advocate for greater awareness. She encourages others facing similar challenges to seek medical help sooner rather than later, emphasizing the unique joy of parenthood that she believes everyone deserves to experience.</p>

          <p>Shares of Fair Isaac Corp., the creator of the FICO credit score, surged over 20% after the company unveiled a new pricing model that allows it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders. This change aims to eliminate markups imposed by the three major credit bureaus—Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax—whose stocks fell on the news. Lenders will now have a choice of pricing and distribution models, a move that analysts believe will improve Fair Isaac's economics while potentially disintermediating the credit bureaus. The Federal Housing Finance Agency director praised the decision as a creative solution to help American consumers.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year, though its stock dipped following the report. The rise in U.S. sales was partly driven by buyers rushing to take advantage of a federal EV tax credit that expired at the end of the quarter. However, the company faced a sales slump in Europe due to increased competition and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political rhetoric. Year-to-date, Tesla's deliveries are down about 6% compared to the first three quarters of the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla experienced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle sales for the third quarter, a rebound largely attributed to a rush of U.S. buyers capitalizing on a $7,500 federal tax credit before it expired. This marks the company's first quarterly sales increase after two consecutive declines. Despite the positive sales figures, the company still faces challenges, including market saturation in California and brand damage from CEO Elon Musk's political activities. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, suggesting the sales boost may be a temporary "sugar rush" rather than a sign of a sustained structural turnaround. (not investment advice)</p>

Occidental Petroleum, in which Berkshire already holds a 28.2% stake, plans to use $6.5 billion from the sale to pay down debt, a move its CEO says will enable the company to restart its stock buyback program.

The significant increase in the stock's value represents a substantial paper gain for the government's strategic investment in the domestic semiconductor industry.
