          <p>The Japanese government plans to spread soil from near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant on government grounds, including the prime minister's office, to demonstrate its safety. This initiative aims to reassure the public that the soil, which has low-level radioactivity, is suitable for public works projects across Japan. The soil was collected following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused the nuclear accident, and this marks the first time it will be repurposed outside Fukushima Prefecture. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi emphasized the importance of securing public understanding, though previous attempts to reuse the soil have faced local opposition.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee has warned against attempts to pressure authorities regarding tax investigations, stating that no one is exempt from tax obligations. This statement follows recent tax reviews on members of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, where at least 20 members were asked to prepay about HK$1 million. Lee emphasized the legal obligation of the Inland Revenue Department to conduct tax audits and assessments, regardless of profession, and highlighted that tax evasion could lead to a three-year jail sentence.

The MTR Corporation, which is nearly 75% government-owned, was fined HK$19.2 million, equivalent to a day of half-price fares for passengers.

          <p>Taiwan is intensifying its crackdown on public servants holding mainland Chinese identification and residency, with a wide-ranging investigation led by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC). The initial phase screened over 370,000 personnel in sensitive positions, and the second phase will include local government officials and public-school teachers. The investigation was initiated following a directive from Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te during a national security meeting in March. The MAC has instructed various agencies to conduct thorough checks on personnel, particularly those with access to sensitive information.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices have surged this year due to economic uncertainty, but central banks' purchases are also a significant factor. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, central banks' gold purchases have increased fivefold, as countries experiment with gold-backed digital assets. These initiatives aim for economic benefits and to bypass the dollar-denominated financial system. Gold is also being used by US adversaries to evade sanctions or finance activities that counter US national security interests.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has decided to allocate 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize energy bills for households and businesses during the summer to combat inflation. The subsidies are part of a larger relief package designed to counter the economic impact of U.S. tariffs. Critics suggest the measures aim to boost support for the government ahead of the House of Councillors election. The government had previously introduced utility bill subsidies in January 2023 to address rising energy prices.</p>
