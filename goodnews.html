          <p>The article explores the surprisingly strong relationship between President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump's personal liking for Starmer, coupled with strong historical ties and the UK's avoidance of trade conflicts with the US, contributes to this positive dynamic.

          <p>Despite claims that the Trump Organization's new $499 smartphone, the T1, will be "built in the United States," experts believe it will likely be manufactured in China.
