          <p>Prince Harry has made a surprise visit to Kyiv, responding to an invitation from Superhumans, an organization dedicated to supporting Ukrainians with life-changing war injuries. The Duke of Sussex emphasized his commitment to doing "everything possible" for the recovery of injured military personnel and is expected to detail new rehabilitation plans during his trip. This visit underscores the continued efforts of his Invictus Games Foundation and Archewell charitable foundation, which recently donated $500,000 to projects supporting injured children from Ukraine and Gaza, including medical evacuations and prosthetic development. The engagement highlights the ongoing royal family's support for Ukraine amidst the conflict.</p>

          <p>South Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix announced its readiness to mass produce next-generation HBM4 high-bandwidth memory chips, solidifying its lead over rivals like Samsung Electronics and Micron Technologies. These chips are vital for artificial intelligence computing, notably expected to power Nvidia's forthcoming Rubin architecture. The company's HBM4 product offers double the bandwidth and a 40% increase in power efficiency compared to its previous generation. This strategic development follows a period of strong demand, which saw SK Hynix achieve record operating profits, and analysts anticipate its market dominance in AI memory will continue into the coming year.

This intergenerational knowledge exchange is reshaping office collaboration, with about half of surveyed employees reporting that AI helps bridge generational divides. Senior directors acknowledge that this partnership allows them to focus on higher-value tasks and unlocks new business opportunities. Overall, a significant majority of workers believe AI enhances efficiency and career prospects, saving an average of 55 minutes daily and improving hybrid team operations.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are expected to open higher, despite data released showing the UK economy flatlined in July, following a 0.4% expansion in June. This economic stagnation in the UK adds to the Bank of England's considerations for its upcoming monetary policy update. Separately, the European Central Bank maintained its key interest rate in a widely anticipated move. In corporate news, Spanish lender Sabadell's board unanimously recommended rejecting a hostile takeover bid from domestic peer BBVA, while Ryanair's CEO threatened to cut more tickets to Spain due to tax policy disputes. International investors are also looking ahead to the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting next week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper, its low Earth orbit satellite network, has secured its first in-flight WiFi contract with JetBlue, marking a significant step in its competition with SpaceX's dominant Starlink. Despite Starlink's substantial lead in deployed satellites and existing airline partnerships, Kuiper's nascent success injects a fresh challenge into the rapidly expanding satellite-powered internet market. Amazon aims to deploy 1,600 satellites by July 2026, a fraction of Starlink's current constellation, relying on its Blue Origin launches and other commercial providers. The burgeoning market for LEO satellite services is expected to benefit billions lacking internet access and users in remote regions, with global operators planning tens of thousands of launches by 2031.

          <p>Great Britain's Davis Cup team must defeat Poland in Gdynia to secure a chance at winning next year's title, facing this World Group 1 tie without world number seven Jack Draper due to injury. Despite a significant ranking advantage for players like Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley over their Polish opponents, captain Leon Smith warns against complacency, likening the matchup to an FA Cup upset scenario. The tie is critical for Britain to maintain its elite status, as a defeat would lead to a relegation play-off. The team's top doubles pair, Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash, are set to debut, adding another layer of intrigue to the contest.</p>

The railway project, initiated seven years ago but paused during the pandemic, is expected to take five more years to complete.

          <p>A controversial bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales is set for a two-day debate in the House of Lords, following its backing by MPs in June. Supporters urge peers to respect the Commons' decision, while opponents highlight "massive problems" and call for further scrutiny, citing concerns from a Lords committee about the bill's underdeveloped nature and unspecified governmental powers. Lord Falconer, championing the bill, argues for respecting the elected representatives' decision. The legislation proposes allowing terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, requiring approval from multiple medical and legal figures.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) serves as a crucial remedy for the current weaknesses in the global multilateral system, which is described as faltering 80 years after World War II. The author argues that the United Nations is increasingly sidelined by unilateral actions and trade wars, with the Global South marginalized in decision-making. The SCO is presented as an alternative governance approach, embodying principles of cooperation among diverse cultures, ideologies, and political systems. It aims to counter fragmentation and the erosion of international law by providing a platform for negotiation and collaboration.</p>
