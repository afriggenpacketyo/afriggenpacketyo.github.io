          <p>China and Cambodia are set to conduct their seventh joint military exercise, dubbed "Golden Dragon," which is expected to be larger in scale and feature more advanced equipment than previous iterations. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Southern Theatre Command held a departure ceremony in Zhanjiang, Guangdong province, showcasing troops from various branches of the military preparing for deployment. The two-week exercise will focus on joint counterterrorism operations and humanitarian relief. This increased military cooperation reflects the deepening ties between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Ofcom has launched investigations into two pornographic websites suspected of failing to comply with the UK's new child safety regulations. The regulator alleges that the sites, including one offering a "nudifying" service, have not provided adequate details on how they prevent children from accessing their platforms. Under the Online Safety Act, websites featuring pornographic material must implement robust age-checking techniques by July. Companies found in violation of the Act could face substantial fines. Ofcom stated that many services have provided details of effective age assurance methods, while others have blocked UK users entirely to prevent child access.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot expressed his disappointment at the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold, hinting that the England international will be joining Real Madrid. Alexander-Arnold announced his intention to leave Liverpool when his contract expires on June 30, 2025. Real Madrid has reportedly approached Liverpool about signing the player early to participate in the FIFA Club World Cup. Slot confirmed that Conor Bradley will start at right-back in the upcoming game against Arsenal, as the team prepares for Alexander-Arnold's exit. He likened the situation to his experiences at previous clubs, where good players often leave, creating opportunities for others to step up.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced his intention to give away 99% of his wealth, planning to end operations of the Gates Foundation in 2045. Gates cited Andrew Carnegie's "The Gospel of Wealth," emphasizing the duty of wealthy individuals to return their fortunes to society. The foundation will draw from its endowment to give away $200 billion, focusing on eliminating preventable diseases, eradicating infectious diseases, and reducing poverty. Gates also criticized the US, UK, and France for cutting foreign aid budgets. He raised concerns about cuts to a hospital in Gaza Province, Mozambique, which Donald Trump erroneously claimed was funding condoms for Hamas.</p>

          <p>Footwear company Keen has pledged to maintain its prices despite new U.S. tariffs on imports. The company has been proactively diversifying its supply chain for over a decade to reduce its dependence on any single country. While other retailers warn of potential price hikes, Keen operates plants in multiple countries and works with manufacturing partners across various locations, spreading costs across the company and its suppliers. Keen's COO stated that they are making a conscious decision not to increase prices, which is shared by their partners. This strategy allows the company to navigate trade uncertainties and avoid passing increased costs onto consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent market fluctuations following President Trump's trade announcements underscore the futility of trying to time the stock market. The S&P 500 experienced a post-election rally, a subsequent decline due to tariff concerns, and a partial recovery after Trump eased some levies. This volatility highlights the difficulty of accurately predicting market movements based on political events. While some investors attempted to hedge against tariff risks or buy during market dips, the overall lesson is that long-term investment strategies are more reliable than trying to time short-term market swings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI chatbots are designed to create the illusion of sentience and match the user's vibe, which can lead to unproductive and potentially unsafe interactions. Alison Gopnik suggests that LLMs should be cultural technologies that enable people to benefit from shared knowledge, expertise, and information gathered throughout human history. Instead of offering opinions, AI should serve as a new interface to knowledge, skills, and understanding of others. New AI systems can incorporate real-time search and use increasingly sophisticated methods for connecting AI outputs to specific, verifiable knowledge and sourced analysis.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a deal over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries. President Donald Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world still applies to most UK goods entering the US. But the deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium. This isn't a trade deal as Trump does not have the authority to sign the type of free-trade agreement, this lies with Congress. It is only the bare bones of a narrow agreement, there will be months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow.</p>
