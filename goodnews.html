          <h2>Emma Raducanu Finds Confidence and Motivation Despite Wimbledon Exit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:34:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a tearful exit from Wimbledon after a close loss to world number one Aryna Sabalenka, British player Emma Raducanu is drawing positives from her performance. The former US Open champion expressed that the hard-fought match demonstrated she is closing the gap with the sport's top players, a significant step in her comeback journey. Raducanu credited her improved play and mentality to recent coaching changes and a more joyful approach to the game. Although disappointed by the defeat, she feels motivated by the progress and believes she is moving in the right direction to challenge for major titles again.</p>

          <h2>Workplace Experts and Employees Debate Whether Crying at Work Signals Strength or Weakness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:11:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The act of crying in the workplace is sparking a conversation about professionalism and emotional expression, with many questioning outdated norms. While some still view it as a sign of weakness, particularly in male-dominated fields, many executive coaches and employees argue it reflects emotional intelligence and humanity. The article suggests that a supportive employer response can foster loyalty and motivation, and that showing vulnerability can be a powerful tool for leaders. Ultimately, while a single emotional moment is unlikely to derail a career, perceptions can vary and what matters most is an individual's overall performance.</p>

          <h2>Tiny Zooplankton Play Major Role in Carbon Sequestration, New Research Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:10:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in the fight against global warming due to their epic annual migration in the Southern Ocean. These animals feast on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to burn this fat, locking away vast amounts of carbon. Scientists calculate this process sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater amount than previously understood. This discovery highlights the crucial but often overlooked role of these small organisms in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

          <p>A pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the UK. The chick is one of ten born this season, a "bumper year" for the vulnerable species. Zookeepers strategically shared eggs between different nesting pairs to improve the chicks' chances of survival, entrusting one to the first-time foster parents. Same-sex pairings are not uncommon among penguins, with both parents typically sharing incubating and feeding duties. The zoo's colony plays a vital role in an international breeding program to protect the at-risk species.</p>

          <p>Hamas has submitted what it calls a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-backed proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza. While accepting the general framework, a senior Palestinian official stated that Hamas has requested several key amendments. These include a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail and that all humanitarian aid be distributed exclusively by the UN. The plan is believed to involve a 60-day ceasefire with a staggered release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, as Israeli military operations continued in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks has shared a list of five common foods he considers "toxic" and does not feed his own children. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and deli slices because of sodium and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, and lean, unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team kept their T20 series against India alive with a dramatic five-run, last-ball victory at The Oval.

The game's momentum shifted thanks to a fiery spell from England's Lauren Filer and a chaotic ending that saw England drop multiple catches. Earlier, England posted 171-9, powered by half-centuries from Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge before a stunning collapse saw them lose nine wickets for just 31 runs.</p>

Burns advocates for embracing the founders' complexities, including their flaws like slave ownership, to make history more accessible and powerful. He believes understanding this gritty, complicated past is essential for navigating present-day divisions and reaffirming the American experiment.</p>
