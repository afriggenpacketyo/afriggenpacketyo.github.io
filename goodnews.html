          <p>Paris Saint-Germain secured a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich to advance to the Club World Cup semi-finals, despite finishing the match with only nine players. After Désiré Doué scored the opening goal, Ousmane Dembélé added a second deep in stoppage time to seal the win. The intense and fast-paced game was marred by a serious ankle injury to Bayern's Jamal Musiala following a challenge from PSG's goalkeeper. Both teams had goals disallowed and saw players sent off in a chaotic finish to the match.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, 'Mark Twain,' details the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, the setting that profoundly shaped his youth and literary career. Traveling to gather material for his book 'Life on the Mississippi,' Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens, revisited the scenes of his formative years as a steamboat pilot. He found the experience deeply moving, reflecting on the freedom and independence he felt in that profession compared to his later life as a famous author. The journey highlighted both the changes to the river landscape and the enduring power of his memories.</p>

          <p>As per his own instructions, Mark Twain's full autobiography has been published 100 years after his death, revealing his uncensored thoughts on society, politics, and personal matters. The work was dictated over four years and intentionally structured in a non-linear, blog-like style, allowing him to speak freely without fear of immediate repercussions for those he criticized. Twain's candid memoir offers sharp commentary on figures like President Theodore Roosevelt and raw emotion regarding his family's tragedies. The century-long embargo was a deliberate choice by Twain to ensure his complete honesty and, as experts note, a brilliant marketing strategy.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris predicts an exciting British Grand Prix, with as many as six cars from three different teams having a realistic chance at victory. The qualifying session was exceptionally close, with the top six drivers separated by just 0.23 seconds. Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured pole position after adjusting his car for higher straight-line speed, while McLaren and Ferrari opted for different aerodynamic setups, creating a strategic battle between cornering speed and straight-line advantage. The varied car configurations and the potential for changing weather conditions suggest a highly competitive and unpredictable race at Silverstone.</p>

          <p>India is poised for victory in the second Test against England, largely thanks to a remarkable performance by captain Shubman Gill. After scoring 269 in the first innings, Gill added another 161 runs, allowing India to set England a near-impossible target of 608. In response, England's top order crumbled, leaving them at 72-3 by the end of day four, with key batsmen Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, and Joe Root dismissed. England now faces the difficult choice of attempting a record-breaking chase or batting for a draw to maintain their series lead.</p>

          <p>The phenomenon often described as 'old people smell' is a real biological process, not just a stigma, according to health experts. As people age, changes in skin composition and the breakdown of certain fatty acids produce a compound called 2-nonenal, which has a distinct musty or greasy scent. This compound is not easily removed by standard hygiene practices due to its oily nature. Experts suggest that managing this odor involves a holistic approach, including a diet rich in antioxidants, proper hydration, and antioxidant skincare, while also noting that some medications and hormonal changes can be contributing factors.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, arguing it established the novel concept of a 'citizen.' He emphasized that the nation's founding was a bloody civil war, not a sanitized event, and that understanding the founders' flaws makes their achievements more accessible and powerful. Burns advocates for telling a complete, complicated history that includes diverse voices, from the top down and bottom up, to foster a shared understanding. He believes this approach is essential for reinvesting in the common principles that hold the nation together.</p>

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently explained her decision to be a single parent, citing her own upbringing in a home with alcoholism and a tendency to 'lose herself' in romantic relationships. Theron stated she was honest with herself about her capacity to be healthy in a partnership while raising children and chose to build her family on her own. Relationship experts support her choice, viewing it as a sign of strength, self-awareness, and alignment with her personal values.

          <p>The rise of digital payment systems and touch-screen kiosks has led to an increase in tip requests in places where they were not previously expected, a phenomenon dubbed 'tipflation.' Customers are now frequently prompted to tip for services ranging from fast-food pickup to self-service checkouts, often with pre-calculated options of 15% or more. This creates social pressure and confusion about when and how much to tip. Experts note that this trend was accelerated by the pandemic's shift to contactless payments, and that system designers have an incentive to make tipping the default.</p>

          <p>A non-alcoholic 'cortisol cocktail' has gone viral on TikTok, with proponents claiming it can lower the body's primary stress hormone. The drink typically combines coconut water, orange juice, lemon, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that this combination of ingredients can meaningfully reduce cortisol levels. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, experts recommend proven stress-reduction methods like quality sleep, exercise, and therapy instead.</p>

          <p>A prototype of the MingKwai, an innovative Chinese typewriter designed in the 1940s by linguist Lin Yutang, has been rediscovered after being lost for decades. The machine is a crucial artifact in the history of modern computing, as it solved the immense challenge of inputting a non-alphabetic language with tens of thousands of characters. Its ingenious design, which broke down characters by shape rather than sound, is a foundational concept for how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed today. The discovery of the typewriter, now acquired by Stanford University, offers new insights into the efforts to preserve the Chinese language in the technological age.</p>
