          <p>The Denver Broncos secured a decisive 28-3 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, improving their season record to 2-2. Quarterback Bo Nix led the offense effectively, throwing for 326 yards and two touchdowns, while the Broncos' defense stifled the Bengals, sacking backup quarterback Jake Browning three times. This win marks a significant rebound for Denver, highlighting a strong team effort and a much-needed return to form after a challenging start to the season. The Bengals, meanwhile, continue to struggle with their star quarterback injured.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have announced a new peace plan for Gaza, calling on Hamas to accept its terms. The proposal includes an immediate end to military operations, the release of 20 living Israeli hostages and remains of over two dozen deceased, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. The plan stipulates no governance role for Hamas and outlines an economic development plan to rebuild Gaza, while leaving the door open for an eventual Palestinian state. International leaders have largely welcomed the initiative as a significant step towards peace.</p>

          <p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by former US President Donald Trump, who claimed he was wrongfully censored after his account was suspended following the January 6, 2020 Capitol Hill riot. The settlement, which includes $22 million for a White House construction project and $2.5 million for pro-Trump organizations, does not constitute an admission of liability.

The cubs received specialized care at the Ramona Wildlife Center, with minimal human interaction to encourage natural behaviors. This article highlights the efforts to reduce human-wildlife conflict and increase the population of mountain lions, a "near-threatened" species facing risks from vehicles, wildfires, and habitat encroachment. Researchers now estimate the California mountain lion population is significantly lower than previously thought.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace proposal, while presented with characteristic hyperbole, represents a significant diplomatic step and a shift in the administration's post-war position. This article analyzes that the plan, which includes an immediate ceasefire and hostage releases, faces fundamental obstacles from both Israeli and Hamas political constituencies, making its implementation uncertain. Ambiguities within the framework allow for potential sabotage during negotiations, and the plan lacks detailed specifics on crucial issues like Israeli withdrawal lines and post-war governance. Despite these challenges, the initiative aims to restart negotiations and bring Qatar back as a mediator.</p>

          <p>Paralympic long jumper and sprinter Stef Reid is advocating for major sports brands like Nike, Adidas, and Puma to sell single shoes instead of pairs. As an amputee, Reid highlights the financial waste and lack of inclusivity in current practices, where she had to buy two shoes but only needed one for her prosthetic blade. This article emphasizes that while brands feature inclusive imagery, the actual buying experience often falls short for amputees and individuals with different-sized feet, making her campaign a call for matching imagery with practical solutions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily suspended the Trump administration's plan to eliminate 532 jobs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the parent agency of Voice of America (VOA). The judge accused the administration of "concerning disrespect" for failing to comply with previous orders to restore VOA programming. This article highlights that the job cuts, intended to take effect Tuesday, would have affected the majority of VOA's staff, which broadcasts American values globally. Critics argue the cuts would silence a crucial source of fact-based news in repressive societies.</p>
