        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's Test cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has expressed frustration with the perception of his team's aggressive "Bazball" playing style, calling common misconceptions "disrespectful." He clarified that the approach is not about reckless aggression but about creating an environment where players can perform without being restricted by the pressures of international cricket. McCullum emphasized that the team's mindset is focused on allowing talent to flourish and achieving success, contrary to the simplistic characterization of their strategy. The coach dislikes the "Bazball" label and feels it undermines the hard work and determination of the players and staff.</p>

          <p>Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere has won a second term after his Labour Party emerged as the leader in a closely contested parliamentary election. The left-wing coalition, consisting of Labour and four allied parties, secured a narrow majority with 87 out of 169 seats in the parliament. The election campaign focused heavily on domestic issues such as the rising cost of living, public services, and wealth taxes. Despite the victory, the populist Progress Party on the right also saw significant gains, doubling its support compared to the previous election.</p>

          <p>China has demonstrated a model of "industrialisation-driven decarbonisation," achieving substantial environmental improvements without deindustrializing its economy. Research indicates that from 2015 to 2022, the average national level of PM2.5 air pollution fell by over 35%, a reduction comparable to what the United States achieved in three decades under its Clean Air Act. This progress is attributed to a revolution powered by cutting-edge green technology, extensive real-time environmental monitoring, and massive investments in sustainable infrastructure. Water quality has also seen significant improvements, showcasing a successful strategy of embedding environmental protection within industrial development.</p>

          <p>Staff at Angel Island State Park recently captured rare footage of a coyote swimming across the Raccoon Strait, a deep-water channel in the San Francisco Bay. The sighting provides a fascinating glimpse into how the island's "budding population" of coyotes, first observed in 2017, likely arrived from the mainland. Researchers believe the animals, which are strong swimmers, paddled about a mile against a strong current to establish a new predator niche on the island. The current coyote population, estimated at 14 to 17 individuals, is believed to have descended from a single breeding pair that made the surprising journey.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has upheld the city's decision to designate Marilyn Monroe's former home in Brentwood as a historic cultural monument, effectively saving it from demolition for a second time. The homeowners, who purchased the property in 2023 with plans to raze it and expand their adjacent estate, had challenged the landmark status in court. They argued the house had been altered too much to be historic, but the judge rejected their claim. The Spanish Colonial-style hacienda is the only home Monroe ever owned by herself and is where she died in 1962.</p>
