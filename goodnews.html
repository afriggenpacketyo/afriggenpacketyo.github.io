          <p>Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez publicly challenged Tom Homan after he threatened to refer her to the Justice Department for advising migrants on how to avoid deportation. At a town hall in Queens, Ocasio-Cortez asserted her right to free speech and offered guidance to migrants about their constitutional protections. Homan claimed her actions could be illegal and impede ICE's deportation efforts, suggesting she was teaching migrants to evade law enforcement. Ocasio-Cortez also criticized the Trump administration's border security policies, calling the deportation of Venezuelan gang members 'sanctioned kidnappings,' while emphasizing migrants' rights to demand a judicial warrant before allowing ICE to enter their homes or workplaces.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive three-year term as Australia's Prime Minister, marking the first such victory in 21 years. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging his party's underperformance during the campaign. Energy policy and inflation were central issues, with both parties recognizing the cost-of-living crisis affecting many Australians. Albanese highlighted improved relations with China, resulting in the removal of trade barriers that had previously cost Australian exporters billions. The election also underscored changing demographics, with younger voters outnumbering Baby Boomers for the first time, prompting both campaigns to address housing affordability.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese secured a second term as Australia's Prime Minister, a significant win for the center-left Labor Party amid a challenging economic backdrop. The victory was a notable defeat for the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton, whose campaign faced missteps and association with some of President Trump‚Äôs policies. The election took place against the backdrop of a cost-of-living crisis, with younger voters expressing disaffection with both major parties. Albanese's win suggests a preference for the 'known evil' over the uncertainties presented by the opposition, though it remains to be seen if Labor can maintain its parliamentary majority.</p>

          <p>Warren Donaldson, prompted by an NBA star's public service announcement, sought medical attention for symptoms he initially dismissed, leading to the discovery of a rare, large mass in his heart. Inspired by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's openness about atrial fibrillation, Donaldson consulted his doctor, who detected a protruding vein in his neck. Doctors found a pericardiac cyst the size of an orange growing within the muscle of his heart, compressing his right ventricular outflow tract. Donaldson underwent open-heart surgery to remove the mass and reconstruct his RVOT, enabling him to resume normal activities after recovery.</p>

          <p>Companies are grappling with the complexities of President Trump's shifting tariff policies, impacting pricing strategies across various industries. Pricing strategists are using customer research, economic modeling, and competitive analysis to determine optimal price points amid the uncertainty. The article notes that many companies are hesitant to raise prices quickly, fearing they may not be able to sustain those increases if tariffs are revoked. The potential scenarios are endless, requiring companies to consider shifting supply chains, inventory, and product offerings to manage tariff costs. The piece emphasizes that setting prices has become a more cross-functional task, as companies consider broader strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>According to experts, curiosity is the most important trait for successful dating, but modern dating apps can hinder genuine connection. Dating app profiles often provide too much information, leading to a lack of mystery and reduced effort to truly get to know someone. Maintaining an air of in-person wonder is vital for fostering real connections. Experts recommend asking open-ended questions that encourage storytelling and active listening, such as 'What made you light up this week?' This approach helps keep the joy of meeting new people alive and sparks deeper conversations.</p>

Elderspeak includes inappropriate endearments, plural pronouns, louder volume, shorter sentences, and simple words intoned slowly. Studies have shown a relationship between exposure to elderspeak and resistance to care among nursing home residents with dementia. The CHAT training program, which includes videos of communication between staff and patients, has been shown to reduce elderspeak and resistant behaviors in nursing homes and hospitals.</p>
