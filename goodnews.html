          <p>President Trump addressed the ongoing negotiations for a nuclear deal between Iran and the U.S., stating that he advised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against disrupting the talks because a solution was near.

He noted that while Iran still needs to agree to the final stages of the document, progress has been made, and a sensible agreement could be reached in the coming weeks. The article suggests a potential breakthrough in nuclear negotiations, aiming for a peaceful resolution with Iran. The tone is cautiously optimistic, reflecting a balance between potential progress and the need for final agreements. </p>

          <p>President Trump defended his tariff strategy, dismissing criticism that he always backs down from imposing tariffs, a concept dubbed the "TACO trade." He argued that his tariff threats have been instrumental in jumpstarting trade talks between the U.S. and the European Union. Trump highlighted that after announcing new tariffs, the EU expressed willingness to meet anytime, suggesting his approach is a negotiation tactic rather than a sign of weakness. Stocks initially fell after Trump's tariff announcement but rallied following the delay, indicating market sensitivity to trade policy. The article suggests that Trump views tariffs as a tool to gain leverage in trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

He highlighted the ongoing efforts to pass the GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate digital assets and potentially create trillions of dollars in demand for U.S. Treasuries.

          <p>President Trump's executive orders on nuclear power could lead to the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) in the U.S. by late 2030, according to GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik. Trump's orders aim to expedite the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) approval process for new nuclear plants, potentially allowing SMR construction to begin by 2027. GE Vernova recently received approval to deploy its BWRX-300 reactor in Ontario, Canada, marking the first SMR deployment in the West. The Tennessee Valley Authority has also applied to build a GE Vernova reactor in Tennessee, indicating growing interest in SMR technology.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as automakers navigate regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume to roughly 20% by 2030. Toyota's strategy aligns with potential shifts in federal fuel economy standards and emissions regulations, including a possible elimination of California's Advanced Clean Cars II rule. The company continues to invest in all-electric vehicles while recognizing the potential of PHEVs as a stepping stone for consumers hesitant to fully embrace electric technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Tokyo University of Agriculture reveals that domestic cats can differentiate between their owner's scent and that of a stranger. The research found that cats spent significantly more time sniffing tubes containing the odors of unknown people compared to their owner's smell. This suggests cats can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar humans based on their odour, although it remains unclear if they can identify specific people. The study adds to existing knowledge about cats' ability to use their sense of smell to recognize and communicate with other cats and potentially humans.</p>
