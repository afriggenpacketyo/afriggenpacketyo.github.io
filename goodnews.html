          <p>Following the Oklahoma City Thunder's NBA Finals win, a shooting near downtown Oklahoma City resulted in one injury. Police responded to the incident on the west side of Scissortail Park, where they found the victim with a gunshot wound. Several suspects reportedly fled on foot, and the victim was taken to a local hospital with an expected full recovery. The police described the scene as "hectic" due to the large celebratory crowd, and an investigation is currently underway to determine the circumstances surrounding the shooting. The authorities are working diligently to gather information and apprehend those responsible for the incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge increased defense spending at their upcoming summit, potentially reaching 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) due to pressure from the U.S. The proposed 5% consists of 3.5% for "pure" defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure like cyber warfare capabilities. While some member states support this target, others struggle to meet the existing 2% threshold agreed upon a decade ago. Despite potential clashes over the specifics, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East underscore the importance of increased defense capabilities. European aerospace and defense companies are closely monitoring these commitments, hoping for concrete government procurement to scale up production capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NHS Lothian is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, while known as a recreational drug, has shown potential in making patients more receptive to psychotherapy. Experts emphasize the importance of controlled administration and lower doses in clinical settings compared to recreational use, and the Royal College of Psychiatrists is set to release an updated report on psychedelics with information on ketamine. Prof Andrew McIntosh hopes to offer the treatment to patients with hard-to-treat depression, offering additional hope and an extra thing to help patients that is not currently available widely in Scotland.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. joining the war between Israel and Iran, global markets have largely remained stable, suggesting investors believe the conflict is contained. The MSCI World index saw only a slight decline, and safe-haven assets traded mixed, indicating a lack of widespread panic. Some analysts believe the U.S. strikes have reduced the nuclear threat in the region, minimizing systemic risk to global markets. Traders are closely monitoring potential countermeasures from Iran following the strikes on its nuclear facilities, but the initial market reaction suggests a contained geopolitical event. The markets view the attack on Iran as a relief with the nuclear threat now gone for the region.</p>

          <p>At an upcoming NATO summit in The Hague, Germany's military, the Bundeswehr, faces new challenges as NATO aims to set ambitious goals for defense spending and troop levels. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources to make the Bundeswehr the strongest conventional army in Europe, NATO's target of 5% of economic output on defense is met with skepticism. The German government supports a figure of 3.5% for defense and 1.5% for infrastructure, but achieving this by 2032 would require a significant increase in spending. The Bundeswehr also needs to recruit additional troops, potentially requiring between 50,000 and 60,000 new soldiers, though there are no plans to reinstate conscription at this time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing defense spending, a major demand by U.S. President Donald Trump, potentially giving him a significant win. NATO countries are expected to commit to spending 5% of their GDP on defense to deter Russia and appease Trump. While this goal is ambitious and could transform European societies, some countries like Spain are seeking exemptions, and others like Italy are requesting more time to meet the obligation. The summit may be disappointing for Ukraine, as its aspirations to join NATO are unlikely to be a central focus.</p>

          <p>New York City will implement ranked choice voting in its upcoming Democratic mayoral primary election, a system that allows voters to rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices. This process continues until a candidate receives a majority. While ranked choice voting aims to ensure broad support for the winner, it can also be complex and potentially lead to delays in election results.</p>

One image displays colorful gas and dust clouds in a star-forming region 9,000 light years away. Equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera, the observatory promises to revolutionize our understanding of the universe. The telescope will conduct a 10-year survey of the southern night sky, mapping the Milky Way and detecting potentially dangerous asteroids.
