          <p>King Charles III is hosting French President Emmanuel Macron for a three-day state visit, the first by an EU leader since Brexit, aimed at revitalizing the relationship between the two nations. The visit includes significant pageantry and high-level talks on defense, migration, and continued support for Ukraine, signaling a diplomatic reset after years of tension. Analysts note the King's active role in diplomacy and the strategic importance of the UK-France partnership in the face of European instability. The summit is expected to address contentious issues like migrant returns while reinforcing shared security interests.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a socialist, is receiving surprising financial backing from several wealthy individuals and millionaires, including venture capitalists and business owners. These supporters have publicly stated they are in favor of his proposals to increase taxes on the wealthy to fund social programs, believing they should pay their "fair share" for beneficial policies. The article notes that despite his radical agenda, Mamdani has assured business leaders he is not against private enterprise and recognizes the need for private housing supply.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis from Wedbush indicates that Nvidia's new B200 GPUs are in extremely high demand, with the company unable to produce them fast enough to fulfill orders. The report, based on observations from Asia, notes that these advanced chips are perpetually on back-order, with priority given to supercomputing centers and major cloud providers. This supply constraint is positively impacting companies in the server and data storage sectors, like Dell and Seagate. The ongoing supply squeeze suggests continued potential upside for chip and storage stocks, provided that trade policies do not disrupt the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A proposal to make at least 10 Premier League soccer games available on free-to-air television each season is being considered by UK Members of Parliament. The Liberal Democrats have tabled an amendment to the Football Governance Bill, which would mandate the new independent regulator to ensure these matches are publicly accessible. Proponents argue that the "jewel in the crown of British football" has been locked behind expensive paywalls for too long. The government has indicated it has no plans to change the current system, citing the importance of broadcast revenue for investment back into the sport.</p>

          <p>As part of its new five-year development plan, China is strategically positioning Guizhou, historically one of its poorest provinces, as a key "strategic hinterland." This initiative aims to bolster the nation's economic and industrial landscape, particularly in response to ongoing trade tensions. Provincial leaders are aligning with the national strategy to leverage Guizhou's comparative advantages. The plan, introduced in late 2023, reflects a broader effort by Beijing to enhance domestic resilience and reshape its economic geography for long-term stability and growth.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Ban Use of NDAs in Workplace Misconduct Cases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 17:44:24 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK government plans to ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will void any confidentiality clauses that prevent workers from speaking out about such allegations. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated it was "time we stamped this practice out," following years of campaigning by activists like Zelda Perkins, Harvey Weinstein's former assistant. The legal change aims to stop the misuse of NDAs for covering up criminality and brings the UK in line with several other countries.</p>

He and his team conducted airlifts as the only means of escape after bridges and roads were washed away.

          <p>The UK government has announced a second nationwide test of its mobile phone emergency alert system, scheduled for 3 p.m. on September 7th. The test will cause compatible smartphones to vibrate and sound a siren for 10 seconds, displaying a test message. This follows a 2023 test that revealed technical issues, with some users not receiving the alert. The system is designed for imminent life-threatening situations like extreme weather or terror attacks and has already been used successfully in several regional emergencies, including for a bomb disposal evacuation in Plymouth.</p>

While their possession-based style is formidable, they have also demonstrated an ability to score from set-pieces and long balls. Despite their dominance, both the coach and players state they still have room for improvement, a daunting prospect for their future opponents.</p>

          <p>Kelly Osbourne is engaged to Sid Wilson, the DJ for the band Slipknot, after he proposed to her backstage at her father Ozzy Osbourne's final concert. The moment, captured on video, included a humorous interruption from Ozzy, who jokingly told Wilson he couldn't marry his daughter before the proposal continued. Kelly and Wilson, who have known each other for over two decades, have a son together, born in late 2022. The engagement took place in front of family and friends, marking a happy milestone for the couple.</p>

          <p>This article explores the tension between human officiating and technological aids in sports, highlighted by a recent incident at Wimbledon where the electronic line-calling system failed. Despite technology like Hawk-Eye and VAR being demonstrably more accurate than the human eye, controversies persist, fueling debate about their reliability and place in sports. Experts suggest our unease stems from a strong innate sense of fairness, where a technically correct call might not feel like a fair one, and a lack of perceived human control over the machines. The piece concludes that the ideal solution involves finding the right intersection between human oversight and technological precision.</p>

          <p>The UNESCO World Heritage Committee is currently meeting in Paris to decide on new additions to its prestigious list of protected sites. Among the 32 nominations are King Ludwig II's Bavarian palaces in Germany, including the famous Neuschwanstein Castle, as well as ancient fortresses in India and prehistoric rock art in Russia. The designation can bring global recognition and increased tourism but also faces criticism for its potential negative impacts on local communities. The committee will also address the growing threats to existing sites from conflict, climate change, and natural disasters, such as water scarcity and flooding.</p>
