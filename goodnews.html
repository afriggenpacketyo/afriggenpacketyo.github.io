          <h2>Shipping Giants Continue to Order Vessels from China Despite US Port Fee</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 01:00:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the US imposing a port fee targeting ships linked to China, major shipping companies like Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) are continuing to order vessels from Chinese shipyards. MSC's senior vice-president, Marie-Caroline Laurent, stated that the port fee would not deter them due to China's unmatched competitiveness in shipbuilding. The International Maritime Organisation's push for net-zero emissions in the shipping industry is driving investments in decarbonisation technologies and new ship orders. Laurent noted that reviving America's shipbuilding sector would require state subsidies and strategic asset retention, but this wouldn't immediately alter MSC's shipbuilding strategy. China's competence and capabilities in building these vessels for the energy transition remain unparalleled, making it the preferred choice for now.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's central bank has exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points, bringing it down to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, which saw the economy expand by 7.4% year-on-year. Despite this positive growth, the central bank has maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, indicating a slowdown compared to the previous financial year. The decision also comes amid a downtrend in India's inflation, with the most recent headline inflation reading for April at 3.16%, its lowest level since July 2019. The RBI had previously expressed concerns about growth amid potential tariff threats from the United States.</p>

The Dragon spacecraft is the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station, making the potential decommissioning a significant development.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have tested core components of quantum-based network in space, which is believed to be part of efforts to build secure communications systems without encryption keys. A laser module and phase encoding device were launched on a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket to test robustness against environmental stresses. This test marks a key step in China's transition from experimental validation to construction of fully integrated space-air-ground quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. QSDC sends messages directly through a quantum channel, skipping the key-sharing step, making the system more efficient and secure.</p>
