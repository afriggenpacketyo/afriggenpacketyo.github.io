        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The surging electricity demand from artificial intelligence data centers is prompting major technology companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google to form partnerships with nuclear energy producers. With data center power needs expected to double in five years, these firms are investing in restarting and extending the life of nuclear plants, such as Three Mile Island and Clinton Clean Energy Center. This move aims to secure a stable, 24/7 power source for their energy-intensive AI operations. The trend aligns with a broader push to expand domestic nuclear power to support the AI race and ensure grid stability.</p>

          <p>Meta's newly announced advanced AI research lab, MSL, has drawn attention for its significant number of employees with Chinese origins. Publicly listed hires reveal that seven of the eleven team members are graduates of prestigious Chinese universities who later pursued careers in the United States. The formation of this lab is part of Meta's ambitious goal to develop "personal superintelligence" for everyone. The company's aggressive recruitment for this new unit has also reportedly created tension with competitors like OpenAI, whose CEO has criticized Meta's high-value offers to attract top AI talent.</p>

          <p>Rio de Janeiro is deploying one of its largest-ever peacetime security operations for the upcoming Brics summit, which will host leaders from 28 countries. Approximately 20,000 military personnel will be on duty, with armed fighter jets enforcing a no-fly zone over the summit venue at the Museum of Modern Art. The city's main domestic airport will be closed to commercial traffic during the meetings to enhance security. This level of security, including the authority to shoot down threatening aircraft, was last seen during the 2016 Olympics, highlighting the significance of the international event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Fourth of July celebrations approaching, experts from Canine Companions offer advice for keeping dogs calm amidst loud fireworks. They recommend exercising dogs earlier in the day and providing mental stimulation, such as puzzle toys, to tire them out before evening festivities begin. For noise-sensitive dogs, it is advised to create a safe, comfortable space away from the noise, use white noise or calming music, and consider anxiety-reducing products like a Thundershirt. The primary advice is to avoid taking dogs to fireworks shows altogether due to their sensitive hearing and the potential for fear and stress.</p>

          <p>NASA has identified a new interstellar comet, named 3I/ATLAS, making it the third known object from another star system to visit our solar system. The comet was discovered using a telescope in Chile and is currently located near Jupiter's orbit, traveling at 37 miles per second. It poses no threat to Earth and will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, passing between the orbits of Mars and Earth. Astronomers are now monitoring the object to determine its size, shape, and composition, providing a rare opportunity to study material from outside our solar system.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article proposes a method to make popular anti-obesity drugs like GLP-1s more affordable for Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons, which inflates list prices, and instead having manufacturers charge health plans a direct, lower price. Employers could then contribute a portion of this cost, significantly reducing the out-of-pocket expense for employees to levels seen in other countries. This approach would simplify the pricing structure, increase access to clinically important medication, and empower doctors to make prescribing decisions based on patient needs rather than financial barriers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As part of the newly passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," tipped workers in the U.S. will receive a temporary tax exemption on their income. The provision allows workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from their taxable income, a move that would cover the majority of individuals in tipped occupations. The law includes a phase-out for high earners and restricts the exemption to jobs that customarily receive tips, with the IRS and Treasury to provide further definition. This policy, a key campaign promise for President Trump, is set to expire at the end of 2028 unless extended by Congress. (not investment advice)</p>
