        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Air traffic at Copenhagen Airport has resumed after being suspended for approximately four hours on Monday evening due to the sighting of several large drones in the vicinity. The closure, which began around 8:30 PM local time, forced the diversion of at least 35 inbound flights to other airports and halted all take-offs and landings. Authorities have launched an investigation into the incident, which caused significant delays and cancellations. The airport has advised passengers to check with their airlines for the latest information on their flight status as operations gradually return to normal.</p>

In the financial sector, he named Capital One, American Express, and Citigroup as attractive options. Cramer also identified potential value in the healthcare and technology sectors with companies like Incyte and Dell, as well as in industrials such as Caterpillar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal health officials have announced that the FDA is approving the drug leucovorin to treat speech-related deficits associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Previously used for cancer patients and to treat anemia, leucovorin is a form of folate that has shown promise in small studies for improving communication skills in some children with autism. The label update will allow state Medicaid programs to cover the drug for this purpose, and the NIH plans to launch further research into its safety and effectiveness. Experts caution that it is not a cure and should be administered under medical supervision, noting its potential benefits for a specific subset of children with ASD.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, waking residents across the region. The quake's epicenter was located just east of Berkeley, and shaking was felt as far as 100 miles away. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), thousands of people reported feeling the tremor just before 3 a.m. While the event caused some minor disruptions, such as broken windows and merchandise falling from shelves, there have been no reports of major damage or injuries. The incident serves as a reminder of the seismic risks in the region and the importance of preparedness.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta has formally accused Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr of engaging in unlawful intimidation of broadcasters to suppress disfavored speech. In a letter, Bonta cited Carr's demand that ABC "take action" against Jimmy Kimmel as a direct threat to First Amendment rights, arguing it constitutes an unconstitutional use of government coercion. Although Kimmel's show is set to return, Bonta stated his concerns remain, calling the incident part of a "dangerous attack" on critics of the Trump administration. He has called on Carr to disavow his threats and pledge not to use the FCC to retaliate against speech he disagrees with.</p>

          <p>Entrepreneur and "Shark Tank" investor Kevin O'Leary has stated that financial stress is the primary cause of marital failure, asserting that most relationships can survive infidelity but not monetary disputes. He views marriage as an economic partnership and emphasizes the importance of shared financial values and open communication about money early in a relationship. O'Leary advises couples to discuss spending habits and long-term goals to ensure compatibility, suggesting that marrying someone who is financially responsible is one of the most critical decisions a person can make. He advocates for a disciplined approach to personal finance. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to television, nearly a week after the show was "pre-empted indefinitely." The suspension followed Kimmel's monologue remarks about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which drew pressure from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr and led major affiliate owners to drop the program. In its statement, Disney explained the suspension was intended "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation" and that the decision to return was made after "thoughtful conversations" with the host. The controversy sparked a significant national debate on free speech, censorship, and governmental influence over media content.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service in England is launching a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if they present with the same symptoms three times without improvement. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid over five months. The guidance encourages doctors to conduct further tests, seek second opinions, or refer patients to specialists to help prevent avoidable deaths from delayed diagnoses. The initiative aims to make this "three strikes and rethink" approach standard practice to improve patient safety.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials have begun the process of drafting the country's 15th five-year plan, a comprehensive economic blueprint that will guide development from 2026 to 2030. This long-term planning is considered a core political advantage by President Xi Jinping, especially as China navigates domestic economic challenges and rising global tensions. The new plan will be crucial for achieving the nation's ambitious goal of reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035. Experts suggest that given the current turbulent environment, Beijing may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over the rigid quantitative targets that have characterized past plans.</p>

          <p>Police in Menlo-Atherton, California, believe they prevented a potential school shooting after receiving a tip through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system. The tip alerted authorities to concerning online posts made by a former student, leading to a temporary lockdown of two schools while the individual was located. Police recovered weapons from the student's home and are continuing their investigation. The "Say Something" system was created by Sandy Hook Promise, an organization founded by families of victims of the 2012 school shooting.
