          <p>YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former middleweight champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. by unanimous decision in a highly anticipated match. Paul controlled the early rounds as Ch√°vez Jr. started slowly, failing to capitalize on Paul's defensive weaknesses until later in the fight. Despite the loss, Ch√°vez Jr. acknowledged Paul as a "good fighter" but not yet ready for championship contention. Paul's victory marks a significant step in his effort to be recognized as a legitimate boxer, and he now looks toward future high-profile fights.</p>

          <p>With extreme temperatures affecting many regions, animal welfare charities are urging dog owners to take precautions to prevent heat-related illness, which can be fatal for canines. The RSPCA notes that dogs are more likely to suffer from overheating during exercise than from being left in hot cars. Key signs of heatstroke include heavy panting, lethargy, and vomiting. Experts advise against walking dogs in the heat of the day, suggesting early morning or late evening instead, and recommend checking pavement temperature to avoid burning their paws.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that a deal has been reached for a "group of very wealthy people" to acquire the U.S. operations of the social media app TikTok. The sale is intended to address national security concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data through TikTok's parent company, ByteDance. Trump, who has extended the deadline for the sale multiple times, stated he would reveal the buyer in about two weeks and believes the deal will receive the necessary approval from China's President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu is set to make its Ernie generative AI model open source, a significant move that could intensify competition in the global AI landscape. This decision marks a shift for Baidu, which previously favored a proprietary model, and follows the success of other open-source platforms like DeepSeek. Experts believe this could pressure closed-source providers like OpenAI and Anthropic by offering a powerful, low-cost alternative for developers. While some analysts see it as a "declaration of war on pricing," others note potential enterprise skepticism regarding security and data privacy. (not investment advice)</p>
