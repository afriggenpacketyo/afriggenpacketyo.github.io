          <p>Following his meeting with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump revealed his perspective on the talks in an interview with Sean Hannity. Trump stated, "there’s no deal until there’s a deal," but believes Putin "wants to see it done" and rated the meeting a "10" for their personal rapport. He declined to specify the main sticking point in negotiations, asserting that the next steps are up to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European nations. Trump also confirmed he would be open to a trilateral meeting and advised Zelenskyy to "make a deal."</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, marking the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect it to continue strengthening, potentially becoming a major hurricane over the weekend as it moves over the Atlantic. While not currently projected to make landfall in the United States, its path is being closely monitored. The storm is expected to pass north of the Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, bringing heavy rainfall and dangerous surf conditions.</p>

          <p>Following a federal court hearing, the Department of Justice has agreed to scale back the Trump administration's takeover of Washington, D.C.'s police force. D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will remain in command, and the newly appointed "emergency police chief" from the DEA will now serve as an intermediary. The agreement came after the District of Columbia sued the administration, arguing that Attorney General Pam Bondi's order was an illegal overreach of federal power. The judge expressed skepticism about the legality of the full takeover, prompting the administration to rewrite its directive.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of the first Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) in California that can be legally sold as a condominium, separate from the main house on the property. This development comes a year after the city passed a landmark law to allow such sales, aiming to create more accessible homeownership opportunities. Officials hope this new type of "starter home" will help address the state's severe housing crisis by providing more affordable options. ADUs, or "granny flats," have become increasingly popular and now account for about one-fifth of California's new housing growth.</p>

          <h2>Salton Sea Shoreline Found to Be a Minor Contributor to Regional Air Pollution, Study Shows</h2>

          <p>A new report indicates that dust from the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the lakebed is the primary cause of the region's severe air quality issues and high asthma rates. Researchers now suggest that efforts and funding might be more effectively spent on protecting people indoors with air filters and weatherization, rather than focusing solely on dust suppression projects. Other pollution sources include agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads.</p>

          <h2>Indian Clinical Trials Suggest Mangoes May Not Adversely Affect Blood Sugar in Diabetics</h2>

          <p>Two new clinical trials in India are challenging the common belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes. The research suggests that when consumed in moderation as a replacement for other carbohydrates, such as bread, mangoes may actually improve blood sugar control and other metabolic health markers. One study found that popular Indian mango varieties produced a lower glycemic response than white bread. Another eight-week trial showed that participants with type 2 diabetes who ate mango for breakfast saw improvements in fasting glucose and insulin resistance, offering new dietary hope for millions.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, has sparked conversation by altering an iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant. The painting, part of a larger piece celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series win, depicts Bryant in his famous celebratory pose but swaps his gold Lakers jersey for a white one with "Dodgers" in blue script. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that he wanted to include a tribute to the Lakers legend while keeping with the mural's Dodgers theme. The creative choice has generated mixed reactions, with many fans appreciating the crossover tribute while some purists question the change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the confirmed return of standalone physical stores to the UK High Street. After its parent company, Arcadia, collapsed in 2020, all stores were closed, but the brand was later purchased by online retailer Asos. Now, Topshop is aiming to recapture its former cultural relevance, hosting its first catwalk show in seven years and banking on millennial and Gen-Z nostalgia. Industry experts note the brand faces challenges in attracting new, younger shoppers and competing in a market dominated by fast-fashion giants and different consumer priorities.</p>
