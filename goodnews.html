          <p>Harvard University has discovered that a copy of the Magna Carta in its collection, purchased for $27.50 in 1946, is actually a rare version from 1300 issued by King Edward I, potentially worth millions. Researchers identified the document by comparing it to other known copies and using ultraviolet light to reveal faded details. The journey of the document to Harvard has been traced back to a British auction house and a World War I flying ace. The discovery underscores the enduring relevance of the Magna Carta's principles of individual liberty and self-governance.</p>

          <p>Disneyland's new "World of Color Happiness!" show, designed to celebrate the park's 70th anniversary, has received mixed reviews. While some find the show energetic and fun, others find its message of constant happiness oppressive and lacking in sentimentality. The show centers on the characters of "Inside Out" and their quest to discover what makes everyone happy. The Muppets' pre-show, however, has been widely praised for its humor and charm.</p>
