          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's dedication to preventing an "ongoing inflation problem," even amidst criticism from President Trump. Powell indicated that policymakers would likely remain cautious until they better understand the impact of tariffs on prices, characterizing economic growth as strong with the labor market near full employment. He reiterated that policy changes are constantly evolving, and their effects on the economy remain uncertain, while defending the Fed's independence from political pressure. House members questioned Powell on the criteria for a rate cut, to which he responded that data collected over the summer would be necessary to assess the potential inflationary effects of tariffs.

          <p>Two European brown bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park near Exeter, prompting an evacuation and a "code red" emergency procedure. The bears, weighing about 180kg each, made their way to the food store and consumed a week's worth of honey, remaining calm and not breaching any public areas. Trained firearms staff and police were deployed, and Lucy was eventually lured back with her favorite foods after about 55 minutes of roaming. An investigation has been launched to determine how the bears escaped, as there were no signs of damage to the enclosure.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ida Jones, the Morgan State University archivist, explains the significance of Juneteenth, which commemorates the day enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned of their freedom. Juneteenth allowed enslaved people to celebrate their freedom and identities, recognizing both their African and American heritage. Celebrations like parades were held in Baltimore City by the 1870s, given its large free population prior to the Civil War. Jones encourages people to visit museums to understand the history and lived experiences of freedom, emphasizing the importance of intellectual nutrition and recognizing the sacrifices made for freedom.</p>

          <p>Taxpayers can make several mistakes when dealing with tax debt that result in significant fees and penalties, according to experts. Common errors include assuming small debts are insignificant, ignoring IRS letters, and believing full payment is the only option. Other mistakes include not filing due to inability to pay, hiring unqualified assistance, and assuming bankruptcy eliminates all tax debt. Avoiding these mistakes requires proactive planning and understanding available IRS payment options such as installment agreements and offers in compromise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that Anthropic's use of books to train its artificial intelligence model Claude constituted "fair use" and was "transformative." The judge stated that the large language models (LLMs) did not reproduce the creative elements or expressive style of the copyrighted works. This decision is a significant win for AI companies, establishing legal limits and opportunities for the industry in using copyrighted works for developing and training LLMs. The ruling begins to set a precedent in the ongoing legal battles over AI training and copyright.</p>

          <p>Longevity expert Dan Buettner suggests that diets with less protein may extend life expectancy, citing figures showing Americans consume more protein than recommended. He points to research indicating that low-protein diets are beneficial, especially in middle age, and recommends about 3g of protein for every 10 pounds of body weight. Plant-based proteins are highlighted as particularly important, with beans, legumes, and nuts being excellent sources. Studies suggest that high protein intake in younger individuals may be linked to increased risks of cancer and mortality.</p>

          <p>A gay anti-bullying PSA from the late 2000s, featuring Hilary Duff, has become a cult classic due to its memorable message and over-the-top style. The PSA, part of GLSEN's "Think B4 You Speak" campaign, aimed to combat the use of "that's so gay" as an insult. The ad's success is attributed to Duff's popularity, the support of the Advertising Council, and its early presence on social media platforms. The campaign led to a decrease in the use of the phrase and a reduction in bullying rates, according to GLSEN data.</p>
