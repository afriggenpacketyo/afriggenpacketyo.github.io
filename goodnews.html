          <h2>China's Central Bank Eases Monetary Policy Amid Trade Tensions with the U.S.</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank has implemented a series of monetary policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and reduced reserve requirements for banks, to mitigate the impact of trade tensions with the United States. These steps aim to boost lending and inject liquidity into the economy, supporting sectors like technology and real estate. The announcement coincides with the upcoming trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Geneva, signaling Beijing's intent to stabilize markets and bolster economic growth amid global uncertainties. Some analysts believe the measures will have a modest impact due to lackluster demand from borrowers.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 02:15:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill in England and Wales proposes an additional two years of imprisonment for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. This measure aims to prevent offenders from evading the consequences of their actions and provide a moment of recognition for victims' families. The bill addresses concerns raised after several high-profile cases where killers did not attend sentencing, causing further distress to the victims' families. While some believe the extra jail time is inconsequential for those facing lengthy sentences, others suggest restricting family visits and parole eligibility as potential deterrents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk has revised its 2025 sales growth forecast downward due to weaker-than-expected sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug, despite reporting a first-quarter profit beat. The Danish pharmaceutical giant's net profit surpassed analyst expectations, but Wegovy sales fell slightly short of anticipated figures. The company now anticipates sales growth of 13% to 21% at constant exchange rates for 2025, a reduction from the previous forecast of 16% to 24%. The adjustment reflects the impact of drug copycats on Wegovy sales.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff argues that President Trump's plan to weaken the dollar, based on the idea that its reserve currency status harms the U.S. economy, is fundamentally flawed. He explains that while the dollar's status influences trade deficits, it is only one of many factors, including fiscal policy and economic strength. Rogoff suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit is a more straightforward solution than initiating a trade war. The analysis underscores the complexities of international trade and the limitations of tariffs as a cure-all.</p>
