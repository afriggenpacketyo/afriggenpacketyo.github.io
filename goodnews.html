          <p>The European Union faces the challenge of negotiating trade deals with both the United States and China in an era of heightened geopolitical competition. The EU aims to secure economic benefits from both superpowers, but striking a deal with one could jeopardize relations with the other. The United States seeks to pressure the world to cut ties with China, while China is also edging closer to negotiations with the US, potentially leaving Europe in a precarious position. Officials in Brussels describe this delicate balancing act as a "high-wire act."</p>

          <p>Shachi Kurl's article in the New York Times discusses the challenges facing Canada under Prime Minister Mark Carney, including economic anxieties, strained relations with the U.S. under President Trump, and complex international relationships. Canadians are concerned about a potential recession and feel betrayed by Trump's trade war and annexation desires. Canada's relationships with China and India have deteriorated, while prospects across the North Atlantic look more promising. The article suggests Canada needs to reframe its place in the world and focus on securing its economic and strategic future beyond America, which will require Carney to step up on the world stage.</p>

          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, a decision with potentially significant socio-economic and political implications. The move, announced by Information Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, demonstrates the government's commitment to societal values and interests. The census is likely to lead to demands for raising quotas for government jobs and college admissions, particularly for Other Backward Classes (OBCs). While supporters say this data is crucial for social justice programs, opponents fear it could deepen social divisions. The last caste-based census was conducted by British rulers in 1931, and since then, independent India has only counted Dalits and Adivasis.</p>

          <p>China is evaluating the possibility of trade talks with the U.S. after receiving overtures from senior U.S. officials, potentially signaling a path toward resolving the ongoing trade war. However, China insists that the U.S. must first remove all unilateral tariffs, viewing it as a sign of sincerity. Analysts caution that reaching a comprehensive deal will be complex and time-consuming, especially given President Trump's unpredictability. U.S. officials have suggested that tensions could ease, but both sides remain firm on their strategic priorities and economic red lines.</p>

          <p>The World Trade Center Health Program has resumed certifying illnesses linked to the 9/11 terrorist attacks after weeks of delays that left some cancer patients without access to treatment. The program's administrator, Dr. John Howard, was reinstated after a layoff, but questions about his authority caused a freeze on certifications. A federal memo confirmed the resumption of processing enrollments and certifications, signaling a turning point after weeks of confusion. The restoration of certification means the program can now review and approve claims from responders and survivors who have developed new conditions linked to the attacks.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to accelerate tariff talks, aiming for a mutually beneficial deal as early as June. Following meetings in Washington, Japan's chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa announced intensive ministerial discussions would begin in mid-May after working-level efforts to address points of contention. Discussions covered non-tariff barriers and expanding bilateral trade and economic security cooperation. The talks occurred amid existing tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which Japan has urged to remove, along with potential offers of increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and expanded tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice.</p>
