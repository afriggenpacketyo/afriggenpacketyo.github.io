          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods exceeded fiscal second-quarter expectations, prompting an increase in its full-year sales and earnings guidance. The company reported a 5% rise in sales to $3.65 billion and 5% comparable sales growth, outperforming estimates. CEO Lauren Hobart attributed this success to effective long-term strategies and strong operational execution. Despite slight tariff-related price increases, consumer spending remains robust, and the Foot Locker acquisition is set to close, making Dick's the top athletic footwear seller in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock fluctuated despite exceeding Q2 earnings expectations, with sales surging 56% to $46.74 billion, due to ongoing uncertainty regarding its China operations. CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about "full steam" AI infrastructure spending, projecting $3-4 trillion by decade-end, and the potential to sell Blackwell processors in China. However, the fate of its H20 chip, specifically designed for the Chinese market, remains unclear amid U.S. trade restrictions. Analysts view Nvidia's results as consistent with growth, driven by a multi-year AI infrastructure boom. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite this recovery, the retailer maintained its full-year guidance due to uncertainty surrounding potential tariff impacts on consumers and its business. CEO Corie Barry noted "resilient, but deal-focused" customers and strong performance in computing and gaming, driven by new product launches like the Nintendo Switch 2.

          <p>NBC plans to boost "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" by airing special episodes after four "Sunday Night Football" games this fall, including two featuring the Kansas City Chiefs. This strategy aims to capture new viewers from TV's top-rated program, especially following the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." The move reflects late-night TV's struggle with declining ratings in the streaming era. NBC hopes to leverage "Sunday Night Football's" strong viewership and Fallon's past success in the slot to gain audience share.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3.3% annual pace in the second quarter, an upward revision from the initial 3% estimate, signaling a rebound after a Q1 contraction. This growth was primarily driven by an upward revision to business investment and consumer spending, alongside a significant drop in imports that boosted GDP by over 5 percentage points. However, some economists suggest the strength is partly a "mirage" due to tariff-related import fluctuations. Concerns persist regarding a cooldown in hiring, leading investors to anticipate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Christopher Barbour, an Alabama death row inmate for 31 years, has been granted a new trial by a federal judge due to new DNA evidence. Recent forensic tests revealed another man's DNA on the victim's body, challenging Barbour's 1992 murder conviction which relied heavily on a confession he claims was coerced. The judge ruled that prosecutors failed to disclose initial forensics notes excluding Barbour as the DNA source, violating his constitutional rights. The state plans to appeal, but Barbour now has the opportunity to argue his innocence to a jury.</p>

          <p>This article argues against the Trump administration's reported plan to use unilateral military force against drug cartels in Latin America, suggesting it would be diplomatically costly with little strategic gain. Instead, it advocates for continuing current diplomatic efforts with Mexico, citing recent cooperation on extraditions and border surveillance. The author emphasizes that supply-side strategies alone are historically ineffective, especially for synthetic drugs like fentanyl. The piece proposes focusing on demand reduction and harm reduction policies, noting a 25% drop in overdose deaths and encouraging generational trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. banking industry is shrinking, with nearly half of FDIC-insured banks disappearing since 2005 due to mergers and acquisitions by large institutions. In contrast, Canada's highly concentrated banking system, with only 79 banks, was named the soundest in the world during the 2008 financial crisis. Experts suggest Canada's stability stems from its large players relying on collective economic strength. However, critics warn that market domination can stifle competition, innovation, and lead to less favorable pricing. The Federal Reserve's proposal to lower capital requirements for big U.S. banks could further accelerate consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>
