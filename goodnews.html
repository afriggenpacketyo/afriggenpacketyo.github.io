        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, has declared his government would re-examine the interpretation of various international laws, including the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), to effectively tackle the modern challenge of "mass migration." He clarified that this approach would involve adapting existing legal provisions to current global realities rather than withdrawing from established treaties. Starmer's comments were made during a party conference, where he also addressed the complexities of deporting foreign criminals and the need to differentiate genuine asylum claims from those based on perceived lesser conditions abroad. This article highlights his efforts to position Labour as a party capable of addressing immigration concerns while navigating the political landscape against rivals like Reform UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has decided to keep its policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, a move consistent with market expectations. Governor Sanjay Malhotra highlighted a significant moderation in inflation during the first quarter but expressed concerns about potential economic growth deceleration in the latter half of the financial year, primarily due to global trade uncertainties and new U.S. tariffs on Indian exports. This article outlines how, in response to these tariffs, the Indian government has proactively reduced goods and services tax rates on several items to stimulate domestic demand ahead of the crucial festive season. This strategy aims to leverage India's robust domestic consumption, which accounts for over 60% of its GDP, to buffer the economy from external trade pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers commenced their postseason run with a dominant 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in Game 1 of the wild-card series, fueled by a club postseason record-tying five home runs, including multiple blasts from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. Starting pitcher Blake Snell was outstanding, delivering seven strong innings. However, the article emphasizes a persistent concern for the team: its bullpen, which struggled significantly in the eighth inning, issuing four walks and nearly jeopardizing a substantial lead. This vulnerability remains a key area of focus for the Dodgers as they aim to sweep the series and prepare for tougher opponents in subsequent rounds.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant trend is emerging where more young Americans, especially those in Gen Z, are choosing blue-collar careers in skilled trades like electrical work, plumbing, and welding. This shift is primarily motivated by growing concerns over the escalating costs of college education and the increasing threat of artificial intelligence to traditional white-collar jobs. The article highlights that a substantial majority of Gen Z individuals prioritize job security against automation, perceiving less risk in hands-on professions compared to fields like data analytics. This movement reflects a changing economic landscape where the stigma around trades is diminishing, and these careers are increasingly recognized for their independence, financial viability, and resilience to technological displacement.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks without interruption, as these payments are covered by mandatory spending. This article clarifies that the core function of benefit disbursement remains secure. However, it cautions that other Social Security Administration (SSA) services, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards, may experience temporary disruptions due to the furloughing of a portion of the SSA's workforce. Although a large majority of SSA employees are deemed essential, the potential for reduced customer service and a possible delay in the annual cost-of-living adjustment announcement highlights areas of inconvenience for recipients.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department extended congratulations to the people of China on the 76th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China, conveying wishes for "health, happiness, prosperity and peace." This article highlights that the message, published on the State Department's website on October 1st, signifies a return to a more traditional diplomatic gesture. It draws a contrast with the previous year, when a similar message from then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken was notably delayed and posted after the official date, amidst strained relations. The timely issuance of this year's message suggests a deliberate effort by the U.S. to maintain diplomatic channels and foster a degree of stability in its complex relationship with China.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a ruling that Sigal Chattah, a Trump-appointed interim U.S. attorney for the district of Nevada, is "not validly serving" in her capacity, leading to her disqualification from overseeing several criminal cases. The article explains that the Justice Department's attempt to circumvent the 120-day legal limit for her temporary appointment by shifting her to an "acting" U.S. attorney role was found to be in violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. This Act aims to prevent executive branches from making such circumventions in appointments. This decision marks the second instance where a judge has partially sidelined a Trump administration prosecutor, underscoring ongoing scrutiny regarding the legality and process of federal appointments.</p>
