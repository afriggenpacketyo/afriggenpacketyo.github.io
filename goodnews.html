          <p>A 16th-century shipwreck, dubbed Camarat 4, has been discovered off the coast of Ramatuelle in southeastern France at a depth of over one-and-a-half miles, making it the deepest-recorded shipwreck in French waters. The French Department of Underwater and Submarine Archaeological Research (DRASSM) announced the discovery, noting the ship was found unexpectedly during a military operation and stretches 30 meters long and 7 meters wide. The vessel's cargo, including well-preserved handmade ceramics believed to be from Liguria, Italy, features the Christogram IHS, reflecting Christianity's role in early modern Europe. This untouched wreck offers a unique research opportunity due to its depth and preservation, allowing for the study of an almost intact 16th-century ensemble.</p>

          <p>Turbo Sjogren, a senior vice-president at Boeing Global Services, emphasized the importance of Europe reducing its dependence on China for critical minerals, mirroring similar concerns in the United States. Sjogren noted that the aerospace supply chain is inherently global, necessitating international cooperation. He highlighted that U.S. legislation since 1973 requires the aerospace industry to avoid reliance on countries like China for materials deemed critical. Sjogren's comments underscore the strategic importance of diversifying supply chains to ensure sovereignty and address evolving global challenges.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi informed U.S. President Donald Trump that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was achieved through direct military talks, dismissing any U.S. mediation. According to Indian diplomat Vikram Misri, Modi clarified that there were no discussions of a trade deal or U.S. involvement during the ceasefire negotiations, which occurred at Pakistan's request. Modi emphasized India's firm stance against third-party mediation, particularly concerning the Kashmir region. Trump reportedly acknowledged Modi's points and expressed support for countering terrorism.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Companies are increasingly using 'tariff engineering' to lower duty payments amid rising tariffs, which involves modifying products to fit into categories with lower tariff rates. This can include altering materials, dimensions, or compositions to reclassify items under different 'harmonized system codes.' Winnebago Industries, for example, plans to use tariff engineering as part of its mitigation strategies, and Columbia Sportswear has a team dedicated to considering tariff impacts during the design process. While legal, this practice requires careful navigation to avoid misrepresenting product classifications, as seen in Ford's case of importing vans as passenger vehicles and then converting them to cargo vans, which resulted in legal challenges.</p>
