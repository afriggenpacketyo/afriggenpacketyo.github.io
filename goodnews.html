          <p>Jerry Adler, a distinguished actor and veteran of Broadway's behind-the-scenes, has died at 96. Hailing from a family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, Adler spent decades as a stage manager, producer, and director for 53 Broadway productions, including the original "My Fair Lady." He transitioned to acting in his 60s, gaining widespread recognition for roles such as Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife." Adler embraced his late-career success, publishing a memoir and stating, "I think retirement is a road to nowhere," until his peaceful passing.</p>

          <p>China's Generation Z is fueling a booming fashion craze centered on ball-jointed dolls, which is creating a notable impact on the country's economy. Young collectors, exemplified by 21-year-old Clementine Cai, are investing significant sums, often upwards of 3,000 yuan for outfits alone, far exceeding their personal clothing expenditures. Data from leading e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, indicates that sales of doll clothing soared by over 117% year-on-year in 2024, reaching a record 10 million yuan in May. This phenomenon underscores a distinct consumer trend among Chinese youth and its growing influence on market dynamics.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are expected to open higher, tracking Wall Street's recent gains, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's signal of potential monetary policy easing next month. In his closely watched Jackson Hole speech, Powell acknowledged concerns about tariffs and inflation but emphasized the dramatic deceleration in hiring, indicating that job market worries now outweigh other factors in the Fed's calculus for rate cuts. This shift has generated significant market optimism, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng futures pointing towards a stronger start. Investors are now keenly awaiting artificial intelligence giant Nvidia's earnings report, which is anticipated to further shape market direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' previously slumping offense roared back to life in an 8-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, propelling them back into a first-place tie in the National League West. Manager Dave Roberts had challenged his team for more competitive at-bats and a renewed team-first approach, which was evident in their nine-hit, four-walk, eight-run performance. The decisive moments came in a five-run seventh inning, featuring Dalton Rushing's crucial three-run home run and Freddie Freeman's second long ball of the day, sealing the win. This offensive resurgence, combining disciplined plate appearances with powerful hitting, marked a significant turnaround after a two-month scoring funk for the team.</p>

          <p>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in southern France continues to be a site of profound spiritual and medical interest, with Catholic Church bishops having recognized over 70 medical miracles in the past 163 years. Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, a Harvard-trained epidemiologist, leads the Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, where world-renowned doctors conduct rigorous, decade-long investigations into thousands of reported cures. For a case to be deemed a miracle, it must involve a sudden, complete, and lasting cure for a severe disease with no possible medical explanation. Despite historical skepticism, independent analyses, such as Dr. Esther Sternberg's, have affirmed the credibility and increasing scientific rigor of the office's meticulous evaluation process over the years.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh has etched his name into baseball history by hitting his 48th and 49th home runs against the Athletics, setting a new single-season record for catchers, surpassing Salvador Perez’s 2021 mark. This remarkable feat also marked Raleigh's ninth multi-home run game of the season, establishing a new major league record for a switch-hitter. The 28-year-old, a first-time All-Star, has demonstrated consistent power, significantly increasing his home run production over the past few seasons. Should he maintain his current pace, Raleigh is poised to become the first American League catcher to lead the major leagues outright in home runs, building on his Home Run Derby victory earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has developed southeast of Bermuda and is currently tracking north-northeast in the open Atlantic Ocean. As of Sunday evening, the storm maintained maximum sustained winds of 45 mph and was situated approximately 295 miles east of Bermuda. Forecasters anticipate Fernand will experience some strengthening through Monday before likely beginning to weaken on Tuesday, with its path expected to keep it over open waters well east and northeast of Bermuda, posing no immediate threat of landfall. This storm follows Hurricane Erin, which intensified to a ferocious Category 5 earlier in the season, aligning with NOAA's forecast for an above-normal hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's new £200 million frontline, comprising recent acquisitions Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, is grappling with early goal-scoring challenges despite substantial summer investment. After their first two Premier League matches, the team has managed only one goal, an own goal, resulting in a 1-1 draw with Fulham and an initial 1-0 defeat to Arsenal. Manager Ruben Amorim acknowledges these "teething problems," attributing them to the new players' adjustment to a different style of play and developing chemistry. While individual talents like Cunha have displayed flashes of brilliance, the attack currently lacks a cohesive unit, prompting concerns about the team's ability to secure victories as the new season progresses and expectations remain high.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer presents his Monday market playbook, analyzing the significant rally spurred by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's signal of impending rate cuts. Powell's emphasis on a dramatic deceleration in hiring, outweighing concerns about tariffs and inflation, redefined market expectations and caught many "negatively biased hedge funds" off guard. Cramer delves into the varied prospects of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, each facing distinct issues, and identifies strong bullish trends in sectors like housing, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and initial public offerings (IPOs). He also pinpoints potential "pain points" in healthcare and enterprise software, recommending a focus on industrials, high-yielding oils, and housing-related retailers. The article concludes with a note of caution for September, historically a weak month, due to expected joblessness. (not investment advice)</p>
