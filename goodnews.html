          <p>Broadcom reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by robust guidance for the current period and a 20% annual increase in revenue. The company's net income rose significantly, and it anticipates approximately $15.8 billion in third-quarter revenue. Broadcom's success is largely attributed to its custom chips for artificial intelligence, with AI revenue reaching $4.4 billion during the quarter. CEO Hock Tan highlighted ongoing investments from hyperscale partners in AI chip sales, specifically citing networking parts that connect server clusters.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants' offseason training session concluded prematurely after multiple fights broke out among players, leading head coach Brian Daboll to end the practice early. Tensions flared as temperatures reached around 90 degrees, with one incident involving Brian Burns and James Hudson and another involving Kayvon Thibodeaux and Jermaine Eluemunor. While Burns downplayed the incidents as a result of the heat and the violent nature of the sport, Daboll opted to cut the session short. Quarterback Russell Wilson characterized the fights as normal occurrences on competitive teams, but the coach chose to prioritize player safety.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 16:28:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners might consider using a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay off their mortgage faster, but this strategy has both advantages and disadvantages. HELOCs offer flexibility, controlled costs, and competitive rates, with minimal closing costs and interest-only payments during the draw period. However, variable interest rates, potential prepayment penalties, and the risk of foreclosure are drawbacks to consider. Alternatives to using a HELOC include refinancing, home equity loans, mortgage recasts, extra mortgage payments, and reverse mortgages, each with their own set of implications.</p>

          <p>Aaron Rodgers is reportedly set to sign a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, bringing an end to months of speculation about his future in the NFL. The 41-year-old quarterback parted ways with the New York Jets earlier this year and has been linked to the Steelers, who lack an established starter. Rodgers's tenure with the Jets was short-lived, as a torn Achilles ended his 2023 season after just four snaps. If Rodgers becomes the Steelers' starter, he will face his former team, the Jets, in Week 1.</p>
