          <p>Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng has announced plans to launch its affordable Mona series in international markets, including Europe, starting in 2026. CEO He Xiaopeng stated the company's overseas expansion is progressing rapidly and also signaled openness to acquiring other EV companies to navigate the intense price war in China's domestic market. The move is set to increase competition for established automakers like Tesla, Volkswagen, and BMW, as Chinese firms like BYD continue to gain market share in Europe with competitively priced models.</p>

          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been publicly ranked in league tables, with specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital securing the top positions. The rankings assess trusts on seven metrics, including waiting times, A&E performance, and financial management, sorting them into four performance categories. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables would increase transparency and accountability, allowing top-performing trusts more autonomy while underperforming ones receive enhanced support. However, organizations like NHS Providers have raised concerns about whether the chosen metrics accurately reflect quality of care.</p>
