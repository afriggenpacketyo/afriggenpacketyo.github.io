          <p>The European Union is providing ‚Ç¨5.5 million to support Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) after the broadcaster lost US public funding. The Trump administration suspended funding to the 75-year-old broadcaster in March, accusing it of promoting a news agenda with liberal bias. EU Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc is releasing the emergency funding as a "safety net for independent journalism." The funds will focus on countries in regions such as Central Asia and the Caucasus. Kallas spoke about tuning in to Radio Free Europe during her childhood in Estonia, part of the former Soviet Union, and how it was a beacon of democracy.</p>

          <p>A new test has been developed that reduces the time it takes to diagnose types of brain tumors from weeks to just hours. The method has been developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham in partnership with clinicians at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH). The new technique has seen results returned in as little as 90 minutes, and one neurosurgeon said it was possible to get a diagnosis while a patient was still in the operating theatre. The new method could allow patients to get radiation treatment or chemotherapy more quickly.</p>
