          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill that would invest $1,000 on behalf of every American baby born over the next four years, with the funds being deposited into "Trump accounts." Children born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, would receive the money, which would be invested in financial markets. The proceeds could be withdrawn later for expenses such as college or buying a house. The accounts would function much like a typical investment account, rather than a tax-advantaged account.
