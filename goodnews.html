          <p>China has successfully completed the first test flight of its next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, which is designed for future lunar missions. The test included a critical zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, verifying the spacecraft's ability to safely extract astronauts during launch failures. The Mengzhou spacecraft features a modular design with two versions: one for near-Earth operations and another for deep-space lunar missions. This test marks a significant step toward China's goal of crewed lunar missions by 2030 and represents the first such test since 1998, when a similar trial was conducted for the Shenzhou spacecraft program.</p>

          <p>The Co-op is offering its members a ¬£10 discount on a ¬£40 shop following a recent cyber attack that resulted in customer data theft. The retailer aims to show it is "on the front foot" ahead of the summer trading season after the incident disrupted deliveries and caused empty shelves. While stock levels have normalized, the discount serves as a gesture of appreciation to its 6.5 million members, although some analysts suggest it may not appeal to all customers due to the high spending threshold. The cyber attack, which cost the Co-op millions in lost sales, prompted the retailer to shut down systems to restrict the damage.</p>

Despite Meta's aggressive efforts to hire talent from OpenAI, Altman stated that none of his top employees have accepted the offers. This comes as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg invests heavily in artificial intelligence, aiming to assemble a leading AI team for its "superintelligence" lab.

          <p>Australia is set to become the first country worldwide to eliminate all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, effectively lifting the ban on gay and bisexual men. The new rules, approved by the country's health products regulator, will begin next month and are expected to increase the donation pool by approximately 625,000 individuals. Previously, men who had sex with men within the past three months were prohibited from donating blood or plasma. The updated approach will ask all donors about anal sex with new or multiple partners, requiring a three-month waiting period for blood donation but still allowing plasma donation. This change reflects research indicating no impact on blood and plasma supply safety.</p>
