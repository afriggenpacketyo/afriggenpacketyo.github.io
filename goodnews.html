          <p>China has inaugurated the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge, now the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, connecting the cities of Changzhou and Taizhou. The 10.3km structure is a multi-functional crossing, uniquely designed to carry an expressway, a regular road, and an intercity railway simultaneously. Its innovative asymmetrical design accommodates the heavier railway on one side of the lower deck, a first for a bridge of this scale. This engineering feat significantly reduces travel time between the two cities from over an hour to just 20 minutes.</p>

Tech investment giant SoftBank Group was a major contributor, with its stock jumping nearly 10%. While the Nikkei experienced significant gains, other Asian markets showed mixed results, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and mainland China's CSI 300 seeing declines. The record follows a strong performance on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 also reached a new closing high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation is ongoing after approximately 75 cargo containers fell from a vessel at the Port of Long Beach, resulting in a minor oil spill and one worker sustaining a sprained ankle. The containers, filled with consumer goods, tumbled into the water and onto a smaller emissions-collection barge while the ship was offloading. Officials have established a safety zone and are working to contain the light oil sheen, which originated from the damaged barge. While the cause of the incident remains unknown, port operations are continuing with minimal disruption.</p>

          <p>Teachers across the United States are developing new ways to educate students about the September 11th attacks, an event that is now a historical topic for the current generation. Programs, such as one hosted by the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, connect educators with firsthand witnesses like retired firefighters to provide authentic and impactful lesson plans. These teachers aim to convey not only the trauma of the day but also the sense of national unity and resilience that followed. The goal is to ensure that the significance of 9/11 remains understood by students who did not experience it directly.</p>

          <p>With daily pressures mounting, Dr. Xand van Tulleken provides five practical, science-backed strategies for managing stress effectively. He advises individuals to first stop worrying about being stressed, as this anxiety can worsen the condition, and instead accept it as a normal part of life.

          <h2>China Pursues a Focused, Practical AI Strategy in Contrast to US's Massive Investment Approach</h2>

          <p>China is adopting a distinct and pragmatic approach to artificial intelligence development, focusing on practical integration across its economy rather than matching the massive investment scale seen in the United States. Through its "AI+" initiative, Beijing is embedding AI into key sectors like the power grid and coal industry, leveraging what it considers "usable" chip technology. This strategy contrasts with the U.S. pursuit of human-level artificial general intelligence, which requires enormous capital. Despite U.S. restrictions on advanced chips, Chinese companies have demonstrated resourcefulness, developing competitive and cost-effective AI models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CEO of Capital A, the parent company of AirAsia, has confirmed that the airline is in "active discussions" to purchase the C919 passenger jet from China's state-owned manufacturer, Comac. This marks a significant step toward the C919's first major international sale, positioning it as a competitor to the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The potential deal reflects growing interest in the Chinese-made aircraft, driven by expanding economic ties and flight connections between China and Southeast Asian nations. The single-aisle jet has a capacity of up to 192 passengers and a range of over 5,500 kilometers.</p>

          <p>Following a successful market debut where its shares climbed significantly, financial analyst Jim Cramer has suggested that stock in the Swedish online lender Klarna remains a good buy. Klarna, known for its "buy now, pay later" services, saw its stock open at $52 and close up over 14% on its first day of trading. Cramer noted the company's solid growth, improving fundamentals, and what he described as "impressive underwriting standards," despite it not yet returning to profitability.

          <p>State lawmakers in California have introduced a bill to significantly reform Measure ULA, the Los Angeles "mansion tax," amid concerns that it has stifled housing development. The proposal, negotiated with Mayor Karen Bass, would reduce the tax rate on sales of recently built apartment buildings and commercial properties. Measure ULA, passed in 2022, levies a tax on property sales over $5.3 million to fund homelessness prevention programs. Critics argue the tax has had a chilling effect on new construction, and this legislative overhaul aims to balance revenue generation with the need for more housing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The once-popular "stand and stir" format of television cooking shows is rapidly disappearing from broadcast schedules, with commissions for food programs dropping 44% in a year. This decline is attributed to the explosive growth of food content on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, where creators can react to trends like the "cronut" almost instantly. Online influencers offer a sense of authenticity and direct community engagement that traditional, heavily regulated television production cannot match. This shift reflects a broader cultural change where audiences, particularly younger viewers, prefer the "raw and real" feel of user-generated content over polished TV productions.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," financial commentator Jim Cramer reflected on the evolution of market sentiment over the past three decades. He recalled the early days of the show in the 1990s, when there was widespread excitement about individual stocks, a feeling he believes is returning to today's market. Cramer noted that after the dot-com bubble burst, many investors shifted to index funds out of fear, but now sees a renewed awareness of the potential rewards of single-stock investing. He credited the show with helping to "democratize" market information for the average person.</p>

          <p>Scientists are studying the mysterious "dark DNA" of Australia's peacock spiders to understand why over 100 different species exist, a remarkable level of diversity. These tiny spiders are known for the males' vibrant colors and elaborate courtship dances. Researchers hypothesize that the large amount of non-gene DNA, or "dark DNA," in their genetic code may allow them to adapt and evolve into new species with exceptional rapidity. This research is part of the broader Earth BioGenome Project, which aims to decode the DNA of all life on Earth to gain deeper insights into evolution.</p>
