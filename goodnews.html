          <p>Octopus Energy has apologized to Peter Holden, a Hartlebury man, for relentlessly pursuing him for nearly four years over someone else's ¬£6,000 gas bill. Despite Holden repeatedly informing the company of the error, he continued to receive monthly bills and was chased by debt collectors. The issue stemmed from an error in industry data, causing Holden to be charged for a meter with the same serial number as another account. Octopus Energy's commercial director personally apologized to Holden and promised additional staff training to prevent similar mistakes in the future.</p>

The government intends to release approximately 300,000 tons of rice via contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system. The agriculture ministry has also established a special response team to address high rice price issues and prevent consumer disengagement from rice products.</p>

          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by using the "first sale rule," a decades-old piece of legislation within U.S. customs law. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions. For example, a U.S. retailer can pay the import duty on the initial factory price rather than a vendor's inflated price. The first sale rule has gained renewed attention under U.S. President Donald Trump's administrations, offering potential cost savings for companies willing to navigate the complexities.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch the world's first ship dedicated to salmon farming in June, as part of efforts to reduce reliance on imported seafood. The Su Hai No 1 vessel, built at a cost of 600 million yuan (US$83.6 million), is expected to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of salmon annually. Unlike traditional offshore net-pen systems, the vessel can quickly relocate to safer waters to avoid adverse conditions and features an onboard processing facility for rapid delivery to domestic markets. This initiative aligns with Beijing's emphasis on developing the ocean economy and strengthening the nation's food supply.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has discovered that sleep allows the brain to enter a repair mode, flushing out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals accumulated during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, deciphers how hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ) triggers sleep and restores balance in the brain. It confirms that rising H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels in sleep-regulating neurons prompt restorative slumber, while excess build-up disrupts sleep quality and sparks inflammation. This offers insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative conditions like Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and opens pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress.</p>
