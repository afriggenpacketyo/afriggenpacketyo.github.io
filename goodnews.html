          <p>The U.S. government has reversed its export restrictions on chip-design software for China, according to announcements from leading semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. The companies confirmed they are working to restore access for their Chinese customers in compliance with the updated U.S. export laws. This move follows a ban implemented in May that required American firms to obtain special licenses before exporting certain semiconductor-related goods and software to China. The decision signals a potential de-escalation in the ongoing technology trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Armenia is actively working to deepen its relationship with China and elevate it to a strategic partnership, as stated by its foreign minister, Ararat Mirzoyan, during a visit to Beijing. This diplomatic pivot comes as Armenia diversifies its foreign policy, moving away from its traditional reliance on Russia. The shift follows Armenia's dissatisfaction with Russia's role in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and its subsequent decision to withdraw from the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Both Armenian and Chinese officials have expressed mutual interest in formally upgrading their bilateral relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a razor-thin Republican majority, the possibility of a tie vote in the House of Representatives has become a relevant concern, as seen during recent contentious legislative battles. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote on a question or a bill results in a tie, the measure is considered to have failed and is not approved. This procedure underscores the critical importance of party unity and attendance for the majority party when attempting to pass legislation.</p>

Constructed from highly durable martensitic steel, the component is described as the "heart" of the new power unit.

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has seen a dramatic revival, with fundraising volume surging to its highest level since 2021. New listing volumes jumped to $14 billion in the first half of the year, a massive increase driven by mainland Chinese companies seeking to raise capital. This boom is fueled by several factors, including supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on mainland exchanges, and U.S. delisting fears pushing firms toward Hong Kong. The renewed activity positions the city to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals a significant shift in the Latino electorate, with President Donald Trump securing 48% of their vote in the 2024 election, a substantial increase from 36% in 2020. Political experts suggest this change reflects a growing populist sentiment rather than a simple move to conservatism, driven by economic concerns and disillusionment with the Democratic Party's immigration policies. Analysts argue that many Latino voters, particularly naturalized citizens, feel both major parties have failed their community, making them a dynamic and evolving demographic that defies simple categorization.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has struck down the Trump administration's policy that effectively banned migrants who cross the southern border from seeking asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president does not have the unilateral authority to create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws established by Congress. The order, which was issued on President Trump's first day in office, had been challenged by immigrant rights groups who argued it endangered people fleeing violence. The judge stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal.</p>
