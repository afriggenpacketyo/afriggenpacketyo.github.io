          <p>Action star Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson revealed that he drew upon his own childhood trauma to portray mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr in the new dramatic film "The Smashing Machine." In an interview, Johnson admitted he was initially scared to take on such a demanding role and shared his fears with co-star Emily Blunt and director Benny Safdie. He explained that this vulnerability was necessary to authentically capture the complex character of Kerr. Johnson also spoke about finding peace in his personal life, particularly through his passion for fishing at his private fishing hole.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 15:41:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola employed an unusually defensive strategy in the team's 1-1 draw against Arsenal, a tactical gamble that nearly secured a victory. After taking an early lead, City shifted to a deep, compact formation, at times resembling a 5-5-0, and finished the match with a record-low 32.8% possession for a Guardiola-led side. The approach was attributed to player fatigue after a demanding week of matches. While the tactic successfully stifled Arsenal for most of the game, a late equalizer from Gabriel Martinelli salvaged a point for the home side, leaving Liverpool as the primary beneficiary in the title race.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan for a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move the government says will stimulate economic growth. The privately-financed project involves converting the airport's existing northern runway for regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While supporters tout the creation of jobs and economic benefits, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups. Critics argue the expansion will worsen noise pollution and increase carbon emissions, contradicting the UK's climate commitments.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executive Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are likely to be part of the investment group involved in the deal to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. The president's comments come as negotiations continue to allow the popular social media app, currently owned by China's ByteDance, to continue operating in the United States under American control. The potential involvement of the Murdochs' Fox Corporation would add a major U.S. media player to the consortium, which also reportedly includes Oracle and Dell. The final structure of the deal is still being worked out between Washington and Beijing.</p>

          <p>In the Formula 1 World Championship battle, Lando Norris managed to gain only six points on his McLaren teammate and rival Oscar Piastri at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, finishing seventh. While Piastri had an uncharacteristically error-filled weekend, including a crash, Norris was unable to fully capitalize due to his own qualifying struggles where he hit a wall and could only manage seventh on the grid. Team principal Andrea Stella defended Norris's race performance, stating he maximized the car's potential from his starting position, but acknowledged that the qualifying error was a missed opportunity for the British driver.</p>

The video captures the immense power and ferocity of the brother-and-sister pair as they aggressively swat and bite at their cage doors just before being set free. Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest tiger subspecies and are endangered due to poaching and habitat loss, with only 500-600 estimated to be left in the wild. The footage serves as a powerful reminder of both their wild nature and the critical importance of conservation efforts.</p>

For the first time, each American player will receive a $500,000 stipend, a controversial move in an event where European players traditionally compete for free.

This boom is driven by a combination of factors, including frustration with air travel, environmental concerns, and a growing appreciation for a more relaxed mode of transportation.

They argue that the modern S&P 500, heavily weighted with high-margin technology and AI-driven companies, justifies higher valuations compared to historical benchmarks. However, other experts express caution, warning that easier monetary policy could fuel a speculative "melt-up" driven by investor FOMO rather than solid fundamentals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can physically accelerate the aging process at a cellular level. Epel explains that stress damages telomeres, the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes, causing them to shorten more quickly than they would naturally with age. This cellular damage can lead to a host of health problems and a faster rate of biological aging. To counteract these effects, she recommends simple daily practices such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, incorporating Omega-3s into one's diet, and prioritizing deep rest to help cells restore and repair themselves.</p>
