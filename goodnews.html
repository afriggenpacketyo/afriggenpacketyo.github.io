          <p>President Donald Trump visited Yankee Stadium to commemorate the anniversary of the September 11th attacks, addressing the New York Yankees team in their clubhouse before their game against the Detroit Tigers. Trump shared anecdotes about former owner George Steinbrenner and offered words of encouragement to the players, expressing his confidence that they would win. His appearance, which included heightened security measures in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, was his first at a Major League Baseball game since the 2021 World Series and was met with a mixed but largely positive reception from the crowd.</p>

          <p>Following a session where all three major stock indexes reached record highs, market analyst Jim Cramer expressed a continued bullish sentiment, challenging what he calls market "cynics." He argued that positive economic events are outweighing bearish concerns, pointing to factors like a strong IPO market and softer labor data that might encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Cramer suggested that despite background concerns like national debt and geopolitical tensions, individual company performance remains strong, and bearish investors may soon be forced to change their stance.

          <p>Angel Studios, the entertainment company behind the successful 2023 film "Sound of Freedom," made its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ANGX. The Utah-based company, which focuses on producing "values-based storytelling," utilizes a unique crowdfunding model and a guild of members who vote on which projects to greenlight. Founded by the Harmon brothers, the studio evolved from a movie-filtering service into a content production house and streaming service. The move to go public via a SPAC merger aims to provide liquidity for its nearly 70,000 investors and fund future expansion.</p>

Other notable films include Nia DaCosta's dynamic adaptation of "Hedda Gabler" starring Tessa Thompson and Guillermo del Toro's faithful yet unique take on "Frankenstein."

          <p>Design software giant Adobe reported fiscal third-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue, causing its stock to rise in after-hours trading. The company posted adjusted earnings of $5.31 per share on revenue of $5.99 billion, reflecting an 11% increase from the previous year. Adobe also provided an optimistic forecast for the fourth quarter, with revenue guidance of $6.08 billion to $6.13 billion, slightly above analyst consensus. The positive report comes as a boost for the company, whose stock had been underperforming the broader tech market for the year.</p>

          <p>A Scottish couple, Michelle and John Wylie, have finally solved the four-year-old mystery of an unknown man who appeared in their wedding photos from 2021. After their recent appeal to a social media content creator went viral, the man was identified as Andrew Hillhouse, who had accidentally attended the wrong wedding. Hillhouse explained that he was running late and rushed into what he thought was the correct venue, only realizing his mistake when the bride he didn't recognize walked down the aisle, leading to his comically puzzled expression in the group photos.</p>

          <p>Yoane Wissa, who recently completed a £55 million transfer to Newcastle United, has had a career marked by remarkable determination and resilience. In 2021, just before a planned move to the Premier League, he was the victim of an acid attack at his home in France that could have ended his career and cost him his sight. His former manager and teammates recall his strong will and refusal to give up, qualities that have defined his journey from France's second division to the Champions League. His recent, publicly forced move from Brentford has soured his legacy with some fans, but Newcastle reportedly valued his desperation to join the club.</p>

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella admitted to employees that the company's leadership needs to "do better" at rebuilding trust with its workforce following recent layoffs and a new return-to-office mandate. During an internal meeting, Nadella responded to an employee's question about a perceived lack of empathy, acknowledging the feedback and the hard work ahead for the company. The comments come after Microsoft cut 9,000 jobs and announced that employees near its headquarters must return to the office three days a week. Despite some internal discontent, the company has performed strongly financially, with its stock up nearly 20% this year.</p>

He addressed concerns that recent U.S. trade rhetoric and tariffs had strained the relationship, asserting that ties with the Indian government remain warm and that he would make it a top priority to ensure India aligns with U.S. interests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the latest report showing U.S. inflation ticking up to 2.9% in August, savers are advised to reconsider keeping large sums in traditional savings accounts. Due to an average interest rate of just 0.39%, a $10,000 deposit in such an account would earn less than $40 over an entire year, failing to keep pace with inflation and effectively losing purchasing power. The article suggests that high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) offer significantly better returns in the current elevated interest rate environment. However, with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, savers should act quickly to lock in higher rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery by the newly formed Paramount Skydance would create a media and entertainment behemoth with an immense portfolio of valuable intellectual property. Paramount already owns major franchises like Star Trek, Mission Impossible, and SpongeBob, alongside growing sports rights with the UFC. A merger would add Warner Bros. Discovery's iconic assets, including the DC superhero universe, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and Lord of the Rings, as well as significant sports broadcasting rights for the NHL and MLB. This consolidation would exponentially expand Paramount's content library, positioning it to compete more directly with industry giants like Disney.</p>

          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced a bizarre incident during the first round of the BMW PGA Championship that he believes ultimately worked in his favor. After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes just before a weather delay, his ball could not be found upon resumption of play, with witnesses reporting they saw two people run off with it. The suspected theft allowed Fitzpatrick to take a penalty drop instead of playing his provisional ball, a situation he estimates saved him at least one stroke. He finished the round with a six-under-par 66, two strokes behind the leaders.</p>

Bessent has recently met with former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard as part of a broader consideration of eleven economists. In addition to vetting candidates, Bessent is reportedly pushing a reform agenda for the central bank, aiming to reduce its massive bond portfolio and overall economic footprint. The process is occurring amid sustained pressure from the White House for the Fed to implement an interest rate cut.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has detailed the financial structure of the recent U.S.-Japan tariff agreement, which includes a $550 billion investment from Tokyo into American projects. Under the deal, the U.S. and Japan will split profits equally from these projects until Japan's initial investment is fully recouped. After that point, the profit-sharing arrangement will shift dramatically, with the U.S. receiving 90% and Japan receiving 10%. Lutnick stated that the investment will fund domestic manufacturing priorities, such as nuclear power and antibiotics, and should not ultimately cost Japanese taxpayers, as their investment is expected to be returned through project revenues.</p>
