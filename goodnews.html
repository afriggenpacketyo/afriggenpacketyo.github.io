The reinstated workers include staff from the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, and the National Center for Environmental Health, raising hopes for the restoration of vital public health programs.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a plan to penalize colleges and universities whose students accumulate high student loan debt without a corresponding increase in earnings, while rewarding institutions that provide better value for the money. The risk-sharing plan would require schools to reimburse the federal government for a portion of the federal loan debt their students fail to repay. The proposal aims to incentivize colleges to focus on student outcomes and reduce the burden of student loan debt. However, experts have raised concerns about the exclusion of defaulted loans and the lack of necessary data to implement the plan effectively. (not investment advice)</p>
