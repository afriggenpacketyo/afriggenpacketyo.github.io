          <p>As graduation season approaches, Chinese universities are setting AI content limits for theses to prevent academic misconduct, including data falsification. However, an official publication from the Ministry of Science and Technology warns against relying on AI content detectors, calling it "technological superstition." The publication argues that these tools produce false results, citing examples of student-written content and even a century-old essay being incorrectly flagged as AI-generated. This raises concerns about the accuracy and fairness of using such detectors in academic evaluations.</p>

          <p>Arrests for illegal work in the UK have surged by 51% in the past year, as police target "unscrupulous" employers who exploit undocumented migrants. Immigration officers arrested over 6,400 people during raids at more than 9,000 businesses, including restaurants, nail bars, and construction sites. The government says these businesses often subject migrants to squalid conditions, illegal working hours, and below-minimum wages. The crackdown aims to disrupt illegal workers and employers who undermine border security.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow U.S. colleges to pay athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement, stemming from a lawsuit filed by former Arizona State swimmer Grant House, allows schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and provides $2.7 billion to former players who were previously barred from revenue. This agreement brings a professionalization of college athletics, with high-stakes recruitment and potential program cuts, impacting nearly every NCAA member school. The NCAA President Charlie Baker called the settlement a pathway to stabilize college sports.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved the House v. NCAA settlement, ushering in a new era for college sports where institutions can directly compensate athletes. Starting this fall, NCAA's top division schools can pay athletes, capped initially at $20.5 million per school, while $2.75 billion will be distributed to former athletes who couldn't earn money during their collegiate careers. This settlement addresses compensation for collegiate athletes, stemming from three lawsuits, and aims to regulate NIL deals through a third-party clearinghouse.</p>
