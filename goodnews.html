          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling follows a lawsuit from 20 states arguing that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge stated that redirecting the funds could cause "irreparable harm" to communities vulnerable to natural disasters like flooding. The BRIC program was designed to fund local infrastructure projects to protect against natural hazards, and its termination has been contested by state officials.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Rory McIlroy has opted to miss the FedEx St. Jude Championship, the first event of the PGA Tour's postseason playoffs. His absence has raised concerns among tour organizers, with one official expressing he was "very concerned" by the decision. Due to their high point totals, McIlroy and top-seeded Scottie Scheffler are already mathematically secure for later playoff rounds, regardless of their participation in the initial event. The situation has prompted discussions about potential rule changes to ensure top players compete in all playoff tournaments, though some peers believe it will not become a widespread trend.</p>

          <p>A major copper mining project in Afghanistan's Logar province, backed by China's state-owned Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC), is reportedly making substantial progress toward beginning extraction this year. The Mes Aynak mine, which holds one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits, was awarded to MCC in 2008 but has faced significant delays. Challenges have included security issues, the presence of ancient archaeological relics, and unexploded landmines. The Taliban government has since approved a switch to underground mining, a more expensive method intended to better preserve the historical artifacts at the site.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime rates in the United States decreased in every measured category during 2024. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows notable drops in violent crimes like murder and robbery, as well as property crimes, including a significant 18.6% decline in motor vehicle thefts. While experts note this continues a downward trend from a post-pandemic spike, the report does not speculate on the causes for the decline. The data also indicated a slight decrease in overall hate crime incidents, though some groups have seen increases in targeted offenses.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed a temperature of 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The ordinance, aimed at protecting tenants from the health risks of extreme heat, will apply to both new and old constructions and is set to be enforced starting in January 2027. Officials emphasized the public health necessity of the law as heat waves become more frequent and intense. The county encourages landlords to use passive cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains, with enforcement being primarily complaint-driven.</p>

          <p>Schools in Los Angeles are partnering with the nonprofit Trust for Public Land to convert heat-absorbing asphalt playgrounds into cooler, greener spaces for children. This initiative addresses the "concrete jungle" environment in many communities where safe outdoor play areas are scarce. Replacing blacktops, which can reach temperatures of 145 degrees, with grass and trees can lower surface temperatures by as much as 40 degrees. The new green spaces not only provide crucial shade but also help mitigate air pollution and support children's emotional and developmental well-being by encouraging more imaginative play.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court ruling, U.S. border agents have been instructed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The court found that while the government could pause access to the asylum system, it could not ignore other laws that protect migrants from being returned to places where they face persecution or torture. This decision effectively reopens pathways for humanitarian claims, undoing a key policy of the second Trump administration that had been credited with a sharp drop in illegal border crossings. Migrants will now be processed under standard immigration law, which allows for asylum requests.</p>

          <p>A new study based on two decades of data from Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park reveals the significant importance of female relationships in gorilla society. The research shows that when a female mountain gorilla moves to a new group, she will preferentially seek out and join another female she already knows, even if they have been separated for many years. This behavior highlights that these same-sex social bonds are a key factor in their dispersal decisions, alongside avoiding inbreeding. The findings provide new insights into the evolutionary roots of social movement and reframe the understanding of female-female relationships among great apes.</p>
