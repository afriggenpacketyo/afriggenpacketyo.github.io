          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde suggests the euro could gain prominence as a global currency due to geopolitical shifts and uncertainties surrounding the U.S. dollar. Lagarde outlined three foundations for the euro to achieve greater global influence: a solid geopolitical foundation through open trade and security capabilities, a reinforced economic foundation to attract global capital, and a bolstered legal foundation by defending the rule of law. Nomura's George Buckley notes growing investor interest in diversifying away from the dollar, making the euro an attractive alternative due to the EU's large trading bloc. The euro has already gained against the dollar this year, and Buckley anticipates further gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's economy demonstrated resilience by growing at an annual rate of 7.4% in the March quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts despite global economic uncertainties. Strong domestic consumption and relatively lower dependence on exports have helped cushion the impact of trade policies. The Reserve Bank of India has been cutting interest rates to bolster growth, and is expected to cut rates again in June. The International Monetary Fund projects India's economy to modestly overtake Japan's in 2025, becoming the world's fourth-largest economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Ukraine may also benefit from a more hands-off approach, allowing for greater freedom to strike targets within Russia.
