The stock, which was priced at $33, more than tripled on its first day, signaling strong investor confidence in the tech market. This IPO follows a failed $20 billion acquisition attempt by Adobe in 2022, which was blocked by regulators over competition concerns. Figma's strong market entry is a notable event in a period that has seen a recent revival of tech IPOs. (not investment advice)</p>

A new report from Morgan Stanley indicates that a majority of these private wealth management firms now use long-term incentive plans, such as co-investment opportunities and carried interest, to attract and retain talent. This has significantly boosted pay, with median total compensation for CEOs at larger investment-focused family offices surpassing $1.2 million. The trend reflects a shift from informal agreements to more structured, performance-based pay in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, despite a significant drop in profits due to lower crude oil prices compared to the previous year. The oil major's net income fell by 44%, but record quarterly production output helped cushion the financial impact. The company recently completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a deal it expects will begin to boost earnings by the fourth quarter. Chevron also aims to reduce annual costs by $1 billion by the end of 2025 as it navigates the changing energy market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Adapt Ancient Anti-Corrosion Technique to Modernize Artillery</h2>

          <p>Researchers in China have reportedly doubled the service life of artillery barrels by refining an ancient chromium plating technology. The technique is inspired by the methods used over 2,000 years ago to protect the bronze swords of the Terracotta Army, which remained sharp and untarnished for millennia. By adapting this sophisticated anti-corrosion process, scientists have developed a solution to combat the extreme heat and pressure that cause rapid erosion and microcracking in modern high-velocity cannons. The breakthrough was detailed in a leading Chinese defense technology journal.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil's second-quarter earnings declined by 23% compared to the previous year, but the results still exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The company's profits were impacted by a 10% drop in oil prices, but this was mitigated by strong production growth, including record output in the Permian Basin and Guyana. The oil giant achieved its highest second-quarter production volume since the Exxon and Mobil merger. The company also continued its cost-cutting measures and returned $9.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR profile explores the influence of Twitch streamer Hasan Piker, one of the most prominent progressive voices online, questioning if he serves as a "Joe Rogan of the left." The article discusses how Piker combines "bro culture" interests like video games and working out with leftist political commentary, potentially reaching an audience of young men often targeted by right-wing commentators. Piker himself argues against the idea that masculinity is inherently tied to right-wing politics and asserts that Democrats need better policies, not just charismatic online figures, to win over voters.</p>

          <p>The United States and Pakistan have announced a new agreement to jointly develop Pakistan's oil reserves, a move signaling a shift toward more economic-focused cooperation. President Trump hailed the deal as a "significant beginning" to a long-term energy partnership. The announcement came as the White House also revealed a broader trade agreement and a new, lower 19% tariff rate for Pakistani imports. While the extent of Pakistan's "massive" oil reserves is unclear, the deal is seen as a strategic move that could attract investment and potentially counter China's growing influence in the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is developing a pilot program to provide Medicare and Medicaid coverage for popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. This five-year experimental plan would allow government health insurance programs for low-income and elderly Americans to voluntarily cover the high-cost medications for weight management purposes. The move aims to address the U.S. obesity crisis but raises significant financial questions due to the drugs' high prices, which can exceed $7,000 per year. The initiative, slated to begin in 2026, marks a potential major shift in federal healthcare policy.</p>
