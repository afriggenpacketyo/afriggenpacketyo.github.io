          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri outperformed Red Bull's Max Verstappen to claim pole position at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix following a qualifying session marked by a significant accident involving Yuki Tsunoda. Piastri's narrow victory, edging Verstappen by a mere 0.034 seconds, occurred despite encountering traffic during his final laps. The qualifying session also highlighted Aston Martin's improved performance, with Fernando Alonso securing fifth place, while Ferrari struggled, failing to get either car into the top 10. This unexpected outcome sets the stage for an exciting race at Imola, challenging the expected dominance of Red Bull and Ferrari.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is reportedly seeking a deal with Iran to curb its nuclear program, despite opposition from conservatives who demand complete denuclearization. The negotiations, led by Steve Witkoff, aim to find a middle ground regarding uranium enrichment, a key point of contention between the U.S. and Iran. While Trump insists on halting all enrichment, Iran maintains its right to enrich for civilian purposes, although they might be willing to limit enrichment to levels below those used for weapons. The potential deal could involve phased sanctions relief and increased international inspections, but faces challenges from both hardliners in the U.S. and skepticism from Iran due to Trump's previous withdrawal from the 2015 agreement.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria caught senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise, leading to internal discussions to determine the scope and pace of the rollback. The decision, which aims to give Syria a chance at greatness, lacks specifics, creating uncertainty about which measures will be affected. Despite the surprise, the Treasury Department affirms its commitment to executing the president's vision for peace and stability in the Middle East. Syria's transitional government has been lobbying for sanctions relief to address economic challenges and rebuild the war-torn country.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates is significantly increasing its investments and influence across Africa, filling a void as the United States and China reduce their presence on the continent. Emirati corporations are investing heavily in key sectors such as ports, renewable energy, and critical minerals, aiming to diversify their economy and expand their global supply chain control. While the U.S. reduces aid and investment in the region, the UAE is forging economic partnerships and providing substantial financial assistance to African nations. This strategic shift raises concerns about the implications for democracy and human rights, as the Emirates prioritizes business interests and delegates statecraft to private entities.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Transit executives and the union representing its train drivers resumed negotiations to resolve a strike that has disrupted the state's commuter rail network. The strike, which began after contract talks stalled, has stranded thousands of commuters and prompted the transit agency to implement contingency plans. While the two sides have been engaged in negotiations for months, they remain at an impasse over the issue of pay, with the union seeking parity with other commuter railroads in the area. As negotiations continue, the agency is urging residents to work from home if possible to mitigate the impact of the strike.</p>

          <p>President Trump took to social media to criticize Walmart for attributing price increases to tariffs imposed by his administration. Trump argued that Walmart should absorb the tariffs rather than pass the costs on to consumers, citing the company's substantial profits. Walmart responded by stating its commitment to keeping prices as low as possible, acknowledging the limitations imposed by small retail margins. The exchange highlights the ongoing tension between the administration's trade policies and the impact on American businesses and consumers.</p>
