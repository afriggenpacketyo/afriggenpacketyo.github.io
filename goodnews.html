          <h2>Economists Await August Jobs Report Amid Labor Market Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 08:46:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming August jobs report is crucial for assessing the labor market's strength after a prior month's disappointing figures and revisions. Economists are concerned about a potential slowdown, with recent data indicating a cooling labor market as the holiday spending period approaches. The report's release follows President Trump's controversial dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner, raising concerns about the integrity of economic data. Analysts predict employers added around 80,000 jobs in August, with the unemployment rate remaining steady; a weaker report could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, while a stronger report may dissuade them from cutting rates.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the possibility of achieving immortality through organ transplants. Putin suggested that repeated organ transplants could lead to rejuvenation and potentially indefinite life extension. Experts say that organ transplants can save lives and advancements in medicine mean transplanted organs are lasting longer. Scientists are also exploring genetically-altered pigs as organ donors and growing brand new organs using human cells, but these advances are for treating ill health, rather than keeping people alive to 150.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has requested the Supreme Court to expedite the review of an appeal challenging lower court rulings that deemed most of his tariffs illegal. The request follows a U.S. Court of Appeals decision that Trump overstepped his authority in implementing tariffs on various countries. Trump's filings argue that delaying a ruling could lead to significant economic disruption and the collection of substantial tariffs. The appeals court has paused its ruling until October 14, allowing time for the Supreme Court to consider the appeal.</p>

          <p>The peace sign has become a ubiquitous photo pose among Gen Z and Gen Alpha, surpassing the popularity of gestures like bunny ears. The gesture, which originated as a symbol of victory during World War II and later signified opposition to the Vietnam War, has evolved in meaning over time. The rise of the peace sign among younger generations is attributed to the influence of Japanese pop culture, particularly anime, where it's associated with cuteness and victory. Kids use the peace sign in photos because it feels more natural and adds interest, reflecting a shift towards strategic posing in pictures.</p>

Kennedy Jr.'s policies are decreasing availability. Most Americans agree that government policy should encourage parents to vaccinate their children, regardless of party affiliation. The poll also found that Democrats are more trusting of the FDA and CDC than Republicans, and the difference in policy perception is connected to differences in approval of RFK Jr's job handling. This leads to a slightly net-negative job approval for Kennedy, with partisan divides.</p>
