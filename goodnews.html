          <p>The United States' failure to secure a tariff deal with Japan and threats to impose new duties on imports from multiple countries could embolden China in trade negotiations. Analysts suggest these developments make the U.S. appear weak, giving Beijing's negotiators more leverage. China was significantly impacted by U.S. President Donald Trump's increased duties on Chinese imports earlier this year. A finance professor at the University of Hong Kong argues that these threats signal desperation from the U.S. and should encourage Chinese negotiators to take a firmer stance.</p>

While some companies like Accenture and British American Tobacco lack explicit dress codes, they expect employees to dress professionally and comfortably. Personal stylists note that wearing shorts to the office is still a gray area, often deemed too casual for client-facing roles.

          <p>A U.S. district judge has allowed a University of Texas at Austin student to continue his free speech case against the school after he was arrested during a pro-Palestinian protest last year. Ammer Qaddumi filed a lawsuit claiming the university violated his First Amendment rights when he was arrested during an April 2024 protest on campus. Judge Robert Pitman dismissed the case against former President Jay Hartzell and Vice President Sharon Wood but ruled that it may continue against interim UT-Austin President James E. Davis. Qaddumi argues that the university's attempt to cancel the event before the students expressed themselves violates their First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, more than three months after his detention. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or a threat to the community. Khalil, a prominent voice in Columbia's pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested by ICE in New York on March 8. The government has not accused Khalil of a specific crime, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued that his presence in the US could pose "potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences."</p>

          <p>Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil has been released from US immigration detention after more than three months, following a judge's order. Khalil was detained for his activism against Israel‚Äôs war on Gaza and his arrest was widely criticized as a dangerous escalation in the Trump administration‚Äôs campaign against protected speech. The federal judge, Michael Farbiarz, stated that Khalil is not a flight risk and does not pose a danger to the community. Khalil is married to a US citizen and father to a newborn son, born during his detention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth stated that OpenAI countered Meta's lucrative job offers to employees of AI startups. This follows OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's claim that Meta dangled $100 million signing bonuses. Meta recently sought to acquire former OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever's new startup, Safe Superintelligence, and is now hiring its CEO, Daniel Gross, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. Meta believes in a future where superintelligent AI will assist humans and is investing heavily in personnel and compute power.</p>

          <h2>Satirical Piece on ICE Agents and Uniforms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 18:14:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This satirical article discusses the lack of a clear uniform for ICE agents and how this can make it difficult for people to identify them as acting under the color of law. It humorously suggests that ICE agents should feel free to express themselves through their clothing, as long as they don't look like they are acting in any kind of official capacity. The piece mocks the idea that ICE agents can do their job effectively while wearing casual or confusing outfits, and implies that this lack of accountability is intentional.</p>
