          <h2>Tesco Customers Mock AI Cameras at Self-Checkouts</h2>

          <p>Tesco has implemented AI-powered cameras at self-checkouts to combat rising shoplifting rates, which increased by 20% in England and Wales last year. The technology identifies when items are not scanned properly and displays a live-action replay to the customer. While Tesco claims this will make the checkout process quicker and easier, some shoppers are mocking the technology, comparing it to VAR in football, while others express concerns over increased surveillance. A Tesco worker welcomed the new tech, citing the difficulty of monitoring multiple self-checkouts alone amidst high theft rates.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, potentially up to ¬£1,000 each, and may have debts written off following a scandal involving the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies will distribute over ¬£70 million in compensation and support to customers affected by the practice of switching vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent. Ofgem's review revealed that suppliers fell short of required standards, and a new code of practice is now in place with stricter conditions for installing prepayment meters. The compensation applies to customers of eight suppliers, with further investigations ongoing for British Gas, Utilita, and Ovo.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is visiting Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, marking their third meeting in as many weeks. This visit underscores Merz's focus on the war in Ukraine and his efforts to reestablish German leadership among European allies, particularly amid weakening U.S. commitments to NATO. Discussions are expected to center on continued military assistance, especially the Taurus missile system, which Germany developed with Sweden. Merz has reiterated his support for Ukraine and for using sanctions to pressure Russia into a cease-fire, contrasting with the initially cooler relationship between Zelensky and the previous German chancellor.</p>

          <p>Auto giant Stellantis has named Antonio Filosa, currently the North American chief operating officer, as its new chief executive. Filosa will succeed Carlos Tavares, who resigned unexpectedly in December, and will assume his new role effective June 23. Stellantis, which owns brands like Jeep, Dodge, and Fiat, recently reported a 14% year-on-year decrease in first-quarter net revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to trade policy uncertainties. Filosa, a 25-year veteran of the company, previously served as Jeep brand CEO and chief quality officer.</p>

This move comes after retail rice prices doubled from the previous year, causing frustration among households. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries initially took orders from major retailers but later suspended them to allocate 100,000 tons to smaller supermarkets and rice shops. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi has assured that the government will ensure reserve rice reaches rural populations, imposing purchase limits on larger retailers.</p>
