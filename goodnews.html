          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lowered its benchmark policy rate to 5.5% from 6%, a larger cut than anticipated and the lowest rate since August 2022. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower growth amid global challenges as reasons for the move, which marks the third consecutive rate cut since February. Despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the previous fiscal quarter, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, a slowdown from the previous year. While the RBI acknowledged limited room for further monetary policy support, it shifted its stance to "neutral" to carefully balance growth and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is causing producer prices to remain in deflationary territory, leading to a surge of cheap exports into global markets. This influx of low-cost goods could ease inflationary pressures in some economies, potentially prompting central banks in Asia to decouple from the Federal Reserve and implement further rate cuts. However, concerns are rising in Asia about the potential for these cheap imports to squeeze local industries. While steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S., the production overdrive impacts global markets, creating both opportunities and anxieties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sweden's Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson has stated that the Swedish economy and households are already feeling the impact of U.S. trade tariffs, even before the full force of the levies is implemented. Market volatility caused by trade policy uncertainty is affecting Swedish savers, who heavily invest in funds and stock markets. The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, has noted that shifts in U.S. trade policy are causing market movements and uncertainty.

She acknowledged the U.S.'s efforts to revive shipbuilding but emphasized that the industry's energy transition requires vessels largely built in China.

          <p>Zia Yusuf's resignation as Reform UK's chairman is significant due to his role in the party's rise. Yusuf, a self-made millionaire, donated ¬£200,000 to Reform and served as a public figure. His heritage and ethnicity helped broaden the party's appeal, and he contributed to building its infrastructure. While Reform received ¬£2.8 million in donations last year, Yusuf's organizational abilities are missed. The party's history of bust-ups and resignations underscores the need for stable staffing to achieve electoral success.</p>
