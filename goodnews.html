          <p>The upcoming election in South Korea is anticipated to potentially reset the nation's relationship with China. While both main candidates are proponents of maintaining the alliance with the United States, the leading candidate is expressing a preference for diplomatic engagement with both North Korea and China in an effort to mend strained relations. The election outcome could signal a shift in regional dynamics and international relations, particularly concerning North Korea's nuclear ambitions and China's growing influence. The success of the future diplomatic engagements will be an important factor to consider.</p>

          <p>AVZ Minerals, based in Perth, has temporarily suspended its arbitration case against the Democratic Republic of Congo following encouragement from the US government to resolve a dispute over the Manono lithium project.

The move is aimed at countering China‚Äôs Zijin Mining, which gained control over the northern section of the project after Congo revoked AVZ‚Äôs rights in 2023, and signals Washington's growing efforts to secure critical minerals in Congo, directly challenging China‚Äôs dominance in the region.</p>

The box office revenue for the first day of the holiday was lower compared to the previous public holiday, indicating a struggle to stimulate domestic consumption. While a Hollywood film, *Mission: Impossible ‚Äì The Final Reckoning*, led the day's income, China's overall box office revenue has declined compared to previous years.
