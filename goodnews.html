          <p>Hasbro reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, largely due to the strong performance of its digital gaming division, including popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go! This growth helped to offset a 16% decline in its traditional consumer products segment, which has been struggling with the impact of tariffs and shifts in retailer orders. Despite reporting a significant net loss due to a goodwill impairment, the company raised its full-year guidance, signaling confidence in its strategy to navigate current market headwinds.

          <p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings, with analysts expecting solid growth in both revenue and earnings per share. Despite this, the company's stock has lagged behind other tech giants this year amid investor concerns about competition from AI chatbots impacting its core search business. The report will be closely watched for insights into the performance of its new AI products, YouTube advertising revenue, and the growth of its Google Cloud division, which recently secured a significant partnership with OpenAI.

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will seek re-election for his Hudson Valley House seat in 2026, ending speculation about a potential run for New York governor. Lawler, who holds a competitive seat crucial to the narrow Republican House majority, stated his decision was based on the importance of maintaining that majority. His announcement clears the field for other potential GOP challengers to incumbent Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, most notably Rep. Elise Stefanik, who is widely seen as a leading contender for the nomination. The decision highlights the strategic calculations within the Republican party ahead of the upcoming election cycles.</p>

Eastwood's secrets to longevity reportedly include being a "lifelong gym rat," adhering to a low-fat, organic diet since the 1950s, and practicing Transcendental Meditation twice daily since the 1970s. This article highlights the contrast between his on-screen tough-guy personas and his off-screen dedication to wellness practices that were considered exotic when he first adopted them.

          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second victory of the 2025 Tour de France, emerging triumphant in a wet and chaotic sprint finish on stage 17. The final kilometers were marked by pouring rain and a crash that took out several of Milan's key rivals, including Tim Merlier and Biniam Girmay. Milan, of the Lidl-Trek team, powered through to strengthen his hold on the green jersey for the points classification. Overall race leader Tadej Pogacar finished safely in the peloton, maintaining his significant lead in the general classification as the tour heads into its final grueling mountain stages.</p>

          <p>The opening day of the fourth Test between England and India at Old Trafford was an evenly matched contest, marked by a significant injury to Indian wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant. Pant was forced to retire hurt after being struck on the foot, a major blow to India, who finished the day at 264-4. Before his injury, Pant and debutant Sai Sudharsan had built a crucial partnership. England's captain Ben Stokes was a key performer, taking two important wickets after once again choosing to field first on a cloudy day, leaving the match finely balanced heading into day two.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is considering reintroducing a form of compulsory military service in response to growing security threats in Europe, sparking a debate about the potential economic consequences. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has proposed a selective service model, but business leaders, represented by the Confederation of German Employers' Associations, worry that pulling young people from the workforce could harm the economy. Economists suggest the impact would depend on the scale of conscription, noting that while it could delay entry into the labor market, it might also provide valuable vocational training, potentially addressing skilled worker shortages in the long run.</p>

          <p>After years of rumors and fan anticipation, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham have announced the official reissue of their 1973 pre-Fleetwood Mac album, "Buckingham Nicks." The fabled record, which was a commercial failure upon its initial release and has been out of print for decades, will be available in all formats for the first time. The announcement, teased on social media, sparked speculation of a reunion between the former bandmates, who have had a famously contentious relationship. The remastered album, sourced from the original analog tapes, will be released in September, finally making a key piece of rock history widely accessible.</p>

          <p>In a historic advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that countries can be sued for their contributions to climate change, including historic emissions. The landmark decision, which is non-binding but legally influential, clears a path for climate-vulnerable nations to seek compensation from historically high-emitting countries for climate-related damages. The ruling stated that all nations, even those not signed on to the Paris Agreement, have an obligation under international law to protect the climate system. This is seen as a major victory for developing nations and activists who have been frustrated by the slow pace of global climate action.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed a method that could prevent mosquitoes from transmitting malaria by making a single, precise change to their genome. Using CRISPR gene-editing technology, scientists altered one amino acid in a gene crucial for the malaria parasite's journey to the mosquito's salivary glands, significantly reducing the insect's ability to infect humans. The study showed this genetic tweak could be rapidly spread through a lab-based mosquito population using a gene drive. While the technology is years from field use and faces controversy, it represents a promising new strategy in the global fight against the deadly disease.</p>
