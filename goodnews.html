          <p>In an effort to normalize diplomatic relations with the European Union, Beijing has lifted sanctions on Reinhard Buetikofer, a retired and outspoken German member of the European Parliament. The move is seen as a significant step toward resuming formal political dialogue, with a potential meeting between China's National People's Congress and the European Parliament's China delegation planned for October. This would mark the first such official engagement since 2018. The lifting of the sanctions, which were imposed in 2021, was reportedly a key demand from European officials before considering a return to normal diplomatic ties.</p>

          <p>A four-person international crew, led by veteran retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, has safely returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. The 20-day mission to the International Space Station was the fourth privately funded flight organized by Houston-based Axiom Space. These commercial trips allow non-NASA astronauts and researchers to conduct scientific experiments in orbit. The missions are also a crucial step for Axiom Space as it develops its own commercial space station, intended to succeed the ISS after its retirement in 2030.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase announced second-quarter earnings that exceeded analyst expectations, driven by better-than-anticipated revenue from its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's trading operations benefited from market volatility, with fixed income trading revenue climbing 14% to $5.7 billion. Despite the strong results, CEO Jamie Dimon reiterated warnings about persistent economic risks, including trade uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and high fiscal deficits. The bank also raised its full-year guidance for net interest income, a key indicator of profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. has reached a trade deal with Indonesia, just a week after threatening the country with a 32% tariff on its exports. In a social media post, Trump called it a "great deal, for everybody" but did not provide any specific details about its terms. The announcement follows a similar pattern to a recent declaration of a deal with Vietnam, which also lacked initial details and was later met with surprise by Vietnamese officials. Indonesia is a top-25 trade partner for the U.S., with a trade relationship worth over $38 billion in 2024.</p>

          <p>This week, the U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on two significant bills that could establish a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry. The GENUIS Act, a stablecoin bill that has already passed the Senate, is expected to become law. However, the more comprehensive CLARITY Act, which defines the jurisdictions of the SEC and CFTC over digital assets, faces a more uncertain path in the Senate. Some Democratic lawmakers have expressed concerns over potential conflicts of interest related to the Trump family's increasing involvement in the crypto market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Citigroup has reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with net income rising 25% to $4.02 billion. The bank's performance was bolstered by a 16% increase in total markets revenue and an 18% jump in banking revenue, benefiting from market volatility during the period. In her statement, CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the strong performance as evidence that her ongoing turnaround plan is yielding positive results. Despite the strong quarter, the bank also increased its allowance for credit losses, citing a deteriorating economic outlook compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, the Trump administration has granted Nvidia approval to sell its advanced H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, according to CEO Jensen Huang. This decision reverses previous restrictions aimed at limiting China's access to high-end semiconductor technology over national security concerns. The move follows intensive lobbying by Nvidia and other tech leaders, who argued that the export controls were hindering U.S. competitiveness in a critical global market. Huang made the announcement in Beijing, emphasizing the importance of American companies serving the dynamic and innovative Chinese market.</p>

Scheffler stated that his family is his true priority and that he would quit professional golf if it ever negatively affected his home life. He expressed that while he loves the challenge of the sport, it does not satisfy the "deepest places of your heart."</p>

          <p>With the possibility of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates later this year, mortgage experts are advising potential homebuyers to prepare now rather than trying to perfectly time the market. Key recommendations include conducting thorough research on the homebuying process, taking steps to improve credit scores, and examining the specific features of different loan products beyond just the interest rate. Experts warn that when rates do drop, a surge in demand could drive up home prices and lead to bidding wars, potentially offsetting the benefit of a lower rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An international team of scientists has detected the gravitational waves from the largest merger of two black holes ever observed. The event, dubbed GW231123, resulted in the formation of a new, massive black hole approximately 225 times the mass of the sun. The discovery is challenging astronomers' current understanding of black hole formation, as the two original black holes were themselves unusually large and spinning near the maximum speed allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity. Researchers believe this complex and powerful event will open new avenues for research into the cosmos.</p>

This move is a response to the escalating competition in China's instant commerce sector, where rivals like Meituan and JD.com have been aggressively using discounts and special offers to attract customers. While the price war has raised concerns about its impact on profitability, the on-demand market is projected to grow significantly, with forecasts suggesting it could surpass $279 billion in sales by 2030.
