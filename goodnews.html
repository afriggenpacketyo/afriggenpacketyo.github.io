          <p>Indirect talks in Sharm El-Sheikh are progressing on a US peace plan to end the Gaza conflict, with Palestinian and Egyptian officials focusing on conditions for a hostage-prisoner exchange. US President Donald Trump expressed strong optimism for a "really good chance" of a lasting deal, anticipating a first phase completion soon. Hamas has partially agreed to the proposals, which include an immediate ceasefire and aid delivery, but has not fully accepted demands for disarmament or its future role in Gaza. The discussions are seen as crucial for potentially ending the war, which began two years ago.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is set to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a move supported by ASEAN countries, which is expected to significantly enhance its role as a regional superconnector. With 70% of Hong Kong's merchandise trade and nearly half its service trade already with RCEP members, the systematic lowering of trade barriers will deepen economic ties, particularly with Southeast Asia. This accession aims to eliminate 90% of tariffs over two decades, benefiting Hong Kong's small and medium-sized enterprises by reducing overheads and logistical hurdles. The article highlights the potential for increased inflow of high-quality consumer goods and reduced manufacturing costs.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong aims to broaden its role as a financial superconnector, not just between mainland China and the world, but across the entire Asia-Pacific region, according to a prominent banking executive. The city is strategically positioning itself as Asia's premier financing hub, seeking to attract listings and capital from top-tier companies in India, Southeast Asia, Japan, and Singapore. This expanded vision leverages Hong Kong's robust fundraising capabilities, high degree of capital freedom, and unique "one country, two systems" framework. The article highlights that this ambition comes as significant mainland capital continues to flow into the city amidst US-China decoupling trends.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index achieved a record high for the second consecutive day, fueled by a robust tech rally on Wall Street. This surge followed a significant deal between OpenAI and AMD, which is seen as a direct challenge to chipmaker Nvidia's dominance. Key chip stocks like Advantest, Tokyo Electron, Lasertec, and Renesas Electronics saw substantial gains, contributing to the index's performance. The Nikkei's momentum was also influenced by the election of a staunch conservative leader for Japan's ruling party. Meanwhile, US equity futures showed slight declines, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting fresh records, largely boosted by AMD's nearly 24% jump.</p>

          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy sources, including nuclear power, collectively generated more electricity than coal globally during the first half of this year. This significant milestone, reported by the energy think tank Ember, indicates that the rapid growth in solar and wind capacity met all new electricity demand and even contributed to a slight reduction in fossil fuel use. However, the article notes a mixed global picture, with developing countries like China leading the clean energy charge, while some richer nations increased their reliance on fossil fuels. Solar power, with its dramatic cost reductions, was the largest contributor to this growth.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Predicts Take-Two Interactive Stock Will Rise Due to 'Scarcity Value'</h2>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer is bullish on Take-Two Interactive, asserting that the company is poised to dominate the video game sector following the private acquisitions of its major competitors. With Activision now owned by Microsoft and Electronic Arts going private, Take-Two remains the sole publicly traded pure-play American video game company, giving it significant "scarcity value." Cramer highlighted the anticipated release of "Grand Theft Auto VI" in May 2026, a decade after its highly successful predecessor, as a key growth driver. He also praised the company's strong recent quarterly results and diverse successful franchises beyond GTA. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harry Kane, the England captain and star striker for Bayern Munich, has indicated he is open to discussing a new contract with the German club, signaling a cooled interest in returning to the Premier League. Kane, halfway through his four-year deal, has achieved significant success with Bayern, scoring 103 goals in 106 appearances and winning his first career honor, the Bundesliga title. While he previously considered a return to England to chase Alan Shearer's Premier League scoring record, his focus is now fully on Bayern.

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, a crucial document outlining development goals, a key focus is on restoring confidence among private firms after years of sluggish demand and administrative penalties. Despite government measures to ease conditions, over 60% of private businesses still describe the climate as "difficult," with warnings of potential bankruptcies if conditions don't improve. Entrepreneurs like Zhan Xiao are hoping for a lifeline, noting banks' reluctance to lend to private firms compared to state-owned competitors. The plan's success hinges on whether leaders can effectively support entrepreneurs and maintain competitiveness in an unpredictable global environment.</p>

          <p>China is strategically relinquishing its "developing country" status at the WTO, a move interpreted as a tactical retreat that ultimately strengthens its long-term geopolitical position. While this status previously granted special trade benefits, China has already conceded many privileges in practice. By shedding the label, Beijing removes a key talking point used by the US and EU to criticize its economic power while still claiming developing country benefits. This maneuver aligns with Mao Zedong's protracted war theory, emphasizing avoiding direct confrontation and reframing the battlefield to favor a long-term strategy, positioning China as an advocate for the Global South.</p>

          <p>Investor Brad Gerstner cautioned that OpenAI's recent deals with AMD and Nvidia are announcements, not yet deployments, emphasizing that "the best chips will win." These partnerships underscore the escalating competition and the persistent "compute scarcity" within the AI industry, driven by immense demand for AI services. Experts view this as a validation of the AI arms race, with artificial intelligence becoming a critical element in the geopolitical rivalry between the US and China. OpenAI's efforts to increase production and build complex AI models are seen as crucial steps to address the global demand for AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Avi Schiffmann, the 22-year-old CEO of Friend, a company selling a $129 wearable AI companion, is embracing public backlash to his product's controversial New York City ad campaign. The ads, which imply AI companionship is superior to human friendship, have been heavily vandalized, a reaction Schiffmann claims was part of his strategy to create "mindshare." He views the vandalism as the best PR, stating that "the picture of the billboard is the billboard." Schiffmann, known for creating viral software like COVID-19 trackers, likened his AI pendant to a therapist, best friend, and even a god, despite widespread criticisms about AI companions and the product's current flaws.</p>
