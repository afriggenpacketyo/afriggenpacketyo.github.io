          <p>Japan Rugby League One is planning to implement new rules from the 2026-27 season that will require teams to have at least eight players meeting specific criteria, such as being Japanese-born, on the pitch simultaneously. This initiative aims to give domestic players more opportunities and exposure in the league. The current rules have three player categories, with each team needing at least 11 Category A players eligible for the Japanese national team on the field. The planned changes will divide Category A players into 'A1' (Japanese players) and 'A2' (foreign players), potentially stirring controversy.</p>

          <p>David Souter, a retired Supreme Court Justice, passed away at 85 in New Hampshire. Appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, Souter often sided with liberal justices, disappointing conservatives. His retirement in 2009 allowed President Barack Obama to appoint Justice Sonia Sotomayor, marking a significant shift in the court's ideological balance. Souter was known for his preference for solitude and intellectual pursuits over Washington's social scene, and his unexpected alignment with liberal viewpoints shaped his legacy on the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is predicted to fall back to Earth after failing to reach Venus due to a rocket malfunction. Experts estimate the half-ton spacecraft could reenter the atmosphere soon, potentially landing anywhere between 52 degrees north and south latitude. While the risk of impact on humans is low, there is concern that the spacecraft, designed to withstand Venus's atmosphere, might not fully burn up during reentry, posing a threat to aircraft and populated areas.</p>

          <p>Ofcom has launched investigations into two pornographic websites, Itai Tech Ltd and Score Internet Group LLC, for suspected failures to comply with the UK's newly introduced child safety rules. The regulator believes these sites may not have implemented robust age-checking mechanisms as required by the Online Safety Act. Firms found in violation of the Act face substantial fines, with the investigations focusing on ensuring the prevention of child access to pornographic content.</p>
