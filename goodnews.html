          <p>The Buss family has reportedly agreed to sell a controlling interest in the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the current owner of the L.A. Dodgers, for a valuation of $10 billion. Walter, CEO of Guggenheim Partners, will assume majority ownership, while Jeanie Buss will retain the title of governor, representing the team in league matters. This sale shatters the previous record for a sports team sale, making the Lakers the most valuable sports franchise in the world. Jerry Buss originally purchased the team for $67.5 million in 1979, transforming it into a globally recognized franchise.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in a case that garnered national attention. The jury also acquitted her of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene, but convicted her of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. Supporters outside the courthouse cheered as the verdict was announced, and Read thanked them after the trial. Prosecutors and Read's attorneys agreed to a one-year probation order for the intoxication charge, allowing her to avoid prison time.</p>

          <p>Double the number of households in Britain will receive ¬£150 off their energy bills this winter as the government changes the rules on who qualifies for the Warm Home Discount. The qualification about property size, type, and home energy score is being scrapped, allowing 2.7 million more homes, including almost a million with children, to benefit. While debt charities and energy groups have welcomed the move, some say the scheme still leaves out some of those most at risk, including those on non-means tested benefits. The bill for expanding the Warm Home Discount will be paid by energy companies and could be passed on through the Standing Charge.</p>

          <p>Karen Read, accused of killing her police officer boyfriend, was found not guilty of murder in her second trial, which ended one of the most watched cases in recent history. The first trial collapsed in July 2024 after the jury could not reach a verdict. She was also acquitted of vehicular manslaughter and leaving the scene, but convicted of driving while intoxicated. The trial included testimony from expert witnesses and friends, with the defense suggesting Read was framed by law enforcement officers.

The central bank expects inflation to rise in the coming months but still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited solid labor market conditions and economic growth but cautioned that new tariffs are likely to increase inflation and slow down growth. The Fed will continue to monitor the situation and learn more about the impact of tariffs over the summer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV, a drug with the potential to drastically curb the HIV epidemic. Clinical trial data suggests that just two injections a year provide near-complete protection against HIV infection. The twice-yearly injection offers a more convenient alternative to the current standard of care, a daily pill called Truvada. While Gilead is taking steps to broaden access, the high price coupled with the U.S.'s steep cuts to foreign aid could prevent people in countries with the highest HIV burden from benefiting.</p>

The launch of Yeztugo faces potential threats, including proposed cuts to federal funding for HIV prevention efforts.
