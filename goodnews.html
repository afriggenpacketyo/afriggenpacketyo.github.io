          <p>The Indian government has approved Apple supplier Foxconn's $433 million joint venture with HCL Group to construct a semiconductor plant in Uttar Pradesh, aiming to boost India's chip manufacturing industry. Expected to be operational by 2027, the facility will produce display driver chips for mobile phones, laptops, automobiles, and PCs, with a capacity of 20,000 wafers and 36 million chips per month. This deal aligns with Apple suppliers' increasing shift towards India amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and supports India's "Semiconductor Mission" to establish a robust chip ecosystem.

          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger-than-anticipated growth in the first three months of the year, expanding by 0.7%, driven primarily by the services sector and significant production increases. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the UK's economic strength compared to other major economies, analysts cautioned that this growth rate may not be sustainable due to impending US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Despite positive figures for March, economists remain skeptical about continued growth throughout the year. The optimism score here is 60.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of stockpiled rice to approximately 600,000 tons in response to near-record high rice prices caused by a supply shortfall. This action involves releasing 300,000 tons over three months through July, in addition to the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. The move aims to stabilize prices, but it could reduce the government's stockpile to a level that raises concerns about future responses to poor harvests or natural disasters.

          <p>Denmark's economy has experienced a boom due to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications, but the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects growth to moderate in the coming years. The IMF notes that Denmark is relatively protected from potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports due to its reliance on merchanting and processing systems, where most value is attributable to intellectual property rather than domestic production. While heightened trade tensions pose risks, the direct impact of U.S. tariffs on the Danish economy is expected to be limited. The optimism score here is 65.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling nearly 274,000 Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs in the U.S. due to a potential defect that may cause a loss of brake function while driving. The front brake lines may contact the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, resulting in brake fluid leaks and increased crash risks. Dealers will inspect and replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe free of charge. Impacted drivers may experience increased pedal travel or a red brake warning indicator. The optimism score here is 55.</p>
