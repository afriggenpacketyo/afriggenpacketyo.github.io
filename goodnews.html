          <p>A top White House economic advisor, Stephen Miran, downplayed the likelihood of President Trump's tariffs causing significant price inflation, equating the odds to rare events like a meteor strike. Speaking on CNBC, Miran acknowledged that prediction is difficult but stated there is no evidence of widespread inflation from the tariffs so far. The comments came as the administration promoted a report showing a fall in imported goods prices, though many economists still anticipate price hikes due to implementation delays and other factors.

          <p>This article revisits Germany's monumental 7-1 victory against host nation Brazil in the 2014 World Cup semifinal, a match that set numerous records and became a turning point in German football history. The game was marked by Germany scoring four goals in a stunning six-minute span, leading to Miroslav Klose becoming the all-time World Cup top scorer. The humiliating defeat for Brazil, which was missing key players Neymar and Thiago Silva, was so profound that "Goal for Germany" became a common phrase for a blunder in Brazil. The win underscored a dominant German team that was destined to win the tournament.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a North Korean operative from the Reconnaissance General Bureau, for his role in a sophisticated IT worker scheme. The scheme involved recruiting North Korean IT workers to pose as American freelancers, using stolen U.S. identities to secure remote jobs at companies worldwide. The wages earned were then funneled back to North Korea to fund its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. This action is part of a broader U.S. effort to disrupt North Korea's illicit fundraising activities through cyber espionage and fraud.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is relaxing its long-standing requirement for passengers to remove their shoes at some U.S. airport security checkpoints. Travelers at several airports, including in Washington D.C. and Philadelphia, have reported being allowed to keep their shoes on during standard screening. The policy shift, which has not been formally announced, appears to be ending a rule in place since 2006, implemented after the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001. A former TSA officer noted that modern screening technology is capable of detecting threats without shoe removal, which could help expedite security lines.</p>

          <h2>Key Considerations for Debt Consolidation in the Current Economic Climate</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With Americans facing record credit card debt and high interest rates, debt consolidation is an increasingly popular strategy. This article outlines three key things to consider before consolidating debt this month. It notes that options extend beyond personal loans to include balance transfer credit cards and specialized debt consolidation programs. Even with current interest rates, the potential savings can be significant compared to typical credit card APRs. However, consumers should be aware of limits on the amount and types of debt that can be consolidated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with congressional leaders in Washington D.C., including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President JD Vance, amid ongoing regional tensions. The discussions focused on the U.S. commitment to Israel's security and efforts to achieve a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. Netanyahu's visit follows criticism from some U.S. lawmakers over President Trump's recent military strikes against Iran's nuclear program sites. After his meeting, Netanyahu praised the "unmatched" coordination with the Trump administration and affirmed their joint work on regional peace opportunities and the goal of dismantling Hamas.</p>

          <h2>Four Arguments for Considering Credit Card Debt Forgiveness This Month</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 14:01:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For Americans struggling with high-interest credit card debt, pursuing debt forgiveness could be a timely strategy. This article presents four reasons why it might be worth exploring this option now. With the Federal Reserve unlikely to cut interest rates this month, relief from high APRs is not imminent, and interest continues to compound daily. Furthermore, any future rate cuts are expected to be minimal, offering little help. Addressing high-rate debt through forgiveness can also improve one's overall financial health by positively impacting their credit score and borrowing ability long-term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recently signed "Big Beautiful Bill" does not eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, a long-standing campaign promise. Instead, the legislation introduces a new $6,000 federal income tax deduction for Americans aged 65 and older. While this deduction could make some Social Security income tax-exempt for certain individuals, it does not apply to all beneficiaries and phases out for those with higher incomes. The White House estimates that 88% of seniors will not pay taxes on their benefits under the new law, which is in effect for the 2025 tax year. (not investment advice)</p>

The funds grow tax-deferred and can be withdrawn penalty-free after age 18 for specific qualified expenses like higher education or a first home purchase.

          <p>A New York Federal Reserve survey indicates that consumer fears about future inflation have subsided, returning to levels seen before President Trump's tariff announcements. The June Survey of Consumer Expectations found that respondents anticipate inflation to be at 3% in one year, down from a peak of 3.6% in March and April. This easing of expectations comes despite ongoing trade negotiations and the implementation of some tariffs. While the overall inflation outlook has softened, consumers still expect price increases in specific categories like medical care, college education, and rent. (not investment advice)</p>
