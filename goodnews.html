          <p>The United States and China have agreed to extend their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing the re-imposition of heightened tariffs. This move provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances and what the U.S. describes as unfair practices. The extension keeps U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods at 30% and Chinese tariffs on American goods at 10%. While the White House hopes for progress, some U.S. business owners express concern that the delay only prolongs economic uncertainty for their operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has announced a significant investment to retool its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky, shifting production from the Ford Escape to a new line of more affordable electric vehicles. The company's strategy centers on a midsize electric pickup truck with a target price of $30,000, which is substantially cheaper than most current electric trucks. Ford CEO Jim Farley described the move as a new "Model T" moment, signaling a major bet on the EV market. This investment is driven by a desire to compete globally, particularly with Chinese automakers producing low-cost, high-quality EVs.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming integrated into K-12 education, with tools like ChatGPT being used by students for everything from exam prep to completing assignments. Teachers are also adopting AI platforms like MagicSchool AI to save time on administrative tasks such as creating lesson plans and grading. While some districts are embracing the technology, others have banned it, creating a divide in AI access for students. The push for AI in schools, supported by the White House and major tech companies, raises complex questions about cheating, educational equity, and how best to prepare students for an AI-driven future.</p>

          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden achieved a significant legal victory as the Nevada Supreme Court ruled his lawsuit against the NFL can proceed in civil court. The 5-2 decision rejected the NFL's attempt to move the case to arbitration, where the league commissioner could have designated the arbitrator. Gruden's lawsuit alleges the NFL maliciously leaked his private emails, which contained offensive language, to destroy his career and reputation. The emails were sent while Gruden was an ESPN analyst and were discovered during a separate investigation, leading to his resignation in 2021.</p>

          <p>NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers is a key investor in AthleteAgent.com, a newly launched startup designed to function like an IMDb for professional athletes. The platform aims to streamline connections between athletes, companies, charities, and sponsors by providing a comprehensive database of their representation, endorsements, and philanthropic activities. Originally co-founded by actor Ryan Rottman, the site has rebranded and introduced a subscription model, hoping to serve the 99% of athletes who lack the visibility of top stars. The company has already attracted over 4,000 athletes to its database and is projecting positive cash flow this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's consumer inflation rate fell for the ninth consecutive month in July, reaching 1.55%, its lowest level since June 2017. The decline was primarily driven by a drop in food price growth, which came in at -1.76%. This continued easing of inflation comes after the Reserve Bank of India held interest rates steady, noting a more benign inflation outlook for the fiscal year. The soft inflation data could provide the central bank with room for a looser monetary policy to support the economy as it contends with trade tensions and potential U.S. tariffs.

          <p>The upcoming summit between Presidents Trump and Putin in Alaska brings focus to the region's history as a former Russian territory. Russia's presence began in the mid-18th century, driven by the lucrative fur trade, and was consolidated by the Russian-American Company. By the mid-19th century, following its defeat in the Crimean War, Russia viewed the remote and costly colony as a liability and sought a buyer. The United States purchased Alaska for $7.2 million in 1867, a deal initially mocked as "Seward's Folly" but later seen as a historic bargain after the discovery of gold and oil.</p>

          <p>Spanish police have arrested three people for allegedly running a "spiritual retreat" that provided clients with dangerous hallucinogenic substances, including ayahuasca and toxic frog venom. The group operated from a villa, charging over $1,160 for multi-day stays that promised a "mystical" experience and health benefits. An investigation began after a complaint from a victim, revealing a company that advertised internationally and generated hundreds of thousands of euros in undeclared income. Police seized various substances and warned that they can have unpredictable and dangerous effects on users.</p>
