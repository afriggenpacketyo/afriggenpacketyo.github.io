          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic. Current forecasts predict it will remain over open water for several days, tracking north of the Caribbean and away from the U.S. mainland. However, the system is expected to intensify, potentially becoming a low-grade hurricane by the weekend as it moves westward. While no immediate land threats have been issued, meteorologists note that Bermuda could be in its path next week as it continues to strengthen.</p>

          <h2>Wild Chimpanzees Found to Consume Alcohol Equivalent of Two Daily Cocktails from Fermented Fruit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:56:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume fruit with a low alcohol content, amounting to a daily intake equivalent to nearly two human cocktails. Scientists measured the ethanol in figs and plum-like fruits, finding it averaged around 0.3% by weight. While this steady, low dose is not enough to cause intoxication, it supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in primate fruit-eating habits. The study provides the first direct chemical measurements of alcohol in fruits that wild chimps are known to eat.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Education Select Committee has recommended against scrapping education, health and care plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send). Instead, the committee calls for establishing new national minimum standards for Send support in schools and providing more training for all teachers. The report emphasizes that EHCPs and tribunals serve as a crucial "backstop of accountability" for parents navigating a system that has been described as financially unsustainable. The government is expected to publish its own reform plans this autumn, having previously not ruled out eliminating the individual plans.</p>

The company, which will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker "NTSK," raised $908.2 million in the sale. This offering is part of a recent resurgence in IPO activity, following a quiet period caused by inflation and high interest rates. The move comes amid a busy period for the cybersecurity sector, which has seen significant dealmaking and investment driven by advancements in artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

The home side initially took a 2-0 lead through goals from Andy Robertson and Mohamed Salah, only for Atletico to equalize with a brace from Marcos Llorente. The victory continues Liverpool's trend this season of securing wins in the final minutes of their games. The match also marked the debut of Liverpool's record £125 million signing, Alexander Isak, who showed promising signs before being substituted in the second half.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump praised the "special relationship" between the United States and the United Kingdom during a lavish state visit hosted by King Charles, an event characterized by extensive royal pageantry. The visit is seen as a strategic move by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to strengthen economic ties, with billions in tech investments already pledged by U.S. companies. While Trump enjoyed a full ceremonial welcome and a banquet at Windsor Castle, thousands of protesters marched in London to voice their opposition. The visit aims to convert Trump's known Anglophilia into tangible economic and political benefits for Britain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to hold its key interest rate at 4% when it meets on Thursday. This follows a cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to a two-year low. Analysts believe that with UK inflation remaining at 3.8%, nearly double the 2% target, policymakers are unlikely to risk another cut that could fuel further price rises. The decision contrasts with the US Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, highlighting different economic pressures facing global central banks as they work to balance inflation control with economic growth.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's quarter-point interest rate cut, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors against making major portfolio changes based solely on the central bank's actions. He argued that the move was widely expected and does not upend the major themes currently driving the market, such as technology and artificial intelligence. Cramer suggested the mixed market reaction might even present buying opportunities, as some investors were likely disappointed by the modest size of the cut. He described Fed Chair Jerome Powell as prudent for navigating between a weakening labor market and persistent inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

Due to Hong Kong's currency peg to the U.S. dollar, its monetary policy generally follows that of the Federal Reserve. The Fed's decision to cut rates was influenced by signs of a softening labor market in the United States, despite ongoing concerns about inflation driven by tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

The Princess of Wales, Catherine, wore a golden couture gown by British designer Phillipa Lepley and the historic Lover's Knot Tiara.
