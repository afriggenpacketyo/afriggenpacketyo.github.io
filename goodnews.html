          <p>Journalist Tim Cowlishaw used his final appearance on ESPN's "Around the Horn" to critique the network's increasing preference for hiring former athletes over journalists as commentators. Cowlishaw expressed gratitude for his 22 years on the show, acknowledging his initial imposter syndrome, and hoped the next program in the time slot would bring as much joy. This comes amid ESPN's shift towards personalities like Pat McAfee and Jason Kelce, signaling a move away from traditional media commentary. The show's cancellation leaves "Pardon The Interruption" as one of the few remaining shows featuring media commentary as opposed to former athletes.</p>

          <p>Stuttgart defeated third-division champions Arminia Bielefeld 4-2 to win the German Cup, marking their first title since 1997.

Bielefeld's impressive cup run, which included defeating Bayer Leverkusen, ended in disappointment, although they celebrated promotion to the second division earlier in May. Stuttgart's triumph follows a period of resurgence under coach Sebastian Hoeness, who guided the team back to the Champions League after years in the Bundesliga wilderness.</p>

          <p>A major power outage in southeast France, potentially caused by arson, threatened to disrupt the Cannes Film Festival's closing celebrations, but power was restored hours before the Palme d'Or ceremony.

The outage affected approximately 160,000 households, causing traffic disruptions and shop closures. Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that all scheduled events, including the closing ceremony, would proceed as planned using an independent power supply.</p>

          <p>A power cut in southern France, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted screenings on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival. Approximately 160,000 homes in Cannes and surrounding areas lost power due to a fire at an electricity substation and damage to a pylon. Authorities are investigating the incidents as arson and sabotage. Despite the disruption, organizers confirmed the closing ceremony would proceed as planned, utilizing an alternative power supply.</p>

          <p>Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi's "It Was Just an Accident" won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, awarding the top prize to a director previously banned from leaving Iran. Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who had been imprisoned, sparking a standing ovation. The film tells the tale of five ordinary Iranians who are confronted with a man they believed tortured them in jail. The ceremony followed a major power outage suspected as arson, and the Grand Prix was awarded to Joachim Trier's "Sentimental Value."</p>

          <p>DMVs across the country are warning drivers about a new phishing scam targeting phones, with text messages claiming unpaid fees on traffic violations and threatening penalties. The fake texts are designed to steal personal and financial information. The FTC and FBI have previously intervened regarding similar scams. Experts recommend registering phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry, avoiding clicking links from unknown numbers, and remaining skeptical of requests for personal information to protect against digital theft.</p>

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for his political film "It Was Just an Accident," despite facing decades of state censorship and imprisonment. The film tells the story of ex-prisoners seeking revenge on their torturer. Panahi, who was banned from filmmaking and international travel in 2010, found ways to create and smuggle out his films. This marks his first time back at Cannes in over two decades. He has insisted he's simply doing the only thing he knows how.</p>

          <p>Several cars from the 1970s have seen their values climb dramatically, driven by rarity, styling, and desirability among collectors. Examples include the 1972 Oldsmobile Cutlass 442 Convertible, 1975 Lamborghini Countach LP400, and 1970 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda Convertible, with prices far exceeding their original sticker prices adjusted for inflation. These cars represent a range of styles, from muscle cars to supercars, and offer a glimpse into the automotive landscape of the 1970s, a period marked by changing emissions regulations and rising fuel prices.</p>

          <p>Military air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter as it neared the Pentagon on May 1. This caused two commercial jets to abort their landings at a Washington airport. The Pentagon tower lost contact with the Black Hawk helicopter for about 20 seconds. The FAA air traffic controllers aborted the landing of a Delta Air Lines Airbus A319 and a Republic Airways Embraer E170. The Army said the cause of the lost contact is thought to be a temporary antenna in a location that did not maintain contact with the helicopter as it was coming in to land at the Pentagon.</p>
