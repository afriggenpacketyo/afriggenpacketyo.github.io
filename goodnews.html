          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 08:00:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new robotic system designed to automate cotton topping has been developed in China, promising to enhance efficiency in Xinjiang's cotton industry. The robot utilizes advanced lidar and machine vision to identify and vaporize the plant's top bud with a high-powered laser, a process that boosts crop yield. Currently in the pilot testing phase, the technology achieves over 82% topping success with minimal plant damage, according to its developers at Xinjiang University. This innovation aims to solve long-standing issues of inefficiency and inaccuracy associated with manual cotton topping, marking a step towards fully automated production.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old German tourist, Carolina Wilga, has been found alive after being missing for 12 days in the remote Australian Outback. A member of the public discovered her on a forest trail in the Karroun Hill Nature Reserve, where her abandoned van had been spotted a day earlier. Police believe her vehicle became stuck in mud, leading her to become lost in the vast and hostile environment. Wilga was described as being in a fragile state but without serious injuries and has been hospitalized in a rescue that authorities are calling a 'miracle' and a 'remarkable story' of survival.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing an autonomous AI software engineer named Devin, created by the startup Cognition, marking a significant advancement in AI adoption on Wall Street. The bank's tech chief, Marco Argenti, stated that Devin will augment their human workforce by handling tedious tasks like code updates, potentially boosting productivity significantly. This move signals a shift towards 'agentic AI,' where programs can execute complex, multi-step jobs independently. While raising concerns about future job displacement, Goldman envisions a 'hybrid workforce' where human engineers supervise AI agents to streamline development and other operational roles.</p>

          <p>Italian high-fashion brand Brunello Cucinelli has reported a 10.7% increase in first-half sales, outperforming estimates and signaling resilience among the super-rich despite broader economic anxieties. The company's success with its 'quiet luxury' aesthetic contrasts with a faltering wider luxury market, which is bracing for the impact of potential US tariffs. In response to tariff threats, the brand plans to raise its US prices by 3-4% in the latter half of the year. The strong performance highlights the brand's ability to maintain momentum and pass costs to consumers even in a challenging global economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bayeux Tapestry, a 224-foot embroidered cloth depicting the Norman Conquest of 1066, will be loaned to the United Kingdom for the first time in over 900 years. The historic artifact will be displayed at the British Museum starting in September 2026, while its home museum in Bayeux, France, undergoes renovations. The loan was announced by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer as a symbol of shared culture. In exchange, the British Museum will send several of its own treasures to Normandy, including artifacts from the Sutton Hoo ship burial.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high, exceeding $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency ETFs. On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs saw their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy and a wave of short liquidations, where traders betting against bitcoin were forced to buy back, further pushing up the price. Ether also saw significant gains, climbing back above the $3,000 mark for the first time since February, reflecting broad positive sentiment in the crypto market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a newly discovered interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which may be the oldest comet ever observed. Scientists from Oxford University suggest it could be three billion years older than our solar system, originating from the Milky Way's 'thick disk,' a region of ancient stars. This is only the third time an object from beyond our solar system has been detected. Based on its trajectory and likely composition of water ice, researchers anticipate it will develop a glowing tail as it approaches the Sun later this year, potentially becoming visible with amateur telescopes.</p>

This model allows busy clients to move money to charities more quickly and efficiently than through traditional foundations. Iconiq Impact, the firm's charitable arm, aims to streamline the philanthropic process and encourage the faster deployment of funds to address pressing social issues.</p>

          <p>After four decades of armed conflict with Turkey, fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) have begun a symbolic disarmament process. In a ceremony in Iraqi Kurdistan, about 30 militants, including four commanders, publicly destroyed their weapons. This marks a significant step towards peace, following a call from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to renounce armed struggle in favor of democratic politics. The Turkish government has hailed the move as a 'critical threshold' in achieving a 'terror-free Turkey,' while a new parliamentary commission is expected to manage the next stages of the peace process.</p>

          <p>For the first time, a professional beach volleyball tournament is being held inside an NBA arena, with 300 tons of sand trucked into the Intuit Dome in Inglewood. The AVP league constructed a custom court inside the arena, a logistical feat made possible by its new league model, which aims to bring the sport to unconventional venues to increase exposure. The indoor setting offers a different experience, free from the sun and wind that typically influence outdoor matches, creating a more intimate and controlled environment for players and fans. This creative approach is part of a broader strategy to grow the sport's accessibility.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new magnetic levitation (maglev) train prototype capable of reaching speeds of 600 km/h (373 mph). Developed by the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC), the train is designed to fill the transportation gap between high-speed rail and aviation. Once commercially operational, it could reduce the travel time between Beijing and Shanghai from over five hours to just two and a half. The sleek, aerodynamic train has completed its initial engineering phase and will now undergo further testing before being deployed for point-to-point travel between major urban centers.</p>

          <p>Three devout Muslim sisters, Jamilah, Zaynah, and Latifah McBryde, have successfully advocated for rule changes in American women's wrestling to accommodate their faith. Unable to wear the standard singlet, they persevered with modified, full-body uniforms, leading to official approval from the NAIA, a collegiate governing body, and later USA Wrestling. Their journey, supported by coaches at Life University, has opened doors for other athletes who require modest uniforms. Despite facing challenges, including being barred from international competition, the sisters have achieved national success and created a lasting impact on the sport for future generations.</p>

          <p>Forty years after the historic Live Aid concerts, the event is remembered as a landmark moment of global unity and rock-and-roll philanthropy, but its legacy is also viewed through a more critical lens. While the 1985 concerts successfully raised millions for famine relief in Ethiopia and placed the issue on the global political agenda, they have since been criticized for a lack of African performers and for reinforcing a patronizing 'white savior' narrative. Despite these controversies, organizers like Bob Geldof maintain that the event harnessed the power of music to effect real change, including inspiring significant debt cancellation for poor countries.</p>
