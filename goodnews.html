          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is expected to maintain a north-northeasterly course over the central Atlantic Ocean through Monday and Tuesday, with the National Hurricane Center confirming it poses no threat to land. Located approximately 360 miles east-northeast of Bermuda, the storm currently has maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and is moving at 12 mph. Although slight strengthening is possible today, weakening is forecast to begin tonight, with Fernand anticipated to become post-tropical by Wednesday. This system is the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted would be an above-normal season, projecting between 13 and 18 named storms.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 05:30:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has implemented an increase in minimum e-commerce delivery fees, notably by 0.4 yuan in Guangdong province, as part of a broader strategy to counteract "disorderly low-price competition" and prevent detrimental price spirals. This policy adjustment is primarily directed at e-commerce clients, with minimal impact expected on individual consumers. The initiative stems from a directive issued by President Xi Jinping's Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, which emphasized the need to regulate market practices, enhance product quality, and manage the retirement of obsolete industrial capacity. Experts predict this "anti-involution drive" will likely extend to additional regions, fostering a more stable and sustainable e-commerce sector.</p>

          <p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel reflected on her controversial 2015 decision to accept hundreds of thousands of refugees, stating her policy was guided by humanitarian principles and human dignity. In an interview, Merkel acknowledged the immense challenges of integrating 800,000 refugees, many fleeing the Syrian civil war, and expressed surprise at the criticism her "Wir schaffen das" (We can do this) statement received. Despite contributing to the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), she maintained that using force to prevent entry was never an option and stood by her decision as morally necessary. She recognized that integration remains a significant ongoing challenge for Germany.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. students are returning to school amidst President Trump's deployment of over 2,000 National Guard troops, though Mayor Muriel Bowser asserts federal agencies are not needed for school safety. Bowser believes the city's existing safe passage and connect programs, alongside local law enforcement, are sufficient, arguing the crime rate had already decreased significantly before the surge. While Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith noted some community members found federal presence helpful, concerns remain about the impact of military-style vehicles and troops near Metro stations, a common route for students. Philadelphia also faces school safety challenges, investing in "safety zones" and additional school safety officers.</p>

          <p>A resurgence of left-handed tennis players, notably Ben Shelton and Jack Draper, could disrupt the US Open, drawing parallels to a period in the late 1970s and early 1980s when southpaws dominated. Despite a historical scarcity of left-handed Grand Slam champions since John McEnroe in 1984, lefties possess distinct advantages, such as unique ball trajectories and spins that often confound right-handed opponents. Shelton, ranked world No. 6, and Draper, who both recently secured their first Masters titles, are demonstrating improved consistency and powerful serves, positioning them as legitimate threats to top players like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. Their success could herald a new era of diverse matchups and added drama in the sport.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans' public education system has transformed into an almost entirely charter school model, with significant improvements in test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment. Former principal Mary Haynes-Smith, initially skeptical, found autonomy as a charter CEO beneficial, making decisions better suited for her school. While data shows substantial academic gains, public opinion remains mixed, with socioeconomic status influencing parental satisfaction and access to higher-rated schools. The system, which has not shied away from closing underperforming charters, is now exploring new strategies beyond closures for continued improvement, including the possibility of the district directly running some schools.</p>

          <p>Despite growing popularity and influencer claims, research offers limited support for weighted vests significantly improving bone and muscle strength, especially when compared to proven resistance training methods. Experts like Lauren Colenso-Semple note that while any physical activity is beneficial, the marketing promises for bone and muscle growth are largely unsupported by data. However, weighted vests may offer cardiovascular benefits by increasing energy expenditure and calorie burn, making them a reasonable tool for boosting physical activity, if used correctly. Ultimately, while not a magic bullet for strength, they can be a motivational aid for those seeking to enhance their workouts, though more effective alternatives exist for specific goals.</p>

Despite these significant setbacks to key players, the club is relatively confident, having enhanced its attacking options this summer with new acquisitions such as Viktor Gyokeres, Noni Madueke, and Eberechi Eze, which should provide sufficient cover during this period.</p>

          <p>China is exploring the expansion of its "Great Green Wall" project into Mongolia, signaling a collaborative effort to combat the severe desertification affecting the Mongolian Plateau, where nearly 80% of the land is degraded. This environmental degradation in Mongolia has far-reaching consequences for the wider East Asian region, notably contributing to the increasing intensity of sandstorms in recent years. The Gobi Desert, which spans parts of both China and Mongolia, is a significant source of sand and dust, leading to events like China's worst sandstorm in a decade in 2021. Such joint initiatives are becoming increasingly vital for mitigating cross-border environmental impacts and addressing shared ecological threats.</p>

The subscription model aims to lower upfront costs and allow battery swaps, with deliveries commencing in late September.

          <p>Singapore's July inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6%, marking its lowest level since January 2021, and core inflation also dipped to 0.5%. This moderation was driven by declines in retail goods, electricity, and gas prices, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) anticipating "moderate" inflation in the near term due to easing global crude oil and food commodity prices. Slower nominal wage growth and productivity increases are also expected to contribute to a moderation in unit labor costs. This economic data strengthens the case for the MAS to potentially loosen monetary policy in October, providing a buffer against weaker growth and rising trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs.
