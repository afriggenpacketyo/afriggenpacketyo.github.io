          <p>A year into CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround strategy, Nike has increased prices on its footwear, apparel, and equipment, with some categories seeing double-digit percentage rises. The move is seen as a way for the company to leverage its brand's pricing power to offset pressures from tariffs and margin compression. While the company posted surprise sales growth recently, it also forecast a weak holiday season, indicating a challenging recovery. This pricing strategy reflects a targeted approach to balance profitability with consumer perception in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>A new report from Adobe Analytics forecasts that U.S. online holiday spending will increase by 5.3% year-over-year, reaching $253.4 billion. This growth rate is slower than the 8.7% increase seen in the previous year and below the ten-year average, reflecting a more cautious consumer environment. Shoppers are expected to prioritize discounts and may increasingly use AI-powered tools to find deals. Despite economic uncertainty, the desire to celebrate the season is expected to sustain spending, with mobile devices predicted to account for over half of all online purchases.

          <p>Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones stated that market conditions are ripe for a significant rally in stock prices before the current bull market reaches a speculative peak. He drew parallels to the period before the 1999 dot-com bubble burst but noted that today's fiscal and monetary policies are far more explosive. Jones advised that while there are substantial gains to be made in the final phase of a bull market, investors must be prepared for an inevitable and severe correction. He suggested a portfolio of gold, cryptocurrencies, and tech stocks for the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold and bitcoin have both reached record prices, driven by a confluence of economic uncertainty, geopolitical instability, and increased investor demand. Gold surpassed $3,900 per troy ounce, while bitcoin briefly broke the $125,000 barrier, with both assets seeing significant gains in 2025. Factors fueling the rallies include concerns over the U.S. government shutdown, global debt levels, and the dollar's viability, prompting investors to seek safe-haven assets. The surge is also supported by rising demand from central banks and institutional investors through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chef Bryant Ng, known for the acclaimed restaurant Cassia, has opened Jade Rabbit, a new fast-casual concept in Santa Monica that embraces and elevates Chinese American food. The restaurant offers a build-a-bowl format with dishes like orange mango chicken and a unique beef and broccoli inspired by Peruvian lomo saltado. Ng aims to challenge the stigma that Chinese American food is not 'real' Chinese cuisine, celebrating it as a legitimate regional style born from immigrant necessity and creativity. The menu also features inventive items like scallion garlic cheese toast, a nod to Sizzler's classic.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal from Live Nation and its subsidiary Ticketmaster, allowing a consumer class-action lawsuit over ticket prices to proceed in federal court. The lawsuit accuses the company of monopolizing ticketing services, leading to artificially high prices. Live Nation had sought to move the case to a private arbitration system, but lower courts found the specific arbitration rules were convoluted and unfairly favored the company. This decision is a victory for consumers seeking to challenge the company's market practices through class-action litigation.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) currently offer interest rates that can help savers protect their money's buying power against inflation. While national average yields for one- to five-year terms are below 2% APY, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some six-month and one-year CDs offering over 4% APY. The current inverted yield curve means that short-term CDs often provide better returns than long-term ones. Experts suggest savers look to online banks and consider laddering CDs of various terms to maximize earnings in this environment. (not investment advice)</p>
