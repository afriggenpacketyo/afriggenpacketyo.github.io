          <p>A UK government minister confirmed they are pushing for a deal with the EU that would allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports, aiming to reduce border queues for travelers. The minister expressed confidence in making progress on lowering food prices by reducing red tape, though emphasized that nothing is finalized until all aspects are agreed upon. A Conservative MP voiced concerns that the government might agree to EU standards, potentially surrendering British sovereignty, particularly regarding food and trade regulations. The discussions are ongoing ahead of a UK-EU summit in London, with both parties hoping to reach agreements on trade and security matters. (optimism score)</p>

          <p>Haas F1 team has requested a review of the decision to disallow Oliver Bearman's final qualifying lap at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, believing he completed the lap before a red flag was issued due to a crash. Despite television footage and live-timing data appearing to support Haas's claim, the FIA upheld its original decision, citing that the red flag was triggered just after Bearman crossed the finish line. Bearman expressed his frustration, stating that the red light on his dash did not appear until after he completed the lap, deeming the decision unfair.</p>
