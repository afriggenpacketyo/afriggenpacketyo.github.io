          <p>A Chinese woman, Zhimin Qian, has been convicted in the UK in connection with a massive international fraud that led to the seizure of 61,000 bitcoin, currently valued at over £5 billion. Between 2014 and 2017, she orchestrated a scam in China that defrauded over 128,000 victims before fleeing to the UK, where she attempted to launder the proceeds by purchasing property. The conviction follows a complex seven-year investigation by London's Metropolitan Police into the global money laundering operation. The case highlights the increasing use of cryptocurrency by organized criminals to conceal and transfer illicit assets across jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>The Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has launched an experimental model, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, which aims to significantly increase efficiency and reduce costs for processing large amounts of information. The model introduces a new feature called DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), which selectively focuses on the most relevant data for a given task, potentially halving operational costs compared to its predecessor. While this "sparse attention" approach makes powerful AI more accessible, some experts raise concerns about its reliability and potential to lose nuance by excluding data. The open-source release is seen as part of the ongoing geopolitical competition in AI between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>A German court has sentenced Jian Guo, a former aide to far-right AfD politician Maximilian Krah, to four years and nine months in prison for spying for China. The court in Dresden found Guo guilty of passing confidential documents from Krah's European Parliament office to Chinese intelligence services. The case, which has fueled broader concerns about Chinese espionage activities within the European Union, also involved accusations that Guo spied on Chinese dissidents living in Germany. Guo had worked for Krah for five years and maintained his innocence throughout the trial, claiming he did not work for Chinese intelligence.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Electric Vehicle Sales Spike as Federal Tax Credit Deadline Approaches</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of electric vehicles in the U.S. have surged dramatically as buyers rush to finalize purchases before the Sept. 30 expiration of federal tax credits worth up to $7,500. The early end to the incentive, part of a Republican tax package, created a "bonkers" sales environment, boosting the entire auto market to its strongest third quarter since before the pandemic. Analysts predict this sales rush will be followed by an "EV hangover," as demand that would have been spread over the coming months was pulled forward. The end of the credit will test the "natural demand" for EVs without significant government incentives. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid expansion of legalized sports betting across the U.S. is prompting a debate on whether states should impose stricter limits to combat problem gambling. Since a 2018 Supreme Court decision, the industry has exploded, but regulations vary widely from state to state in the absence of a national policy. Some addiction researchers and policymakers are calling for a more unified, public health-focused approach, citing models from countries like the UK and Norway that have set betting limits and levies for treatment programs. The industry advocates for a "responsible gaming" model, but critics argue it ineffectively places the burden on individuals rather than addressing the industry's practices.</p>

          <p>Facing uncertainty over the future of U.S. military assistance, Ukraine is rapidly expanding its domestic arms industry to sustain its defense against Russia. The country, which was heavily reliant on foreign weapons, is now producing a significant portion of its own arsenal, including millions of military drones that are striking targets deep inside Russia. Ukrainian tech entrepreneurs are transforming the nation into a "defense valley," developing advanced systems like the long-range Flamingo cruise missile. This strategic shift aims to reduce dependency on allies and ensure a steady supply of sophisticated weaponry to counter Russia's numerical superiority.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after the legendary "Thrilla in Manila" boxing match, this article reflects on the brutal and historic third fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. The author, Ali's authorized biographer, recounts watching the fight tape with Ali years later, noting the boxer's pained reaction to reliving the physical punishment. The fight was the culmination of an intensely personal and bitter rivalry, fueled by Ali's taunts which Frazier felt stripped him of his dignity. Both men inflicted permanent damage on each other in the 14-round epic, a battle that is remembered as one of the greatest and most punishing in boxing history.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and his cabinet are holding a two-day retreat in Berlin to reset their agenda after a challenging first five months in office. The primary focus of the meeting is to tackle bureaucracy and improve the German economy's competitiveness, with proposals to cut red tape costs by 25% and reduce federal staff levels. This gathering comes as public satisfaction with the ruling conservative-Social Democrat coalition has reached a record low. The retreat aims to foster better teamwork and deliver quick results for businesses facing economic pressure, signaling a push for greater efficiency and modernization from the government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, has definitively ruled out applying a Value Added Tax (VAT) to private healthcare services in the upcoming autumn budget. Responding to speculation about potential tax increases, Streeting stated unequivocally that "it's not happening." The statement comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces pressure to find ways to fund public services while adhering to borrowing rules, leading to questions about whether the government would break its manifesto pledge not to raise VAT. Currently, most private healthcare in the UK is exempt from the standard 20% VAT rate.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to launch a new online hospital service by 2027 to help reduce patient waiting times, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce. The "NHS Online" service will be accessible via the NHS app and will have its own dedicated doctors to manage patients who opt for virtual care. It is designed to handle assessments, consultant check-ups, and follow-up appointments online, freeing up capacity for in-person visits. The initiative, which will be phased in, aims to deliver millions of appointments in its first three years, focusing on specialties like ophthalmology and gynaecology where many patients may not require inpatient treatment.</p>
