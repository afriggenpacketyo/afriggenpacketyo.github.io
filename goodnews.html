          <p>The High Court has dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees. The challenge, brought by families and private schools, argued that the policy was discriminatory and breached human rights law. The court found that the policy was made by Parliament after full debate and was a manifesto commitment, and the government was entitled to consider the expected revenue outweighed any adverse effects. The government defended the policy, stating it would raise ¬£1.8bn a year by 2029/30 to spend on raising standards in the state sector.</p>

          <p>Deconstruction, the practice of carefully dismantling buildings for reusable materials, is gaining traction as a climate solution. It promotes a circular economy by reducing waste and lowering the carbon footprint of construction. Cities like Boulder, Colorado, and Portland, Oregon, are leading the way with deconstruction ordinances and reuse facilities. However, challenges remain, including the need for local infrastructure, skilled labor, and economic incentives to offset the higher costs compared to traditional demolition, but the benefits of embodied carbon are significant.</p>
