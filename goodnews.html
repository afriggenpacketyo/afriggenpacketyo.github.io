          <p>U.S. Treasury yields retreated from recent highs after Donald Trump proposed a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., which sent investors seeking safety in bonds. Trump's remarks followed concerns that his budget bill would worsen the U.S. deficit, which had previously pushed the 30-year Treasury yield to levels not seen since 2023. This article also notes that Moody's downgraded the U.S.' credit rating late last week, citing the growing budget deficit and the cost of funding the existing debt.</p>

          <p>Jemele Hill dismissed claims that Caitlin Clark is being specifically targeted in the WNBA, stating that hard fouls and trash talk are simply part of the competition. Hill argued that such incidents shouldn't be attributed to race or any specific targeting of Clark, referencing A'ja Wilson's claim that Clark's popularity is due to her being White. The article details a recent altercation between Clark and Rhyne Howard during a game, with Hill suggesting that similar incidents are not uncommon in men's basketball.

          <p>A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration from sharply cutting jobs and reorganizing federal agencies under the Department of Government Efficiency effort led by Elon Musk. The judge stated that agencies cannot conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and that a President may not initiate such changes without partnering with Congress. The Trump administration has appealed the decision.</p>

          <h2>Contrast-Enhanced Mammography Found to Detect More Tumors in Women with Dense Breasts</h2>

          <p>A new study found that contrast-enhanced mammography detects three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue as ultrasound scans. The study, published in The Lancet, compared various types of scans and found that contrast-enhanced mammography can also detect tumors that are much smaller than those found by regular mammography. While M.R.I.s are better at detecting more tumors, they are considerably more expensive. This method of mammography is not yet widely used for screening in the United States.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its decision to revoke the university's ability to enroll foreign students. The university argues that the move is a violation of the U.S. Constitution and a retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, temporarily blocking the policy from coming into effect.</p>
