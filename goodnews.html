          <p>Jim Irsay, the owner and CEO of the Indianapolis Colts, has died at the age of 65, according to a statement from the team. Irsay, son of former Baltimore Colts owner Robert Irsay, had a lifelong involvement with the NFL, starting as a ball boy and eventually becoming the youngest general manager in team history. He took over sole ownership in 1997 and oversaw the team's Super Bowl victory in 2006, led by Peyton Manning. Beyond football, Irsay was known for his extensive collection of historical manuscripts and musical instruments and his openness about his struggles with addiction. </p>

          <p>An NYPD inspector, Terrell Anderson, was transferred from his command of the candidate assessment division after it was discovered that he had overridden negative psychological reports for 80 prospective officers. This allowed the candidates to enter the Police Academy despite not meeting mental health standards. The inspector's decisions occurred amidst a decline in the department's head count, and the matter is currently under investigation. Anderson, who has been cited for meritorious duty 38 times, was known for his efforts to recruit more officers of color and for his community-focused approach in troubled precincts. </p>

          <p>Sea temperatures around the UK and Ireland have risen significantly, with some areas experiencing temperatures 4¬∞C warmer than normal, creating a marine heatwave. This phenomenon, driven by climate change and a warm spring, could impact marine life, potentially disrupting breeding patterns and leading to jellyfish blooms. Scientists are surprised by the heatwave's persistence and are studying its potential effects on the ecosystem. While the waters are still cooler than peak summer temperatures, the heatwave may also influence land temperatures through sea breezes. </p>
