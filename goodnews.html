          <p>This article explores the potential benefits of investing in 1-ounce gold bars amid current economic volatility and rising inflation. Analysts from Citi have increased their short-term price forecast for gold, citing a negative U.S. economic outlook and increased demand for safe-haven assets. The smaller bar size offers greater flexibility and liquidity for individual investors compared to larger formats or other gold-related investments like ETFs. The text suggests this format is a strategic way to preserve purchasing power while navigating market turbulence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime and an 8.1% decrease in property crime compared to the previous year. Notably, the murder rate fell by 14.9%, and motor vehicle thefts saw a significant 18.6% decline. While experts note this continues a downward trend from a post-pandemic spike, they also caution that aggravated assaults remain high and that many crimes go unreported.</p>

          <p>The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark have collectively agreed to purchase $1 billion in U.S. weapons to be sent to Ukraine. This arrangement follows a new policy supported by President Trump, allowing NATO allies to procure American arms for Ukrainian aid. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed the deal, noting the Netherlands will provide components for Patriot air defense systems, which are crucial for defending against Russian airstrikes. The move signifies continued European support for Ukraine's defense efforts, even as direct U.S. military aid has been a subject of political debate.</p>

          <p>A new report details the significant disparities in financial support provided to Ukrainian refugees across Europe, a topic of current debate in Germany. In Germany, refugees receive "citizens' money," a monthly stipend of €563 plus housing and health insurance costs, one of the most generous packages. In contrast, Poland offers no monthly payments but provides access to jobs and services, while Hungary offers a minimal stipend of €55 per month. The UK and Belgium have their own complex systems, highlighting the lack of a unified EU standard for refugee financial assistance.</p>

          <p>Oil and gas producer Coterra Energy reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by higher-than-expected production. Despite the positive results, the company faces headwinds from declining prices for both oil and natural gas and is managing operational issues related to excess water in some of its Texas wells. The company updated its full-year guidance, slightly increasing its production forecast but lowering its free cash flow projection. Coterra also announced a new long-term natural gas supply agreement with a power plant being built in the Permian Basin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article addresses concerns about outliving a reverse mortgage, a financial tool for seniors to convert home equity into cash. It clarifies that a borrower cannot be forced to leave their home as long as they reside there and meet obligations like paying taxes and insurance. However, it is possible to outlive the home's equity, as the loan balance grows with interest, potentially leaving no value for heirs. The text explains that reverse mortgages are non-recourse loans, meaning the estate will never owe more than the home's sale value. (not investment advice)</p>

The directive emphasizes the need for the U.S. to establish a lunar power source before competitors like China and Russia, who have a similar goal for the mid-2030s. The program, Fission Surface Power, will rely on microreactor technology to generate at least 100 kilowatts of electricity for a planned Artemis base.

The move signals a further distancing from Musk's policies following a public disagreement between him and President Trump, and was described by a new OPM official as inefficient.</p>
