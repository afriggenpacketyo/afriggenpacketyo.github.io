          <p>Chinese officials and state-run media are portraying the initial trade agreement with the United States as a significant victory for Beijing. They claim that China's firm stance and countermeasures were effective in securing a deal with relatively few concessions.

The fire caused damage to the property's entrance, but no injuries were reported. The investigation is being led by counter-terrorism officers as a precaution due to the property's previous connections with a high-profile public figure. The Prime Minister has thanked the emergency services for their work, while declining to comment further because the matter is part of a live investigation. The London Fire Brigade confirmed that they were called to a small fire, which was under control within 20 minutes.</p>

          <p>Investing $500,000 in an annuity can provide a substantial monthly income, but the exact amount varies based on several factors. These factors include the annuitant's age, gender, the type of annuity chosen (fixed, variable, immediate, or deferred), and the prevailing interest rate environment. Monthly payouts could range from $2,600 to over $5,200, according to an analysis of Cannex data by Annuity.org. Choosing the right annuity requires careful consideration of individual retirement needs, risk tolerance, and financial goals, as well as comparing different annuity types and checking the financial strength of the provider.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to raise the limit on the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less. The SALT deduction limit has been a sticking point in tax bill negotiations and the provision could still change significantly. Enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, of 2017, there's a $10,000 limit on the federal deduction on state and local taxes, known as SALT, which will sunset after 2025 without action from Congress. Raising the SALT cap has been a priority for certain lawmakers from high-tax states like California, New Jersey and New York.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariff receipts hit a record level in April, totaling $16.3 billion, as revenue from President Trump's trade war began to impact the budget. The increase in tariffs helped reduce the budget deficit for the month, although the U.S. is still running a significant deficit overall. The Trump administration instituted 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.S. imports starting April 2, which came on top of other select duties he had leveled previously. High interest rates continue to pose a budgetary burden, with net interest on the national debt totaling $89 billion in April.</p>

          <p>The temporary tariff pause between the U.S. and China is expected to lead to a surge in freight shipments as importers rush to move goods before potential future tariff increases. However, the reduced tariffs at 30% will still pose challenges for some businesses, and container rates are likely to increase due to pent-up demand. Experts warn that the uncertainty surrounding a permanent deal will continue to disrupt supply chains and potentially lead to higher prices for consumers.
