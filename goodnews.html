          <p>The Kremlin has announced that an agreement has been reached for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump in the near future. While a specific date and location have not yet been disclosed, a Putin adviser confirmed that preparations for the summit are underway. The announcement follows a meeting between Putin and a White House special envoy, which Trump described as "highly productive" in working towards an end to the war in Ukraine. This development occurs as a deadline approaches for Russia to make peace or face significant new U.S. sanctions.</p>

Key players like Zoe Harrison at fly-half and captain Zoe Aldcroft in the back row have been retained or reinstated.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal has reportedly reached an agreement to sign Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez for a fee of £46.3 million (53 million euros). The 26-year-old Uruguayan international is expected to undergo a medical to finalize the move. Nunez joined Liverpool in 2022 for an initial £64 million and has scored 40 goals in 143 appearances for the club. The sale could provide Liverpool with the financial flexibility to pursue other transfer targets, such as Newcastle's Alexander Isak, before the current transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>The tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, once a niche hobby, is now a major spectator sport, with live-play shows selling out venues like Madison Square Garden. This phenomenon, known as "actual play," features comedians and actors playing the game for large audiences, both online and in person. The popularity of shows like "Dimension 20" and "Critical Role" is credited with fueling a new golden age for the game, attracting a more diverse player base than ever before. This mainstream success is driving broader engagement with D&D, including traditional home games among friends.</p>

          <h2>NFL Implements Ban on Smelling Salts Citing Player Safety and Concussion Risks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Football League has banned the use of smelling salts by players on the field, citing safety concerns and their potential to mask concussion symptoms. The decision aligns with an FDA warning that the ammonia-based inhalants have not been proven safe or effective for boosting alertness. While some players have expressed dismay at the ban, health experts note that the substance can cause a reflexive jolt of the head and neck, potentially worsening an undiagnosed head injury. The long-term effects of repeated use remain poorly understood, prompting the league to take this precautionary measure.</p>

          <p>China and Pakistan are set to expand their technological collaboration into new strategic areas, including nuclear power for agriculture, space exploration, and artificial intelligence. The discussions occurred during a meeting between Pakistani officials and the heads of China's nuclear and space agencies. A key focus is extending the peaceful use of nuclear technology, building on the success of the two Chinese-designed Hualong One reactors already operating in Karachi. These reactors are China's first exported third-generation units, each capable of generating over 10 billion kWh of electricity annually.</p>

          <h2>Experts Outline Strategies for Fireproofing Forests in a Warming World</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 03:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As wildfires intensify globally due to climate change, experts are emphasizing proactive forest management strategies to mitigate risks. These include converting flammable monocultures, like pine or eucalyptus, back to more fire-resistant native deciduous forests. Short-term solutions involve reducing ground fuel through controlled burns, mechanical clearing, or animal grazing. Additionally, creating wide, vegetation-free firebreaks can slow or stop a fire's spread. These measures, combined with early detection systems and adequate firefighting resources, are crucial for adapting to a hotter, drier planet where fire risk is escalating.</p>

          <p>SoftBank Group reported a second straight quarter of profit, largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Fund technology investment arm. The Japanese conglomerate's fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen significantly exceeded analyst expectations. The Vision Fund's strong performance was bolstered by gains in public holdings like Grab and private investments in Indian firms such as Swiggy. This positive result comes as investors watch for returns on SoftBank's substantial new investments in artificial intelligence, including a major funding round for OpenAI and the pending acquisition of Ampere Computing.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the prevailing political tendency towards authoritarian control is ill-suited for solving complex global challenges like climate change and economic instability. The author critiques leaders who prioritize maintaining power over fostering real change, noting that a rigid, top-down approach stifles the creativity needed for a polycrisis world. Citing neuroscience, the article explains that the human brain is wired for certainty, a trait exploited by fear-mongering politics. The author advocates for a shift away from "power over" to a more collaborative and pluralistic model that embraces uncertainty to renew democracy.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has expressed a cautiously optimistic outlook for the industry, signaling a recovery from a historic crisis. A bumper olive harvest in Spain has led to a 50% drop in raw material costs, allowing for lower supermarket prices and stimulating consumer demand. This follows two seasons of poor yields, which caused extreme price volatility and declining consumption. The company, which owns brands like Bertolli, now anticipates a more balanced market and plans to double its investment in advertising to reinforce olive oil's status as a staple.

          <p>Some financial experts argue that China is successfully managing its significant local government debt, which was once seen as a major risk to global financial stability. Through a sweeping debt-restructuring campaign, Beijing has enabled local governments to extend repayment terms, bringing the risks under control. In contrast, these analysts express growing concern over the debt challenges in the United States, where the burden sits at the federal level. This perspective suggests a shifting outlook on the comparative debt situations of the two economic superpowers, with China's centralized approach seen as more manageable. (not investment advice)</p>
