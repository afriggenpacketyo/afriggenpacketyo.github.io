          <p>Amidst protests in Los Angeles concerning immigration sweeps, U.S. officials have stated that deployed Marines and National Guard personnel will operate under specific rules of force. Their primary task is to protect federal buildings and personnel, refraining from patrolling streets or detaining protesters unless necessary for self-defense. The troops will carry weapons but without ammunition loaded, and they will not use rubber bullets or pepper spray. The rules can change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done yet, and the LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell stressed the importance of open communication between agencies to avoid escalation and ensure a coordinated response during this critical time.

          <p>A Pennsylvania-based plastics injection molding company, The Rodon Group, is experiencing a surge in business due to the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. Demand has increased by nearly 50% as companies panic due to supply shocks, reminiscent of the pandemic. The company has avoided the tariff chaos by using automation to keep production of K'nex toys stateside, and invested in robots in the 1980s that "did almost nothing, but could pick stuff up," Aretan said. The company's CEO emphasizes the importance of STEM education and investing in the U.S. workforce to maintain domestic production competitiveness. The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

A separate defamation lawsuit Baldoni filed against The New York Times, which first reported Lively's complaint, was also dismissed.

          <p>The article revisits the historical precedent of President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1965 decision to federalize Alabama's National Guard without the governor's consent to protect civil rights marchers. This action is compared to President Trump's recent controversial move to federalize the California National Guard amidst immigration protests. Johnson's decision came after Alabama Governor George Wallace refused to provide safety for the activists, and the article also highlights Eisenhower's 1957 federalization of the Arkansas National Guard during the Little Rock desegregation crisis. The article provides historical context for the current debate over federal versus state control of the National Guard. The optimism score for this article is 55.</p>
