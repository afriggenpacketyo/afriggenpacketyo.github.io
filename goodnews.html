          <p>Mayuri Chari and Janhavi Khemka are two Indian women artists who are making names for themselves through their distinct artistic visions. Khemka, a hearing-impaired artist, explores sound through vibration and tactile mediums, drawing inspiration from her mother. Chari challenges societal norms regarding women through her art, focusing on the female body and experiences in India. Both artists have faced challenges, including lack of accessibility and institutional rejection, but have found support and recognition through their work, which speaks to personal experiences of gender, disability, and family.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK government borrowing was higher than expected in April, reaching ¬£20.2 billion, which is ¬£1 billion more than the same month last year, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that this is the fourth-highest April borrowing figure since records began in 1993. While tax receipts increased by over ¬£5 billion due to higher National Insurance contributions from employers, government expenditure also rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increased pension and benefit costs. Borrowing for the financial year ending in March is now estimated at ¬£148.3 billion, which is ¬£3.7 billion less than initially estimated but still ¬£11 billion more than the Office for Budget Responsibility expected.</p>

          <p>China is urging the European Union to provide a fair playing field for businesses in response to Brussels' proposal to impose a handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms. The European Commission is proposing a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly to customers from overseas and a 50-cent fee for parcels sent to European warehouses. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning emphasized the importance of an open and inclusive trade environment and called on the EU to uphold its commitment to openness and provide a non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. According to James Butterfill, the head of research for CoinShares, the price rise is taking place despite a drop in U.S. stock markets. The diverging movements of bitcoin and stocks could be the result of investors looking for alternative stores of value. Additionally, Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt has contributed to the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a notable bitcoin skeptic, said that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency.</p>

          <p>The European Union is providing Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty with millions of dollars to continue functioning after the Trump administration withheld funds. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, announced a $6.2 million contribution to support the network's independent journalism. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, founded during the Cold War, provides non-ideological news to countries where the press is restricted. The Trump administration's actions have been seen as an effort to undermine the news media's finances and independence. This move by the EU underscores the value placed on the network's reporting, particularly on Russia and Hungary.</p>
