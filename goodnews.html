          <p>China is leading a renewed effort within the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to establish a new development bank for its ten member nations, including Russia and India. The initiative aims to create a financial institution that can help member states reduce their dependence on the U.S. dollar for trade and insulate their economies from associated risks. Analysts suggest that such a bank would also accelerate key infrastructure projects across Eurasia, strengthening economic ties within the bloc. The move is seen as a logical step in creating an alternative to Western-dominated global financial systems.</p>

The couple, who have been together since 2018, both wore custom-designed Louis Vuitton outfits for the occasion. Moretz opted for a non-traditional baby blue gown, reflecting their desire for a wedding that felt personal and different. The event was planned to include activities the couple loves, such as fishing, horseback riding, and poker, sharing their passions with their guests.</p>

          <h2>New Dating of Ancient Greek Skull Reshapes Human Evolution Timeline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 17:47:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study using advanced dating techniques has determined that the significant Petralona cranium, a human fossil discovered in Greece, is at least 286,000 years old. This new, more precise age resolves decades of debate and places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era. The finding provides crucial context for understanding human evolution in Europe, suggesting a more complex history than previously understood. It strengthens the theory that archaic human populations, possibly *Homo heidelbergensis*, coexisted alongside the emerging Neanderthal lineage in the region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent coronal mass ejection from the sun has created a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis to be visible across large parts of the United Kingdom, much farther south than usual. The Met Office advised that sightings could be possible with the naked eye in areas with clear, dark skies, potentially reaching as far south as the Midlands. While forecasts are subject to change, the heightened solar activity provides a rare opportunity for many in the UK to witness the natural light display. Visibility will ultimately depend on local weather conditions and light pollution.</p>

          <p>At 38 years old, Novak Djokovic continues to defy age by reaching the later stages of the US Open, but his journey has been marked by persistent physical issues. While his performance remains at a high level, the tennis star has repeatedly required medical attention for various ailments during the tournament. This raises questions about whether his aging body can withstand the grueling demands of best-of-five-set matches against the sport's younger elite. His continued success is a testament to his skill and preparation, but his physical robustness remains a key uncertainty.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed confidence that the Supreme Court will overturn a lower court ruling and uphold President Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs. The administration is appealing a decision that found the tariffs illegal, arguing they are a legitimate use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Bessent claims the tariffs are a necessary tool to address long-standing trade imbalances and combat the influx of fentanyl, which he defines as a national emergency. The administration has also prepared a backup plan using other legal authorities if the appeal fails.</p>
