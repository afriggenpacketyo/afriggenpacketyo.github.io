Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik emphasized that American companies will manage the data centers and cloud services, ensuring strong security measures to prevent technology diversion. This announcement coincided with President Donald Trump's visit to the UAE as part of his Middle East tour, during which he engaged with heads of state and unveiled multiple agreements.</p>

          <p>Gold has long been valued as a safe haven and store of wealth, especially in unpredictable investment environments, and is now more accessible to everyday investors through major retailers like Costco and Walmart. Investors can choose from options such as gold IRAs, physical gold, gold futures, and gold ETFs, each with its own set of pros and cons. Physical gold requires secure storage, while gold futures are speculative and risky. Experts recommend limiting gold investments to 5% to 10% of a portfolio for diversification.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shaibani met in Turkey to discuss lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria after President Trump announced he would end sanctions and met with the country‚Äôs president, a former jihadist. Rubio emphasized the U.S. goal of establishing a peaceful, stable Syria and expressed encouragement from Syria‚Äôs new government. The Trump administration plans to issue a temporary waiver of some sanctions, allowing American dollars to flow into the country and enabling Syria‚Äôs neighbors to fund reconstruction. The United States first imposed sanctions on Syria in the 1970s, introducing more punishing restrictions on the Assad regime during Syria‚Äôs civil war.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson is working to unify House Republicans on a mega-bill encompassing President Donald Trump's legislative agenda, focusing on Medicaid and tax reform. A key sticking point is the state and local tax (SALT) caps, with moderates opposing the proposed $30,000 cap on deductions. Johnson aims to find a consensus and pass the bill by Memorial Day, claiming Republicans are aiming to pass the package in a "deficit-neutral way." The House Budget Committee will send the bill to the Rules committee, targeting a final vote in the House next week.</p>

          <p>Belgium's parliament has voted to drop the country's planned nuclear phaseout, reversing a 2003 law that stipulated nuclear power plants were to be closed by 2025. The motion passed with 102 votes in favor, eight against, and 31 abstentions, marking a significant shift in the country's energy policy. In 2022, Belgium delayed the phaseout by 10 years, planning to run one reactor in each of its two plants as a backup due to energy uncertainty from Russia's war in Ukraine. Nuclear energy currently accounts for around 40% of Belgium's power generation, according to the International Energy Agency.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria could stabilize Syria on many levels. However, it remains unclear if sanctions relief will be limited to specific sectors, like international humanitarian aid, banking or general business, or if the end of the US sanctions is subject to certain conditions. Along with lifting sanctions, Trump also urged Syria to do five things, including signing onto the Abraham Accords with Israel and telling all foreign terrorists to leave Syria. Following the ousting of Assad, some 1.87 million Syrians, both internally displaced and returnees from abroad, have already returned to their communities.</p>

Medicare supplemental insurance can fill gaps in regular Medicare coverage, while long-term care insurance covers costs associated with nursing homes, assisted living, and in-home care. Whole life insurance provides lifelong coverage with a cash component that can be borrowed against and left to beneficiaries. Acting this spring could secure more coverage at lower premiums.</p>

The study suggests the languages ‚Äã‚Äãand traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. The study also found the early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environmental settings.
