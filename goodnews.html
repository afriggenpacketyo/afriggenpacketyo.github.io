          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a 25 basis point interest rate cut, lowering its inflation expectations due to a stronger euro and reduced energy costs. Euro zone inflation had fallen below the ECB's 2% target in May, reaching 1.9%. The ECB now anticipates an average inflation rate of 2% in 2025, a downward revision from the March forecast of 2.3%. Despite the rate cut, ECB President Christine Lagarde acknowledged that the outlook for euro area inflation remains more uncertain than usual, and the ECB left its growth forecast for 2025 unchanged at 0.9%.

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a straight woman in a job discrimination case, rejecting a requirement that members of majority groups must meet a heightened standard to win such cases. The justices overturned an appeals court decision that had imposed a stricter burden of proof on the plaintiff. This ruling clarifies the legal standards for employment discrimination cases and ensures that all individuals, regardless of their group affiliation, have equal protection under the law.</p>
