          <p>Alibaba shares experienced a 5% drop in premarket trading following the release of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, which fell short of analyst expectations for both revenue and net income. Despite a 7% year-on-year revenue increase, the company's net income significantly missed estimates, although it was still 279% higher compared to the previous year. The article points out that analysts had hoped that investments in artificial intelligence and e-commerce would drive better results, but macroeconomic volatility and competition in China affected the company's performance.
