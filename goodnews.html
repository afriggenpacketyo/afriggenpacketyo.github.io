          <p>A Mexican navy training ship, the Cuauht√©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, injuring nineteen people. The incident occurred on Saturday evening as the ship was departing for Iceland. Mayor Eric Adams reported that four individuals sustained serious injuries, and authorities temporarily closed the bridge to traffic. According to the Mexican navy, the ship sustained damage during a sailing maneuver, prompting a review by naval and local authorities. The Mexican ambassador to the U.S. noted that the ship has been sailing for about 20 years and that the incident may have been caused by mechanical issues with the pilot assigned to navigate the vessel.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, bloody bare footprints, led to a decades-long search for answers in the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs. Investigators initially compared the footprints to multiple suspects, including Arthur Gray, who lived with Childs at the time, but he had a solid alibi. In 2015, forensic scientist Andrea Feia discovered an unknown DNA profile throughout the crime scene. This led investigators to Jerry Westrom, who was eventually arrested in 2019 after his DNA matched the unknown profile, and his footprints were also confirmed to match those found at the scene.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart after the retailer warned that tariffs would force it to raise prices, asserting that the company should absorb the costs. In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated that Walmart made billions of dollars and could afford to "EAT THE TARIFFS" to keep prices down for consumers. Walmart responded by reiterating its commitment to keeping prices as low as possible despite the pressure from tariffs. This exchange occurred amidst concerns that Trump's trade policy could lead to inflation, with retailers facing the choice of raising prices or laying off workers.</p>

          <p>The government is exploring plans to have convicted criminals perform community service tasks such as filling potholes and cleaning bins. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood aims to expand unpaid work programs, collaborating with local councils and private companies to assign jobs to offenders. These offenders would not receive wages; instead, the earnings would be directed to a fund supporting victim's groups. The goal is to ensure punishment involves tangible contributions to society, addressing public needs and demonstrating that crime does not pay.</p>
