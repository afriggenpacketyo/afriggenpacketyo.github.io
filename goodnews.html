          <p>Uber is launching a new pilot program next month in select U.S. cities, allowing women drivers and riders to request matches with other women. This feature aims to enhance safety and comfort on the platform, building on previous tests in other countries. While the preference isn't guaranteed, it increases the likelihood of gender-matched pairings. The initiative comes as ride-hailing companies continue to address safety concerns, including incidents of sexual assault and harassment, on their platforms.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump's advocacy for Coca-Cola to use cane sugar in the U.S. is seen as a win for the sugar industry, which has historically benefited from government policies and significant political donations. This move, despite Trump's preference for Diet Coke, aligns with his administration's expanded supports for sugar producers and threats against corn syrup. Analysts suggest the shift, though unlikely to be wholesale, increases demand for sugar, potentially raising prices for farmers.</p>
