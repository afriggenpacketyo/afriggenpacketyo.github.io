          <p>After 81 years, the remains of four crew members from the WWII bomber "Heaven Can Wait," which crashed off New Guinea in 1944, are returning home for burial. Family members initiated an investigation that led to the discovery of the wreckage and a Navy recovery mission. The families of Staff Sgt. Eugene Darrigan, 2nd Lt. Thomas Kelly, 1st Lt. Herbert Tennyson, and 2nd Lt. Donald Sheppick can now properly honor their lost loved ones. The recovery effort, led by Project Recover and the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, highlights the enduring impact of the war on families and the commitment to finding missing service members. </p>
