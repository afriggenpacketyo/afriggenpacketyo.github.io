          <p>President Trump attended a NATO summit in the Netherlands, focusing on Iran and defense spending. Despite a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, Trump noted violations by both sides. He aimed to secure commitments from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of their GDP on defense, with NATO already agreeing to boost spending. Secretary General Mark Rutte praised Trump's actions in Iran and on new defense spending levels. Russia's war in Ukraine remains a concern for NATO members.

She noted WWE is at a "whole new level" since being broadcast on Netflix, reaching a different audience and opening up opportunities for WWE superstars.

          <p>President Trump urged Senate Republicans to finalize the megabill funding his second-term agenda, threatening to withhold vacation until it's done. Both the Senate and House face pressure to reconcile their versions by July 4. Speaker Mike Johnson warned House Republicans their Independence Day celebrations are at risk. The bill includes making the Trump 2017 tax cuts permanent, allocating funds for border security and defense, scaling back Medicaid and SNAP benefits, and altering state and local tax caps.

          <p>A small art exhibit in Dallas is paying tribute to African American veterans, ensuring their stories are seen and heard. The exhibit, titled Honor Endures, was created by photographer Keith Vinson and three of his classmates. It aims to share the often-overlooked stories of African American veterans. One of those stories is that of Lakeydria Houston, who was sexually assaulted while serving in the Army. The group of artists behind Honor Endures hopes to continue this work.</p>
