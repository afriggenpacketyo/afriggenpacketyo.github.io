          <p>China's industrial profits rose by 3% in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite high U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures. This cumulative profit increase follows a 1.4% year-on-year rise in the first four months of the year, reversing previous declines. Although U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods remain at 51.1% and China's levies on U.S. imports are at 32.6%, exports to Southeast Asian nations have surged, compensating for a 21% drop in exports to the U.S. Manufacturing activity in China fell more than expected in April, highlighting the ongoing supply-demand imbalance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half the tax write-off for intangible assets, such as player contracts and media rights, for future professional sports team owners. The tax break, which allows owners to deduct the full value of these assets over 15 years, has contributed to rising team values and has made teams into tax shelters. While the provision would only affect future owners, it could cool demand for teams and potentially impact the value of current owners' investments. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the change would raise nearly $1 billion over 10 years, though team owners argue the figure is much higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The government is shifting apprenticeship funding to prioritize training for under-21s in England, with controversial plans to scrap funding for postgraduate apprenticeships. This means that only students under 21 will qualify for funding for level 7 apprenticeships, and the government is promising 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults. Critics argue that the decision to scrap higher apprenticeships will damage public services, particularly the NHS, while the government aims to push more money generated by the apprenticeship levy towards younger individuals.</p>

          <p>Despite the implementation of Real ID requirements, travelers at Portland International Airport (PDX) reported few problems during the Memorial Day weekend. While the Homeland Security chief had warned of extra security for those without Real ID, many travelers found the process to be smooth, with some using passports instead. TSA officials stated that they are managing wait times and tailoring screening procedures to each airport, and travelers generally praised the efficiency of the airport experience.</p>

          <h2>King Charles' Visit to Canada Seen as Subtle Message to Trump</h2>

          <p>King Charles III's visit to Canada, as the country's head of state, is interpreted as a subtle rebuke to President Trump, who has threatened Canada's sovereignty. Invited by Prime Minister Mark Carney, the visit emphasizes Canada's distinct heritage from the U.S., and the King's opening of Parliament is seen as a symbolic show of support. The speech, while delivered by the King, will be written by the prime minister's office and is expected to diplomatically assert Canada's independence.</p>
