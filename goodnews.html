The Group of Seven (G7) launched an action plan to reduce critical mineral supply chain risks, addressing overdependence on China. Ishiba noted the impact of U.S. tariffs on Japanese firms, while China criticized the G7's market-distorting practices allegations. Kim Jong Un and Russian security official Sergey Shoigu discussed matters agreed upon with Vladimir Putin, and Ishiba pledged Japan's support for Ukraine's peace efforts, with Japan hosting a landmines conference. Japan reported a trade deficit in May due to weak U.S. exports, possibly affected by tariffs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed the first test flight of its next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, a critical step towards its 2030 lunar ambitions. The modular spacecraft, designed for both near-Earth and deep-space missions, underwent a zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre. The test involved igniting the spacecraft's escape engines while grounded, followed by a clean separation of the return capsule and deployment of parachutes. This safety measure ensures crew survival in case of rocket failure during launch, marking China's first such test since 1998, advancing its space exploration capabilities.</p>

          <p>Following a recent cyber attack that compromised customer data, the Co-op is offering members a ¬£10 discount on a minimum ¬£40 purchase. The retailer aims to regain customer trust and boost sales after the incident disrupted deliveries and left shelves empty. While the offer is intended as a gesture of appreciation, some analysts suggest the high spending threshold may limit its appeal. The Co-op is nearing full recovery from the attack, which involved hackers accessing its technology networks and stealing member data. The retailer is not planning to offer fraud prevention or identity monitoring services, and the cyber-attack is estimated to have cost Co-op millions in lost sales.</p>

Despite Meta's aggressive pursuit, Altman stated that none of OpenAI's top talent have accepted the offers. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is reportedly frustrated with his company's AI progress and is investing heavily to assemble a leading AI team.

          <p>Australia is set to become the first country to remove all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, effectively lifting the ban on gay and bisexual men. The changes, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to increase the donation pool by 625,000 people. The new rules will ask all donors about anal sex with new or multiple partners, requiring a three-month wait to donate blood if the answer is yes, but allowing plasma donation. These changes aim to reduce stigma and boost plasma supplies, while research indicates no impact on blood safety, though some argue the approach is more conservative than other countries.</p>
