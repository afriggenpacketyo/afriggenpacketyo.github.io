The Switch 2, set to launch in June with improved features and a starting price of $449.99 in the U.S., aims to continue Nintendo's success in the gaming market. The company had previously lowered its sales forecast for the original Switch due to tariff implications, but investors remain optimistic, with shares up 33% this year.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's has postponed its planned auction of sacred jewels linked to the Buddha's remains in Hong Kong, following threats of legal action from the Indian government. The sale, which drew criticism from Buddhist academics and monastic leaders, was suspended to allow for discussions between the involved parties. The Indian government argued that the relics constitute an inalienable part of India's religious and cultural heritage and that their sale would violate international laws.
