          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK) has announced it will lay down its arms after a 40-year insurgency against the Turkish state. The decision follows a message from imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan, who stated that the armed struggle had outlived its purpose. The P.K.K. has evolved from seeking an independent Kurdish state to advocating for greater rights for Kurds within Turkey. The group hopes Ocalan will lead the disarming process and calls on Turkey‚Äôs Parliament to participate, potentially ending a conflict that has claimed over 40,000 lives and influencing other Kurdish militias, especially in Syria. This New York Times article underscores the potential political victory for President Erdogan and the shift in regional dynamics.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reported substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential de-escalation of the ongoing trade war. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted the talks were "in-depth" and "candid." The White House has termed it a "trade deal," with a joint statement expected to provide further details. The talks, the first face-to-face meetings since President Trump imposed tariffs, aim to reduce the US's $1.2 trillion trade deficit and establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic power outage affecting Spain, Portugal, and southern France has ignited a debate over the role of renewable energy in maintaining energy security. The blackout, which lasted several hours, disrupted services and infrastructure across the Iberian Peninsula. While Spanish authorities are investigating the cause, some observers are pointing to the region's high reliance on wind and solar power as a potential factor. However, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and grid operator Red Electrica de Espana (REE) maintain that renewable energy was not responsible for the incident, as described in this CNBC article.</p>

          <p>Nina Mohanty, a millennial entrepreneur, has raised $2 million to develop Bloom Money, a financial app designed for immigrant communities in the UK. The app supports collaborative money-saving methods, such as "money circles" or rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCA), which are commonly used within these communities. Mohanty aims to address the gap in mainstream banking services that often fail to understand or cater to the unique financial practices of immigrant groups.

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled the world‚Äôs most advanced ocean simulation system with a resolution of 1km (0.6 mile) ‚Äì an unprecedented benchmark. The feat defies technological restrictions imposed by US semiconductor export controls designed to hobble China‚Äôs supercomputing sector. It aims to advance global climate research and empower agencies to refine disaster response strategies and coastal resilience planning, offering a lifeline as climate-related economic losses mount worldwide, according to this South China Morning Post report.</p>
