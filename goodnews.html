          <p>England has confirmed that fast bowler Jofra Archer will make his return to Test cricket for the first time in over four years in the upcoming match against India at Lord's. Archer's inclusion is the only change to the team, replacing Josh Tongue, as he completes a remarkable comeback from a series of debilitating back and elbow injuries. His last Test appearance was in 2021, and his return to the site of his 2019 World Cup final heroics is a significant boost for England. The team has kept faith in him with central contracts throughout his long recovery.</p>

          <p>Singapore's state investment firm, Temasek Holdings, saw its net portfolio value climb to a record SG$434 billion ($324 billion), an 11% increase from the previous year. This growth was driven by strong performance in its Singapore-listed companies and direct investments in the U.S., China, and India. The firm has been actively rebalancing its portfolio, making SG$52 billion in investments while also executing its largest divestment in over two decades at SG$42 billion. Despite geopolitical risks, Temasek remains constructive, viewing the U.S. as a key destination for capital, particularly in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six months after its launch, New York City's congestion pricing program has successfully reduced traffic and pollution, marking a significant environmental policy achievement. The $9 charge for cars entering lower Manhattan has cut traffic delays by a quarter, improved air quality, and increased public transit use. The revenue is funding much-needed upgrades to the city's subway and bus systems. Despite these tangible benefits and growing public support, the program faces a persistent legal and political battle from the Trump administration, which has sought to kill the initiative.</p>

          <p>A rodeo bull, known as Sauce Boss or Twinkle Toes, became a local celebrity in Snowmass Village, Colorado, after escaping from his handlers. The bull broke free while being unloaded for a rodeo and managed to evade capture for four days, hiding in tall brush and trees. Police issued an alert asking the public to keep a safe distance. Cowboys eventually managed to approach and recapture the animal, which is now expected to make his delayed debut at the local rodeo. The bull's brief dash for freedom captured the public's imagination online.</p>

          <h2>Cognitive Scientist Argues Against Comparing the Human Brain to Artificial Intelligence</h2>

          <p>A cognitive neuroscience researcher argues that the growing metaphor of the human brain as an AI system is dangerously misleading. The article contends that unlike AI, which is programmed and optimized, human learning is messy and driven by factors like motivation and curiosity. This flawed comparison could lead to harmful approaches in education and mental healthcare, prioritizing measurable outputs over genuine understanding and emotional experience. The author warns that outsourcing human functions like memory to AI doesn't extend the self but fundamentally alters the mechanisms that make us human.</p>

          <h2>Advocates Propose Reviving Classic Los Angeles Architectural Styles to Address Housing Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to Los Angeles's severe housing crisis, urban planning advocates are urging the city to look to its own architectural past for solutions. Instead of building dense, high-rise developments, they propose embracing medium-density designs like bungalow courts and dingbat apartments that once defined the city's character. Initiatives like "Small Lots, Big Impacts" are showcasing how multiple housing units can be built on single lots, creating more affordable homeownership opportunities. This approach aims to increase housing supply while preserving the city's unique aesthetic, offering a vision to "Los Angelize L.A." rather than imitate other metropolises.</p>

          <p>Homicides in Los Angeles have decreased by over 20% in the first half of 2025, positioning the city to record its lowest annual total in nearly six decades. The city recorded 116 homicides through late June, continuing a downward trend since a pandemic-era spike in 2021. This decline mirrors a national trend, with experts attributing it to a variety of factors rather than a single cause. Despite the positive statistics, LAPD officials caution that the gains could be fragile, especially as the department faces potential staffing shortages amid the city's fiscal challenges.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman is attempting to maintain a politically neutral, "hard middle" approach while navigating the turmoil of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement in the city. Since taking office, the former Republican turned independent has focused on restoring stability after his predecessor's controversial term. However, his measured response to federal actions, such as arrests inside courthouses, has drawn criticism for its perceived silence. Hochman insists his mission is public safety, not engaging in the political discourse between federal, state, and local leaders.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Societal Factors like Politics and War Influence Urban Animal Evolution</h2>

          <p>A new global study argues that the evolution of urban wildlife is shaped not only by physical environmental factors but also by societal forces such as religion, politics, and war. Researchers claim these cultural elements can leave lasting marks on the genetics, behavior, and survival of animals in cities. For example, policing strategies can alter park designs, affecting animal movement, while human displacement from conflict can open new habitats. This perspective challenges the separation of social and life sciences, suggesting urban planning must integrate both to support biodiversity alongside human communities.</p>

          <p>In a significant reversal, Warner Bros. Discovery has renamed its primary streaming service back to HBO Max, just two years after dropping the prestigious HBO brand to create the more broadly named "Max." The original move was intended to make the service more appealing to a mainstream audience by distancing it from HBO's high-end programming to better incorporate Discovery's reality content. However, the gambit failed to significantly boost subscribers, leading executives to acknowledge the immense brand value of HBO. The change reflects a renewed focus on quality content over sheer quantity.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that the recent intellectual trend of anti-liberalism, which saw thinkers on both the right and left declare the liberal political order obsolete, is now in decline. The article points to prominent critics, such as Sohrab Ahmari on the post-liberal right and Samuel Moyn on the left, who are now re-evaluating their positions and expressing a renewed appreciation for liberal democracy's virtues. The naked authoritarianism of the Trump administration has reportedly prompted this shift, forcing a reconsideration of what is at stake and revealing the intellectual weaknesses of the anti-liberal projects.</p>

          <p>The stock price for EssilorLuxottica, the maker of Ray-Ban sunglasses, jumped nearly 6% following reports that Meta has acquired a minority stake in the company. The investment, reportedly worth around $3.5 billion, signals Meta's deepening push into AI-powered wearable technology. The two companies have an existing partnership producing Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which integrate Meta's AI voice assistant. This move could expand their collaboration to other brands like Oakley and Prada and further build out Meta's hardware product line as it competes in the AI space.</p>

          <p>Amid a surge in popularity, this article explores the long history of tennis, tracing its origins to 12th-century France where it was played with palms instead of rackets. The modern game, known as lawn tennis, was pioneered in 19th-century Britain and was initially a sport for the privileged classes. The single biggest transformation came in 1968 with the dawn of the "Open Era," which professionalized the sport and introduced prize money. This shift, along with social changes, opened the game to a more diverse range of players and fueled its growth into the global spectacle it is today.</p>
