          <p>A team from Tsinghua University has developed a powerful new imaging chip, named Yuheng, capable of distinguishing colors with unprecedented sharpness and efficiency. The chip overcomes the traditional trade-off between resolution and efficiency in imaging, enabling it to record the color signatures of nearly 10,000 stars per second. This breakthrough could significantly accelerate projects like mapping the Milky Way, reducing the timeline from millennia to under a decade. The researchers are now preparing an engineering model of the chip for testing on the Gran Telescopio Canarias in Spain, the world's largest single-aperture optical telescope.</p>

          <p>Following a phone call with Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to meet the Russian leader in Budapest, Hungary, to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump stated that the discussion with Putin made "great progress" and comes as his administration increases pressure on Moscow. As leverage, the White House is considering supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, a topic expected to be discussed during an upcoming meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The renewed diplomatic push follows the recent ceasefire in Gaza, allowing the administration to refocus its efforts on the European conflict.</p>

          <p>The Portland City Council has unanimously voted to legally codify its sanctuary city status, further restricting cooperation between city employees, including police, and federal immigration authorities. The "Protect Portland Initiative" makes the city's sanctuary policies legally binding and establishes a formal framework for resisting federal immigration enforcement actions. This ordinance prohibits the use of city resources to assist agencies like ICE and mandates the creation of new training programs for city staff. The move reinforces Oregon's statewide sanctuary law and comes amid ongoing tensions with the Trump administration over federal actions in the city.</p>

          <p>Three men who followed a Nazi ideology have been sentenced to prison for preparing terrorist attacks against mosques and synagogues in the UK. Christopher Ringrose, Marco Pitzettu, and Brogan Stewart were part of an online group that amassed over 200 weapons, including machetes and a 3D-printed firearm component. The judge noted that the group was planning an imminent attack on an Islamic education center in Leeds before their arrest by counter-terror police. The men were convicted of preparing acts of terrorism, with the judge stating they continue to adhere to their extreme right-wing beliefs.</p>

          <p>At the World Conference on China Studies in Shanghai, prominent Chinese academics argued that Western theoretical frameworks are often inadequate for accurately understanding China. They called for a research approach that is more deeply grounded in the country's unique historical and social context. Lin Shangli, president of Renmin University, stated that Western logic struggles to explain the transformation of non-Western civilizations and China's distinct governance structures. The scholars emphasized the need for tailored methodologies and field research to overcome biases and achieve a more nuanced comprehension of the nation's development and complexities.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss military aid, including the potential provision of long-range Tomahawk missiles. The visit is set against the backdrop of a recent phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, where they agreed to hold a summit in Hungary to discuss ending the war. Zelenskyy suggested that Moscow's renewed interest in dialogue was directly influenced by the prospect of Ukraine receiving advanced U.S. weaponry. However, following his call with Putin, Trump appeared to temper expectations, citing concerns about depleting the U.S. missile stockpile.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago has achieved the largest reduction in drug overdose deaths among the ten most populous U.S. counties, with a 37% decrease since the national peak in 2023. The city's success is attributed to a robust, multi-faceted strategy that includes one of the nation's most advanced drug supply surveillance systems. By using mass spectrometers to test street drugs, the health department can quickly issue alerts about dangerous new adulterants like medetomidine and nitazenes. This data, combined with hyper-local overdose tracking and widespread distribution of naloxone and test strips through community hubs like public libraries, empowers users and improves emergency response.</p>

          <p>The landscape of professional criticism is undergoing a dramatic transformation as traditional media outlets reduce their critical staff while social media platforms give rise to a new class of self-styled commentators. While this democratization of opinion has led to concerns about expertise, it has also created a high demand for cultural analysis on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Letterboxd. These new critics build their own followings and operate under different rules, often blending analysis with entertainment and personal branding. This shift raises complex questions about integrity, authority, and the financial sustainability of criticism outside of institutional support.</p>

          <p>Millions of people are expected to participate in a second wave of "No Kings" protests across more than 2,500 U.S. cities and towns this Saturday. The demonstrations are organized by a coalition of over 200 progressive groups to protest what they describe as President Trump's authoritarian actions and corruption. The planned marches come as the Trump administration has increased its crackdown on dissent, deploying federal forces to several cities and labeling anti-fascist groups as terrorists. Organizers are proceeding despite the threats, emphasizing a commitment to nonviolent action and encouraging participants to show courage in the face of potential intimidation.</p>
