          <p>A couple volunteering at Vindolanda, a Roman fort near Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, unearthed a sandstone carving of Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory. The artifact was found in rubble near former infantry barracks, which were built in 213 A.D. during a tumultuous time. Experts believe the stone was part of a larger, brightly painted work, symbolizing the end of war and the establishment of the fort. The discovery is considered rare, and the artifact will be displayed at the Vindolanda museum next year, offering insight into the grandeur and symbolism of Roman forts.</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is remembered as a cultural icon 150 years after his birth. Mann's works reflected his life spent wandering between diverse worlds, especially after escaping Nazi Germany in the 1930s. He is renowned for novels like 'Buddenbrooks' and 'The Magic Mountain,' and his political essays and radio speeches during and after the Nazi dictatorship demonstrated his opposition to authoritarianism.

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce ¬£15 billion in transport infrastructure investments across England, particularly in the Midlands, North, and West Country. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects in mayoral authorities, including extensions to tram networks in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands. The investment marks a shift away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the south-east. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander hailed the announcement as a watershed moment for improving transport across the North and Midlands, while critics question Labour's ability to fund the promises.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a surge in Australian sales for May, reaching its highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y. Despite declining sales in the U.S. and Europe, Australian sales jumped to 3,897 vehicles, with the Model Y experiencing a 122.5% year-over-year increase. However, Tesla's global sales have faced challenges due to increased competition and reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities. Tesla's rebound in Australia contrasts with lower sales in other regions, although the company has seen positive results in Norway and Turkey.</p>
