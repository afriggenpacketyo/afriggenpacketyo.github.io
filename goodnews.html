          <p>A federal judge has denied another motion by Donald Trump to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the men wrongfully convicted in the 1989 Central Park jogger case. The plaintiffs‚ÄîYusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, and Korey Wise‚Äîsued Trump for statements he made suggesting they were guilty, despite their exoneration for a brutal sexual assault and assault. Judge Wendy Beetlestone ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which Trump's legal team invoked, does not apply in federal court. This decision allows the lawsuit, which addresses Trump's false claims about the case, to proceed.</p>

          <p>Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, a pioneering couple in Maryland's fight for marriage equality, are reflecting on the 10th anniversary of the Supreme Court's nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. Although their 2004 lawsuit to overturn Maryland's ban was unsuccessful in court, their public campaign raised awareness and helped pave the way for the state to legalize same-sex marriage in 2012. The couple, now married for over a decade, shared their story of facing obstacles in healthcare and daily life, emphasizing the importance of their fight for their children. They also expressed concern over current legal challenges threatening marriage equality nationwide.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students at Johns Hopkins University has successfully designed and built a custom printer that adds braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which needed a device that could handle materials incompatible with commercial braille printers. The students' invention features open hardware, making it accessible for BISM's employees who have low or no vision to operate. The new printer will be used for an annual fundraiser and will save employees from the laborious task of manually punching braille dots.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq achieved new record highs this week, navigating initial fears of escalating conflict between the U.S. and Iran. The market stabilized after a brief surge in energy prices, with investors betting the military action would not significantly impact economic growth or inflation. This de-escalation, combined with growing investor speculation of three potential Federal Reserve rate cuts by year-end, fueled the rally. The article notes that while the May PCE inflation report was slightly hotter than expected, it did not derail the market's positive momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New genetic research on skeletons from √áatalh√∂y√ºk, a 9,000-year-old settlement in Turkey, suggests it may have been a matriarchal society. After analyzing DNA from over 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses, researchers found that where biological connections existed, they were traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained connected to the family home. The findings, which also show females received significantly more grave goods than males, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal societal structures in the ancient world.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman was likely bitten by a juvenile shark while swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York. The woman suffered minor, non-life-threatening lacerations to her leg and foot and was treated at the scene. Although she did not see what bit her, experts who analyzed photos of the injuries believe they are consistent with a juvenile sand tiger shark. Swimming was temporarily suspended, but patrols will remain in place, though officials note that unprovoked shark bites on humans remain a rare occurrence globally.</p>

A concerned driver had called in the sighting along the remote stretch of road.

The California Department of Transportation was subsequently notified to remove the bird.

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, openly defying a government ban in a significant rebuke to Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n. The event, which organizers called the largest in the country's history, proceeded despite a new law prohibiting gatherings that "promote" homosexuality to minors, which carried the risk of heavy fines for attendees. The massive turnout was seen as a blow to Orb√°n's prestige amid slumping poll numbers. Participants and EU officials who joined the march framed it as a defense of not only LGBTQ+ rights but also broader democratic freedoms in Hungary.</p>
