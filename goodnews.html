          <h2>Study Links Dog Owner's Work Stress to Anxiety in Their Pets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 22:10:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study in Scientific Reports reveals a correlation between dog owners who dwell on work stress and increased stress-related behaviors in their dogs. Researchers surveyed 85 working dog owners, measuring job stress and rumination, and found that dogs of more stressed owners exhibited more whining, pacing, and restlessness. The connection was attributed to "crossover," where stress spills over from one person to another, and emotional contagion, where dogs pick up on human feelings through subtle cues. The article suggests that employed dog owners might benefit from avoiding work-related ruminations at home to protect their pets' well-being.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto delivered a crucial two-run double in the fourth inning, leading the New York Mets to a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. After Dodgers pitcher Tony Gonsolin struggled with command, issuing consecutive walks to load the bases, Soto capitalized with a decisive hit. Gonsolin's performance was critical for the Dodgers, whose bullpen was already strained after a lengthy extra-innings game the previous night. Mets starter David Peterson pitched effectively, allowing only two runs in 7 ‚Öî innings, contributing to the team's win.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to improve working conditions for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions due to increasing competition for talent, as Japanese cuisine gains popularity worldwide. The new scheme, slated to start in January, will pay chefs more than 6 million yen ($41,000) annually, an increase from the current average of around 4 to 4.5 million yen. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the significant role of chefs in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food proactively. The government hopes the improved conditions will attract and retain skilled chefs.</p>
