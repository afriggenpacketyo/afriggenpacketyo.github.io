          <h2>Rory McIlroy Encounters Bizarre Moment at The Open, Unearthing a Buried Golf Ball With Swing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 15:24:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the third round of The Open, golfer Rory McIlroy experienced a bizarre moment when his swing on the 11th hole unearthed a second, hidden golf ball. After hitting his own ball from the rough, another ball, which had been buried unseen beneath his, popped into the air and landed near his feet. McIlroy, visibly surprised, picked up the unexpected ball and later described the incident as "the most weird, ridiculous thing" he had ever seen on the course. Despite the strange occurrence and a bogey on that hole, he finished the round strong.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler established a commanding four-shot lead heading into the final round of The Open at Royal Portrush. Scheffler played a solid, bogey-free third round of 67, highlighted by an eagle, putting him in a strong position to claim his first Open Championship title. While other contenders like Rory McIlroy showed early flashes of brilliance, none could consistently keep pace with Scheffler's steady performance. A victory would mark the third leg of the career Grand Slam for the dominant American golfer.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 15:07:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly nearing a move to Barcelona, a transfer that raises questions given his recent struggles at his home club. After falling out of favor with manager Ruben Amorim and spending time on loan at Aston Villa, Rashford's departure from Old Trafford seems imminent. For Barcelona, the move is seen as a way to strengthen their attack after failing to sign other targets, with the initial deal likely being a loan with an option to buy. The Spanish club is betting that a change of scenery could help the 27-year-old English international rediscover his top form.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a 27-19 victory over Australia in their series opener, but the performance left much to be desired. After a dominant first 50 minutes where they built a commanding 24-5 lead, the Lions' intensity dropped off significantly as they brought on replacements. This allowed a lackluster Australian side to score late tries, making the final score look more competitive than the match truly was. Analysts noted that while a win is a win, the flat finish and lack of atmosphere in the second half were disappointing for a much-anticipated Lions Test match.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a knee injury much faster than initially anticipated. Muncy, who suffered a bone bruise after a collision at third base on July 2, has already resumed running, throwing, and swinging a bat. Doctors told him he was incredibly lucky to have avoided a more severe, season-ending injury, as the timing of the impact was a millisecond away from causing major ligament damage. His quicker-than-expected return is welcome news for the Dodgers, whose offense has struggled significantly in his absence.</p>

          <p>Twenty-eight years after the event, Great Britain's 1997 men's 4x400m world championship relay team has finally received their gold medals. The ceremony took place at the London Diamond League meeting, where the athletes were celebrated by a large home crowd. The British team was upgraded from silver after the winning US team was disqualified due to a doping admission from team member Antonio Pettigrew in 2008. The presentation marked the end of a long, laborious process to reallocate the medals and recognize the British athletes' rightful victory.</p>

          <p>A combination of strong corporate earnings and moderating inflation data helped the S&P 500 achieve a positive week, despite some market jitters over potential new tariffs. Key economic reports, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), showed inflation trending in the right direction, reinforcing the market's belief that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates later this year. Early earnings reports from major companies like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, while initially met with mixed reactions, ultimately demonstrated corporate resilience, suggesting investors should not judge a quarter's performance too quickly.
