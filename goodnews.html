          <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar responded to Kamala Harris's loss to Donald Trump by urging the Democratic party to not rule out female candidates in 2028. Klobuchar referenced Angela Merkel as an example of a woman running a country well. The article also mentions Joe Biden's comments on Harris's loss, where he suggested sexism played a role. Klobuchar suggests that the party would have been better served by a primary election, and that the focus should be on helping the American people, not looking backwards.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion article argues that a thriving American Dream relies on strong public services like schools, hospitals, and fire departments, not just tax cuts and tariffs. The article contends that underfunding these institutions undermines the workforce and hinders manufacturing growth. It criticizes proposed federal budget cuts to K-12 education and student mental health services, advocating for reinvestment in public services to build a 21st-century workforce. The author uses their mother's experience as a NICU nurse to illustrate the importance of public servants in building communities and ensuring stability.</p>

The move comes as the PKK has been hit hard by the Turkish military in recent years, and President Erdogan needs the support of pro-Kurdish political parties if he is to be able to run again in Turkey's next presidential election.</p>

The PKK began as a secessionist group but has recently sought greater rights for Kurds inside Turkey.

          <p>Rory McIlroy is the favorite to win the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow, a course he loves and where he has posted his most recent wins in 2021 and 2024. The course will be set up tougher than usual, but McIlroy's confidence is high, and he is unburdened by ending his 11-year wait for a fifth major. Weather forecasts predict a soft golf course, which suits McIlroy and his booming driver just fine.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay describes a student-led movement in Serbia combating an entrenched and powerful autocratic government. The movement, sparked by a train station collapse that killed 16 people, has grown into the largest and most extensive protest yet, reaching deep into Serbian society. The government has tried to defang the protests, but the movement continues, with students organizing demonstrations and raising international awareness of the struggle.</p>

          <p>Shipping companies will need to adapt to whatever trading barriers remain after global trade powers negotiate their way out of the trade war, according to the head of the International Chamber of Shipping. The chamber strongly believes in free trade as the best way to increase prosperity for all. The comments came ahead of a meeting with members of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, after the US in recent weeks imposed tariffs on global imports and proposed fees that would target Chinese vessels.</p>
