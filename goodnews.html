          <p>The FDA will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and high-risk individuals but will require vaccine makers to conduct clinical trials before approving them for broader use. This decision, outlined by FDA officials in The New England Journal of Medicine, aims to balance access for vulnerable populations with the need for more evidence for the general population. Vaccine manufacturers are urged to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials for healthy individuals between 6 months and 64 years old. Dr. C√©line Gounder notes that this change may limit booster access for those under 65, while Pfizer and Moderna have expressed commitment to working with the FDA.</p>
