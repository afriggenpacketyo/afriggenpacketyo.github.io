          <p>E-cigarettes, initially designed to help smokers quit by delivering nicotine without harmful chemicals, have introduced a new set of health concerns, especially among young people who never smoked. While e-cigarettes have contributed to a decline in lung cancer rates, a significant number of teens are now vaping, ingesting nicotine in potentially damaging quantities, leading to addiction and possible long-term health risks. The debate continues among experts on whether vaping is a net improvement overall, with some advocating for stricter regulations and others emphasizing harm reduction strategies to convince smokers to switch to e-cigarettes while minimizing new users. Given the uncertainty and varying regulations, vaping presents a genuine public health conundrum, and further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects. The article examines the benefits and drawbacks of e-cigarettes, concluding that smokers may benefit from switching to e-cigarettes, but non-smokers should avoid vaping.</p>
