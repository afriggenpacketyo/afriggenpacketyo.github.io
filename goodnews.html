          <p>The White House announced on Sunday that a trade deal with China has been struck after two days of talks in Geneva. The announcement comes after US treasury secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that there had been ‚Äúsubstantial progress‚Äù in talks between his team and that of the Chinese vice-premier, He Lifeng, in Geneva on defusing the trade war. The US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, suggested more strongly that a deal had been reached. The article notes that Trump's rhetoric, that China needs to be ‚Äúopened‚Äù to US business seemed to ignore a half century of trade between the two nations since one of his political heroes, Richard Nixon, visited China in 1972.</p>

The Trump administration has accused China of unfairly subsidizing key sectors of its economy and flooding the world with cheap goods.
