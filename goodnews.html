        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba and JD.com experienced a surge in sales during the 618 shopping festival, driven by a government subsidy program. Sales of consumer electronics and home appliances on Alibaba's platforms jumped by 283% during the initial checkout period compared to last year's Singles' Day campaign. JD.com reported a 380% year-on-year increase in home appliance and electronics sales in the first hour of its 618 campaign. The subsidy program allows consumers to receive rebates of up to 2,000 yuan per item, reflecting improved domestic retail spending. Optimism for consumer spending is moderate given the government support, but the long-term impact remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is pushing back against allegations linking him and his wife, Casey DeSantis, to $10 million given to the Hope Florida Foundation after a settlement with a healthcare provider. DeSantis's office claims the allegations are politically motivated and likens them to attacks on President Trump. The funds were part of a settlement with Centene, a medical insurance provider, and were later dispersed to organizations including Keep Florida Clean, a PAC that previously targeted a marijuana legalization amendment. A senior official from DeSantis's office clarified that the Hope Florida Foundation is a separate entity from Casey DeSantis's Hope Florida initiative. The controversy has potential implications for the upcoming governor's race. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The traditional midlife crisis, often associated with buying sports cars and abandoning family life, doesn't resonate with millennials who are now entering their 40s. This generation, shaped by economic instability and a focus on mental health, is more likely to seek personal growth and new opportunities rather than engage in self-destructive behavior. Many millennials are grappling with the reality that they may not achieve the same level of stability as previous generations, leading to feelings of wistfulness and uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted many to reevaluate their careers and priorities, seeking more fulfilling and meaningful paths. The article emphasizes the need to deconstruct traditional ideas about midlife crises.</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, following the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. An electoral win for Lee would set him up as the country's next leader and determine the trajectory of South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S., and policies on China and North Korea. Despite facing charges for breaching election laws, Lee held a sizable lead in opinion polling ahead of the election. Analysts suggest that Lee is likely to pursue a more left-leaning agenda, focusing on economic revival and tariff negotiations with the U.S. The election's outcome is expected to influence South Korea's economic and foreign policies.</p>

          <p>Germany's Constitutional Court has rejected a challenge by the populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) to the results of February's parliamentary elections. The BSW narrowly missed the 5% threshold required for representation in the Bundestag, arguing that its ballot placement and the failure to conduct a recount violated its right to equal opportunity. The court found that the party did not sufficiently substantiate the possibility of a violation of its rights. Had the BSW overcome the 5% hurdle, the new coalition government would not have had a majority. The decision reinforces the stability of the current government.</p>

Former world number four Greg Rusedski believes Draper is on the cusp of success but needs consistent health to rise in the rankings. Sinner and Alcaraz have been consistently healthy, allowing them to steadily improve. Draper's missed opportunity to face Sinner in the quarter-finals serves as a reminder of the challenges he faces in Grand Slam tournaments.</p>
