        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government, led by Prime Minister Starmer, is beginning discussions to establish overseas "return hubs" for asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected and have no further appeal options in the UK. This initiative, announced during Starmer's visit to Albania, aims to process asylum seekers abroad after their claims are denied in the UK. While the government has not disclosed which countries are involved in the talks, previous reports suggest a focus on the western Balkans. Starmer emphasized that these return hubs are not a singular solution but part of a broader strategy to combat organized crime and illegal immigration, particularly to stop small boats crossing the English Channel.</p>

          <p>China has launched the first satellites for its Three-Body Computing Constellation, a project to create a supercomputer in orbit. The constellation, developed by Zhejiang Lab, aims to provide real-time data processing with a computing capacity of 1,000 peta operations per second. This space-based system could rival the most powerful ground-based supercomputers. Space historian Jonathan McDowell notes the growing trend of cloud computing in space, highlighting the potential for orbital data centers to use solar power and efficiently radiate heat, reducing energy needs and carbon footprints.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's shares experienced a drop following the release of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, which fell short of expectations for both revenue and net income. Despite a 7% year-on-year revenue increase, investors were hoping that investments in artificial intelligence and the core e-commerce business would drive stronger results. The company is navigating macroeconomic uncertainties, including the trade war between Washington and Beijing, which has impacted consumer sentiment in China. Alibaba is also facing intense competition in the Chinese e-commerce market, leading to a price war with rivals.</p>

          <p>While overall inflation has cooled, certain everyday items like coffee and beef continue to see rapidly rising prices. Coffee prices have soared due to droughts in major coffee-producing regions, while beef prices have increased due to a shortage stemming from drought conditions in 2022. Car repair costs are also on the rise, driven by the increasing complexity of modern vehicles and a shortage of skilled technicians. These trends highlight that even in a period of cooling inflation, specific sectors can experience significant price increases, impacting consumers differently based on their spending habits.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline due to growing expectations of a potential nuclear deal between the U.S. and Iran. President Trump's comments in Doha suggested progress in negotiations with Iran, raising the prospect of lifting economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran's commitment to halt uranium enrichment. Analysts anticipate that a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal could significantly impact oil markets, potentially increasing crude oil exports by as much as one million barrels per day.

          <p>Roger Q. Mason's "Califas Trilogy" explores the erosion of dreams and the possibility of repair amidst ruins in Los Angeles. The trilogy includes "California Story," which examines the cost of ambition through the story of P√≠o Pico, and "Hide and Hide," a neo-noir about a Filipina immigrant and a queer Texan youth evading law enforcement. The third play, "Juana Maria," portrays the final months of an Indigenous woman brought to the Santa Barbara Mission. Mason uses shimmering poetry and creative casting to express taboos and blur boundaries between oppressed and oppressors.</p>

          <p>The article explores the unique spiritual centers of Los Angeles, noting that they often hold imperfect pasts and urban realities that mirror the city itself. It examines the Self-Realization Fellowship Hollywood Temple, the Peace Awareness Labyrinth and Gardens, and the Philosophical Research Society, highlighting their distinct teachings and architectural styles. The author reflects on the duality of L.A., where darkness and light coexist, and the way these spiritual spaces offer a sense of peace and reflection amidst the city's chaos.</p>
