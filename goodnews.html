          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte as the administration develops a plan to sell weapons to European allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine. This strategy aims to expedite military support for Kyiv by moving equipment already in Europe, such as from Germany, rather than waiting for new production from the U.S. The meeting comes as the White House faces bipartisan pressure to approve legislation imposing heavy sanctions on Russia's economy and its international partners. Lawmakers are advocating for a bill that would grant the president authority to impose up to 500% tariffs on countries aiding Russia's war effort.</p>

          <p>Pro-wrestling veteran Dustin Rhodes, at 56 years old, won the AEW TNT Championship in a four-way match at the All In: Texas event. The title was vacated just hours before the show due to health issues concerning the previous champion, Adam Cole. Rhodes, who was one of the first wrestlers to join the All Elite Wrestling promotion in 2019, secured his first-ever championship with the company in an emotional victory. The win makes him a triple champion, as he also currently holds the ROH World Tag Team and ROH World Six-Man championships. This marks a significant milestone in his long career spanning multiple major wrestling promotions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Belgian cyclist Tim Merlier won the ninth stage of the Tour de France, claiming his second victory in this year's race. The stage concluded in a dramatic sprint finish after a nearly successful breakaway attempt by Mathieu van der Poel, who was caught just one kilometer from the end. Van der Poel's audacious two-man attack from the start of the 174.1km stage provided significant excitement to what is often a predictable flat stage. Despite the thrilling finish, there were no major changes in the overall standings, with Tadej Pogacar retaining the yellow jersey, 54 seconds ahead of his closest rival, Remco Evenepoel.</p>

          <p>A new report has identified robotics firm Teradyne as a key supplier for Amazon's advanced 'Vulcan' robot, which the e-commerce giant says has a "sense of touch." The robot's limbs are produced by Universal Robots, a company Teradyne acquired in 2015. Following the report from Hunterbrook and Citrini Research, Teradyne's stock surged over 6%. This development is seen as a potential turning point for Teradyne's industrial automation business, validating its strategy of engaging directly with large original equipment manufacturers like Amazon. The news comes as Teradyne navigates a challenging economic environment and uncertainty related to the Trump administration's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" film debuted with a strong $122 million at the domestic box office, providing a much-needed success for Warner Bros.' DC Studios. The opening marks a critical launch for the rebooted DC cinematic universe under the leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran. Globally, the film earned $217 million. While the domestic performance was robust, some analysts noted its overseas earnings of $95 million were slightly soft, potentially due to the character's strong American identity in a complex global political climate. The film, which cost an estimated $225 million to produce, received largely positive reviews from both critics and audiences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FIFA has reached an agreement with the global players' union, Fifpro, to introduce mandatory rest periods to protect professional soccer players from injury and burnout. The consensus includes ensuring a 72-hour gap between matches and a minimum three-week rest period at the end of each season. This agreement is a significant step in addressing player welfare concerns, which have been amplified by the expansion of competitions like the 32-team Club World Cup. While Fifpro views this as a positive first step, the union is still pursuing legal action against FIFA over what it calls an over-congested fixture calendar.</p>

          <p>This article highlights numerous abandoned locations around the world that have been transformed into unique and popular tourist destinations. From the Maunsell Sea Forts in England, built for World War II, to the sand-filled ghost town of Kolmanskop in Namibia, these sites offer a fascinating glimpse into the past. Other examples include a former Soviet prison in Estonia that is now a beach and diving spot, and a replica of Paris in China, Tianducheng, which attracts tourists despite being largely uninhabited. These places, once left to decay, now draw thousands of visitors annually, showcasing the allure of history, ruin, and reclamation.</p>

          <p>This article details how retired patent attorney Barbara Rae-Venter used her hobby of genetic genealogy to help law enforcement identify and capture the Golden State Killer. The technique involves using DNA from a crime scene, uploading it to public genealogy databases, and building family trees to find a suspect. This method has since been used to solve dozens of cold cases, including identifying a living Jane Doe who was kidnapped as a child and tracking down a man who committed a sexual assault in Ohio decades earlier. While the practice has raised privacy concerns, law enforcement agencies see it as a powerful tool for bringing long-sought criminals to justice.</p>

          <p>A year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is showcasing enhanced security protocols. The agency has implemented new technologies, including a fleet of military-grade drones and mobile command posts, to improve aerial reconnaissance and inter-agency communication. These changes directly address critical failures from the 2024 event, where a commercial drone went undetected and communication between the Secret Service and local police was fragmented. The new mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, allow for direct radio contact with local law enforcement, a capability that was absent during the Butler rally.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has pledged that the government will take steps to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers. While she did not confirm reports of a new subsidy program, she stated that an announcement on affordability is forthcoming later in the week. The government has confirmed a £25 million package to help install charging gullies for homes without driveways and £63 million for broader charging infrastructure. The move addresses the high upfront cost of EVs, a major barrier to adoption, as the country moves toward its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. The opposition criticized the plan as forcing families into expensive cars prematurely.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Beijing policy adviser, has argued that Chinese think tanks must develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power. He stated that these organizations should become more "self-centred" and focus on China's unique practical experiences rather than relying on Western academic frameworks. According to Zheng, this approach is necessary to properly explain China's practices to the world and accurately predict its future development. He contrasted this with university research, which he believes is often stuck in Western theories and less focused on the practicalities of Chinese public policy formation and implementation.</p>
