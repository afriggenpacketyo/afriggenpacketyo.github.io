        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A head-to-head trial comparing the weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy found that Mounjaro led to a greater weight reduction than Wegovy. The trial involved 750 obese individuals and showed that those on Mounjaro experienced a 20% weight reduction compared to the 14% reduction seen with Wegovy after 72 weeks. Researchers indicated that both drugs have a role in weight management, but Mounjaro may be more effective for individuals with more weight to lose. Both medications work by mimicking hormones that make you feel full, but Mounjaro flips two appetite switches in the brain while Wegovy flips one.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the nomination of Jeanine Pirro to replace Edward Martin as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, following the collapse of Martin's nomination. Martin, a "Stop the Steal" advocate, faced criticism for his political activism and controversial social media posts. Pirro's selection has elicited mixed reactions, with some expressing concerns about her provocative TV pronouncements, while others see her prosecutorial experience as a positive attribute. Martin will instead be assigned to a Justice Department task force and will serve as a pardon attorney. The U.S. Attorney for Washington D.C. has a unique portfolio, including federal corruption cases, high-profile defendants and a large set of local criminal prosecutions in the D.C.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed reservations about cutting the consumption tax to combat inflation, citing concerns about the potential strain on state finances. This comes as the government considers an economic package ahead of the House of Councillors election. Senior officials have generally dismissed a consumption tax cut as a viable option. The prime minister wants to avoid a serious drain on state coffers. The consumption tax is currently at 8 percent for food and beverages and 10 percent for other items.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in October 2012 and taken to South Korea, was returned to a Japanese temple on Monday. This event ended a dispute that had strained bilateral relations, according to a source close to the matter. The statue of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima, was handed over in South Korea to representatives of the Japanese temple on Saturday. The artifact is designated as a cultural asset by the prefecture. In 2023, South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, and the return procedures were completed in January.</p>

Mexico's Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegu√© said on social media that he had spoken with Secretary Brooke Rollins, who had informed of the decision. The U.S. restricted Mexican cattle shipments in late November following the detection of the pest but lifted the ban in February after protocols were put in place to evaluate the animals prior to entry into the country.</p>

          <p>The White House announced a "trade deal" with China without providing specifics, after Trump administration officials spent the weekend negotiating with their Chinese counterparts. While details of the deal are still unclear, any de-escalation in the ongoing trade war could bring much-needed relief to a global economy that has been roiled since President Donald Trump's April 2 tariff announcement. China said that it will release a joint statement with the U.S. on Monday regarding the agreement reached on Sunday.</p>
