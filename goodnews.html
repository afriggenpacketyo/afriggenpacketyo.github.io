          <p>Legendary musician Billy Joel recently shared an update on his health after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus, a condition involving fluid buildup in the brain. Speaking on a podcast, the 76-year-old singer described one of the primary symptoms as poor balance, comparing the sensation to "being on a boat." While he noted the condition is still being treated and is not yet fixed, he reassured fans that he feels good and that the "brain disorder" sounds more severe than his current experience. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a treatable condition that typically affects older adults, though its cause is often unknown.</p>

          <p>Credit card startup Imprint has successfully secured a deal to launch a new co-branded card with online shopping platform Rakuten, outcompeting larger, established banks. The five-year-old company, which also recently raised $70 million in new capital to boost its valuation to $900 million, is gaining significant traction in the competitive co-branded card industry. Imprint's strategy focuses on providing a seamless digital experience and transparent fee structures, partnering with smaller banks to issue cards on major networks like American Express. This partnership marks a significant win for the startup, positioning it as a serious challenger to financial giants like Synchrony and Citigroup.</p>

          <h2>Wreckage of WWII Destroyer USS DeHaven Reveals Intact Torpedoes and Bell</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 10:53:49 EDT</div>

          <p>An expedition exploring World War II shipwrecks has discovered new artifacts from the USS DeHaven, an American destroyer sunk off the Solomon Islands in 1943. Using remotely operated vehicles, the Ocean Exploration Trust captured high-resolution footage showing that the ship's torpedoes and bell remain largely intact on the seabed. The DeHaven sank after being bombed by Japanese aircraft, resulting in the loss of 167 crew members. This survey of the wreckage in the historic Iron Bottom Sound provides valuable data for historians and maritime heritage managers, shedding more light on the pivotal naval battles of the Guadalcanal campaign.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that the current 90-day suspension of heavy tariffs between the United States and China will likely be extended. The current truce, which paused a significant trade war, is set to expire on August 12. Bessent stated that an extension would be worked out during upcoming talks in Stockholm, Sweden, and expressed that trade relations with China are in a "very good place." Beyond tariffs, the U.S. hopes to discuss other issues, including China's manufacturing glut and its economic support for Russia and Iran, suggesting a move toward more constructive, multi-level engagement.

          <p>Major food and beverage companies, including General Mills, PepsiCo, and Kraft Heinz, are increasingly focusing on high-protein products to meet surging consumer demand. This trend is fueled by fitness culture, social media influencers, and growing interest from users of new medical weight-loss drugs. Companies are both launching new protein-fortified product lines and rebranding existing items to highlight their protein content. For example, General Mills' protein cereals generated over $100 million in sales last year, while new players like Protein Pints ice cream are seeing explosive growth, demonstrating the powerful market appeal of protein-centric foods across various categories.</p>

          <p>The Coca-Cola Company has announced plans to launch a version of its classic soda made with cane sugar in the United States later this year. This move follows a social media post from President Donald Trump claiming he had convinced the company to make the switch from high-fructose corn syrup. Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey clarified that the new offering will complement the existing portfolio rather than replace it, describing it as an "and" strategy, not an "or" strategy. While health experts note there is little nutritional difference between the two sweeteners, the decision reflects consumer interest in differentiated product experiences.</p>

          <p>Police Scotland has addressed concerns from the police union regarding staffing levels for President Donald Trump's upcoming visit, asserting the force has "immense experience" in managing such large-scale events. The operation to police Trump's visit, which includes the opening of a new golf course, is described as the largest in Scotland since the death of Queen Elizabeth II. While the Scottish Police Federation raised concerns about officers being pressured to work longer hours, the assistant chief constable expressed confidence in the plan, which involves local, national, and UK-wide specialist support. The force is also preparing for significant protests expected during the visit.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The common advice to "just be yourself" is often counterproductive and incomplete, according to psychotherapist Britt Frank. In this article, she argues that humans have multiple, often conflicting, "selves" and that our behavior is heavily influenced by our nervous system's state, not a single authentic identity. Using authenticity as a justification for poor behavior can also damage relationships. Instead of striving for a raw, unfiltered self, Frank advocates for "self-leadership," which involves consciously choosing which parts of oneself to present in different situations. This approach promotes self-awareness, alignment with personal values, and taking responsibility for one's impact on others.</p>

          <p>Corporate spending on business travel is increasing but at a more moderate pace as companies remain cautious amid ongoing trade policy uncertainty.

While travel continues, businesses are being more strategic, prioritizing essential relationship-building meetings over large group events. Airline executives have noted that corporate travel demand is stable but not growing as strongly as initially expected, reflecting a broader "wait and see" approach from C-suite leaders managing economic pressures.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that while he believes the Federal Reserve should conduct an internal review of its non-monetary policy operations, he does not think Fed Chair Jerome Powell needs to resign. This statement contrasts with President Trump's repeated calls for Powell's departure. Bessent suggested that such a review, focusing on the Fed's expanded functions and costs like its building renovation, would be a positive legacy for Powell. He emphasized that monetary policy decisions should remain independent and insulated from political influence, while other aspects of the central bank's operations warrant oversight after years of growth.
