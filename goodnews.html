          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a major issue affecting ultra-high-speed ground travel, potentially rescuing vacuum-tube maglev technology. Researchers discovered that even small imperfections in the track could cause extreme discomfort for passengers traveling at 1,000km/h. However, they have developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, minimizing the severity of vibrations. The study used supercomputer simulations and prototype tests on China's full-scale test line to identify and address the issues.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship successfully reached orbit during its ninth test flight, but an apparent propellant leak caused a loss of attitude control, leading to an uncontrolled reentry and likely disintegration over the Indian Ocean. The company stated that it would continue to review data and improve Starship's reliability for future missions. Despite the failure to complete the mission, the launch demonstrated the vehicle's ability to reach orbit, marking progress in SpaceX's development of a fully reusable spacecraft for interplanetary travel. The craft had to be cleared from the landing zone for public safety.</p>

The 24-year-old wrestler from Ishikawa Prefecture becomes the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since his stablemaster Nishonoseki in 2017. Onosato secured his promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, meeting the requirement of consecutive championships as an ozeki. He is the first wrestler to reach yokozuna without a single losing record, marking another milestone in his rapid ascent in the sumo world. This will be his first time facing Hoshoryu as yokozuna at July's Nagoya meet.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will no longer advise routine COVID-19 shots for healthy children, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The decision is a departure from the previous recommendation of annual shots for everyone over 6 months old, citing a lack of data to support the need for shots in healthy children. While most children experience mild symptoms from COVID-19, some can become seriously ill or develop long COVID. The original vaccination course offered significant protection against serious illness, but the need for annual vaccines is more contentious, with debates over the duration of protection and the benefits for children with prior infections or vaccinations.</p>

The bill also aims to incentivize other states to establish their own versions of fire camps and expand occupational safety coverage for incarcerated firefighters. Currently, incarcerated firefighters make up around 30% of California's wildfire crews, earning significantly less than their non-incarcerated counterparts.</p>
