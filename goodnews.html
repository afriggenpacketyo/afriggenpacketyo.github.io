          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, renowned tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou reflects on his successful partnership with Serena Williams, attributing it to mutual trust and his ability to motivate her. He addresses Williams' recent promotion of a weight-loss drug, confirming they had disagreements about her weight post-pregnancy, which he viewed as critical for her performance and injury prevention. Mouratoglou also discusses the end of his coaching relationship with Naomi Osaka, suggesting the pressure of his legacy with Williams may have been a factor. He concludes by analyzing the dominance of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner in men's tennis.</p>

          <p>This article offers practical financial advice for college students navigating new responsibilities like student loans, credit cards, and shared expenses. Financial educator Yanely Espinal recommends that students' total loan debt upon graduation should not exceed their expected first-year salary. She also advocates for "loud budgeting"—openly discussing financial struggles with peers—and creating formal roommate agreements for shared costs. Other tips include continuing to apply for scholarships while in school and making small interest payments on loans before graduation to save money in the long run. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Male Tarantulas Embark on Annual Mating Trek Across Colorado</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Each autumn, from mid-September to mid-October, male brown tarantulas in Colorado leave their burrows in search of mates. This perilous journey sees the spiders, having reached sexual maturity, face predators, traffic, and potential rejection or consumption by the females they court. Females, who can live up to 30 years, remain in their burrows their entire lives. Scientists note that while much is known about this annual event, basic questions about the tarantulas' navigation and triggers for the trek remain a mystery, highlighting gaps in the understanding of these common arachnids.</p>

          <p>Emily Thornberry has pulled out of the race to become Labour's deputy leader, leaving four candidates remaining. Thornberry, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, failed to secure the 80 nominations from MPs required to advance to the next stage of the contest. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is currently the frontrunner with significant backing from parliamentary colleagues. The contest, which will conclude in late October, is viewed by some as a potential outlet for party members to express discontent with Sir Keir Starmer's leadership a year into his premiership.</p>

          <p>Official statistics from Germany show a significant drop in the number of asylum-seekers receiving welfare payments, decreasing by 10% from late 2023 to late 2024. This reduction corresponds with a general fall in asylum applications, with Germany now ranking third in the EU for new applications, behind France and Spain. This marks the first time in over a decade that Germany is not the top destination for asylum seekers in the bloc. The majority of current welfare recipients are from Turkey, Syria, and Afghanistan, with Turkish nationals now forming the largest group.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from Morgan Stanley, interest from U.S. investors in Chinese stocks has reached its highest point in five years, signaling a potential shift after a multi-year retreat. The bank found that over 90% of investors surveyed expressed a willingness to increase their exposure to China's market, with particular interest in sectors like robotics, biotech, and new consumer companies. This renewed interest is attributed to China's sector leadership, efforts to stabilize its economy, and a growing demand for diversification away from U.S. assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Colorado Rockies 9-0, completing a series sweep and extending their NL West lead to three games. Mookie Betts led the offense with a four-hit, five-RBI performance, including a grand slam, while pitcher Blake Snell delivered a scoreless six-inning, 11-strikeout start. However, the victory was tempered by an injury concern for catcher Will Smith, who was a late scratch from the lineup due to swelling in his hand. The team's health remains a persistent issue as they approach the final stretch of the season with 16 games remaining.</p>

          <p>After winning Olympic gold in Paris, British 800m runner Keely Hodgkinson endured the most challenging year of her career, suffering two separate hamstring tears that sidelined her for 376 days. Despite the frustration, the 23-year-old says the experience has taught her about her own strength and has not diminished her ambition. She made an explosive return to competition in August, running the fastest time of the year and re-establishing herself as a top contender. Now, Hodgkinson is aiming for her first World Championship gold in Tokyo, viewing any success as a bonus after fearing she would miss the event entirely.</p>
