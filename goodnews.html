          <p>A CBS News feature delves into the enduring legacy of folk singer Woody Guthrie and his iconic anthem, "This Land Is Your Land." The segment explores how the song, crafted as a response to "God Bless America," has become a powerful symbol of the nation's promise of inclusivity and equality for all its citizens. The report includes insights from Guthrie's daughter, Nora, who recounts discovering the original, more political, handwritten lyrics.

          <p>This article examines the rising popularity of ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response), the tingling sensation some people experience from specific auditory or visual triggers. It profiles Maria Viktorovna, known as the "ASMR queen," whose "Gentle Whispering" videos have amassed a huge following, and speaks with physiology professor Craig Richard about the physical effects of the phenomenon. The report describes ASMR as a "brain massage" and explores its transition from an internet curiosity to a mainstream wellness practice, even leading to the creation of dedicated ASMR spas. The piece provides context on why these gentle sounds are making so much noise in popular culture.</p>

          <p>Following his recent passing at the age of 97, this article pays tribute to Apollo astronaut Jim Lovell, a pivotal figure in American space exploration. It highlights his remarkable career, including his role as commander of the perilous Apollo 13 mission, famously turning a near-catastrophe into a successful recovery. The piece also revisits a 2018 interview where Lovell and his Apollo 8 crewmates recounted their historic 1968 mission, during which they became the first humans to orbit the Moon. Their Christmas Eve broadcast and the iconic "Earthrise" photograph they captured are remembered as unifying moments for humanity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Humorist David Sedaris offers a witty commentary on the evolving and often confusing nature of tipping, particularly with the rise of digital payment screens. He recounts a personal experience at an airport breakfast spot where he was prompted to tip 22% for minimal service, sparking an internal debate about the value of labor and social obligation. Sedaris humorously contrasts this with the physical effort of carrying a heavy bag of cat litter, questioning the logic behind pre-programmed gratuities for tasks he largely performs himself. The piece weaves in reflections on immigrant labor and personal guilt, capturing the awkward and complicated emotions many face in everyday transactions.</p>

          <p>Marking its 75th anniversary, Billy Wilder's 1950 noir masterpiece "Sunset Boulevard" is being celebrated for its enduring influence and sharp critique of Hollywood. The article reflects on the film's iconic performances by Gloria Swanson and William Holden and its daring themes of ageism and obsession, which were controversial at the time. It also covers the film's successful transition to the stage as an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, recently revived with a Tony-winning performance by Nicole Scherzinger. Through interviews with original cast member Nancy Olson and modern star Scherzinger, the piece explores why the story of a faded star's tragic comeback attempt continues to resonate with audiences today.</p>

Chan, a self-described introvert, explains that a personal brand allows individuals to shape the narrative about their skills and talents, preventing them from being underestimated. She suggests that introverts can start small, such as sending one networking email a month or posting one professional update a week, to build confidence and visibility. The article emphasizes that a brand isn't just an online presence but is also built through offline activities and interests, which can lead to unexpected career opportunities.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Electric Spark: The Enigma of Dame Muriel," examines the life of the renowned British novelist, focusing on the deep religious underpinnings of her famously witty and acerbic work. The article explains that Spark, a Catholic convert, used narrative structure and authorial omniscience to explore theological themes, particularly the relationship between an all-knowing God and flawed humanity. Her work was heavily influenced by the Book of Job and her own experiences, including a nervous breakdown and working in British psychological warfare during WWII. The review highlights how Spark's fiction often blurred the lines between the mundane and the supernatural, making her one of modern literature's most important religious writers.</p>

          <p>This article suggests that Target stock, despite being down significantly from its peak due to reduced consumer discretionary spending, may present a long-term opportunity for investors. It highlights the retailer's strong digital sales growth, particularly in same-day services, as a positive sign of underlying customer loyalty and operational strength. As a "Dividend King" that has consistently raised its dividend for over 50 years, the stock's current low price offers a high yield. The analysis posits that the company is well-positioned to rebound and reward patient investors once broader economic conditions for discretionary spending improve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Ohio couple, Jason and Katie Lee, saved $60,000 over five years to quit their jobs and move with their young son to Taipei, Taiwan, for a 13-month sabbatical. The primary motivation was to allow their son to bond with his paternal grandparents and for the family to immerse themselves in Taiwanese culture without work pressures. During the break, Jason focused on his mental and physical health and re-evaluated his career goals, realizing his family could be happier with less income and more flexibility. The transformative experience, which also included the birth of their second child, has led them to reconsider their professional priorities upon their return to the U.S.</p>

Experts note that while AI empowers bad actors, it is also essential for defense, helping to filter noise and identify genuine threats more efficiently.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," is a dark, historical tale set in 18th-century England about five enigmatic sisters accused of witchcraft. The book review explains that the story directly engages with the historical trope of femininity being perceived as a menace, as the villagers become convinced the sisters can transform into dogs. Told from the perspective of outsiders, the novel explores why female bodies and sisterly bonds are often seen as conduits for unnatural forces. While the reviewer finds some of the feminist commentary predictable, they praise the novel's lush, violent prose and its compelling, if unsettling, exploration of how fear can curdle into persecution.</p>

          <p>Devastating floods in Texas Hill Country that washed away homes and debris have also revealed a significant prehistoric discovery: a set of 110-million-year-old dinosaur tracks. A volunteer assisting with cleanup efforts found 15 large, three-clawed footprints in the Sandy Creek area of Travis County. Paleontologists from the University of Texas at Austin have identified the tracks as belonging to a large bipedal carnivore similar to an Acrocanthosaurus. The floodwaters eroded layers of dirt and gravel that had concealed the footprints in the Glen Rose Formation limestone, offering a rare glimpse into the region's ancient past amidst a modern disaster.</p>

          <p>In 2025, 19 U.S. states are offering temporary sales tax holidays, waiving taxes on specific categories of goods like back-to-school supplies, clothing, and disaster preparedness items. While politically popular, tax experts note the benefits can be limited, as consumers often just shift the timing of planned purchases rather than boosting overall economic activity. Research also suggests that wealthier taxpayers, who have more flexibility in their spending, may benefit most. However, many middle and lower-income families strategically plan for these events to save on major expenses, especially as rising costs and potential tariffs put a strain on household budgets.</p>

Further investigation revealed the ship was originally the HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy ship built in 1749 that was deployed by the British during the American Revolution. After its naval service, it was sold and repurposed as a whaling ship before sinking in the North Sea in 1788, with all 56 crew members surviving.</p>

          <p>This article explores the concept of negativity bias, the human evolutionary trait that makes us more attuned to threats and bad news than to positive developments. This psychological quirk, combined with the media's tendency to function as a watchdog focused on problems, can create a skewed and overly pessimistic view of the world. The author argues that consciously seeking out stories of progress, such as falling murder rates or declining deaths from extreme weather, is not naive but necessary. Cultivating realistic optimism can provide the resilience and motivation needed to believe that large-scale problems are solvable and inspire action.</p>

The event was widely witnessed, with hundreds of people across Georgia and nearby states reporting a fireball and a loud boom.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains why the Airbus A340 was designed with four smaller engines instead of the two larger ones found on its sister aircraft, the A330. The primary reason was to appeal to airlines, particularly in Asia, that preferred the redundancy of four engines for long-haul flights over open oceans in an era before twin-engine jets had proven their modern reliability. However, as twin-engine aircraft received higher ETOPS ratings, allowing them to fly further from diversion airports, the need for four-engine jets diminished. The A340's higher operating and maintenance costs ultimately led to its decline in popularity, with very few remaining in passenger service today.</p>
