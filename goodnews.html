          <h2>Treasury Secretary Says Walmart Will Absorb Some Tariff Costs After Trump's Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 11:59:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that Walmart will "eat some of the tariffs" in response to President Trump's demands, claiming he received this assurance from Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon. This follows Walmart's earlier announcement that it would need to raise prices for consumers due to the impact of Trump's tariffs on international trade. Trump had criticized the company, insisting it should absorb the tariffs instead of passing the costs onto customers. Bessent indicated that Walmart is promising to absorb some of the tariffs, similar to what it did in previous years, while also acknowledging that the company had to present a worst-case scenario during its earnings call.</p>

          <p>Saturday Night Live concluded its 50th anniversary season with continued creative success, raising questions about the show's future. Despite ongoing speculation about cast departures, particularly Weekend Update hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che, no major announcements were made during the season finale. SNL remains a powerful brand in comedy, finishing as the top broadcast entertainment program among viewers aged 18 to 49, averaging 8.2 million viewers per week across all platforms, according to NBC. The show's ability to reinvent itself weekly remains a key strength, though following up on the hype of its 50th anniversary will be a challenge.</p>

She recounted feeling "very embarrassed" before the operation and struggling with the emotional impact of post-surgery care. Surgeons inserted titanium rods into her spine to correct the curvature, and she spent 10 days on her back afterward. Princess Eugenie credited her mother, Sarah Ferguson, for helping her view the post-surgery scar as a "badge of honor." She also emphasized the importance of showing "people your scars" and changing the way beauty is perceived.</p>

          <p>Nike is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Air Jordan, the most successful basketball shoe in history, which revolutionized the sneaker industry. Howard White, a Nike veteran and founding father of the Jordan Brand, recalled Nike's bold decision to bet on Michael Jordan, offering him $2.5 million to wear their shoes. The Air Jordan exceeded expectations, generating $126 million in sales in its first year. Jason Mayden, chief design officer for the Jordan Brand, stated that Jordan remains integral to the operation. Sean Williams, who runs a Brooklyn-based program dedicated to studying and collecting shoes, emphasized that Air Jordans are bigger than basketball, empowering people to believe in themselves.</p>

          <p>Hawaiian lei making, an ancient tradition introduced by early Polynesian settlers, is facing challenges due to suburban sprawl and climate change. The exquisite array of flowers used in leis is becoming scarcer, with an estimated 90 percent now imported from countries like Thailand. Andrew Mau, who owns a small Oahu boutique, noted the impact firsthand, with reduced flower stocks forcing lei-makers to adapt. He creates "forever leis" from wood beads, seeds, and shells as a response to the perishability of flowers. Meleana Estes, a Hawaiian native, emphasizes that a lei is an "expression of aloha" and a gesture of love.</p>

          <p>With the stock market recovering from its April lows, investing experts are advising investors to diversify their portfolios into international equities and other asset classes. David Schassler, VanEck head of multi-asset solutions, suggests diversifying internationally and into real assets like gold and bitcoin. While some investors embraced international diversification earlier in the year, many remain heavily tilted towards U.S. stocks. Experts caution that U.S. stock valuation remains a concern and that investors should be mindful of concentration within their U.S. stock holdings. China and India are also highlighted as potential areas for international diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent conceded that Walmart may pass along some of the costs from President Trump's tariffs to consumers through higher prices. Bessent said that he spoke with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, stressing in two news show interviews that what he thought really mattered for Walmart customers was the decline in gasoline prices. Gas is averaging roughly $3.18 a gallon, down from a year ago but also higher over the past week, according to AAA. Trump had previously warned Walmart to avoid raising prices. Walmart executives said that higher prices began to appear on their shelves in late April and accelerated this month.</p>
