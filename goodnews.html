          <h2>UK Campaigners Advocate for English-Language Ingredient Lists on Cosmetics to Protect Allergy Sufferers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 03:09:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Campaigners in the United Kingdom are urging for a change in cosmetic labeling regulations, advocating that ingredients be listed in English rather than the current standard of Latin or scientific names. This push is driven by concerns for individuals with severe allergies, such as nut allergies, who find it difficult to identify potential allergens from Latin terms. Supporters, including a Member of Parliament and affected families, argue that cosmetic products should adopt labeling standards similar to food packaging to prevent dangerous allergic reactions. The industry's trade association defends the Latin-based system, known as INCI, stating it provides a globally harmonized language for ingredients, but critics maintain it prioritizes industry convenience over consumer safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study indicates that China's large dams on the Brahmaputra River in Tibet may not cause the droughts feared by downstream nations like India, and could in fact increase water flow during dry seasons. The research, based on data collected since 2014 from two operational dams, shows that low-flow water levels in February rose by over 50%. This suggests that the dams' water regulation mechanisms are augmenting the river's volume during traditionally dry periods. The findings provide a new perspective on the controversial issue of China's mega-dam projects and their cross-border environmental impact.</p>

The strike, scheduled to begin on July 25, is the latest action in an ongoing dispute over pay. The BMA is demanding a clear plan to restore pay to 2008 levels in real terms, arguing that the government's current offer of a 5.4% increase is insufficient. While the government has stated it will not increase the pay offer, the talks indicate a potential willingness to negotiate on other aspects of working conditions.</p>

          <p>China's aerospace industry is experiencing a significant surge in private investment, positioning the country as a key player in the rapidly expanding global space economy, which is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035. This opinion article highlights how the space sector is no longer dominated by state-led missions, with private enterprises driving innovation in satellite launches and other technologies. Companies like i-Space and LandSpace have achieved major milestones, such as putting the first private Chinese rocket into orbit. This growth is fueled by technological advancements, lower costs, and strong state support for private commercial space ventures. (not investment advice)</p>
