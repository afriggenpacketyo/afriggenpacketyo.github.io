        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Zach Cregger's horror film 'Weapons' examines its narrative choices and thematic depth. The article praises the movie for providing clear answers to its central mystery, where a class of third-graders vanishes one night. It highlights how the film explores the fallacy of catharsis, suggesting that defeating the villain doesn't erase the underlying trauma and grief. The review commends the performances, particularly Amy Madigan's, and the film's ability to be both a satisfying and emotionally resonant horror masterpiece.</p>

          <p>Erin has strengthened into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasters predicting it could become a major hurricane. As of Friday, the Category 1 storm was located east of the Leeward Islands and is not expected to make a direct impact on the United States. Its forecast path shows a northward curve, keeping it away from the U.S. East Coast. Officials in the Caribbean have issued tropical storm watches, urging residents to monitor the storm's progress due to potential heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions.</p>

          <p>Former tennis champion Monica Seles has publicly shared her five-year struggle with myasthenia gravis, a rare and incurable autoimmune disease that causes muscle weakness. In partnership with an immunology company, she aims to raise awareness about the condition, which affects voluntary muscles and can cause symptoms ranging from double vision to difficulty breathing. A neurologist explains that while the disease can be serious, its symptoms often fluctuate and can be managed with modern treatments, allowing most patients to lead relatively normal lives.</p>

          <p>The health care sector emerged as the week's top performer in the stock market, buoyed by Berkshire Hathaway's new stake in UnitedHealth Group and insider buying at Eli Lilly. The broader S&P 500 was on track for a modest weekly gain, though value stocks outperformed momentum-based companies. In contrast, the technology, consumer staples, and utilities sectors all posted negative returns for the week. The article notes that upcoming earnings reports from major retailers and commentary from the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole symposium will be key events for investors (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airlines are finding the summer travel season more challenging as demand patterns shift and costs rise, leading to more strategic schedule adjustments in August. Travelers are booking earlier in the season or shifting Europe trips to the fall, while last-minute bookings have also become more common. In response to these unpredictable trends and an initial oversupply of capacity, carriers have been cutting flights. This reduction in capacity is expected to help stabilize fares but reflects a more complex and less predictably profitable third quarter for the industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The film "East of Wall" is reviewed as a worthy modern western that uses a docu-fiction approach to tell the story of a struggling ranch matriarch and her daughter in South Dakota. The article praises the film for its authentic portrayal of resilience, featuring first-time actors playing versions of themselves. While it may not reach the transcendent quality of similar films like "The Rider," the review highlights its lived-in warmth and compelling performances. The film effectively captures the beauty and severity of life on the plains for women forging their own path.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Reveals Trump's Claims of 'Out of Control' Crime in Washington D.C. are Misleading</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent statements about crime in Washington, D.C. finds his claims to be misleading. While D.C. did have a high homicide rate in 2023 compared to states, it was not the highest among major U.S. cities, and the rate has dropped significantly in 2024 and 2025. The article points out that Trump's justification for federalizing the city's police force omits the recent, substantial decrease in violent crime, a trend consistent with national statistics. Even the AI bot on Trump's own social media platform acknowledges the current downward trend in the city's crime rates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A seismic swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest being a magnitude 4.0, has occurred in the Geysers geothermal steam field in Northern California. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such small quakes are common in this area, which is one of the world's most productive geothermal power facilities. The seismic activity is believed to be induced by the operations of the power plant, which involves withdrawing steam and injecting reclaimed water into the hot rock. The USGS notes this activity is distinct from the region's major seismic hazards on faults like the San Andreas.</p>
