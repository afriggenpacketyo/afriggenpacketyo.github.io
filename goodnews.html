          <h2>Researchers Investigate Why Electric Vehicles May Induce More Motion Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique characteristics of EVs, such as rapid acceleration and regenerative braking systems, contribute to this issue. The regenerative braking, which converts kinetic energy back into battery power during deceleration, can cause low-frequency movements that are known to provoke queasiness. Researchers are exploring solutions to mitigate this effect and improve passenger comfort as the automotive industry continues its transition to new energy sources.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has voiced concerns that the expanded 32-team Club World Cup could "destroy" his team's 2025-26 season due to the demanding schedule. While preparing for a match against Al-Hilal, Guardiola admitted he tries not to think about the potential for player exhaustion to avoid anxiety. He acknowledged the arguments of other managers who have criticized the relentless calendar but also noted that as a manager, he must follow the rules set by football's governing bodies. Guardiola emphasized his immediate focus is on the current tournament and recovering the team's form.</p>

          <p>China has lifted its blanket ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023 in response to the release of treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The decision follows months of monitoring and sampling that Chinese authorities said "showed no abnormalities." The move is seen as a step toward improving diplomatic and trade relations between the two Asian powers, particularly as China faces trade pressure from the United States. While the general ban is lifted, restrictions will remain on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima. (not investment advice)</p>
