          <p>President Trump hosted a dinner for dozens of corporate leaders from companies like Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, and Microsoft to raise funds for a new $200 million ballroom in the White House's East Wing. The project, which broke ground last month, is being financed entirely by private donations rather than taxpayer money, a move that has drawn criticism from figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren. The administration says the 90,000-square-foot expansion is necessary for hosting large functions, and the president thanked attendees for their generous contributions, stating the cost has been "fully taken care of."</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani took the unusual step of participating in on-field batting practice in an effort to break a significant postseason slump. The $700-million player has struggled, hitting just two-for-25 with 12 strikeouts since the start of the NL Division Series. Manager Dave Roberts commented that the team cannot win the World Series with such a performance from its key slugger. Ohtani downplayed suggestions that his return to pitching this season has negatively impacted his hitting, stating he does not feel a direct physical connection between the two roles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came after the administration sent termination notices to over 4,000 employees, with the White House budget director suggesting the number could exceed 10,000. Judge Susan Yvonne Illston cited the administration's unprecedented actions and President Trump's own social media posts as evidence that the firings were intended to punish political opponents. The order applies to employees represented by the two unions that filed the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>As the Mercury Prize ceremony approaches, Irish singer CMAT and the band Pulp are leading as the bookmakers' favorites to win the prestigious award for album of the year. CMAT is favored for her third album, "Euro-Country," while Pulp is a close second for their comeback record, "More." This year's ceremony is being held in Newcastle, marking the first time it has taken place outside of London, a move intended to decentralize the UK music industry. Other notable nominees include PinkPantheress, hometown hero Sam Fender, and 84-year-old folk musician Martin Carthy, the oldest nominee in the prize's history.</p>

          <p>South Korea's benchmark Kospi index surged to a record high, driven by optimism from multiple positive economic developments. The International Monetary Fund upgraded the country's 2025 growth forecast from 0.8% to 0.9% and also raised its global economic growth projection, noting that the impact of U.S. tariffs was modest. Additionally, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that trade negotiations with South Korea were nearing completion. The positive news boosted shares in major companies like Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor, providing a lift to Asian markets amid recent global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is promoting plans to construct a large triumphal arch, dubbed the "Arc de Trump," across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial. The monument is intended to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary next year and will reportedly be funded by private donors. Trump has displayed renderings and a model of the arch, which he wants based on Paris's Arc de Triomphe, to donors and in the Oval Office. This project is part of a broader effort by the president to reshape the capital's aesthetic, which also includes a new $250 million White House ballroom and a gilded redecoration of the Oval Office.</p>

          <p>The band The Last Dinner Party is releasing their second album, "From The Pyre," which they describe as darker and more gothically grandiose than their chart-topping debut. After winning the BBC's Sound of 2024 and a Brit Award for best newcomer, the London quintet wrote and recorded the new material in just four months at the beginning of the year. Singer Abigail Morris explains that some songs explore deep personal themes, such as the loss of her father, reframing grief through the lens of heartbreak. The band's confidence has grown with their success, allowing them to experiment with more complex arrangements and themes.</p>

          <p>A UK housing association chief has proposed a plan to address the high cost and social tension associated with housing asylum seekers in hotels. The idea involves the government providing funds to councils and housing associations to purchase properties, adding to the nation's social housing stock for both local residents and asylum seekers. This approach could drastically cut the annual cost per asylum seeker from £54,000 in a hotel to just £4,000 in social housing. The proposal is reportedly being discussed with government departments as a potential long-term solution to empty the 210 hotels currently in use.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn stated that federal regulation of artificial intelligence is imperative, especially as states like California, Utah, and Texas begin to pass their own laws. Speaking at the CNBC AI Summit, the Tennessee Republican emphasized the need for a national standard to protect consumers and children online, arguing that Congress must act where it has so far failed. Blackburn is a proponent of the Kid's Online Safety Act and is also focused on legislation to protect an individual's name, image, and likeness from being used by AI models without consent, ensuring people can protect their "virtual you."</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after an EF-5 tornado destroyed 95% of Greensburg, Kansas, the town has reinvented itself as a model of sustainability and resilience. Today, 100% of the community's electricity is generated by wind energy, and its buildings are designed with sustainable features that provide long-term economic benefits, including stable electricity costs. The town's mayor explained that the transition was achieved through cooperation rather than mandates, showing residents the practical advantages of going green. The successful rebuild has inspired some younger residents who had left to return, seeing the town as an example of a stronger, better community.</p>

Manager Sonia Bompastor noted that while Thompson is a talented young player, she is still adapting to her new environment and believes her best is yet to come.
