        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Democratic National Committee voted to void David Hogg's election as vice chair following a procedural challenge, though some suggest it's tied to internal criticism. Hogg had announced plans to spend $20 million to primary older Democratic lawmakers, sparking clashes with veteran strategist James Carville. Carville initially criticized the plan but later expressed support for Hogg's efforts. The DNC will hold another vote later this year to decide whether to remove Hogg, amid broader discussions about the party's future leadership.</p>

          <p>India's inflation rate slowed to 3.16% in April, marking the sixth consecutive month of decline, according to recent reports. The reading was lower than March's data of 3.34%, and also below economists' expectations. Food inflation, a key metric, dipped to 1.78% in April, down from 2.69% the previous month. Analysts suggest that while food prices will remain stable, core inflation may rise due to increasing gold prices, which have been affected by trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Amid a budget crisis, Los Angeles City Council members are considering cutting the Fire Department's emergency incident technician positions, which they view as essentially drivers.
