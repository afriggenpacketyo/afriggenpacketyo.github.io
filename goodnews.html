          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration will now permit Boeing to issue its own airworthiness certificates for certain new 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, reversing a policy enacted after major safety crises. This change, which involves alternating certification duties with the FAA weekly, signals growing regulatory confidence in the manufacturer's production quality. The decision comes after years of heightened scrutiny, including a production cap on the 737 Max following a midair incident in January 2024. Boeing is working to stabilize its production and sees this as a key step toward potentially increasing its output rates in the future.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump attended the first day of the 45th Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black on Long Island, a prestigious biennial golf tournament between American and European teams. His presence was welcomed by some on the U.S. team, with top golfer Scottie Scheffler suggesting it would provide a boost to the American players. An avid golfer and owner of several courses, Trump has remained actively involved in the sport, including hosting LIV Golf events and participating in merger negotiations between LIV and the PGA Tour. The visit was a brief one, with Trump scheduled to return to the White House in the afternoon.</p>

The company announced a deal for Nvidia to invest up to $100 billion in data center capacity and expanded its "Stargate" project with Oracle and SoftBank to a $400 billion commitment. These moves are part of CEO Sam Altman's vision to build the massive-scale infrastructure required for the next generation of artificial intelligence. Despite the staggering costs and significant execution risks, including immense energy requirements, the company is betting on insatiable market demand to eventually make the ventures profitable.</p>

          <h2>Key Inflation Gauge Remained Stable in August, Aligning with Economic Forecasts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 10:13:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, held steady in August with a 2.9% annual increase, matching the previous month and economists' expectations. The overall PCE index, which includes food and energy, saw a slight rise to 2.7% year-over-year. While inflation has cooled from its peak, it remains above the Fed's 2% target, continuing to strain American households. This data comes after the Fed's recent interest rate cut and is unlikely to alter its course, as policymakers focus on balancing inflation control with a deteriorating job market.

          <h2>Congress Considers Changing Social Security's Claiming Age Terminology for Clarity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 09:55:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Claiming Age Clarity Act, is advancing in Congress to change the language used by the Social Security Administration to describe retirement benefit ages. The proposed changes aim to reduce confusion, as a recent survey showed few adults understand when they qualify for full benefits. Under the bill, "early eligibility age" (62) would become "minimum benefit age," "full retirement age" (67) would be "standard benefit age," and age 70 would be the "maximum benefit age." Proponents believe this clearer terminology will help retirees better understand the financial implications of their claiming decisions and improve their long-term financial security.</p>

These funds use covered call option strategies to generate monthly distributions, appealing to investors seeking income diversification away from volatile bond markets. While these income-focused ETFs, such as those from Simplify and NEOS, remain small compared to traditional gold and bitcoin funds, BlackRock's recent filing for a bitcoin premium income ETF signals growing mainstream interest. This trend reflects a broader shift in portfolio construction as investors look for new ways to generate returns and manage risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially launched its "Gold Card" program, offering U.S. residency for a $1 million fee, a significant price cut from the initially proposed $5 million. This has made it one of the most competitively priced "golden visa" programs globally, sparking immediate and high demand from wealthy individuals, particularly from China and India. Immigration attorneys report a surge in interest, with the government planning to issue 80,000 cards. However, the program faces potential legal challenges over its creation via executive order and concerns that it may allow applicants to bypass existing backlogs for traditional employment-based visas.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic flooding and infrastructure damage, the tourism-dependent economy of Asheville, North Carolina, is still struggling to recover. The storm, which hit just before the crucial fall tourist season, resulted in average losses of $322,000 for small businesses. Now, as the autumn colors return, local business owners are hopeful that a strong influx of visitors will help them recoup losses and survive the upcoming winter. Many entrepreneurs, having exhausted savings and taken on debt to reopen, see this season as a critical test for their survival, especially as demand for vacation rentals in the area remains down by 20% since the hurricane.</p>

          <p>Shares of Paccar, the parent company of truck manufacturers Peterbilt and Kenworth, surged over 6% following President Trump's announcement of a new 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks. The tariff, set to begin on October 1, is intended to protect domestic manufacturers from what the administration calls unfair foreign competition. According to Bank of America, Paccar's domestically produced trucks cost significantly more than competitors' trucks made in Mexico. The new tariff is expected to level the playing field, directly benefiting Paccar and placing the company in a stronger market position, as reflected in the immediate positive reaction from investors.

          <p>As more Americans take on side hustles, an intellectual property attorney warns that securing a trademark is an essential first step for any new venture, no matter how small. Darlene Harris, a managing attorney, compares a trademark to a property deed, stating it provides crucial legal ownership over a business name, logo, or slogan. Failing to do so can expose entrepreneurs to lawsuits and claims on their profits if their branding is too similar to an existing one. Harris advises new business owners to think long-term and invest in a comprehensive intellectual property strategy that also considers copyrights and forming an LLC to protect personal assets.</p>

During a trial in the Xinjiang desert, the massive turbine, roughly the size of a basketball court, generated one megawatt of power while floating high in the atmosphere. The device, which is lifted by helium, captures stronger and more consistent winds than ground-based turbines and delivers electricity via heavy-duty cables. The company, Sawes Energy Technology, aims to conduct further tests in different environments before beginning mass production in 2026, with the first units expected to connect to the grid that same year.</p>

The match is anticipated to be a clash of styles, pitting England's dominant forward pack against Canada's dynamic and physical backline. Experts are divided, but most predict a very close contest, with England's deep bench of replacements potentially being the deciding factor.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill in the U.S. Senate, the ROAD to Housing Act, aims to address the national housing crisis by encouraging local governments to relax restrictive zoning laws. The legislation proposes creating federal model zoning codes that promote denser construction and providing financial incentives to municipalities that adopt these reforms and successfully increase their housing supply. Proponents, like the Economic Innovation Group, see this as a promising federal strategy that could create "Right-to-Build Zones," allowing cities to test less restrictive rules in specific areas. This approach could cut through local political opposition that often stalls housing development at the municipal level.</p>

This strategy allows Nvidia to deploy its massive cash flow, gain insight into emerging technologies, and secure its position as the preferred hardware supplier for the industry. While not all investments require the use of Nvidia's chips, having the chipmaker on a company's cap table has become a significant endorsement for attracting further capital.</p>
