          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is hosting a major exhibition of realist painter Ilya Repin, featuring dozens of his oil paintings and sketches from Russia's State Tretyakov Gallery. The exhibition is curated to emphasize the artist's "Russianness," focusing on significant periods of his life within the Russian Empire. This presentation comes amid a cultural dispute, as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has also claimed Repin, known there as Illia Riepin, as part of its own national cultural heritage. The event highlights the use of cultural diplomacy in the context of current geopolitical alignments.</p>

          <p>Nine months into his tenure, Manchester United's head coach Ruben Amorim is implementing significant changes to reverse the team's fortunes after a self-described "disaster season." His strategy involves a shift away from the rigid discipline of his predecessor, fostering a more positive training environment and empowering a six-player leadership group. Amorim is also reshaping the squad to fit his preferred 3-4-3 formation, which has involved costly new signings and tactical adjustments for key players like Bruno Fernandes. The club faces a challenging start to the season, with European qualification set as the minimum target.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has broken her social media silence three weeks after her "Good Jeans" ad campaign for American Eagle sparked a divided public response. She posted photos from a night out with friends, making no direct comment on the controversy, which saw some critics label the ad's "great genes" wordplay as racially insensitive while others praised it for challenging "woke" advertising. American Eagle defended the campaign, stating it was always about the jeans. Reputation management experts suggest the controversy, regardless of its merits, could ultimately boost Sweeney's career and earning potential by generating significant media attention.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the eponymous West Hollywood Italian restaurant that has been a favored haunt for celebrities for six decades, has died at the age of 90 in Belgrade, Serbia. Born in the former Yugoslavia, Tana was a professional soccer player and actor before opening his restaurant in 1964, creating a late-night dining spot for stars like Elizabeth Taylor and George Clooney. Known for its classic red-sauce Italian-American fare and discreet service, the restaurant became an L.A. institution. Tana sold the establishment in 2009, but its legacy as a timeless piece of Hollywood history endures.</p>

          <p>The long-standing "85th percentile rule," which sets speed limits based on the speed of the fastest 15% of drivers, is being reconsidered by some states and federal agencies. This method, originating from 1930s studies on rural roads, is criticized for creating a feedback loop where speeding leads to higher official limits, even in urban areas with high pedestrian traffic. Amid rising road fatalities, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that this is a guideline, not a mandatory rule, encouraging communities to also consider factors like pedestrian safety and crash frequency. Cities like Madison, Wisconsin, are now actively lowering residential speed limits to improve safety.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop New Technique for High-Resolution 3D Brain Imaging</h2>

          <p>Researchers in China have created a new method for making biological tissues, including the brain, transparent to allow for clearer and more vivid 3D imaging. The technique prepares what is described as "ionic glassy tissue," which preserves the organ's original structure and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells. This advancement allows for highly accurate visualization of the brain's intricate inner workings. The process also allows the tissues to be formed into a glassy solid at low temperatures, enabling long-term storage without compromising structural integrity.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, retaking sole possession of first place in the National League West. The game was characterized by a series of sloppy plays from the Padres, including three runners caught stealing by Dodgers catcher Will Smith in the first two innings alone. The Dodgers capitalized on San Diego's mistakes, which included numerous walks from starting pitcher Dylan Cease and a costly two-run error in the outfield. The win not only extended the Dodgers' division lead but also clinched the head-to-head season series, which would serve as a tiebreaker.</p>

          <p>A collection of stories from service and retail workers highlights bizarre and humorous instances of customer confusion, often described as "Sir, this is a Wendy's" moments. Examples include a woman demanding a chicken dinner at a museum gift shop, a customer trying to return a Walmart laptop to Best Buy, and another attempting to haggle over the price of a lamp at a Cracker Barrel as if it were a flea market. These anecdotes reveal a common experience among employees who have encountered patrons who are profoundly mistaken about where they are or what services the business provides, often leading to awkward or confrontational interactions.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to join a video call with European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, to coordinate their stance on Ukraine. The call precedes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's upcoming visit to the White House, where he will meet with President Trump. Starmer commended Trump's recent efforts at a summit with Vladimir Putin for bringing an end to the war "closer than ever before" but emphasized that any path to peace must directly involve President Zelenskyy. The allied discussion aims to present a united front and ensure robust security guarantees for Ukraine are part of any potential peace agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a hypersonic drone carrier concept featuring an innovative single, rotating "scissor wing" design, an idea once explored by NASA. Unlike conventional aircraft, this design allows the wing to sit perpendicular to the fuselage for efficient lift at low speeds and then pivot to become parallel at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5. This transformation allows the aircraft to function as a highly efficient waverider, minimizing drag and managing shock waves across different speed regimes. The design aims to overcome the traditional compromises between low-speed take-off performance and high-speed aerodynamic efficiency.</p>

          <p>A small private plane made a successful emergency landing on Interstate 805 in San Diego's Sorrento Valley on Saturday afternoon due to apparent mechanical issues. The aircraft was reportedly en route from Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport to the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. The California Highway Patrol and the Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the incident. Remarkably, no injuries were reported from the landing, though it caused a significant traffic disruption, with all southbound lanes being temporarily closed and diverted.</p>

          <p>A derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party destination and is now on the market for £3 million. Former software CEO Mike Conner purchased the abandoned island for £555,000 in 2017 and undertook a challenging five-year renovation to make it habitable. The historic fortress, originally built to defend against French naval attacks, now features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and its own nightclub. The extensive project required overcoming major logistical hurdles, including bringing all materials and equipment in by helicopter to the remote off-grid location.</p>

          <h2>UK Parents Share Budgeting Strategies for Managing School Holiday Food Costs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are using meticulous planning and creative cooking to manage the increased cost of feeding children during the six-week summer holidays. One mother utilizes her freezer to store discounted "yellow sticker" meat and other items purchased over several months in preparation for the break. Another parent rations snacks by putting food for each day into separate bags and storing them out of children's reach. These strategies, along with using local food pantries and batch cooking, help families stretch their budgets as they lose access to subsidized school meals during the extended holiday period.</p>
