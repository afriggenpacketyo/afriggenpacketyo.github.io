The discussion reportedly covered monetary policy and potential structural changes at the central bank.

The Trump administration is seeking new leadership and operational reforms at the Fed ahead of an anticipated interest rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced that the EU will fast-track its review of the planned 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine cars. The decision comes in response to significant pressure from European automakers, who cite challenges such as high costs, a lack of charging infrastructure, and intense competition from Chinese electric vehicles. Industry leaders argue the 2035 target is no longer feasible and are calling for a more technologically neutral approach that includes other low-emission options. Environmental groups, however, are urging the EU to remain firm on the original deadline to drive innovation.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly anti-corruption protests that led to the prime minister's resignation, Nepal has sworn in former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its interim leader. Karki, 73, is the first woman to hold the position and is tasked with restoring order and organizing general elections within six months. The unrest was initially sparked by a government ban on social media but quickly escalated into a mass movement against the political establishment, culminating in protesters setting fire to parliament. Karki is widely seen as a figure with a clean image, supported by the youth-led protest movement.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Debate Whether $7.6 Trillion in Money Market Funds Will Fuel a Stock Rally</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 15:21:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a record $7.6 trillion sitting in high-yield money market funds, investors are watching to see if an expected Federal Reserve interest rate cut will push that cash into the stock market. Some on Wall Street believe this "wall of cash" could fuel a significant rally as lower rates make cash savings less attractive. However, experts like Peter Crane of Crane Data are skeptical, arguing that the vast majority of these funds are held by institutions and corporations that will not move into equities regardless of rate changes. They suggest that only a return to near-zero interest rates would cause a substantial outflow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Four Key Considerations for Prospective Homebuyers Amid Falling Mortgage Rates</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates fall to their lowest levels in nearly a year, prospective homebuyers are advised to act strategically to capitalize on the opportunity. This article highlights four key points: timing is crucial, as lenders often adjust rates before formal Fed action; the best rates are reserved for applicants with high credit scores; buyers should prioritize finding the right home over waiting for the perfect rate, encapsulated by the phrase "date the rate, marry the home"; and securing a mortgage pre-approval remains essential to show sellers you are a serious and financially prepared buyer.

Ruiz noted that the industry's project backlog has more than tripled in a year to $470 billion, driven by the demands of artificial intelligence and hyperscale tech companies.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Mitch Kamin, a prominent lawyer with a background in nonprofit leadership and civil rights, as her new chief of staff. Kamin becomes the third person to hold the top role in Bass's administration in less than three years, a notably high turnover rate compared to previous mayoralties. He previously served as general counsel for the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art and as a partner at the law firm Covington & Burling, where he represented the city in a lawsuit against the Trump administration's immigration policies. Bass described Kamin as a "seasoned leader and status quo disrupter."</p>

          <p>Terence Crawford, who is moving up two weight classes, weighed in at the same weight as champion Saul "Canelo" Alvarez ahead of their highly anticipated super-middleweight bout in Las Vegas. The undefeated Crawford, aiming to become a three-division undisputed champion, appeared impressively lean and muscular despite the added weight. Alvarez will be defending his four major world titles in what is expected to be a historic fight. While Alvarez has a natural size and power advantage at 12 stone, many experts are tipping the adaptable and skilled Crawford to win.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has charged identical twin brothers, Se Youn and Hee Youn Kim, with tax evasion and running a lucrative scheme to broker public golf course tee times. The brothers allegedly monopolized desirable reservation slots across Southern California, reselling them to customers at a premium and failing to report over $1.1 million in combined income to the IRS. Instead of paying their tax debts, the indictment alleges they made lavish purchases from luxury brands. The charges come after local golfers expressed widespread frustration over their inability to book tee times, prompting a federal investigation.</p>
