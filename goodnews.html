          <p>AI chatbots like Grok, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are increasingly used for fact-checking, but their responses are not always reliable, according to recent studies. A BBC study found that 51% of AI-generated answers contained significant inaccuracies, while research by the Tow Center for Digital Journalism revealed that AI tools often fail to correctly identify the source of article excerpts. Experts warn that AI chatbots are only as good as the data they are trained on and should not be seen as definitive fact-checking tools, emphasizing the need for users to double-check responses with other sources. The article suggests caution when relying on AI for critical information verification.</p>

          <p>Three Iranian nationals have been charged in the UK with suspected espionage on behalf of Iran's intelligence services, following arrests made earlier this month. The men are accused of engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service between August 2024 and February 2025. One of the suspects faces an additional charge related to surveillance and reconnaissance with the intention of committing serious violence against a person in the United Kingdom. A fourth man, also arrested in connection with the investigation, has been released without charge. The arrests come amid heightened concerns about Iranian activities on UK soil, as indicated by the article.</p>

          <p>The UK and EU are preparing for a summit focused on improving long-term relationships and addressing issues stemming from Brexit, despite insiders not expecting a major new deal. The summit will cover topics such as defense, security, energy, migration, and agriculture, with potential agreements on easing administrative burdens for farmers and the food industry. Discussions are ongoing regarding young citizens' ability to live and work in each other's countries, as well as fishing rights, and the UK aims to demonstrate progress after trade deals with India and the US, hoping to boost the economy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Department under President Trump is focusing on voter fraud, with assistance from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Recent charges include cases of non-U.S. citizens allegedly voting illegally in Florida, but these cases do not point to any widespread conspiracy. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is shifting its focus to enforcing the president's executive orders, and DOGE is assisting with investigations by comparing Social Security data with state voter data to identify potential noncitizens who have illegally voted. States are also quantifying the noncitizen voting issue, adding to evidence that it rarely occurs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's legislative agenda, dubbed "one big, beautiful bill," draws parallels to Ronald Reagan's economic policies in 1981, which also used budget reconciliation to enact significant tax and spending cuts. Reagan's program, known as Reaganomics, aimed to stimulate the economy through tax cuts and increased military spending, mirroring Trump's current approach. Similar to the role of David Stockman in the Reagan administration, Elon Musk is wielding considerable influence in the Trump administration through the Department of Government Efficiency, overseeing budget cuts and personnel changes. The article examines the historical context and potential impact of Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>Two drug smugglers have been jailed after being caught with ¬£37m of cocaine in an inflatable boat off the Suffolk coast. Bruce Knowles, 56, and Ferhat Gumrukguoglu, 32, were intercepted by Border Force officers near Benacre Broad on 24 June last year. The court heard how the pair had trialled a "dry run" of the operation in April before attempting the real thing two months later, meeting a larger ship in waters between England and France. Knowles was sentenced to 17 years and three months, while Gumrukguoglu received a 15-year sentence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing disparity between the wealthy and the average person has sparked debate about the need for an "extreme wealth line," a point beyond which wealth accumulation should be actively curbed. The current system allows for wealth to beget wealth through passive returns on existing assets, with no upper limit on how much an individual or family can acquire. Some suggest the extreme wealth line should be set at 1,000 times the societal median, which would amount to net assets of ¬£350m based on the Sunday Times rich list. The article advocates for a democratic way of defining an extreme wealth line to tackle inequality effectively.</p>

After a season of identity searching, the Knicks, led by Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns, found their rhythm, blending resilient defense with explosive offense. The team's success, orchestrated by President Leon Rose, is a result of strategic trades and signings rather than relying on homegrown stars. The Knicks now face the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals, carrying momentum and a newfound sense of confidence.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced prehistoric human migration from Asia to North and South America, revealing insights into the origins and diversification of Indigenous groups. The study, published in Science, found that the first people to colonize the Americas migrated from modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. The research also identified genetic traits that helped Indigenous groups adapt to diverse environments, such as the Andes mountain range and the Amazon rainforest. The findings are helping underrepresented Indigenous groups understand their ancestral origins.</p>
