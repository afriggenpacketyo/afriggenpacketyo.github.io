          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-09 05:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the deep historical origins of the American ideal that all individuals possess innate rights, a concept central to the Declaration of Independence. It traces this principle not just to the Enlightenment but further back to the Book of Genesis, which posits that all humans are created in God's image, thereby having intrinsic value. This biblical view challenged the hierarchical societies of the ancient world where rights were conferred by rulers. The Founders, particularly Thomas Jefferson, synthesized these religious and philosophical traditions to assert that governments are instituted to secure pre-existing rights, a revolutionary departure from the "divine right of kings."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-09 05:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article confronts the central contradiction of the Declaration of Independence: its proclamation that "all men are created equal" was written by Thomas Jefferson, a man who enslaved nearly 200 people. It argues that the meaning of these words has evolved beyond Jefferson's original intent, largely through the persistent efforts of Black Americans. From early post-Declaration petitions for abolition to the powerful oratory of Frederick Douglass and the legal battles of the Civil Rights Movement, Black activists have consistently used the document's ideals to challenge racial injustice. This ongoing struggle has transformed the Declaration into a tool for expanding freedom, making their intentions more relevant than those of the founders.</p>

          <p>The article reconstructs the likely meal shared by the Founding Fathers at Philadelphia's City Tavern on July 4, 1777, to celebrate the first anniversary of American independence. The menu reflects a uniquely American cuisine shaped by global trade and local resources, featuring dishes like turtle soup, roasted sturgeon, and turkey. Ingredients such as spices from Asia, sugar from the Caribbean, and potatoes from Peru highlight the interconnectedness of the colonial world. This culinary snapshot reveals that the new American identity, much like its food, was a complex fusion of diverse influences from across the globe.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article contrasts the divergent reactions of Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson to Shays's Rebellion, revealing their foundational disagreement on the nature of American democracy. Hamilton feared that popular uprisings could lead to a demagogue overthrowing the republic, advocating for a strong central government to maintain order. In contrast, Jefferson viewed rebellion as a necessary check on power, famously stating that "the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." This intellectual battle between Hamilton's fear of anarchy and Jefferson's fear of tyranny has shaped American political discourse ever since.</p>

          <h2>Uncovering the British Aristocratic Roots of American Revolutionary Ideas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-09 05:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article reveals a previously unknown connection between American revolutionary writer Thomas Paine and Charles Lennox, the third Duke of Richmond, a radical British aristocrat. Evidence suggests the Duke was Paine's first patron and a key figure behind the anti-government "Junius letters," which articulated a right to revolution years before the Declaration of Independence. This discovery challenges the narrative that revolutionary fervor was solely a colonial phenomenon, indicating that its ideological foundations were also cultivated in London. The radical energy, it argues, spread from the empire's core to its periphery, linking the struggles for liberty on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>Craig Clark, a 79-year-old retiree from Sarasota, Florida, has earned the nickname "Tech Fairy" for his work refurbishing and giving away laptops to those who cannot afford them. Over the past eight years, the former computer technician has donated hundreds of computers, funded by donations of old devices and his own money for new hard drives. Clark identifies recipients in his community, often approaching minimum-wage workers or people at second-hand stores who he sees are in need. He says his mission is driven by the joy of fixing computers and seeing the positive, life-changing impact the devices have on people's lives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the energy think tank Ember reveals that for the first time, renewable energy has become the world's primary source of electricity, accounting for 34.3% of global consumption in the first half of 2025. This historic shift saw coal's share fall to 33.1%, largely driven by the rapid adoption of solar and wind power in developing nations like China and India. While some Western countries increased coal consumption, the overall global trend indicates a significant move away from fossil fuels. The report notes that the growth in renewables is now outpacing the growth in electricity demand, a crucial tipping point for reducing carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>The article explores the use of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy as a treatment for first responders suffering from severe depression and PTSD. It follows the story of a police sergeant who found relief through the therapy after traditional methods failed. While practitioners say low doses of the hallucinogenic drug can help patients process trauma, the treatment's efficacy is still being studied, and the market remains largely unregulated. High costs, lack of insurance coverage, and the stigma associated with ketamine present significant hurdles, even as advocates argue it can be a life-saving option for those in high-trauma professions.</p>

          <p>The newly announced ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas marks a significant diplomatic breakthrough in the two-year conflict, largely driven by direct pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. While this first phase brings hope, the article cautions that a permanent end to the war is not guaranteed, as crucial details like Hamas's disarmament and the future governance of Gaza remain unresolved. The deal is a political victory for President Trump, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still faces pressure from ultranationalist coalition partners who oppose it. Both sides have reasons to be wary, given past ceasefire failures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young consumers, particularly from Gen Z, are rejecting "fast furniture"—cheap, mass-produced items designed for short-term use—due to its significant environmental impact. Instead, they are turning to secondhand markets like Facebook Marketplace to find unique, durable, and more sustainable pieces. This trend pushes back against an industry that contributes millions of tons of waste to landfills annually, as much of this furniture is made with mixed materials that are difficult to recycle. The shift reflects a broader awareness of consumption's carbon footprint and a desire for items with a personal story and lasting value.</p>

The acquisition is a major step in SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's vision to advance "Physical AI," combining robotics with Artificial Super Intelligence. This move further solidifies SoftBank's position as a central player in the AI industry, adding to its significant investments in companies like chip designer Arm and OpenAI. The deal also means that ABB will no longer pursue a separate public listing for its robotics business. (not investment advice)</p>
