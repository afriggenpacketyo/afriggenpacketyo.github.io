          <p>The UK and France are reportedly close to finalizing a deal to address small boat crossings in the English Channel, which would involve France taking back a number of migrants. The pilot scheme is expected to initially involve returning around 50 migrants per week, with the UK accepting a similar number of asylum seekers from France with legitimate claims. Critics argue this number is too small to act as a significant deterrent compared to the total number of crossings. The success of the agreement will ultimately be judged by whether it leads to a substantial and sustained reduction in arrivals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming 'Superman' film, directed by James Gunn, is generating political discussion over its portrayal of the iconic hero. Gunn has stated the film focuses on "universal morality" and kindness rather than American exceptionalism, depicting a hero who protects the vulnerable worldwide. This interpretation has drawn criticism from some right-wing commentators, who have labeled the character as "woke" and called for a boycott. The article explores this in the context of Superman's origins as a character created by Jewish immigrants to defend the weak against rising fascism.</p>

          <p>A major industrial accident was averted in Los Angeles when 31 construction workers were safely rescued after a portion of a large sanitation tunnel collapsed. The workers were approximately 400 feet underground and six miles in from the tunnel's only entrance when the cave-in occurred. They were able to scramble over the debris to reach a tunnel boring machine and were then transported to the surface. Officials praised the workers' composure and called the outcome a victory, as no one sustained major injuries in the frightening incident.</p>

          <p>In what researchers are calling a major leap for medical technology, an autonomous robot has performed a realistic gallbladder surgery on a life-like model with 100% accuracy. The system, developed at Johns Hopkins University, used a machine learning architecture similar to ChatGPT to understand the procedure and adapt to unexpected situations. The robot was also able to respond to and learn from voice commands, demonstrating a significant step toward clinically viable autonomous surgical systems. While the procedure took longer than a human surgeon, the results were comparable in quality.</p>

          <h2>Former Chinese Central Bank Official Argues for Yuan's Safe-Haven Potential</h2>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan has the potential to become a safe-haven currency, citing its stability during recent global stress events like the Russia-Ukraine war. The argument, presented in a recent article, suggests that China's low inflation, current account surplus, and large foreign reserves give the yuan considerable advantages. However, for the yuan to achieve this status, the authors contend that China would need to implement greater flexibility in its capital controls and encourage more foreign participation in its financial markets.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The market for weight-loss drugs in China has grown into a US$150 billion industry, attracting dozens of domestic and international pharmaceutical producers. This rapid expansion is driven by the approval of new, more effective medications and a growing obese population. Chinese firms are now entering the lucrative market, with Innovent Biologics becoming the first domestic company to win approval to market its weight-loss drug in the country. The trend mirrors the soaring sales of similar drugs seen in Western countries, fueled by celebrity endorsements and social media.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vienna is often cited as a model for successful housing policy, largely due to its extensive social housing sector, which comprises 43% of the city's housing units. This system, which caters to a broad range of income levels, results in significantly lower rent levels and also helps moderate prices in the private market. Originating in the 1920s, the city's long-term political commitment to social housing has created remarkable stability. However, the article notes that the system can be complex to navigate, and deregulation has reduced the availability of the cheapest private housing for newcomers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology have created what they claim is the world's lightest insect brain controller, a device weighing just 74 milligrams. When strapped to a bee's back, the controller uses tiny needles to pierce the insect's brain and deliver electronic pulses. These pulses create illusions that can command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat with a reported 90% success rate. This development marks a significant, if potentially unsettling, step forward in the field of bio-robotics and remote control of living organisms.</p>

          <p>A large section of the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, which was illegally felled in September 2023, has been installed as a permanent memorial. The piece of trunk is now on display at The Sill National Landscape Discovery Centre in Northumberland, near where the tree once stood. The installation, which includes benches inscribed with public messages of remembrance, was designed to allow people to touch and interact with the wood. The project aims to create a symbol of hope and a positive response to the widely condemned act of vandalism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to combat persistent labor market pressures, China's government has introduced a new subsidy for companies that hire unemployed young people. The policy provides a one-time payment of up to 1,500 yuan (US$209) for each new hire aged 16 to 24 who is signed to a formal contract. This measure is part of a broader push to stabilize employment amid sluggish economic growth and fierce domestic competition. The funding for the subsidy will come from the country's unemployment insurance reserves and will remain in effect until the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Shares of WK Kellogg, the maker of North American breakfast cereals like Corn Flakes and Fruit Loops, soared over 56% in extended trading. The surge followed reports that Italian chocolate giant Ferrero is in advanced negotiations to acquire the company for approximately $3 billion. A deal could be announced as soon as this week and would give the owner of Ferrero Rocher and Kinder a dominant position in the US breakfast cereal market. WK Kellogg has been facing financial struggles and significant debt since splitting from its international parent company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its key policy rate steady at 2.5% as it evaluates the effectiveness of recent government measures. These measures were implemented to cool down Seoul's rapidly accelerating housing market and address the expansion of household debt. While the economy has shown signs of slowing, the central bank is prioritizing financial stability over stimulating growth at this time. Analysts expect that if the housing market stabilizes, the bank may be open to cutting rates later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>
