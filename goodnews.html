          <p>An innovative "ice battery" system is being used to cool buildings and lower energy costs. The system freezes water at night when electricity is cheaper, then uses the ice to cool buildings during the day, reducing cooling costs by up to 40%. This technology helps alleviate stress on the energy grid during peak hours and is installed in about 4,000 sites globally. Scientists are also testing new materials that require less energy to store energy for cooling purposes, aiming to make the process even more efficient.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has introduced the Strong Borders Act, a bill designed to restrict some asylum claims and enhance authorities' powers to halt immigration application processing. Immigration Minister Lena Diab says the bill aims to combat organized crime and illegal trafficking while bolstering the integrity of Canada's immigration system. The bill includes provisions for increased border monitoring and could bar asylum claims from those in Canada for over a year. Critics argue that the bill infringes on civil liberties by expanding government powers to inspect mail and restrict cash transactions.</p>

          <p>Over 100 British athletes, including Sir Mo Farah and Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill, have signed an open letter urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer to support London's bid to host the 2029 World Athletics Championships. The bid would see the event held at London Stadium, requiring public funding in 2028, with an estimated ¬£400m economic impact. Athletes emphasize the potential to inspire a new generation to participate in athletics, reminiscent of the impact of London 2012 and 2017.</p>
