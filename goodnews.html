          <p>Eurostar services are returning to normal after facing major disruptions caused by two separate fatalities on the LGV Nord line and subsequent cable theft. The cable theft near Lille, involving approximately 600 meters of copper cables, forced trains to be rerouted, resulting in extended journey times and cancellations. Eurostar urged passengers to postpone their journeys, offering free changes or full refunds to those affected. Technicians worked to repair the railway cables, and one track was reopened to allow some trains to run in both directions while full repairs were underway. Delays are still expected, and passengers are advised to check for updates.</p>

          <p>Most NATO allies have committed to increasing defense spending to 5% of their GDP, aiming to reassure the US of their commitment to the alliance. The agreement divides the spending into 3.5% for hard defense and 1.5% for defense-related investments. However, some members, like Spain and Slovakia, have expressed reservations about meeting the target. Despite the pledge, concerns persist regarding the US's long-term commitment to NATO, particularly after President Trump questioned the alliance's mutual defense clause. The alliance seeks to address these concerns and maintain a strong transatlantic partnership.</p>
