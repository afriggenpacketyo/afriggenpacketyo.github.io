          <p>Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain to win the revamped FIFA Club World Cup, an event hailed as a "huge success" by FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who noted revenues over $2 billion. The article highlights the close relationship between Infantino and Donald Trump, who was present at the final, and discusses the significant financial rewards for the participating clubs. However, it also addresses widespread criticism from figures like Jürgen Klopp regarding player exhaustion, exacerbated by extreme heat during the tournament, a concern FIFA has pledged to address.</p>

          <p>Cole Palmer delivered a masterful performance, scoring two goals and providing an assist to lead Chelsea to a decisive 3-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final. Playing in extreme heat in New Jersey, Chelsea executed a clinical plan, absorbing pressure and striking effectively on the counter-attack to build an insurmountable first-half lead. The win marks a historic moment for Chelsea, securing the inaugural title of the expanded 32-team tournament. The match concluded with a minor scuffle between the teams before Chelsea's celebrations began.</p>

          <p>In a speech, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to divorce their personal feelings about President Donald Trump from their financial decisions, arguing that the market is showing resilience. He posits that despite institutional selling, individual investor enthusiasm, coupled with a pro-business regulatory environment and the deflationary impact of AI, is driving stocks higher. Cramer suggests that policies like deregulation, leniency on corporate mergers, and new tax breaks are creating a positive environment for corporate profits and, consequently, stock prices.

          <p>In his final career match at WWE's Saturday Night's Main Event, Hall of Famer Goldberg was defeated by the reigning World Heavyweight Champion, Gunther. Despite a late-match rally featuring his signature Spear and Jackhammer moves, Goldberg was unable to secure the pinfall and ultimately passed out in Gunther's sleeper hold. The event also saw a shocking upset as LA Knight pinned Seth Rollins, who appeared to suffer a legitimate knee injury during the match and had to be helped to the back.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise album titled "Swag," which is being described as a return to his R&B roots, similar to his past projects "Journals" and "Changes." The article characterizes the 21-track LP as raw, improvisatory, and messy in a way that reflects a tumultuous period in the artist's life, including health issues and a break from his longtime manager. The music features spacey, cooled-out grooves and is noted for its unpolished, authentic feel, distinguishing it from the more streamlined pop of his male contemporaries.</p>

          <p>To be among the top 10% of wealthiest American households, a net worth of at least $2 million was required, according to the Federal Reserve’s 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances. This figure is significantly higher than the median household net worth of $192,900, highlighting a large wealth disparity. The article notes that due to stock market gains and inflation since 2022, the current threshold to enter the top 10% is likely closer to $2.2 million. Reaching this level of wealth typically requires a combination of high earnings, diligent saving, and successful investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" movie, written and directed by DC Studios co-head James Gunn, launched with an estimated $122 million at the North American box office.

The film, which cost around $225 million to produce, is seen as a vital reset for the DC cinematic universe after a series of recent box office disappointments.

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal, is advancing a new sanctions bill described as a "sledgehammer" against Russia's economy. The legislation would give President Trump the authority to impose massive tariffs on countries like China, India, and Brazil that support Russia's war effort by purchasing its goods. The move comes as President Trump expresses growing frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to de-escalate the war in Ukraine. The senators believe this strong economic leverage is necessary to force Putin to the negotiating table and end the conflict.</p>

          <p>A 1940s-era fortune cookie factory in Denver has been transformed into a unique, free-to-the-public art gallery by founder Amanda Precourt. After purchasing the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago, Precourt undertook an eight-year renovation to create the "Cookie Factory" gallery, which opened in May. The mission of the privately funded space is to provide a place for community connection and healing through art, a cause personal to Precourt. The inaugural exhibition features nature-based work by artist Sam Falls and is part of a long-term vision to foster discussion on important subjects through art.</p>
