          <p>The Richmond-Upon-Thames Council has rescinded a £150 fine given to a woman for pouring a small amount of leftover coffee down a road gully. The woman, Burcu Yesilyurt, stated she was trying to be responsible by not spilling the liquid on the bus she was about to board. After she was stopped by three enforcement officers in what she described as an "intimidating" encounter, the council ultimately cancelled the fine, acknowledging it was a minor contravention and apologizing for the inconvenience.</p>

The comments came as stocks like Beyond Meat saw extreme, inexplicable trading volatility, highlighting the type of activity that draws regulatory scrutiny when not supported by company news.

          <p>Australia defeated England by six wickets in their Women's World Cup match, overcoming an early batting collapse to successfully chase down England's total of 244. Despite being reduced to 68-4, a commanding 180-run partnership between Annabel Sutherland, who scored 98, and Ash Gardner, who made 104, guided the defending champions to victory. For England, opener Tammy Beaumont top-scored with 78, but the middle order struggled against Australia's disciplined bowling. The result serves as a reminder of Australia's formidable depth and resilience in the tournament.</p>

          <p>The government in England is postponing its planned reforms for the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (Send) system until the new year. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson announced a "further period of co-creation" to test proposals with parents, educators, and experts before publishing a full Schools White Paper. The delay has been met with frustration from some parent groups over the continued uncertainty, while others have welcomed the government's decision to take more time to ensure the reforms are effective and properly address the system's widely acknowledged failings.</p>
