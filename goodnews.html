          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company's robotaxi service is tentatively scheduled to begin in Austin, Texas, on June 22. Musk indicated that the rollout will be small and closely monitored, with geofencing and remote monitoring to ensure safety, and the initial tests will involve the Model Y. Automotive safety advocates and those opposing Musk's political views are planning protests, raising concerns about Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. Musk also led the Department of Government Efficiency, which made cuts to federal agencies, regulations and offices tasked with oversight of Tesla and his other companies, which has raised some concerns. The article highlights the potential impact of autonomous vehicles on transportation and the ongoing debate about their safety and regulation.</p>

          <p>Mikie Sherrill, a U.S. Representative, won the Democratic primary for governor in New Jersey, emerging from a crowded field due to her background as a navy pilot and former prosecutor, and her criticism of Donald Trump. Sherrill defeated five rivals, including a fellow House member and several mayors, and will now face Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli in the November general election. Her campaign focused on making the state more affordable, with emphasis on lowering housing costs, and she garnered endorsements from key county party organizations and women's rights groups. A win in November would make her New Jersey's second female governor, succeeding Phil Murphy, who is term-limited, as the state looks to maintain Democratic control.</p>

          <p>China's J-20 stealth fighter has tripled its radar detection range due to semiconductor advancements led by scientist Xu Xiangang at Shandong University. A silicon-carbide semiconductor material developed by Xu's team has powered a threefold increase in the detection range of phased array radar systems. This allows Chinese radars to swiftly detect enemies and gain a first-mover advantage, making it crucial for national security. The J-20, known as the Mighty Dragon, is a twin-engine stealth fighter seen as China's answer to America's F-22 Raptor, and officially entered active service in March 2017.</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is making a significant investment in artificial intelligence, with Meta nearing a $14 billion stake in Scale AI and hiring its founder, Alexandr Wang, to lead a new AI research lab. Zuckerberg is reportedly frustrated with Meta's standing in AI and is counting on Wang to improve the company's AI ambitions, particularly after the lukewarm reception of Meta's Llama AI models. By taking a stake in Scale AI rather than acquiring it outright, Meta aims to avoid further antitrust scrutiny from regulators, and Wang will bring his expertise in data-labelling and AI model training to Meta. The article emphasizes the importance of AI to Meta's future and the company's efforts to bolster its position in the field.</p>
