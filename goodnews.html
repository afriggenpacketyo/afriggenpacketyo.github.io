          <p>A man who allegedly threatened a mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was arrested after his family reported his social media threats to the police. The suspect, identified as 49-year-old Billy Cagle, was taken into custody unarmed inside the terminal. Authorities later found an AR-15 rifle with ammunition in his truck parked outside. Officials praised the family's quick action and the coordinated law enforcement response for preventing a potential tragedy at the world's busiest airport. The suspect, a felon with known mental health challenges, now faces charges including terroristic threats.</p>

Despite the positive financial results, the company noted that overall consumer demand remains soft, with unit case volume seeing only a 1% increase globally. Key markets like North America and Latin America showed flat volume growth, indicating that lower-income consumers may be cutting back. The company maintained its full-year forecast, projecting a 5% to 6% rise in organic revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays have secured a spot in the World Series for the first time since their back-to-back championship wins in 1992 and 1993. They will face the Los Angeles Dodgers, who are aiming to become the first team to win consecutive titles in 25 years. The series opener will be held in Toronto, as the Blue Jays earned home-field advantage with a slightly better regular-season record. The matchup pits Toronto's powerful offense against a dominant Dodgers team led by two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani, setting the stage for a highly anticipated championship contest.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Ants Redesign Nests to Mitigate Disease Spread</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 07:13:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research shows that black garden ants actively alter their nest architecture to reduce the transmission of a lethal fungus. When exposed to the pathogen, the ants build more compartmentalized nests with fewer interconnections and more distant entrances, effectively creating a form of "architectural immunity." This structural change complements their known social distancing behaviors, such as self-isolation by infected individuals, to protect the colony's most valuable members like the queen and larvae. Scientists suggest these findings demonstrate how a social species can manipulate its environment to combat epidemics, offering potential insights for designing human spaces that better control disease spread.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled a plan to cut "needless form filling" and red tape for businesses, aiming to save firms nearly £6 billion annually and stimulate economic growth. The proposed reforms include simplifying the company merger process and removing lengthy reporting requirements for over 100,000 small businesses. Business Secretary Peter Kyle also mentioned the possibility of temporary regulatory exemptions for new AI software to foster rapid development and commercialization. While business groups have welcomed the proposals, critics argue that more significant deregulation, particularly related to post-Brexit customs, is needed to truly boost competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has finished a course of radiation treatment for an aggressive form of prostate cancer at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia. His daughter, Ashley Biden, shared the news on social media, expressing gratitude to the medical team and noting her father's bravery. It is a common tradition for patients to ring a bell to mark the completion of a radiation therapy cycle. Biden had announced his diagnosis in May, revealing that the cancer had metastasized to his bones, which raised concerns about the transparency of his health status during his presidency.</p>

          <p>General Motors reported third-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, prompting the company to raise its full-year guidance for 2025. The automaker posted an adjusted earnings per share of $2.80, significantly higher than the expected $2.31, on revenue of $48.59 billion. GM also lowered its projected financial impact from tariffs for the year, citing recent policy updates from the Trump administration. Despite the strong overall performance, the company's net income was halved due to a $1.6 billion charge related to its pullback from all-electric vehicles, with executives acknowledging that EV profitability will take longer than anticipated.

          <p>The German government has placed an order for 20 Eurofighter Typhoon jets, one of the world's most advanced fighter aircraft, to be manufactured by Airbus. The new jets are expected to be delivered between 2031 and 2034, marking a significant technological upgrade for the German Air Force and strengthening its capabilities within NATO. The Eurofighter Typhoon is known for its high speed, maneuverability, and advanced weaponry and sensor systems. The aircraft is constructed with minimal metal, making it difficult to detect on radar, and features a sophisticated cockpit with life support and protection systems for the pilot.</p>

          <p>The population of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale has increased for the fourth consecutive year, reaching an estimated 384 individuals. This slow but encouraging growth follows a significant decline in the previous decade, according to the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium. Scientists attribute the positive trend to conservation measures, particularly new protections in Canadian waters where the whales have been spending more time. While threats from ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement persist, researchers are cautiously optimistic, also noting an increase in new mother whales and a higher birth rate, which are crucial for the species' long-term recovery.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Sequoia Park Zoo in Eureka, California, were surprised to find a wild American black bear inside the facility before it opened for the day. The bear was observed on a public walkway, peering into the bear habitat and interacting calmly with the zoo's three resident black bears through the enclosure's fencing. The "polite visitor," believed to have come from the adjacent Sequoia Park, did not act aggressively and was safely guided back into the woods by zoo and wildlife officials. The incident prompted a reminder for the public to maintain a safe distance from local wildlife.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition titled "Monuments," co-presented by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, provocatively displays nearly a dozen removed Confederate statues. The exhibition juxtaposes these controversial monuments, some still bearing graffiti from protests, with contemporary art that explores themes of race, history, and civil rights. The show opens in a charged political climate, as the Trump administration is actively working to reinstall some of these same statues in public spaces. By recontextualizing these figures within a museum setting, the curators aim to stimulate a deeper conversation about their meaning and the ongoing culture wars in America.</p>
