          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting follows a phone call between the two leaders, which Trump described as productive. In a strategic move to increase pressure on Moscow, the White House is also considering supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, a topic to be discussed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This renewed diplomatic push comes after Trump claimed a recent ceasefire deal in Gaza provides momentum for resolving other global conflicts.</p>

          <p>Chinese autonomous driving company Pony.ai is partnering with automotive giant Stellantis to expand its robotaxi services into the European market. The collaboration will begin with testing in Luxembourg, using Stellantis-provided electric vehicles like the Peugeot e-Traveller equipped with Pony.ai's self-driving software. This move is part of a broader trend of robotaxi companies expanding into Europe and the Middle East, following successful deployments in major U.S. and Chinese cities. The partnership aims to establish a strong safety record to gain regulatory approval for a gradual rollout across various European cities starting next year.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high for the third consecutive day, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. This performance stood in stark contrast to other major Asia-Pacific markets, which experienced significant losses. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and mainland China's CSI 300 both fell sharply, tracking a downturn on Wall Street that was fueled by renewed fears about the stability of the U.S. banking sector. The divergence highlights how specific geopolitical and economic factors are creating varied outcomes across the region's financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-acting injection to prevent HIV, called cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has been approved for use by the NHS in England and Wales, aligning their policy with Scotland. The shot, administered every two months, offers an alternative to daily PrEP pills and is intended to help end new HIV cases by 2030. It is considered a crucial option for individuals who find it difficult to adhere to a daily pill regimen due to practical or personal reasons, such as housing instability or lack of privacy. Health officials and charities have praised the approval as a game-changing tool for public health and for tackling inequalities in HIV prevention.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has refused the Trump administration's request to deploy National Guard troops within Illinois, upholding a lower court's restraining order. The three-judge panel determined that the president's action was a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment and that the administration failed to provide sufficient evidence of a "rebellion" that would justify such a move. The court noted that political opposition and protests against federal immigration policies do not constitute a rebellion against U.S. authority. This ruling maintains the block on the deployment, which President Trump had argued was necessary for crime prevention and protecting federal facilities in Chicago.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Greene King, a major UK pub chain, has stated that coffee shops and food delivery services are emerging as significant rivals for the traditional pub. Nick Mackenzie explained that these businesses are competing for consumers' leisure time and money, especially as a growing portion of the population, particularly younger people, do not drink alcohol. To adapt, pubs are improving their food and coffee offerings and creating more comfortable, less "dingy" environments to attract a broader clientele. The chain is also exploring "competitive socialising" activities to remain relevant in a changing hospitality landscape.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is working to establish direct export channels for its fresh durians to China, a move aimed at significantly increasing profits for its growers. Currently, many Indonesian durians reach the massive Chinese market indirectly through neighboring countries like Malaysia and Thailand, which assist with cold-chain logistics and phytosanitary approvals. By developing its own large-scale refrigeration infrastructure and streamlining certification processes, Indonesia hopes to bypass these intermediaries. This initiative would allow the nation to better capitalize on China's immense appetite for the fruit, as it consumes over 90% of the world's durian supply.</p>

          <p>The UK government is rolling out a digital identity card for military veterans, which can be downloaded to a smartphone via the new One Login app. This initiative is designed to make it easier for the country's 1.8 million veterans to prove their status and access dedicated services, such as healthcare, housing support, and retail discounts. While physical cards will still be available, ministers are positioning the optional digital version as a case study for a future mandatory digital ID scheme for all UK residents. Officials hope this initial launch will demonstrate the technology's security and convenience, addressing public concerns about the broader plan.</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Max Scherzer delivered a commanding performance, leading the Toronto Blue Jays to an 8-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series. The win evens the best-of-seven series at two games apiece. The 41-year-old Scherzer allowed only two runs over five and two-thirds innings in his 500th career major league start. Toronto's offense provided ample support, with Andrés Giménez contributing a home run and four RBIs, while Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his fifth home run of the postseason. The series will continue with a pivotal Game 5 in Seattle.</p>

          <p>Apple's latest smartphone, the iPhone Air, sold out within minutes of its launch in China, indicating strong consumer demand in the key market. According to Apple's website, the new model was unavailable for in-store pickup in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai shortly after bookings opened, and online shipment dates were pushed back by several weeks. This robust reception for Apple's thinnest-ever iPhone comes despite a challenging economic climate and intense competition from domestic brands like Huawei and Xiaomi. The strong sales highlight the enduring appeal of the Apple brand among Chinese consumers, especially in the high-end segment of the market.</p>

          <p>Mookie Betts, a finalist for a Gold Glove award at shortstop, made a spectacular defensive play in the ninth inning to help secure a 3-1 playoff victory for the Los Angeles Dodgers over the Milwaukee Brewers. The win puts the Dodgers one victory away from advancing to the World Series. Betts, who successfully transitioned from the outfield to shortstop this season, has been a key factor in the team's postseason success with both his stellar defense and strong hitting. His manager and teammates have praised his incredible work ethic and his ability to master one of baseball's most demanding positions, a move few believed was possible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's largest annual online shopping event, Singles' Day, has launched nearly a month ahead of its traditional November 11th date as retailers attempt to boost sluggish consumer spending. Major e-commerce platforms like Alibaba's Taobao and JD.com have already started their "11.11" sales campaigns in mid-October. This move is a response to a challenging economic environment in China, marked by a property crisis and high youth unemployment, which has made consumers more hesitant to spend. By extending the sales period, retailers hope to encourage purchasing and invigorate a retail sector that has been failing to meet growth expectations.</p>
