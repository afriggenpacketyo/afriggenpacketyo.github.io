          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the newly announced U.S. tariff schedule, with some expressing relief at lower-than-expected rates. Cambodia's prime minister welcomed its revised 19% duty, a significant reduction from a previously threatened 49%, as beneficial for its economy. Similarly, Thailand's finance minister noted its 19% tariff reflects a close partnership with the U.S. and helps maintain competitiveness. Meanwhile, Taiwan's president confirmed a 20% temporary tariff, which is lower than the initial proposal, and indicated that ongoing negotiations could lead to further reductions in the future.

Lohan expressed her excitement about returning to a role beloved by fans and noted that becoming a mother herself has given her a new perspective on the film's themes.

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels chose not to be major sellers at the MLB trade deadline, instead making small additions to their roster. General Manager Perry Minasian explained the decision was aimed at allowing the team's young core to play meaningful, competitive games in August and September. Rather than trading key players for future prospects, the Angels acquired two veteran relief pitchers and an infielder. The strategy is to build experience and a winning expectation for the current group, even though the team is currently under .500 and faces long odds for a playoff spot this season.</p>

          <p>The White House is set to begin construction on a new $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump has labeled his "gift to the country." The new building, designed to hold up to 650 people, will address the current White House's limited capacity for large-scale events. According to the press secretary, the project will be funded by President Trump and other "patriot donors" and will replace the current East Wing. This marks the first major structural change to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948, reflecting the president's real estate background.</p>

Figma's stock soared 250% on its first day of trading, pushing its market capitalization to nearly $68 billion, a significant outcome for a tech market that has seen few major IPOs in recent years. The successful debut comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe collapsed due to regulatory concerns.

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily halted the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The ruling postpones the expirations, which were set to begin in August, until a hearing can be held in November, affecting about 60,000 people. In her decision, Judge Trina Thompson criticized the administration's actions, suggesting the terminations were based on a predetermined agenda rather than an objective review of country conditions. TPS is granted to migrants from countries deemed unsafe for return due to natural disasters or civil conflict.</p>

          <h2>Potatoes Evolved from Ancient Tomato Ancestor, New Genetic Research Suggests</h2>

          <p>Researchers have published a study suggesting that the modern potato's ancestor is, unexpectedly, the tomato. According to findings in the journal Cell, the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through a hybridization event. The study explains that an ancient tomato provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to form tubers, while another species contributed a gene that controls their growth. By analyzing hundreds of genomes from both cultivated and wild potatoes, scientists believe they have finally solved the long-standing puzzle of the starchy vegetable's origins, demonstrating how inter-species breeding can create new traits.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC is facing a critical match against Pachuca in the 2025 Leagues Cup, needing a victory to keep their tournament hopes alive. The team is coming off a disappointing penalty shootout loss to Mazatlán, which has put them in a precarious position in the annual competition between MLS and Liga MX clubs. Coach Steve Cherundolo is expected to field his strongest lineup after resting several key players in the previous game. Pachuca enters the match with momentum after a 3-2 win over San Diego, making this a decisive contest for both sides at BMO Stadium.</p>

          <p>Apple announced strong financial results for its third quarter, with revenue growing 10% year-over-year to $94.04 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. The positive performance was driven by record sales for the iPhone and a strong showing from its services division, with growth seen across most geographic regions, including China. Despite the solid earnings, the company offered few new details on its artificial intelligence strategy, which remains a key point of focus for investors. CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed the company's significant investment in AI but provided no clear timeline for major updates, leaving Apple as a "show me" story in the AI space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery to become a Union naval hero and South Carolina lawmaker, will be the first monument honoring an individual African American on the state's capitol grounds. The sculpture is being created by artist Basil Watson and was made possible by a bipartisan push from state lawmakers. Smalls is celebrated for commandeering a Confederate ship to freedom in 1862 and for his later career as a champion of civil rights. The new monument is seen as a significant step in telling a more complete story of the state's history, joining statues that are currently all of White men.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profit for its second quarter, but its stock fell in after-hours trading due to investor concerns. While the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit saw revenue growth, it was not as substantial as rivals, and its profit margins declined. Furthermore, the company's guidance for third-quarter operating income fell short of Wall Street's expectations. Despite strong performance in its e-commerce and advertising businesses, the mixed signals from its high-margin cloud division and a cautious outlook tempered investor enthusiasm for the tech giant's performance.

          <p>Pop star Justin Timberlake has revealed he was battling a "relentlessly debilitating" case of Lyme disease throughout his recent Forget Tomorrow world tour. In a social media post, the 44-year-old singer explained that he wanted to shed light on his behind-the-scenes struggles with nerve pain and fatigue. He said the diagnosis, while shocking, helped him understand his symptoms and he made the personal decision to continue touring. Lyme disease is a bacterial illness transmitted by tick bites that can cause fever, muscle aches, and joint stiffness, which he powered through to complete the tour.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy to make its main civil service internship scheme exclusively available to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The change, effective in 2026, aims to increase the number of working-class young people in Whitehall to ensure it better reflects the country it serves. Eligibility will be determined by parental occupation when the student was 14. Successful interns will also be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program, creating a new pathway for underrepresented talent into senior government roles and addressing concerns that the civil service is too privileged.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a notably subdued trade deadline, opting for minor additions rather than the blockbuster deals made by some competitors. The team acquired veteran relief pitcher Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call, addressing needs in the bullpen and outfield without giving up significant prospect capital. The front office expressed strong faith in its current roster, believing the team is talented enough for a deep postseason run once key players return from injury and others return to form. This conservative strategy contrasts with aggressive moves made by rivals like the San Diego Padres and New York Mets.</p>
