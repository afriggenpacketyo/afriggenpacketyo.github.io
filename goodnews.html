          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers end a seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. Pitching three scoreless innings, Ohtani set a positive tone for the team, striking out four batters and allowing only one hit. Although still on a limited workload as he recovers from surgery, his effective outing provided a crucial spark for the Dodgers, who had been struggling to find momentum.</p>

          <p>A last-minute try by Jack van Poortvliet gave England a dramatic 22-17 victory over Argentina, securing a 2-0 series win in San Juan. The game was tightly contested, with the score tied at 17-17 for much of the second half before the decisive score in the final moments. The series victory is a significant achievement for a developing England side missing many of its senior players, marking their sixth consecutive Test win and demonstrating resilience ahead of their final summer match against the United States.</p>

          <p>As China faces a declining population, the rise of Artificial Intelligence is seen by some as a contributing factor, as it reduces traditional incentives for marriage and childbearing. Young adults increasingly see AI as a future source of companionship and elderly care, roles historically filled by family. However, this article presents an alternative view from a demography expert, who suggests that the AI revolution might redefine societal structures around life and family, potentially making traditional concerns about population numbers obsolete.</p>

          <p>In what was dubbed the "shortest call in show history," a 20-year listener of Dave Ramsey's financial advice program called in with a simple question. The caller, Chad, had $211,000 in cash and a remaining mortgage of $95,000, and asked if he should pay it off. Ramsey's immediate and unequivocal response was, "Good Lord. Pay it off today," reflecting his long-held financial philosophy that prioritizes becoming debt-free to achieve financial peace, even if it means forgoing potential investment gains.</p>

          <p>Tensions flared at the end of day three of the third Test between England and India, with the Indian team angered by what they perceived as England's time-wasting tactics. England opener Zak Crawley used delays, including calling for a physio, to ensure his side would only have to face one over before the close of play instead of two. England's bowling coach Tim Southee dismissed India's complaints, pointing out that Indian captain Shubman Gill had engaged in his own on-field delays earlier in the match.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has discreetly pushed back against criticism from the Trump administration regarding its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project. The central bank updated its website with a "Frequently Asked Questions" page to address claims made by the Office of Management and Budget, which called the project an "ostentatious overhaul." The Fed's page clarifies that no new VIP dining rooms are being built and explains that cost increases were driven by unforeseen conditions and design changes, not lavish spending.
