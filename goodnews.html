          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 00:00:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight in blind animals and enabling them to see infrared light. The study, published in Science, details how tellurium nanowire implants in a biocompatible device restored vision in mice and a monkey. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible and infrared light into electrical signals, acting as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina. This advancement holds significant potential for treating human blindness, offering a new approach to restoring vision and potentially granting enhanced visual capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified that Costco membership cards are not acceptable forms of identification for boarding domestic flights. This announcement follows the implementation of the REAL ID Act, which requires travelers to present REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs. The TSA emphasized this message in a Facebook post, humorously stating that while they appreciate Costco's hotdogs and rotisserie chickens, their membership cards do not meet REAL ID requirements. The confusion likely stems from the presence of stars on Costco cards, similar to the star markings on REAL ID-compliant cards. The public is reminded to visit their state's driver's licensing agency website to obtain a REAL ID.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, indicates that subsidies for fathers yield higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study also highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare primarily on women, which clashes with rapid economic changes.</p>

The carrier's Android smartphones and feature phones marketed from June will no longer include the Docomo emoji set, as Google's emoji have become more globally prevalent. Introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service, Docomo's emoji gained immense popularity in Japan and were later recognized by the Museum of Modern Art in New York for their role in humanizing electronic communication.

De Kai's book, "Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future," suggests that this approach can help ensure AI develops in a way that benefits humanity rather than leading to its demise.
