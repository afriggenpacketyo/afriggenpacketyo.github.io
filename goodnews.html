          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head football coach Deion Sanders has publicly revealed he was diagnosed with an aggressive, high-risk form of bladder cancer. During a press conference with his medical team, it was disclosed that he underwent surgery to remove his bladder, which was then reconstructed using his own intestines. Sanders, who appeared emotional but in good spirits, confirmed he is now considered cancer-free and plans to continue coaching the team this season. His doctors stated his prognosis is very good, and he will be monitored with routine surveillance scans.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona has rapidly intensified to become the first hurricane in the central Pacific Ocean this year, reaching Category 1 strength. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center stated that the storm is not an immediate threat to the Hawaiian Islands and is projected to remain well to the south. Iona is expected to strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane before gradually weakening later in the week as it moves westward. While the central Pacific has been quiet, the eastern Pacific has already seen several named storms this season, including two major hurricanes.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles luxury real estate market is showing significant strength, highlighted by Paris Hilton and her husband Carter Reum's recent purchase of a Beverly Hills mansion for $63 million. The property was previously owned by Mark Wahlberg, who sold it for a lower price in 2023 to avoid a new mansion tax. Real estate agents report that demand is high, fueled by buyers displaced by wildfires and increasing interest from foreign investors, particularly from China. In June, five of the top ten most expensive home sales in the U.S. were in California, indicating a robust high-end market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a meeting in Scotland, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer presented a European-led peace plan for Gaza to U.S. President Donald Trump. The proposal was developed in collaboration with France and Germany following the breakdown of previous U.S.-led negotiations. The plan aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and establish a sustainable path toward a two-state solution. While Trump emphasized feeding children as the immediate priority, Starmer's government is also facing domestic pressure to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, a move his spokesperson described as a matter of "when, not if."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must continue reimbursing Planned Parenthood clinics for Medicaid-funded services nationwide. The order blocks a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to end Medicaid payments for one year to certain abortion providers. Judge Indira Talwani wrote that restricting access to care would likely cause adverse health consequences, including increases in unintended pregnancies and untreated STIs. Planned Parenthood had argued that cutting off Medicaid funds would force the closure of nearly 200 clinics, potentially causing over a million patients to lose access to essential healthcare services.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have recently seen a slight decline, making them a more attractive borrowing option for homeowners. With rates on credit cards and personal loans remaining high, tapping into home equity can be a more cost-effective financing source. Financial experts advise prospective borrowers to carefully compare both loan products, shop around for the best rates from different lenders, and precisely determine the amount of equity they need to borrow. This ensures responsible borrowing, as the home itself serves as collateral for these types of loans. (not investment advice)</p>

Healy warned that without these "seed" venues, where artists like The Smiths and Amy Winehouse started, the talent pipeline for the UK music industry could dry up. The festival, organized by live music platform GigPig, will see over 1,000 pubs, bars, and restaurants host events in September.

          <p>For individuals reducing their red meat consumption, nutrition experts highlight several alternative sources of iron to prevent deficiency. While red meat is a rich source, studies have linked it to increased risks of Type 2 diabetes, cancer, and dementia. Registered dietitians recommend iron-rich, plant-based foods such as lentils, beans, tofu, spinach, and pumpkin seeds. Certain seafood, including oysters, clams, and sardines, are also excellent sources. To improve the body's absorption of iron from plant-based foods, it is beneficial to pair them with foods high in vitamin C, such as citrus fruits or bell peppers.</p>

The downgrades to a neutral rating were primarily based on the stock's current valuation following a significant rally, with shares more than doubling since April. Mizuho simultaneously raised its price target for the company, citing accelerating margin expansion and strong orders. The sentiment suggests that while the stock's rapid appreciation has made it fully valued in the short term, its fundamental business prospects, particularly in gas turbine production, remain attractive for long-term investors.
