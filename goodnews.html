          <p>The article discusses the display of Mexican flags during protests against ICE raids in Los Angeles. The author argues that the Mexican flag's presence is a symbol of Californian history and the contributions of Mexican immigrants.  The author contrasts this with the negative portrayal of Mexican immigrants by President Trump and calls for a more inclusive understanding of American identity. The piece concludes by asserting that the Mexican flag is as American as other cultural symbols.</p>
