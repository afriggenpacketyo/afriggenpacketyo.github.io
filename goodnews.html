          <p>The Princess of Wales has withdrawn from a planned appearance at Royal Ascot as she continues her gradual return to public life following her cancer diagnosis last year. According to royal sources, Catherine is trying to find the right balance as she fully returns to public engagements, and she was said to be disappointed to miss the sporting occasion in Berkshire, where she would have appeared in the carriage procession. She was due to attend on Wednesday with her husband the Prince of Wales, King Charles and Queen Camilla. Catherine was last seen smiling and joking with other royals on Monday during the Order of the Garter service in Windsor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has endorsed David Ellison's Skydance takeover of Paramount Global, despite his $20 billion lawsuit against CBS, a Paramount subsidiary, over a "60 Minutes" interview. Trump expressed hope the deal goes through, linking the merger-review delay to his lawsuit. Paramount seeks a settlement to clear the path for the Skydance acquisition, which needs FCC approval. The deal faces a regulatory hurdle: FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's consent to transfer CBS television station licenses to the Ellisons from the Redstones, and the Senate approved Trump's second Republican appointment to the panel, Olivia Trusty.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Zillow indicates that a home's interior paint colors can boost its sale price by almost $2,600, with olive green being the hottest kitchen color. Buyers are willing to pay up to $1,600 more for a kitchen with olive green cabinets, while classic navy walls in the bedroom can increase the sale price by an estimated $1,815. Dark gray living rooms are also preferred, potentially boosting an offer by about $2,600, while bright, playful colors like lemon yellow or scarlet red can negatively impact the sale price. These findings highlight the importance of aesthetic considerations when selling a home.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, after a second trial. The jury also acquitted her of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene, but convicted her of driving while intoxicated. Her lawyers argued she was framed for O'Keefe's death, and the first trial collapsed after the jury couldn't reach a verdict. This verdict concludes a high-profile case that has garnered significant attention.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, keeping the key borrowing rate in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, and indicated that two cuts are still possible by the end of 2025. Economic projections suggest stagflationary pressures, with GDP expected to advance at a 1.4% pace in 2025 and inflation hitting 3%. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated the central bank is well-positioned to wait for more clarity before adjusting policies.

          <p>There is no official minimum debt threshold to qualify for bankruptcy, but it makes sense to consider it when unsecured debt is more than half of annual income. Warning signs include making only minimum payments, borrowing from one card to pay another, calls from debt collectors, and an impact on housing or utilities. Alternatives to bankruptcy include debt settlement, debt management plans, debt consolidation loans, budgeting and side income, and hardship programs. Filing for bankruptcy can provide a fresh start, but it also comes with long-term consequences (not investment advice).</p>

The rising temperatures are due to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, where parts of France and Spain could see temperatures close to 40C. A Met Office study indicates a rapidly increasing risk of 40C temperatures in the UK, potentially within the next 12 years, driven by climate change.</p>
