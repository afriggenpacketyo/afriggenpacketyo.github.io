        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals new to investing, stock market terminology can seem daunting, but many terms are simpler than they appear. Volatility refers to how much a stock's price fluctuates, while diversification involves spreading investments across different asset classes to manage risk. An investment horizon is the period an investor expects to keep their money invested before needing it, ranging from short-term to long-term goals. Understanding these terms can help new investors gain confidence and make informed decisions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The term 'wife guy,' often used to describe men who publicly express affection for their wives, has evolved into a derogatory label. However, the author argues that this negativity is misplaced, as genuine expressions of love should not be discouraged. The term emerged alongside social media trends and the #MeToo movement, initially as a welcome corrective to scummy behavior. Despite the risk of being perceived as performative, embracing vulnerability and openly expressing love is a valuable and worthwhile pursuit.</p>
