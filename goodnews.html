          <p>The article reports that new college graduates are encountering a more challenging job market than anticipated, with the unemployment rate rising to 5.8% in March. Factors contributing to this include federal job cuts driven by policy changes, employment uncertainty related to tariffs, and growing concerns about job losses due to artificial intelligence. Despite these challenges, experts advise graduates to maintain a positive mindset and consider opportunities in smaller firms, which may offer better prospects for growth and entrepreneurship. The article suggests that while the entry-level job landscape may be redefining itself, opportunities still exist in sectors like hospitality, education, and sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has offered to sell its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites without the Teams communication app to address concerns raised by European regulators regarding competition. The European Commission is examining Microsoft's practice of bundling Teams with its productivity tools, following a complaint from Slack in 2020 alleging abuse of market power. Microsoft's proposed commitments include offering versions of Office 365 and Microsoft 365 without Teams at a reduced price, enhancing interoperability for Teams' competitors, and allowing customers to move their data to competing products. Salesforce, which acquired Slack, stated that it will carefully scrutinize Microsoft's proposed commitments to ensure they provide an effective remedy to the anticompetitive practices.</p>

Trump also indicated progress in nuclear talks with Iran, while reiterating that the U.S. would not permit Tehran to develop nuclear weapons. He addressed the conflict in Gaza, acknowledging civilian suffering, and decided against traveling to Turkey to support cease-fire talks involving Russia and Ukraine, citing low expectations for a breakthrough.</p>

The birds create vortices in the water using their head movements and webbed toes, pushing food towards their bills. The shape of the bill also creates a tiny tornado as it pulls out of the water, stirring up prey and trapping it. These techniques could inspire new water filtration methods.</p>
