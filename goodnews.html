        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's consumer price index (CPI) eased to 2.82% in May, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, marking the lowest level since February 2019. The year-on-year inflation rate fell below Reuters' median poll estimate of 3% and was lower than April's 3.16% print, with food inflation significantly dropping to 0.99% from 1.78% in April. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been relaxing monetary policy, recently cutting its benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.50%, in response to the easing inflationary pressures. Nomura economists predict a subdued CPI of 3.3% for fiscal year 2026, with expectations of further rate cuts by the RBI, but these are just predictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paige Bueckers, the WNBA's No. 1 draft pick, scored a career-high 35 points in her return from injury, but the Phoenix Mercury defeated the Dallas Wings 93-80. Bueckers also set season highs with five three-pointers, contributing six rebounds and four assists, although she felt she could have been more disruptive and used her voice more. Alyssa Thomas added a double-double in her return from a calf injury, and Satou Sabally contributed 20 points and nine rebounds for the Mercury. Despite Bueckers' scoring feats, the Wings struggled, with leading scorer Arike Ogunbowale held to just 10 points on 2-of-10 shooting.</p>

          <p>Apple's new software design, called Liquid Glass, has been met with mixed reactions from users, with some criticizing its translucent backgrounds and readability. This redesign comes as Apple rolls out its AI features, named Apple Intelligence, which includes summarized notifications and a Clean Up tool for photos. Despite the initial mixed reviews, Apple executives are defending their decision to delay releasing more AI features, emphasizing the importance of getting the features right rather than rushing them out. Google is positioning itself as a clear alternative for users seeking more advanced AI features, showcasing a prototype that can use phone cameras and microphones to perform tasks on behalf of the user.</p>

Meta has a policy against non-consensual intimate imagery and has previously removed ads for nudify technology and blocked associated websites.

          <p>China's state media, specifically Qiushi, the Communist Party's top theoretical journal, has praised Pop Mart's Labubu toy for its creativity and global success. The commentary suggests Labubu's popularity demonstrates China's shift from low-value goods production to innovation, and Qiushi likened the toy's success to other globally acclaimed Chinese products. Pop Mart collaborates with artists to produce toy characters, and its overseas revenue has significantly increased, with Labubu being its most popular product designed by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung. The toy's popularity has also led to a wave of counterfeit products, highlighting its widespread appeal.</p>

          <p>The backlog in routine hospital treatments in England has decreased to its lowest level in two years, with the waiting list dropping to 7.39 million at the end of April, according to recent data. However, the NHS has not met its target of 92% of patients being seen in 18 weeks for nine years, with the current rate just below 60%, and the government has made meeting this target a key mission. Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting stated that the NHS is on the road to recovery, with a 3% annual budget increase and upcoming reforms planned to build on these achievements. The peak of the waiting list occurred in September 2023, reaching nearly 7.8 million.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of Brazilian football fans suggests that pre-match rituals can be more emotionally intense than the game itself, but the author argues that a sociological perspective is essential for understanding the full fan experience. Football elicits a wide range of emotions, and simply measuring heart rates doesn't capture the cultural significance and diverse interpretations of the game. Football offers a sense of community and identity in an increasingly individualistic world, and it generates comprehensible narratives, and it occasionally offers moments of scintillating drama.</p>

          <p>Despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's historical opposition to nuclear deals with Iran, an analyst suggests that Israel should welcome a potential agreement between President Trump and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The analyst argues that among bad options, a nuclear agreement could be the least bad, as it could lead to a more regionally integrated Iran with a stake in regional peace and stability. A diplomatic deal would curtail Iran's nuclear program and put the country on a path defined by its economic and pragmatic interests, potentially leading to a less belligerent foreign policy.</p>
