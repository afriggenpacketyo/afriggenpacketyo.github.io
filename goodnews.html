          <p>President Trump is anticipated to announce a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, a move that could potentially alleviate investor anxiety surrounding the administration's global tariff policies. The post-Brexit UK aims to secure an independent trade deal separate from its European partners. While details remain unclear, the UK is reportedly considering reducing tariffs on US cars and digital sales taxes affecting US tech companies. Investors are closely monitoring whether Trump can de-escalate the trade war, which has previously triggered chaos in US stock markets. Optimism surrounding the deal is tempered by the potential impact of existing tariffs and ongoing trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cultivation of a relationship with President Trump appears to be paying off with an imminent trade agreement between the US and Britain. This deal offers a much-needed political victory for Starmer, who has been grappling with faltering economic growth and unpopular austerity measures. While details remain unclear and potential hurdles exist, such as balancing relations with the EU and addressing concerns from British farmers, the agreement signifies a strengthening of the "special relationship" between the two countries. Starmer's efforts to act as a bridge between Europe and the United States have seemingly contributed to this successful outcome.</p>

          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its upcoming Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking the first sales forecast since the announcement of the new device. The company also reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results, revealing a decline in revenue and profit, which was expected as consumers await the new console. Nintendo's forecasts are based on current US tariff rates, and the company acknowledges that additional tariffs could impact demand in the US market. The Japanese gaming giant is navigating a complex trade landscape as it prepares to launch its highly anticipated Switch 2 console.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has achieved a significant political victory by finalizing a trade deal with the United States, especially after facing pressure to rethink domestic policies following poor local election results. This deal, coming shortly after a free trade agreement with India, provides a boost to the UK economy and strengthens its trade ties. While the specific details of the deal are still emerging, it is expected to reduce tariffs on specific goods and benefit both countries. The agreement is seen as a testament to Starmer's efforts to forge a strong relationship with President Trump, despite criticisms from opposition parties.</p>
