          <p>A Monrovia, California resident shared security footage of a black bear roaming her backyard before entering her home. The homeowner's 17-year-old dog, Doodle, confronted the bear in the kitchen, barking and growling until the bear left the house. The homeowner woke up to find the bear in her kitchen, just ten feet from her bed. She credited Doodle with saving the day, as the brave canine took the initiative to chase the predator away, preventing any harm to the homeowner or further damage to the property.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate reached 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, increasing pressure on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to raise rates. The figure exceeded economists' expectations and is above the BOJ's 2% target for the 38th consecutive month. The BOJ has held rates at 0.5% but indicated it would continue to raise rates once it has more conviction that underlying inflation will approach 2%. Japan's GDP also shrank 0.2% in the quarter ended March, marking the first contraction in a year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effective in reducing shoreline pollution. Local and state plastic bag policies enacted from 2016 to 2023 have reduced the share of plastic bags collected during shoreline cleanups by as much as 47%. Fee-based policies appear to be more effective than full bans, while partial bans are the least effective. The study also suggests that plastic bag laws may reduce harm to marine life, with a reduction in entangled animals observed in areas with such policies.</p>
