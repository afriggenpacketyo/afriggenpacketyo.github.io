          <p>The article reviews "Relay," a new paranoid thriller directed by David Mackenzie, starring Riz Ahmed as Ash, a solitary off-the-grid fixer. Ash specializes in helping whistleblowers disappear from dangerous entities, utilizing a text-telephone service for traceless communication. The film's premise offers a cynical update on classic 1970s thrillers, exploring the uneasy truce between individuals and powerful tormentors. The narrative follows biotech scientist Sarah, played by Lily James, as Ash guides her through a high-stakes cat-and-mouse chase, revealing his own past as a failed whistleblower and the isolating nature of his work.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Northern Virginia is actively working to prevent the extinction of over 20 species, including the Przewalski's horse and black-footed ferret. Scientists at the institute study reproduction, ecology, genetics, and migration with the goal of reintroducing species to their natural habitats. Conservation biologists express concern over the accelerating rate of species disappearance, noting the cascading effects on ecosystems when one species is lost. The article highlights successful efforts, such as the growth in the black-footed ferret population, demonstrating the critical role these institutions play in global conservation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses how the Ukraine war is reshaping geopolitics in the former Soviet Union, notably seen in the US-brokered peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia, reducing Russia's traditional influence. While Russia officially welcomed the deal, some internal voices view it as a significant humiliation for Moscow. Azerbaijan is leveraging this shift to build new alliances with countries like Turkey and Central Asian states, asserting greater independence. The conflict has also exposed Russia's perceived weaknesses, leading other former Soviet states to adopt more multi-vector foreign policies and engage more with powers like China.</p>

The article notes potential travel disruptions due to rail strikes and engineering works over the weekend, impacting major events like Notting Hill Carnival and music festivals.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's hint at potential interest rate cuts ahead significantly boosted Wall Street, particularly non-tech, economically sensitive stocks like DuPont and Home Depot. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new all-time high, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallied but did not surpass previous milestones, with tech stocks showing more muted gains tied to AI trends rather than borrowing costs. The article notes strong quarterly earnings from Palo Alto Networks, Home Depot, and TJX Companies, and the launch of Disney's ESPN streaming app. The CNBC Investing Club made a trade, purchasing more Cisco Systems shares.

          <p>A central Berlin street, formerly known by a name with overt racist connotations, has been officially renamed Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse, honoring the first Africa-born scholar to receive a European doctorate. The decision, initially announced in 2020, faced legal challenges from residents but was upheld by the Higher Administrative Court. The renaming coincides with International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition. Anton Wilhelm Amo, enslaved as a boy from Ghana, became a philosopher and legal scholar in 18th-century Germany. This change is seen as a significant act of decolonization, acknowledging Black history and resistance in Germany.</p>

          <p>The article addresses a common retirement dilemma: a 66-year-old, Alex, who gave a year's notice, is now asked to stay two extra months as a part-time consultant to train his replacement. This scenario raises questions about potential impacts on retirement benefits, particularly Social Security, if he starts collecting while still earning income. The article advises that delaying Social Security could increase future benefits, and continued work allows for more 401(k) contributions and employer-provided health insurance. Ultimately, working longer generally improves retirement finances, but the decision involves weighing financial gains against personal retirement plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's efforts to withhold Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grant funding from 34 "sanctuary" cities and counties. These municipalities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, and Boston, limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The administration had sought to strip hundreds of millions of dollars in grants, arguing against subsidizing policies that impede immigration control. This ruling expands a previous order and represents a significant legal setback for the Trump administration's attempts to compel cooperation from local governments on immigration matters.</p>
