          <p>Senate Republicans are scheduled to meet to discuss President Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' with the Senate Finance Committee meeting at the White House with the president to discuss the tax policy components, including the extension of the 2017 tax cuts. The entire committee, along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and GOP Whip John Barrasso, are expected to attend the meeting. Senate Republicans will also meet behind closed doors to discuss the bill's parameters, as GOP leadership aims to expedite its progress in the upper chamber. The Finance Committee is responsible for writing the tax policy components of the bill, including the extension of the Trump 2017 tax cuts, a key priority for the package.</p>

          <p>Labor groups and elected officials are campaigning for a minimum wage of at least $25 per hour in Los Angeles County, citing the steep increase in the cost of living. A person living in L.A. County without children must earn about $28 an hour to cover basic expenses, according to MIT's living wage calculator. The campaign is expected to face opposition from business groups, who warn that increasing labor costs could force businesses to close or reduce services. The current minimum wage in Los Angeles is $17.28, slightly higher than the state's minimum wage.</p>

          <p>The England women's national football team, the Lionesses, are evaluating their performance following a mixed week of matches. Manager Wiegman had to deal with Mary Earps' retirement and Millie Bright's withdrawal, but Aggie Beever-Jones showcased England's attacking depth with a hat-trick against Portugal. The week concluded with a 2-1 loss to Spain in the Nations League, prompting discussions about the team's readiness for the upcoming Euros. Despite the loss, Wiegman remains optimistic, viewing the game as a learning opportunity and emphasizing the importance of giving players the necessary minutes to prepare for the summer tournament.</p>

          <p>The UK has been exempted from President Trump's executive order that doubles tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%. While the order increases import taxes for US firms buying from other countries, the levy remains at 25% for the UK. A UK-US tariff pact signed in May, which will eliminate all import taxes on steel and aluminum, has not yet taken effect. The UK government has stated its commitment to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge ruled that the Bureau of Prisons must continue providing transgender inmates gender-affirming care, despite an executive order from President Trump to halt funding for such care. Judge Royce Lamberth allowed a group of over 2,000 transgender inmates to pursue a lawsuit challenging the order as a class action, ordering the Bureau of Prisons to provide hormone therapy and accommodations like clothing and hair-removal devices. The ruling does not require surgical care related to gender transitions, and a White House spokesperson stated the Trump administration expects to ultimately prevail in the legal dispute. The ACLU, representing the prisoners, hailed the ruling as a reminder that trans people have constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>Mondelƒìz International, the company behind Oreo cookies, has filed a lawsuit in the U.S. against Aldi, accusing the supermarket chain of copying the packaging of its snacks. Mondelƒìz claims that Aldi's similar packaging is likely to deceive consumers and capitalize on the Oreo brand's fame and prestige. The lawsuit includes side-by-side comparisons of Mondelƒìz products with Aldi's versions, also targeting Wheat Thins, Nutter Butter, Chips Ahoy!, and Ritz. Mondelƒìz asserts that Aldi has continued to produce unacceptable copies despite previous communications, and that allowing Aldi to continue would irreparably harm the Mondelƒìz brand.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve Board has announced the removal of the $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed on Wells Fargo since February 2018, a punishment stemming from past misconduct. This restriction had prevented the bank from growing key business lines for years, and its removal is expected to unlock new growth opportunities. Wells Fargo shares are up more than 2% in after-hours trading following the announcement. While some of Wells Fargo's stock gains in recent months reflect the market pricing in the eventual removal of the asset cap, the Club believes there is plenty more upside that can be realized from here.
