          <p>State health officials have officially declared the end of a major measles outbreak in Texas that infected 762 people and resulted in two pediatric deaths. The outbreak, the state's largest in three decades, is considered contained after 42 days passed without a new case. The response involved extensive testing, vaccination efforts, and public education campaigns. Despite this success, officials remain vigilant, warning that new cases are likely due to ongoing outbreaks elsewhere and declining vaccination rates, which have left many communities vulnerable to the highly contagious and preventable disease.</p>

          <p>Labor Day, celebrated on the first Monday of September, marks the unofficial end of summer and honors the contributions of American workers. The federal holiday, which falls on September 1st this year, originated from the labor movement's fight for better working conditions in the late 19th century. While many government services, banks, and the postal service will be closed, most major retailers and restaurants are expected to remain open, though some may have reduced hours. The article provides a practical overview of the holiday's history and what services and businesses will be available to the public.</p>

          <p>The musical "& Juliet" offers a modern, feminist reimagining of Shakespeare's classic tragedy, exploring what might have happened if Juliet had not died. The production, praised for its energetic direction and clever book, uses a catalog of hit songs from producer Max Martin to create a euphoric, dance-party atmosphere. Instead of its tragic end, Juliet travels to Paris with friends, embarking on a journey of self-discovery and empowerment. The review highlights standout performances and celebrates the show's witty script and successful integration of pop anthems, transforming a well-known story into a feel-good spectacle.</p>

          <p>While there are no federal age limits for purchasing annuities, individual insurance companies often set their own restrictions, typically capping buyers between 80 and 85 years old. The article explains that the timing of an annuity purchase is a critical factor, as it impacts both cost and payout amounts, which are calculated based on life expectancy. Financial advisors often suggest considering annuities in one's late 50s to mid-60s to balance growth potential and favorable rates. Ultimately, the decision should align with an individual's broader retirement strategy rather than being based solely on age. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, "Saturday Night Live" cast member Bowen Yang reflected on his journey to the show, which he says was an unexpected fulfillment of a high school superlative. Yang initially pursued a pre-med degree before realizing his true passion was for performance, and he discusses how pop culture served as a crucial tool for assimilation after moving from Quebec to Colorado as a child. He also shares anecdotes about his podcast "Las Culturistas," his experience portraying JD Vance on SNL, and hiding a copy of "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" as a teenager, viewing it as "cultural contraband."</p>

          <p>The conservative network Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems. The suit alleged that Newsmax knowingly aired false claims that the company's equipment was used to rig the 2020 presidential election against Donald Trump. This settlement follows a similar, larger case where Fox News paid Dominion $787.5 million. In a statement, Newsmax maintained that its coverage was fair and balanced, while Dominion expressed it was pleased to have resolved the matter, marking another significant financial consequence for media outlets that spread election misinformation.</p>

According to the Kiel Institute, Europe as a whole has provided $165.7 billion, compared to the U.S. total of $130.6 billion, contradicting some claims made by President Trump. The report clarifies that while the U.S. is the largest single-country donor, the collective European effort is greater. Both the U.S. and European allies have provided a mixture of grants and loans to support Ukraine's military, financial, and humanitarian needs.</p>

The study found that reported conflicts on the panel had declined from over 42% in the early 2000s to just 5% in 2024, directly challenging Kennedy's assertion that the committee was rife with conflicts. Researchers noted that significant progress has been made over the last two decades to reduce such conflicts on influential public health committees.</p>
