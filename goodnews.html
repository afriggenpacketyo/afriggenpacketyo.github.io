          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold another 225,000 shares of the company's stock, valued at approximately $37 million. This transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, under which he may sell up to 6 million shares. The sale comes as Nvidia's market capitalization surpasses $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company, driven by soaring demand for its AI-powering graphics processing units. The company also announced plans to resume sales of its H20 chips to China following indications of license approval from the U.S. government. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Producer Price Index (PPI), a key measure of wholesale inflation, showed no change in June, contrary to economists' expectations of a 0.2% increase. This report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that the impact of President Trump's tariffs on U.S. prices has been marginal so far. While the overall figure was flat, final demand for goods did rise, offset by a drop in services prices. On a year-over-year basis, the headline PPI increased by 2.3%, its lowest level since September 2024, providing a conflicting signal on future inflation trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican senators have decided to exempt the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) from a broader package of government spending cuts. The initial plan sought to rescind $400 million from the globally recognized HIV/Aids program, which was launched under President George W. Bush and is credited with saving millions of lives. Following bipartisan concern, the amendment to protect Pepfar's funding was introduced, reducing the total proposed cuts to $9 billion. The White House has indicated its support for the amendment, which helps ensure the continuation of life-saving services worldwide.</p>

While national average rates for CDs are modest, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some one-year CDs offering yields above 4.30%.
