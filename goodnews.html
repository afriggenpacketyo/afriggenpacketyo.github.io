          <p>NFL owners have unanimously approved allowing players to compete in flag football at the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. The league will negotiate safety and scheduling logistics with the NFL Players Association and international governing bodies, with a limit of one player per NFL club. Flag football, a five-on-five non-contact sport, was approved as an Olympic sport in October 2023, along with baseball/softball, cricket, lacrosse, and squash. The NFL's push to expand the sport's popularity outside North America is evident in the seven regular-season games planned internationally for next season in Brazil, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Ireland.</p>

          <p>CEOs from various sectors, including auto, housing, travel, and advertising, shared their perspectives on consumer spending and the economy at the CNBC CEO Council Summit. While concerns about consumer sentiment and tariff-related price increases persist, some sectors, like homebuilding for older homebuyers, remain strong. Carvana's CEO noted a pull-forward in car sales due to tariff fears but sees no evidence of growing consumer weakness. Airline CEO Barry Biffle expressed optimism about consumer spending rebounding, while homebuilder Sheryl Palmer highlighted the resilience of older homebuyers. These insights offer a mixed view of the economic landscape, with some sectors showing strength despite broader concerns.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued an order temporarily reinstating the floor privileges of Maine Republican Rep. Laurel Libby, who was sanctioned for posting a photo of a transgender high school athlete. The Court's decision, with Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissenting, underscores the importance of protecting a legislator's right to represent their constituents, regardless of their views. While Libby's actions were offensive, stripping her of her voting rights would disenfranchise her constituents and undermine democratic principles. The case highlights the complexities of balancing free speech with the need to protect vulnerable individuals from harm.</p>
