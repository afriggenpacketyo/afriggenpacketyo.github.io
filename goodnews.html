          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk surged after new trial data indicated its weight management drug, Wegovy (semaglutide), significantly outperforms rivals like Eli Lilly's tirzepatide in reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death by up to 57%. This positive outcome comes as the company navigates an increasingly competitive weight loss market, despite Denmark recently halving its economic growth forecast partly due to Novo's declining U.S. market share. The findings reinforce Wegovy's position as a leading treatment for both weight management and cardiovascular health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool's acquisition of elite strikers Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak signals a significant tactical shift under manager Arne Slot. This article explores five potential formations, including a squeezed 4-2-3-1 and a more fragile 4-4-2, to integrate both players alongside existing stars. The analysis suggests that while some configurations might be risky, the club's busy schedule means a "best XI" concept is outdated, with Ekitike likely to be a versatile cover option. The manager's challenge lies in balancing offensive power with midfield stability for the upcoming season.</p>

Alibaba's core e-commerce business also showed signs of revival, with new "instant commerce" features offering one-hour deliveries in China.

          <p>England has launched the final phase of its largest-ever childcare expansion, providing 30 hours of government-funded care for children aged nine months to four years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called it a "landmark moment," but parents face long waiting lists due to nursery staff shortages and regional availability issues. Providers note that funding rates often fall short of costs, leading to additional charges for families and potential inequalities. While aiming to boost the economy and children's development, the scheme faces significant implementation challenges.</p>

          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, 81, sustained a fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple cuts, and other injuries in a car accident in New Hampshire. His spokesperson stated that prior to the crash, Giuliani had stopped to assist a woman who was a victim of a domestic violence incident, contacting 911 and remaining on scene until officers arrived. While recovering in a Manchester-area hospital, he is reported to be in good spirits and is expected to wear a brace for his injury.

          <p>ScotRail has permanently abolished peak rail fares, eliminating higher prices for weekday rush hour travel and offering significant savings for passengers, such as a nearly 50% reduction on Edinburgh to Glasgow tickets. This initiative, previously piloted and then reinstated, aims to encourage more commuters to use trains instead of cars, thereby reducing CO2 emissions. While an earlier pilot scheme saw limited success in boosting passenger numbers, the Scottish government, championing the policy, hopes this permanent change will make public transport more affordable and accessible. The new system also simplifies ticketing for customers.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered brine shrimp, also known as Artemia, in a highly saline wildlife water source within Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region's Taklamakan Desert. These ancient, salt-tolerant crustaceans, dating back 400 million years, are widely used as aquaculture feed and possess medicinal and cosmetic value. The finding suggests that the city of Aral possesses natural conditions suitable for cultivating such organisms. Further laboratory studies will determine if it's a new species and identify the scientific support needed to develop commercial aquaculture in the region, potentially unlocking a new economic opportunity.</p>

          <p>Greek and German police, collaborating on a tip from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, have dismantled a significant criminal ring smuggling cocaine from Spain into Greece and other European countries. The operation involved hiding drugs in trucks, mainly registered in Bulgaria for Greek-owned companies, with Greek and Bulgarian drivers. Five suspected members were arrested in Greece and Germany, with more at large. Authorities confiscated over 300 kg of cocaine, and the gang's estimated profit exceeds 5 million euros.

          <p>China's RatingDog manufacturing PMI unexpectedly rose to 50.5 in August, indicating the fastest expansion in five months and beating estimates. This growth was primarily fueled by a recovery in new export orders, suggesting external demand resilience despite tariffs. However, the article notes that gains in overall output and new orders were muted, reflecting little improvement in domestic demand. Employment in the manufacturing sector remained bleak, reducing jobs for a fifth consecutive month. The durability of this upturn depends on sustained exports and a pickup in domestic demand.
