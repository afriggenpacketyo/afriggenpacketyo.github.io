          <p>The University of Tokyo is considering a plan to temporarily accept international students from Harvard University if they are barred from studying at the U.S. institution. The Japanese university stated that it is currently examining the details of such a plan. This consideration follows potential moves by the U.S. government that could impact international students studying at Harvard, prompting the University of Tokyo to explore offering these students an alternative academic opportunity.</p>

          <p>The article explores the unique experiences of NBA players on small-market teams, contrasting them with the high-profile lives of players in major cities. Two-time NBA All-Star Reggie Theus recalls the hometown feel and personal connections he experienced playing in Sacramento and Orlando, noting that teammates often did more together. Michael Ray Richardson, a four-time All-Star, emphasizes the community impact a winning team can have in smaller markets, creating a college-like atmosphere. Robert Parish highlights the importance of tradition and fan loyalty in both large and small NBA cities, concluding that victories translate to both types of environments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the increasing popularity of food-rating apps that assess the healthfulness of packaged foods, while also noting the importance of approaching these apps with skepticism. Nutrition experts recommend using apps that assess overall nutrient content rather than focusing solely on individual ingredients, and advise consumers to avoid panicking over minor additives. The apps increase consumer awareness and improve nutrition knowledge, though their overall impact on dietary intake may be limited. Former federal food policy official Jerold Mande suggests government standards for app data to enhance usefulness.</p>

          <p>This story recounts an incident where a mother, Tulika Prasad, experienced a challenging moment in public with her autistic son, Vedant, who had a meltdown in a grocery store. A stranger stepped in to offer help, unloading the shopping cart and later paying for the groceries. The woman revealed that she also had a child with autism, providing empathy and comfort without offering unsolicited advice. This act of kindness helped Prasad feel less vulnerable and more supported as a parent of an autistic child.</p>

          <p>Japan has begun allowing Taiwanese individuals marrying Japanese citizens to list Taiwan as their place of origin in the family registry system, a change welcomed by Taiwan but opposed by China. Previously, the registry listed Taiwanese individuals as being from China. The Justice Ministry's revision aligns the family registry with Japan's residence registry, aiming to protect the rights and interests of Taiwanese in Japan. This decision reflects Japan's stance of maintaining non-governmental relations with Taiwan while respecting China's claim over the island.</p>

Fara Williams was one of the few to include all top-four teams in her predictions, showcasing the unpredictable nature of sports outcomes despite advanced analytical models.</p>
