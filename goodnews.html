          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued after being trapped behind a waterfall in California for two days. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down the Seven Teacups waterfalls when strong water hydraulics forced him off his lines and stranded him. After being reported missing, an extensive search involving aircraft and a drone located him alive and responsive. A California Highway Patrol helicopter was used to hoist him to safety, where he was treated for dehydration and minor injuries before being reunited with his family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, moving beyond Westernized dishes to offer authentic, regional cuisine from areas like Hunan and Zhejiang. Using Singapore as a launchpad, brands such as Luckin and Nong Geng Ji are testing diverse palates before expanding to other parts of Asia, North America, and beyond. This culinary movement challenges outdated stereotypes about Chinese food and aims to showcase its sophistication and diversity. Some observers suggest this gastronomic expansion could serve as a form of soft power, potentially improving China's global image through cultural exchange.</p>

          <p>A new music collection titled "Sunset Boulevard" documents Elvis Presley's final burst of creativity during his recording sessions in Los Angeles from 1972 to 1975. The set includes hits like "Burning Love" and soulful ballads such as "Separate Ways," showcasing his expressive vocal abilities in his later years. The article also recounts how Presley's disappointment over losing a role in the film "A Star Is Born" in 1975 may have contributed to his subsequent career decline. The collection provides insight into a period when the rock and roll pioneer was navigating a changing musical landscape.</p>

          <p>Samsung's share of the U.S. smartphone market surged from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, narrowing the gap with Apple, whose share declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to the growing momentum of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors compared to the standard smartphone design. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of price points and experimentation with new technology are creating renewed competition. Analysts suggest Apple may release its own foldable iPhone by 2026 to counter this trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tijjani Reijnders, Manchester City's new midfielder, made a sensational Premier League debut by scoring a goal and providing an assist in a 4-0 victory over Wolves. The 27-year-old Dutch international, signed from AC Milan, delivered a dominant performance that earned high praise from manager Pep Guardiola and pundits. Reijnders' box-to-box energy and creative passing provided a significant boost to City's midfield, which was depleted by injuries last season. His immediate impact suggests he will be a key player for the club as they aim to rebound from a disappointing previous campaign.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of 96 British Members of Parliament has formally urged the UK government to expedite the evacuation of sick and injured children from Gaza for medical treatment. In a letter to senior ministers, the MPs highlighted the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system and requested that any barriers to evacuation be removed without delay. The letter also calls for a clear timeline and adequate funding for the scheme, which the government has said is being carried out "at pace." This initiative follows similar actions by other countries, such as Italy, to provide humanitarian medical aid to Gazans.</p>

          <p>Topshop is planning a major comeback with the relaunch of standalone physical stores, years after its previous owner, Arcadia, collapsed and all locations were closed. The brand, now owned by online retailer Asos, recently held its first catwalk show in seven years, signaling a renewed focus on its influential role in fashion. Industry experts note that while nostalgia for the brand is high among millennials, Topshop will face challenges in attracting younger Gen-Z shoppers and competing with fast-fashion giants. The new strategy will focus on quality products and re-establishing the brand's unique "London girl" aesthetic.</p>
