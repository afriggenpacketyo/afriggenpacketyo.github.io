          <p>North Korea has successfully launched a warship, just two weeks after an initial launch attempt resulted in damage and harsh criticism from leader Kim Jong Un. The 5,000-tonne destroyer is now moored at a pier, according to state media, after workers used barrage balloons and tethers to restore its balance. Kim Jong Un had previously condemned the failed launch as a "criminal act" resulting from carelessness and unscientific empiricism, leading to the arrest of at least four officials. Analysts suggest Kim's swift response indicates the regime's commitment to advancing its military capabilities and protecting his image as a leader of a rising military power, with the warship expected to be deployed early next year.</p>

          <p>At the SuperReturn conference in Berlin, private equity leaders acknowledged that a previously anticipated boom in M&A and IPO activity has not materialized, putting pressure on the industry. Despite this, attendees displayed a strong resolve, defending against the narrative that dealmaking is declining and highlighting growth opportunities in areas like European defense firms and Middle Eastern data centers. Experts noted that exits have slowed due to geopolitical tensions and public market volatility, leading companies to remain private longer. Some argue that private equity continues to outperform public markets over the long term, while others point to the high prices paid during the recent period of low interest rates as a challenge to achieving target returns.

          <p>The Japanese government has approved a five-year plan to enhance the country's infrastructure resilience against disasters, allocating over 20 trillion yen ($139 billion) to the project. The plan focuses on addressing aging infrastructure and specifies 326 measures to be implemented by government bodies from fiscal 2026 through 2030, with regional authorities sharing the costs. This decision follows prolonged water outages after the Noto Peninsula earthquake and a sinkhole in Saitama Prefecture, both highlighting the urgent need for infrastructure maintenance and disaster preparedness. Key allocations include funds for maintaining vital services, repairing sewer pipes, reinforcing bridges, and constructing disaster prevention infrastructure like erosion control dams and river embankments.</p>

          <p>A jobs report is expected to reveal a slowdown in job growth for May, reflecting the impact of President Donald Trump's fluctuating tariffs on the U.S. economy. Economists anticipate the U.S. added 125,000 jobs in May, a decrease from the previous month's 177,000, as trade agreements and tariff pauses provided some economic relief. However, tariffs remain on many imports, leading companies like Pepsi, Goldman Sachs, and Target to warn of potential losses due to uncertainty. Consumer spending, a key economic driver, could weaken if import costs rise, though unemployment remains low and inflation has cooled. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Operation Guardian Angel, launched by U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, aims to force sanctuary cities to cooperate with federal immigration authorities by using judicial warrants to detain criminal illegal aliens. The program targets illegal aliens with prior deportations who are arrested locally, seeking federal criminal warrants for felony re-entry. This approach bypasses sanctuary cities' policies of ignoring ICE detainer warrants, leading to the arrest of numerous individuals. The article argues that every U.S. Attorney's office should adopt this strategy to restore immigration law enforcement and remove criminal illegal aliens from sanctuary cities.</p>

Many Pride organizations have reported a 20% to 30% decrease in corporate support, attributed to financial strain, internal transitions, and fear of backlash. Some brands became "silent partners," donating without public acknowledgement, while others scaled back or withdrew their support altogether.

The Home Builders Federation supports the initiative but cautions against burdensome paperwork that could hinder the construction of new homes. The new rules will be included in the Future Homes Standard, and while the government has not committed to the previous Conservative government's proposed 40% figure, they are promising to require some solar panels even if that target cannot be met.</p>

The painting's authenticity was confirmed after cleaning revealed Turner's signature, correcting a long-held belief that his earliest exhibited oil was "Fisherman at Sea".

          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. The move, a third consecutive rate cut since February, aims to address lower-than-anticipated growth amidst a challenging global environment. The decision was influenced by softened inflation and better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. While maintaining its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, the RBI revised its inflation outlook to 3.7% and shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral" due to limited room for further easing.
