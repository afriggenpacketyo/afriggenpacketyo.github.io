U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, pending customary closing conditions.

          <p>Airbus has overtaken Boeing as the world's leading planemaker due to a series of setbacks for Boeing, including safety incidents and production snags. The Air India crash further compounds Boeing's challenges, emphasizing the critical importance of operational safety in the aviation industry. Airbus has managed its largest aircraft, the A380, more effectively than Boeing, which has faced numerous issues with its Dreamliner.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Hawaii are using drones to drop live mosquitoes in remote forests as a novel approach to combat avian malaria, which threatens the state's endangered honeycreepers. The mosquitoes are male and carry a strain of bacteria that prevents their eggs from hatching when they mate with local females. This method aims to reduce the population of biting mosquitoes and thus curb the spread of malaria to the remaining bird populations. This approach has little ecological downside, since mosquitoes are not native to the islands.</p>
