          <p>Cristiano Ronaldo and Lamine Yamal are set to meet as Portugal plays Spain in the Nations League final, marking a clash of generations in football. Ronaldo dismisses the idea of a personal rivalry, emphasizing it's a team versus team contest, while Yamal's Spain prepares to challenge Ronaldo's Portugal in Munich for the trophy. This game will be the first time that Barcelona's Yamal, a potential Ballon d'Or winner, will face Ronaldo, who is currently out of contract with Saudi club Al-Nassr. The media is hyping the matchup, but both players remain focused on their team's performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have used the rare mineral tellurium to create an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals and gave them the ability to see infrared light. The study, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, showed how tellurium nanowire implants in a biocompatible device restored vision in blind mice and a monkey. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, replacing photoreceptor cells in the retina. The advance offers significant promise for treating human blindness.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men‚Äôs participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining global birth rates, particularly in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly ageing population and shrinking workforce, making the decline in fertility rates especially urgent. Traditional expectations placing the burden on women clash with rapid economic changes.</p>
