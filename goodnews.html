          <p>Jos√© Gonz√°lez Valencia, the brother-in-law of Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) leader Nemesio Rub√©n "El Mencho" Oseguera Cervantes, was sentenced to 30 years in a U.S. federal prison for orchestrating a drug trafficking operation and providing weapons to the cartel. Gonz√°lez Valencia, also known as "Chepa," led the "Los Cuinis" group, which financed CJNG's drug trafficking operations using various methods to avoid detection. The U.S. government has been intensifying efforts to weaken the CJNG, designating it as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and sanctioning its leaders, including El Mencho. El Mencho's son-in-law also pleaded guilty to money laundering in a separate case, underscoring the U.S. government's commitment to dismantling the cartel and prosecuting its members. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing nature of the cartel problem, but the sentence represents a victory in the fight against drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil from U.S. immigration detention, where he was held for over three months due to his activism against Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza. The judge found that Khalil is not a flight risk and does not pose a danger to the community, criticizing the government's case for detention. Khalil's arrest was widely criticized as an attack on free speech, and his release follows a series of defeats for the Trump administration's efforts to deport pro-Palestinian international students. Khalil is married to a U.S. citizen, and his release allows him to reunite with his family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jia Zhangke's latest film, "Caught by the Tides," is a reflexive remix of his career-long exploration of globalization and alienation in China. Drawing from nearly 25 years of footage, including outtakes from his most acclaimed films, Jia crafts a poignant story about the passage of time and its impact on individuals and nations. The film follows Qiaoqiao (Zhao Tao) as she navigates romantic despair and societal changes, offering a bittersweet sense of d√©j√† vu for viewers familiar with Jia's filmography. The film serves as a primer on Jia's fascination with China's political, cultural, and economic evolution.</p>

          <p>Kroger has announced plans to close 60 of its supermarkets across the U.S. over the next 18 months, representing about 5% of its Kroger-branded stores.

A Tesla Safety Monitor will be present in the front passenger seat, and rides will be limited to a geofenced area of the city, with remote drivers monitoring as a backup. While analysts are optimistic about the potential of robotaxis, Tesla faces pressure to deliver on its promises and catch up to competitors like Waymo.</p>

The Trump administration has taken actions against Harvard's international students, including disqualifying them from receiving visas, citing concerns over "known illegal activity" by students. The agreement could potentially resolve the ongoing disputes between the Trump administration and Harvard regarding international students.</p>

Trump suggested that the deal would be "HISTORIC" and "very good for our Country," without providing further details. The battle over international students could have significant consequences for Harvard, where about one in four students are from outside the United States.</p>
