        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ofgem, the UK's energy regulator, has announced a decrease in the energy price cap, resulting in a typical household saving of ¬£11 per month starting in July. Despite this reduction, Ofgem advises households to explore fixed-rate energy deals, as they may offer better value than the variable tariffs governed by the price cap. Tim Jarvis, director general of markets at Ofgem, encourages consumers to shop around and discuss options with their existing suppliers. Citizens Advice has expressed concern that the price cap reduction offers little comfort to those struggling with debt, urging the government to provide targeted support and energy efficiency measures.</p>

          <p>Local governments in China will now be required to justify significant increases in fines imposed on private companies, as part of central government efforts to curb illegal investigations and profit-seeking activities targeting private enterprises. This initiative is also part of the government's ongoing economic recovery efforts, which began in March. The Justice Ministry's campaign will involve real-time nationwide statistical analysis of enforcement activity, focusing on detecting unusual increases in punitive fees.

          <p>President Trump has asserted that military recruitment has reached a 30-year high due to increased patriotism following his reelection. However, military records indicate that enlistments began rebounding during former President Biden's term, driven by recruitment reforms. Experts attribute the continued improvements to changes in recruitment strategy and compensation, rather than the change in commander-in-chief. While enlistments have risen year over year, they remain below recent peaks, and recruitment reforms have helped candidates struggling with enlistment requirements.</p>

          <p>Electric grills are emerging as a climate-friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuel grills, offering convenience and environmental benefits. Switching from gas or charcoal to electric grills reduces reliance on fossil fuels, especially when powered by renewable energy sources.
