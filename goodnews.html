The increase in council tax includes a police precept, which will help fund services such as community policing.</p>

          <p>House Republicans propose a plan to make colleges share the risk of student loan debt, penalizing those with high debt and low graduate earnings while rewarding schools with opposite outcomes.  The plan involves complex calculations based on program costs and graduate earnings, and would save the government billions.
