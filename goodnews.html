          <h2>Warren Buffett Plans to Step Down as Berkshire Hathaway CEO</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 10:46:46 EDT</div>

          <p>Warren Buffett surprised investors by announcing his plans to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway by year-end, after 60 years at the helm, though he will remain chairman. The move follows the death of his longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, which has weighed heavily on Buffett. Greg Abel, currently vice chairman of non-insurance operations, will succeed him as CEO. While Abel already manages significant parts of Berkshire's operations, his leadership will face scrutiny, especially in maintaining the company's unique culture and investment approach.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a 100% tariff on movies made overseas caused a brief dip in the stocks of major Hollywood studios and streaming services. The tariff, framed as a response to foreign tax incentives, raises concerns about the impact on studios that film internationally for cost benefits or location purposes. Experts question how the tariff would be implemented and whether it would apply to already completed projects or television shows, and worry about potential retaliatory measures from other countries that rely on Hollywood for international box office sales.

The second dinner offers access to Trump based on the number of $TRUMP tokens held, with top holders promised dinner with the former president.
