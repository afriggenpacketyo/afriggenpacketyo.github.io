          <p>Discontent is growing in the Tokyo metropolitan area over proposals to construct large data centers in residential areas, prompting industry groups to address local concerns about the facilities' imposing nature. Some projects are being scrapped due to resident opposition, citing worries about electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstructed natural light. One residential association is demanding a project be paused until it conforms to city ordinances, while another city was flooded with calls of concern when plans were revealed for a data center in a prime location. Municipalities are starting to require earlier construction notices and clear indications of heat-emitting units to address these issues.</p>

Maresca, who previously coached Delap at Manchester City's academy, believes Delap's familiarity with their playing style will be an advantage.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales in May grew at their fastest pace since late 2023, boosted by the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, surpassing analysts' estimates, while industrial output growth slowed slightly. Fixed-asset investment expanded 3.7% year-to-date, but property investment contraction deepened. The urban survey-based unemployment rate fell to 5.0%, the lowest since November, and this rise in retail sales came as a surprise, likely boosted by the lasting effects from the consumer goods trade-in program.</p>

Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, pending a superior proposal.
