          <p>South Korean AI chip startup Rebellions, formed from a merger with Sapeon, has secured investment from Samsung and aims for a $150-$200 million funding round before its IPO. Positioned as a rival to Nvidia, Rebellions has already raised $220 million and counts major investors like SK Hynix and Aramco. The company is collaborating with Samsung to bring its second-generation 'Rebel' chip to market, utilizing Samsung's advanced 4-nanometer process and HBM3e memory. This strategic partnership could significantly boost Samsung's foundry business if Rebellions secures a large customer base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amidst the recent 'Labubu' collectible craze, attention is turning to the 'Monchhichi,' a popular 1980s furry toy considered its 'ancestor.' Created by Japanese designer Yoshiharu Washino in 1974, Monchhichi gained global fame, particularly in Europe and the US, before a relaunch in 2004 targeting young adults. Interestingly, in former East Germany, a version of the doll called 'Tiemi' was produced, bypassing authenticity issues due to the ban on capitalist imports. The Tiemi, named after designer Susanne Tieme, was manufactured in Sonneberg and became popular across the Eastern Bloc, with these plush figures now sought-after collector's items.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British bank Barclays exceeded profit expectations in its second quarter, reporting a pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion ($3.34 billion) and announcing a £1 billion share buyback. The strong performance was largely fueled by a 10% year-on-year increase in investment banking income, reaching £3.3 billion, as market volatility boosted trading revenues. Higher net interest and trading income offset a decline in advisory fees. CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan stated the bank is on track to achieve its three-year plan objectives, delivering higher and more stable returns for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prioritizing Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko as top targets for striker reinforcements in the current transfer window. The club acknowledges the need to offload existing players to fund new arrivals, a process that might extend closer to the September 1 deadline. While Newcastle is also interested in Sesko, Villa has stated it's not interested in selling Watkins, though United believes this stance could change. However, a suggested £60 million price tag for Watkins is considered too high by United.</p>

          <p>Chinese experts are advocating for China to leverage new cultural symbols and foster open engagement with scholars across Asia to reshape its global narrative. This strategy aims to counterbalance what they perceive as a historically dominant Western discourse. Experts emphasize China's need to proactively shape international rules in emerging fields, aligning soft power with its growth, especially as the foundations of US hard power appear fragile. They suggest that Asian values, rooted in 'harmony and diversity,' should guide a return to consensus-based politics, asserting China's leadership in shaping an Asian discourse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has surpassed China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the US, a significant shift driven by manufacturing supply chain diversification and trade uncertainty. In Q2, India-assembled smartphones accounted for 44% of US imports, a 240% year-on-year increase, while China's share dropped to 25%. Apple's accelerated move to manufacture iPhones in India is a primary factor, aiming for a quarter of all iPhones to be made there in coming years. This trend reflects global manufacturers shifting final assembly to India to serve the US market, despite initial lower yield rates compared to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has introduced its first nationwide subsidy aimed at boosting birth rates, offering parents 3,600 yuan ($500) annually for each child under three. This initiative comes as China's population continues to shrink, despite the abolition of the one-child policy nearly a decade ago. The scheme, applied retroactively from 2025, will benefit approximately 20 million families. Several provinces have already piloted similar payouts, with some cities offering up to 100,000 yuan for third children. Raising a child in China is among the world's most expensive, making these subsidies a crucial step in addressing the looming demographic crisis. (not investment advice)</p>
