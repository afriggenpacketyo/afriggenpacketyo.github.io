          <p>Conan O'Brien and Ryan Reynolds humorously commented on Meghan Markle's new lifestyle brand, As Ever, particularly her artisanal jams, comparing it to Reynolds' father's work as a food broker. The comedians joked about the luxury nature of the jams and their presentation, referencing Markle's suggestion to repurpose the packaging. This article notes that Markle's venture has faced criticism for being inauthentic, with some experts suggesting she lacks the relatability needed for a successful lifestyle brand. The conversation also touched on Colin Jost's joke about Britain's trade deal demand involving Markle and Prince Harry.</p>

          <p>Small religious colleges in rural areas are increasingly facing closure due to declining enrollment and financial challenges, prompting some institutions to consider mergers as a survival strategy. This NPR article highlights the efforts of St. Ambrose University and Mount Mercy University to unite in order to avoid the fate of other religiously affiliated colleges. These institutions often serve low-income, first-generation students and provide a supportive, values-based education in areas with limited access to higher education. The challenges faced by these colleges underscore the broader demographic and economic pressures impacting higher education in rural America.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that a simple change in how bricks are stacked in traditional kilns in Bangladesh could significantly reduce air pollution. The study found that stacking bricks in a zig-zag pattern to improve airflow and ensuring more consistent coal delivery can reduce fuel use by 23% and lower emissions of carbon dioxide and particulate matter by about 20%. This NPR article emphasizes the potential for low-cost interventions to improve both environmental conditions and worker health, as well as increase profits for kiln owners. The research team is now working with the Bangladeshi government to expand this training.</p>

          <p>A new internal survey conducted by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences (ZMSBw) indicates that less than 1% of German soldiers harbor "consistent right-wing extremist attitudes." While this suggests a relatively low level of extremism within the military, the report also identifies problematic chauvinist and xenophobic views among some soldiers. This article emphasizes the need for continued vigilance and scrutiny, particularly in light of past incidents involving far-right networks and terrorist plots within the Bundeswehr.

The author argues that America's reliance on cars has led to increased congestion, unhappiness, and environmental damage, while Europe's investment in rail infrastructure offers a more sustainable and community-oriented model for travel.</p>
