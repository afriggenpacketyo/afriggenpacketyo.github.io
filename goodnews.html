          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" indicates that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, which is more than double the amount detected in 2022. The increase is attributed to both a rise in submissions and the company's stricter policies against incentivized reviews, where businesses offer rewards for positive feedback. Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged system involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake reviews. The company acknowledges that rooting out fake reviews is an ongoing challenge but emphasizes its commitment to improving detection methods, including using AI and behavioral biometrics to identify patterns and abnormalities in submissions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner, has suggested that China should lower its annual GDP growth target to around 4% for the next five to ten years. This recommendation considers the likelihood of ongoing rivalry with the United States and the necessity to address structural issues within China's economy. Xu emphasized that achieving 4% GDP growth would be beneficial if it leads to expanded employment opportunities and controlled debt ratios. He argues that setting a target higher than the potential growth rate would be inappropriate given the complex international environment and domestic challenges like property issues and weak market confidence.
