          <p>The UK Parliament debated amendments to a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek assistance in ending their lives, focusing on ensuring that no staff would be forced to participate in the assisted dying process against their wishes. Members of Parliament also considered preventing medical staff from raising the option of assisted dying with patients first, but ran out of time to vote on all changes, scheduling further debate for June 13. The government remains neutral on the bill, allowing MPs a free vote based on their conscience. </p>

          <p>A new report by Wood MacKenzie indicates that individuals and small businesses may bear some of the costs for grid upgrades needed to support large electricity users like data centers and factories. The report suggests that the payments from these large energy users may not cover the full cost of necessary infrastructure, potentially leading to higher electricity rates for other customers. While some states, like Texas, have policies to protect individuals from these costs, the report emphasizes that complete protection requires removing data-center-caused infrastructure costs from utilities' books. </p>

          <p>Thames Water and other water companies could be prevented from paying bonuses by the industry regulator Ofwat, under new rules set to take effect next month. Environment Secretary Steve Reed said the measures would prevent companies from dumping sewage into rivers while profiting from bonuses. Ofwat can stop firms using customer money to fund bonuses, and the new rules could ban them from using funds from shareholders or lenders. </p>
