        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka was excluded from England's squad for their World Cup qualifier against Andorra, likely due to fitness issues. Head coach Thomas Tuchel mentioned that Saka had only participated in one full training session during the week, suggesting a link between his absence and his physical condition. Saka, who has 43 caps for the Three Lions, had previously missed three months of action due to a hamstring injury but returned towards the end of the season. Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins was also left out and returned home due to a minor injury, while the reason for Conor Gallagher's omission remains unclear. Optimism is measured due to the injury, but the player is expected to return soon.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy voiced concerns about his form heading into the US Open after struggling with his driver at the Canadian Open. The golfer missed the cut at the Canadian Open, finishing nine over par, after experiencing issues with a new driver.

He acknowledged that hitting fairways is crucial for success at Oakmont, the US Open venue, and that he is still searching for the missing piece in his tee game.</p>

Sridhar suggests that governments should prioritize nutritious food, active cities, clean air policies, preventive healthcare, and public provision of water.
