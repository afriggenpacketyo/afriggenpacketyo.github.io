          <p>Meta's Chief Product Officer, Chris Cox, has declared that smart glasses represent the future of computing, envisioning a shift towards more natural user interfaces involving voice, sight, and gestures. The company recently unveiled its $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display and a neural wristband for control, allowing users to record video and send messages. Despite a minor technical glitch during a live demo by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Meta is building on the success of its previous audio-only smart glasses, which have sold millions of units. The company faces growing competition from Google, Snap, and Apple, all of whom are developing their own AI-powered eyewear.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the latest interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has seen a slight reduction. For a $50,000 loan, current monthly payments are approximately $618 for a 10-year term and $487 for a 15-year term, marginally lower than costs earlier in the year. The article explains that while the savings are not dramatic, they accumulate over the life of the loan, making it a potentially more attractive borrowing option for homeowners with significant equity. It also contrasts fixed-rate home equity loans with variable-rate Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). (not investment advice)</p>

The incident occurred on a short flight from the prime minister's residence to Stansted Airport. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the pilots landed at a local airfield out of an abundance of caution, and the presidential couple safely transferred to a support helicopter to complete their journey. The transfer added approximately 20 minutes to their travel time during the visit hosted by King Charles II and Queen Camilla.</p>

The automaker aims to increase its annual global sales to 5.55 million units by 2030, a 34% rise from last year, and will invest $26 billion to expand its U.S. operations. Despite lowering its annual profit margin forecast due to tariffs, Hyundai plans to have over 80% of its U.S. vehicles produced locally by 2030. The announcement was made during an investor event in New York, which was shadowed by a recent immigration raid at a jointly-owned battery plant in Georgia.</p>

          <p>During a press conference in the U.K. with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Donald Trump hinted that "good news" regarding a potential resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war could be forthcoming. He expressed a sense of obligation to end the conflict, which has resulted in millions of deaths. Trump also conveyed his personal disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating, "He's let me down," for not being more receptive to peace negotiations. Despite his 2024 campaign claim of ending the war in a day, Trump admitted the conflict has been more difficult to resolve than he anticipated.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing its first significant rainfall in months as moisture from a dissipated tropical storm moves through the region, with many areas under a flood watch. While the rain is a welcome change after a long dry spell, officials state it will have only a marginal effect on the severe drought conditions and the overall risk of a dangerous wildfire season. Fire officials typically require two to four inches of rain to consider the fire threat diminished, a total this storm is unlikely to deliver to most areas. The precipitation might temporarily slow the start of the peak fire season but is not a long-term solution for the region's drought.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan children who have pending immigration cases in the U.S. Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, ruled that the administration's justification for a recent attempt to expel over 70 minors—claiming it was to reunite them with their families—"crumbled like a house of cards." The ruling cited evidence that no parents had affirmatively requested their children's return and that many were surprised by the effort. The judge's order provides temporary protection for these children, who are legally entitled to special consideration and cannot be subjected to expedited removal.</p>

          <p>For individuals with substantial credit card debt, such as a $75,000 balance, debt forgiveness through settlement can offer significant relief. This process involves negotiating with creditors to pay a reduced lump-sum amount, potentially lowering the total owed by 30% to 50%. The article contrasts this with traditional repayment methods, where high interest rates can cause the debt to balloon over many years, costing far more than the original principal. While settlement can damage a person's credit score and requires available cash, it presents a viable path to financial freedom for those overwhelmed by debt. (not investment advice)</p>

In a separate case, a federal appeals court rejected the administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the U.S. The court upheld a lower ruling that found the Department of Homeland Security Secretary lacked the authority to end the program, thereby protecting the recipients from deportation for now.</p>
