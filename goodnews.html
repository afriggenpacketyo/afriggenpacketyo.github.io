        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's body may protect against dangerous infections. Research indicates that specific beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium longum, can halve the risk of young children being hospitalized with lung infections. The study analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns and tracked their health for two years, finding that babies with B. longum were significantly less likely to require hospitalization for lung infections. The researchers suggest this discovery could lead to new therapies aimed at boosting beneficial bacteria in infants.</p>

          <h2>FDA to Review Data on Mifepristone Amid Safety Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 20:25:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA review the latest data on mifepristone, a drug used in medication abortions. The review follows concerns about the drug's safety, fueled by a report from a right-wing advocacy group. Experts argue that concerns about mifepristone's safety are misguided, citing the FDA's initial approval in 2000 and subsequent reviews that have not found new safety concerns. The Supreme Court previously rejected a challenge to the availability of mifepristone in 2024, preserving access to the drug.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts in the UK are advising women using weight-loss medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro to stop if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. It is currently unknown whether these medications could harm an unborn baby. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends women use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterward. Concerns have been raised that the growing popularity of these medications means many women are not using them safely or getting the right advice.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to tighten measures against unpaid medical bills left by foreign tourists. The government will review insurance coverage for foreigners as part of its annual basic policy on economic and fiscal management. This measure aims to address the issue of increasing unpaid medical expenses incurred by tourists during their stay in Japan. The forthcoming policy is expected to clarify the government's commitment to resolving this financial concern.</p>

The Department of Justice admitted that its claim that OCG had not expressed fear of being sent to Mexico was based on erroneous information.</p>

          <p>Confidence in higher education has declined, especially among Republicans, with many questioning the value of a four-year college degree for securing well-paying jobs. Recent unemployment rates for college graduates are at their highest since 2021, though this is partially due to post-pandemic economic shifts. Despite a consistent college wage premium, where graduates earn more than non-graduates, this premium has not been increasing. Lower-income students also see a declining relative value of college, often attending less prestigious institutions and pursuing different fields of study.</p>
