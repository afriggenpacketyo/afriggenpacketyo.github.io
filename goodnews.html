          <h2>Dodgers to Maintain Trade Deadline Strategy Despite Max Muncy's Knee Injury</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 22:27:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to alter their trade deadline strategy despite a knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy. Initially feared to be season-ending, the injury was diagnosed as a bone bruise with an expected recovery time of about six weeks. This timeline would allow Muncy to return more than a month before the playoffs. The team's management expressed relief and will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base in the interim. The front office feels confident they can weather his absence without making a desperate trade.</p>

          <p>Several New York City beaches in Queens were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to shore. Drones operated by the city's emergency management agency confirmed the sharks' proximity to beachgoers in the Far Rockaway area. Officials credited the drone technology and lifeguard response for ensuring public safety during the holiday. The beaches were reopened after about an hour, with authorities continuing to monitor the waters to keep swimmers safe from potential encounters.</p>

          <p>South Korea and Japan are intensifying efforts to support their shipbuilding industries as the United States increases pressure on China's dominance in the sector. South Korea's new administration has labeled its industry as being in a "major crisis" and has outlined policies to foster growth and innovation. The government's guidelines aim to promote the development of advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through digitalization and improved working conditions. These moves are seen as a strategic response to global trade dynamics and an attempt to reclaim market share from China's shipbuilding powerhouses.</p>

          <p>Despite a difficult loss to world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of Wimbledon, British player Emma Raducanu is drawing significant confidence from her performance. Raducanu stated the close match proved she is no longer "gulfs away" from the sport's top competitors, a feeling that had previously been a problem.

          <h2>Is Crying at Work a Sign of Weakness or an Acceptable Display of Emotion?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:11:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The question of whether it is acceptable to cry at work has been highlighted by a recent emotional appearance by a UK politician, sparking a broader discussion. Career experts suggest that the old-fashioned view of professionalism as emotionless is outdated, and that showing vulnerability can be a sign of emotional intelligence and strength. However, some acknowledge a lingering bias in certain workplaces where crying could be perceived as instability and potentially affect promotion prospects. Ultimately, many argue that compassionate employers who support staff through emotional moments are more likely to foster a motivated and productive workforce.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has revealed the significant role of tiny marine animals called zooplankton in mitigating global warming through a massive annual migration in the Southern Ocean. These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink hundreds of meters into the deep ocean to burn that fat over winter. This process effectively locks away vast amounts of carbon, equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55 million cars, preventing it from re-entering the atmosphere. Scientists call these overlooked animals "unsung heroes" but warn that their populations are facing growing threats.</p>

          <p>An Arizona-based, Harvard-educated economics professor, Dr. Bishara Bahbah, has emerged as a key backchannel negotiator between Hamas and the U.S. in Gaza ceasefire talks. After being contacted by a senior Hamas official in April, Dr. Bahbah, who has connections to the Trump administration, began relaying messages to help secure a deal. His involvement is credited with building trust and facilitating the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander in May as a "good faith" gesture. This unusual diplomatic channel highlights the unconventional methods being used to navigate the complex and intractable conflict.</p>

          <p>A same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom. Zoo experts entrusted them with one of two eggs laid by another penguin couple to improve the chances of both chicks successfully fledging. This is part of a successful breeding season for the vulnerable species at the zoo, which welcomed 10 new chicks this year. Same-sex penguin parenting, while not common, has been observed in other zoos, with both parents typically sharing the duties of incubating the egg and feeding the chick.</p>

The Gallagher brothers, who had been feuding for years, appeared refreshed as they performed classic hits like "Wonderwall" and "Live Forever" for a fervent crowd of 70,000. Liam Gallagher's vocals were noted as being particularly powerful and fresh, putting to rest concerns about past vocal issues. While the brothers showed little direct interaction on stage, their musical chemistry was evident, creating an emotional experience for fans who had waited 16 years for the comeback.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally delivered what it calls a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-backed ceasefire and hostage release proposal, stating it is ready to enter negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official revealed that Hamas's acceptance is contingent on several key amendments. These include a U.S. guarantee that Israel will not resume hostilities if talks for a permanent end to the war fail, and that all humanitarian aid be distributed exclusively by the UN. Israel and the U.S. have not yet responded, but have been reluctant to agree to similar demands in the past.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks has identified five common foods he avoids giving his own children to promote lifelong health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and deli slices because of preservatives and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar crashes, and deep-fried foods, which create harmful inflammatory compounds. The doctor recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and lean proteins to build better eating habits from childhood.</p>
