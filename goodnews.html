          <p>ASEAN is at a critical juncture, caught between the US-China trade war, but has an opportunity to assert itself as a linchpin in global trade and geopolitics. With China and ASEAN finalizing negotiations to upgrade their free-trade agreement, aiming to deepen economic integration, Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is pressing for an ASEAN-US meeting to discuss tariffs. Asean's unique position of being geographically central, economically vibrant and diplomatically neutral allows it to shape trade rules rather than merely adapt to them. This opportunity hinges on Asean‚Äôs ability to exploit the US-China rivalry, fostering a neutral, inclusive trade ecosystem that prioritizes regional resilience and strategic autonomy.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that parents in Europe find their lives more meaningful compared to childfree individuals, but experience lower life satisfaction, especially among mothers. Sociologists Marita Jacob and Ansgar Hudde's research, based on data from the European Social Survey, reveals that parents generally feel more fulfilled but are often more dissatisfied with their lives. The study highlights that life satisfaction levels depend significantly on both living situations and family policies, with Scandinavian countries showing less disparity between parents and childfree individuals. Greater gender equality and comprehensive family support systems in Scandinavia contribute to higher parental satisfaction compared to central and eastern Europe.</p>
