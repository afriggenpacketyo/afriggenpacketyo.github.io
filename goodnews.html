          <p>Golfer Tiger Woods and Vanessa Trump, the ex-wife of Donald Trump Jr., are reportedly in a "very serious" relationship, with sources suggesting a potential marriage in the future. The couple, who publicly confirmed their relationship in March, have been seen together at various golf events, as their children are also competitive golfers. This development follows Woods' previous high-profile relationships and a very public divorce. Woods is currently recovering from a ruptured Achilles injury, which he sustained earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>The proliferation of digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options has led to a phenomenon known as "tipflation," leaving many customers confused and pressured. While tipping was once reserved for specific service situations, requests are now common in fast-food, takeaway, and even self-service environments. Experts note that this increase in requests is driven by payment technology design, which often defaults to asking for a tip. This shift is altering social norms and creating awkward situations for consumers unsure of when and how much to tip.</p>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend known as the "cortisol cocktail," a non-alcoholic drink made with ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, and magnesium, is being promoted as a way to lower the stress hormone cortisol. However, medical professionals are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. Endocrinologists explain that cortisol levels fluctuate naturally and that doctors rarely aim to lower them outside of specific medical conditions. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, it is not a proven method for stress reduction.</p>

          <p>A prototype of the MingKwai Chinese typewriter, an innovative 1940s machine long thought to be lost, has been discovered and acquired by Stanford University. Invented by linguist Lin Yutang, the typewriter was a groundbreaking attempt to adapt the complex, non-alphabetic Chinese language for mechanical typing. Its unique system for organizing characters by shape rather than sound laid the conceptual groundwork for modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean computing input methods. The discovery is considered a major event for scholars studying the history of technology and language.</p>

The waterway, closed to swimmers since 1923 due to pollution, has undergone a $1.5 billion cleanup project, and officials now say it meets safety standards on most days. On Saturday, Parisians eagerly took the plunge at designated swimming areas near the Eiffel Tower, complete with lifeguards and safety measures. The reopening fulfills a long-held dream for the city and offers a new way for residents to cool off during hot summers.</p>

The research team, led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, studies hundreds of sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay. By examining the contents of a shark's stomach, a process which involves temporarily capturing the animal and inducing it to regurgitate, researchers can assess the shark's diet and the overall health of the marine ecosystem. They hope this work will generate more support for the conservation of these vital predators.</p>

          <p>A renter in Scottsdale, Arizona, was fined $4,000 by his property management company for posting negative online reviews about his rental experience, which included issues like black mold. The fine was based on a "non-disparagement" clause in his lease, a practice that is illegal under the 2016 federal Consumer Review Fairness Act. This act protects consumers' rights to share honest feedback about businesses without fear of retaliation or financial penalties. The case serves as a reminder that such "gag clauses" in contracts are unenforceable, and consumers have recourse through agencies like the FTC.</p>

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to help manage difficult emotions. The concept, based on neuroscience, is that the physiological response to anger or stress, involving hormones like cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any continued feeling of upset is due to consciously or unconsciously rerunning the triggering thought. Gawdat suggests using this 90-second buffer to consciously choose a different response, rather than renewing the cycle of anger, thereby leading to a more fulfilled life.</p>

This continues a trend, though the number is down from the previous year. The state's appeal is largely attributed to its tax-friendly policies, including no state income tax on Social Security or retirement account withdrawals, and no estate tax. In contrast, California saw the largest exodus of retirees, with a net loss of nearly 57,000 people in the same age group. (not investment advice)</p>

For many, reframing physical activity is key to finding joy and consistency in movement. The piece highlights different paths to this, such as a writer who found comfort in weight lifting over cardio, and another who started running with her dog. The central idea is that finding a form of movement you genuinely enjoy can lead to a healthier relationship with your body and exercise itself.</p>

          <p>Deaths from heart attacks have plummeted by nearly 90 percent in the U.S. since the 1970s, thanks to significant medical and public health advancements. This dramatic progress is attributed to a combination of factors, including the successful public health campaign against smoking, which drastically reduced a major risk factor. The development and widespread use of statin drugs to manage cholesterol, along with improved emergency treatments like CPR and angioplasty, have also saved millions of lives.
