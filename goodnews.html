This investment strategy highlights a focus on founder quality and identifying undervalued industries before they become mainstream, which proved highly successful as ElevenLabs plans a global expansion and potential IPO.</p>

A key focus will be his expected summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, aimed at de-escalating their ongoing trade war. While en route, Trump told reporters he would be open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for the first time since 2019, adding a significant potential development to his diplomatic agenda.

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays secured a decisive 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the first game of the World Series, held in Canada for the first time since 1993. The game turned in the sixth inning when the Blue Jays scored nine runs, highlighted by a historic pinch-hit grand slam from Addison Barger. Despite an early 2-0 lead and a late two-run homer from superstar Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers were unable to overcome Toronto's offensive surge. The Blue Jays now lead the best-of-seven series 1-0 as they prepare for Game 2 in Toronto.</p>

          <p>Luka Doncic delivered a masterful performance, scoring 49 points to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 128-110 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. His scoring outburst set a new franchise record for the most points in the first two games of a season, with a total of 92. Doncic dominated from the start, dropping 23 points in the first quarter alone, and came close to a triple-double with 11 rebounds and eight assists. The dominant showing solidifies his exceptional start to the season and underscores his critical role in the Lakers' early success under new coach JJ Redick.</p>

          <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit, hosted by Malaysia, is set to tackle critical regional security issues, notably the ongoing civil war in Myanmar and border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia. US President Donald Trump is expected to attend and oversee the signing of a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia, following a US-brokered ceasefire in July. However, resolving the conflict in Myanmar remains a significant challenge for the bloc, as its "Five-Point Consensus" has seen little progress. The summit will also mark a milestone with the official admission of Timor-Leste as ASEAN's 11th member state.</p>

          <p>On the eve of early voting, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race. The endorsement from the influential Brooklyn Democrat provides a significant boost to Mamdani's campaign, which has focused on the city's affordability crisis. Jeffries' support helps consolidate the Democratic party behind Mamdani, who is running against former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo recently received his own high-profile endorsement from the outgoing mayor, Eric Adams, setting the stage for a competitive final stretch in the election for leadership of the nation's largest city.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to South Korea for the APEC summit is being interpreted by experts as a significant, albeit symbolic, step toward mending strained diplomatic ties. While major immediate breakthroughs are not expected, the visit itself signals a mutual desire to reset the relationship. This will be Xi's first visit since 2014, a time considered a high point in Beijing-Seoul relations that led to a free-trade agreement. The current diplomatic landscape is more complex, and the meeting will be closely watched for any signs of progress on economic cooperation and regional security issues.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Pew Research Center reveals that the Latino population in the United States has grown to 68 million, nearly doubling since the year 2000. This demographic now constitutes one in five Americans and accounted for over half of the nation's total population growth in that period. Key findings show that U.S. births have been the primary driver of this increase, the median age of Latinos is 31, making them the youngest major ethnic group, and 79% are U.S. citizens. California and Texas are home to the largest Latino populations, with people of Mexican origin forming the largest subgroup.</p>
