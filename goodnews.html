          <h2>South Korean Court Upholds Dismissal of 'Baby Shark' Copyright Infringement Lawsuit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 02:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has definitively rejected a significant copyright claim against Pinkfong's globally viral children's song "Baby Shark." US composer Jonathan Wright had sought $21,600, asserting the 2015 hit copied his earlier 2011 rendition, but the court upheld previous decisions. It ruled that Wright's version lacked sufficient originality to qualify for copyright protection, as both songs are rooted in a traditional melody popular at US summer camps. This final judgment solidifies Pinkfong's stance that "Baby Shark" is based on a public domain singalong chant, concluding a protracted legal dispute that garnered international attention due to the song's immense popularity and cultural impact. The decision provides clarity for the music industry regarding the originality of folk-inspired works.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm, valuing the franchise at a record $6.1 billion. This landmark transaction represents the largest price ever paid for an American professional sports team, surpassing previous records set by NFL and NBA franchises. Chisholm's group, which includes Boston businessmen Rob Hale and Bruce Beal Jr., will initially take ownership of at least 51% of the team, with full control slated for 2028. This deal underscores the escalating valuations of major sports franchises and reflects a significant new chapter for the Celtics, who recently secured their 18th NBA championship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article highlights four individuals who achieved their dream jobs without attending university, demonstrating alternative paths to success. Frazer Walsh became a zookeeper at Chester Zoo via an apprenticeship, emphasizing hands-on learning over traditional academia. Lloyd Wakefield taught himself photography through YouTube, eventually touring with Harry Styles and establishing a creative community. Thaliqua Smith pursued a film-making apprenticeship with Channel 4, advancing to assistant producer roles on major shows. Faye Husband, overcoming health challenges, turned her nail hobby into a thriving self-employed business. Their stories underscore the value of apprenticeships, self-directed learning, and not rushing career decisions.</p>

          <p>This article explains BTecs, which are practical qualifications assessed through exams, coursework, and projects, equivalent to GCSEs (BTec Firsts) or A-levels (BTec Nationals). BTec Nationals, studied over one or two years, serve as a route to university for one in four students or lead directly to employment. Graded on a scale from Pass to Starred Distinction, these qualifications are popular among diverse age groups, particularly white working-class students, and in sectors like health and social care. Recent government reviews have paused plans to scrap many BTecs, acknowledging their importance alongside T-levels in post-16 education.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at easing regulations for commercial rocket launches, directing the US transportation secretary to eliminate or expedite environmental reviews for FAA launch licenses. The order cites inefficient permitting processes as a deterrent to investment and innovation in global space markets. It also calls for canceling "outdated, redundant or overly restrictive rules." This move could potentially benefit private space companies like Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has faced delays due to environmental studies and licensing reviews, though environmental groups have criticized the deregulation for potentially risking people and wildlife.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, coinciding with increased public concern about the health risks of even moderate drinking. Experts suggest this shift is driven by greater knowledge of alcohol's negative effects, including increased risks of cancer and mental health issues, debunking previous notions of moderate benefits. Young people, in particular, are more likely to perceive moderate drinking as harmful and are less inclined to consume alcohol, influenced by evolving social norms, the rise of alcohol-free alternatives, and economic factors.</p>
