          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his role in certifying the 2020 election results despite pressure from Donald Trump and his supporters. The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for prioritizing the constitutional transfer of power during the January 6th Congressional session, targeted by rioters. Pence resisted calls to overturn electoral votes cast for Joe Biden, even as Trump publicly criticized him and some rioters chanted threats against him. The award recognizes Pence's principled stand, reminiscent of the senators profiled in Kennedy's book, 'Profiles in Courage,' and acknowledges the political isolation he has faced since leaving office. Pence expressed feeling deeply humbled and honored upon receiving the award.</p>
