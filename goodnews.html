          <p>Dana White transformed the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) from an unprofitable, unsanctioned league into a global sports empire now valued over $15 billion, with 675 fighters under contract. His unconventional business acumen, including high-stakes gambling and a willingness to take risks, was central to its success. White's early relationship with Donald Trump, who hosted the UFC's first major fight, fostered a lasting connection, culminating in plans for a historic fight at the White House. The article explores White's unapologetically masculine brand, his staunch defense of free speech against "cancel culture," and the UFC's significant penetration into mainstream culture.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European party, led by President Maia Sandu, is poised for a parliamentary majority following an election marred by claims of "massive Russian interference." With 95% of votes counted, Sandu's Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) secured 49%, significantly ahead of the pro-Russian bloc. The election was deemed critical for Moldova's future path to the EU, especially given its proximity to Ukraine and a pro-Russian breakaway region. This article highlights the ongoing geopolitical struggle for influence in the region, with reports of disinformation campaigns, vote buying, and attempts to destabilize the democratic process, though the pro-EU outcome suggests resilience.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy played a pivotal role in Europe's "near impossible" Ryder Cup victory on American soil at Bethpage, fulfilling his long-held ambition to win an away Ryder Cup. Despite facing intense, often abusive, crowd behavior and the significant mental and physical toll of playing four matches, McIlroy's commitment to his team remained unwavering. His singles match against Scottie Scheffler, though ending in a loss, was overshadowed by his overall contribution and the team's strong performance in the initial days.

This unique contest, known for its meme battles and trash-talking campaigns, draws significant attention to New Zealand's native bird species, 80% of which are designated as being in trouble. The majestic raptor, capable of flying over 200 km/h, is an endemic species threatened by electrocution and habitat loss, with an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 remaining. The article underscores the serious conservation message behind the lighthearted event, highlighting the nation's bird obsession and the importance of protecting its unique wildlife.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer contends that the current AI boom's massive spending on data center infrastructure is fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble of 2000. He argues that today's investments come from well-capitalized hyperscalers like Meta, Google, and Microsoft, who have clear use cases and a necessity to build out AI capabilities to maintain dominance. Unlike the speculative, debt-fueled connectivity bubble of 2000, where numerous unproven companies failed, Cramer sees the current AI buildout as self-funded and driven by genuine demand, despite skepticism about immediate, visible consumer benefits. He believes the few key players are making essential investments rather than engaging in a speculative frenzy (not investment advice).</p>
