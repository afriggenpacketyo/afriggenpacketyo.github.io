          <p>As the 80th anniversary of Victory Day approaches, marking the end of WWII and the Sino-Japanese war, an article examines China's evolving role in the global post-war order. Despite an estimated 35 million Chinese casualties as a key Allied power, China now finds itself increasingly perceived as a revisionist force alongside Russia, challenging the Western-dominated security architecture. Beijing, however, aims to assert its position as a defender of global norms, with President Xi Jinping likely to use the anniversary as a platform to underscore the country's historical sacrifices as a foundation for its commitment to upholding international stability. The article explores how China's past contributions underpin its current determination to maintain global order amidst changing geopolitical dynamics.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its fiscal second quarter, forecasting continued sales growth above 50% and signaling robust demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. Despite this, the stock saw a slight decline in extended trading, attributed to data center revenue falling just short of estimates for the second consecutive period. The company's finance chief projects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030, though H20 chip shipments to China remain uncertain due to geopolitical factors. Nvidia also announced an additional $60 billion in share repurchases, highlighting its strong overall performance driven by its data center and gaming divisions, even as growth slightly slowed compared to previous quarters.

World No. 4 Pegula secured a straightforward win against Anna Blinkova, continuing her consistent performance at majors and reaching the third round for the sixth consecutive year. Navarro, a 23-year-old who reached the semi-finals last year, delivered a commanding performance against Caty McNally.

          <p>Kinloch Castle, a grand Victorian hunting lodge on Scotland's Isle of Rum, is back on the market for offers exceeding £750,000, following the collapse of a previous potential sale. The historic property, owned by Scottish government agency NatureScot, is currently in a poor state of repair and requires extensive restoration. The island's small community, comprising around 40 residents, largely supports the sale for redevelopment but emphasizes the need for active community involvement and respect for land access rights from any prospective buyer. This unique opportunity seeks a buyer committed to not only restoring the iconic building and its grounds but also contributing to the nature, sustainability, culture, and economy of the Isle of Rum.</p>

Padilla, who has a long history of public service in California, emphasized the importance of this redistricting effort, framing it as crucial for preventing a "rigged system" that could undermine democratic processes and allow for budget cuts to vital programs.
