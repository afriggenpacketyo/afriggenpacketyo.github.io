          <p>India's foreign minister has expressed optimism about reaching a trade agreement with the United States before the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs concludes on July 9.

Both countries aim to craft a mutually beneficial and balanced agreement, potentially including early wins, with a target to increase bilateral trade to $500 billion.
