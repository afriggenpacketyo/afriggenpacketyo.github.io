          <h2>WNBA Player Kelsey Mitchell Comments on Fan Conduct Towards Angel Reese</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 11:32:14 EDT</div>

          <p>Indiana Fever player Kelsey Mitchell addressed the fan treatment of Chicago Sky's Angel Reese, urging for a focus on "human to human" decency rather than race. Speaking at the WNBA All-Star game, Mitchell expressed that negative comments are disrespectful to the athletes and hoped fans would see the players as human beings. The discussion stems from the polarizing attention on Reese, particularly her rivalry with Caitlin Clark, which has driven league popularity but also incited online criticism. A prior WNBA investigation into alleged hateful comments from fans towards Reese was not substantiated.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise more quickly than initially anticipated. Muncy, who was injured in early July, has already resumed baseball activities like running and swinging, with manager Dave Roberts suggesting a return much sooner than the original six-week timeline. The Dodgers' offense has struggled significantly in his absence, highlighting his importance to the team's lineup. Muncy expressed relief that the injury was not more severe, noting that a slight difference in timing could have resulted in season-ending surgery.</p>

          <p>Twenty-eight years after the event, Britain's 1997 men's 4x400m relay team has been officially awarded their world championship gold medals. The presentation occurred at the London Diamond League meeting following the disqualification of the original U.S. winners due to a doping admission by team member Antonio Pettigrew in 2008. The athletes—Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton—received a warm reception from the crowd. The belated ceremony corrects a historical injustice, recognizing the team for their clean performance and talent after a lengthy process of investigation and reallocation.</p>

          <p>Entrepreneur and author Scott Galloway argues that "follow your passion" is the worst career advice given by billionaires, suggesting it is a luxury only the already-rich can afford. Galloway, a self-made millionaire, recommends a different approach: find something you are skilled at, that has the potential to be lucrative, and then develop a passion for it. He emphasizes that success often comes from enduring rejection and pivoting based on opportunities rather than blindly pursuing a single passion. This sentiment is echoed by other leaders who advise combining one's strengths with practical, valuable skills to build a successful career.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona has reportedly opened talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, a move the player is said to prefer. The deal is structured as an initial loan with an option to buy, which would provide significant wage bill relief for United. Rashford has been training separately from the first team amid a stand-off with head coach Ruben Amorim and has not been assigned a squad number for the upcoming season. The transfer would fulfill Barcelona's search for a top winger and allow Rashford a new start after a difficult period at his hometown club.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its efforts to combat the smuggling of strategic minerals, such as rare earths, and has vowed to strengthen export controls. At a recent meeting, officials described the anti-smuggling situation as "severe," noting that offenders collude with foreign parties and use covert tactics to illegally export minerals and related technologies. A special operation launched in May has already led to multiple arrests. Authorities are also planning a new joint enforcement center to better coordinate controls on dual-use items that have both civilian and military applications. (not investment advice)</p>

Huang's charm offensive and the strong presence of U.S. firms at the expo reflect a recent easing of trade tensions.

          <p>According to a Charles Schwab survey, the average American believes a net worth of $839,000 is needed to feel financially comfortable. However, financial experts caution against fixating on this single metric, calling it potentially misleading. They argue that net worth is just a snapshot in time and doesn't capture the full picture of one's financial health, such as cash flow or asset liquidity. Instead of chasing a specific number, experts advise focusing on aligning spending with personal values and ensuring money management supports life goals, which is key to achieving true emotional and financial comfort.

          <p>The article refutes a claim circulating on social media that using sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer, labeling it as false. Health officials and scientific studies confirm there is no evidence to support this assertion; in fact, UV radiation is the primary cause of melanoma, and sunscreen helps protect against it. The piece explains that the rising incidence of skin cancer globally is likely due to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and historical use of less effective products. It clarifies that while some countries with high sunscreen use also have high skin cancer rates, this correlation does not imply causation.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has reportedly taken a stake in payments company Global Payments, which has seen its stock price falter. The company's value has declined significantly since its poorly received 2024 acquisition of Worldpay, a move that investors felt contradicted prior commitments and was overpriced. The article argues that Elliott's involvement could be beneficial by adding shareholder representation to the board, enhancing oversight, and restoring investor confidence in the integration of the massive acquisition. An activist presence could hold management accountable and increase the probability of a successful turnaround for the undervalued company. (not investment advice)</p>
