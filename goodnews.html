          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, averting the threat of new U.S. tariffs. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on EU goods, a compromise from the 30% rate previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the agreement, the EU will reportedly invest an additional $600 billion in the U.S. and purchase $750 billion in American energy, aiming to rebalance the trade relationship. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described it as a "huge deal" that will bring stability, though it still requires approval from EU member states. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his position among the sport's legends. Despite having the overall victory virtually guaranteed, Pogačar launched a characteristic attack during the final stage in Paris, even amid treacherous rainy conditions. Although he didn't win the final stage itself, which was claimed by Belgian rider Wout van Aert, his aggressive performance underscored his dominant and daring racing style. The 26-year-old finished more than four minutes ahead of his main rival, two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard, marking the fifth consecutive year the two have finished first and second.</p>

          <p>A profile of John Oliver explores the comedian's journey from his stand-up origins at the Edinburgh Fringe festival to his acclaimed HBO show, "Last Week Tonight." Oliver reflects on how failure is a crucial part of comedy and how his style evolved to tackle complex, often obscure, political and social issues with meticulous research. Despite his sharp critiques of American problems, the British-born comedian, now a U.S. citizen married to an Iraq War veteran, expresses a deep affection for his adopted country. He argues that criticizing something you love is a way to push for its improvement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has successfully shut down four dark web sites that formed a massive child sexual abuse material network, leading to at least 18 convictions of its leaders and users. The investigation, dubbed "Operation Grayskull," targeted a network with over 120,000 members who traded millions of illicit files. Among those convicted was William Spearman, a lead administrator from Alabama sentenced to life in prison, who was described as one of the world's most significant purveyors of such material. Officials called the operation one of the most successful of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and sadistic online community.</p>

Ang highlights the historical importance of this dedicated effort to understand China, suggesting that a similar commitment is needed today.

The film, set in a retro-futuristic 1960s, also brought in $100 million internationally for a global debut of $218 million.
