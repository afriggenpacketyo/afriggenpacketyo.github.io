          <p>Alphabet shares experienced a significant drop after Apple's Eddy Cue suggested that AI search engines could eventually replace standard search engines like Google. Cue mentioned the possibility of integrating AI services from OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic into Apple's Safari browser. His comments came during testimony in a Justice Department lawsuit against Alphabet, which focuses on Google's practice of paying platform providers to be the default search engine. Cue also noted a recent decline in Safari searches, attributing it to the rise of AI usage.</p>

          <p>Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted new official city flags, including Pride flags, in response to state laws that restrict the display of unofficial flags on government properties. These state laws are viewed by civil rights groups as attempts to suppress flags supporting L.G.B.T.Q. people. Salt Lake City approved flags featuring rainbow colors, transgender Pride colors, and a Juneteenth symbol, while Boise designated the rainbow Pride flag and an organ donation flag as official. The actions have sparked controversy, with some state officials criticizing the cities for bypassing state law.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold interest rates steady, citing increased uncertainty due to President Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on inflation and economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the rising risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation, making it difficult to determine the appropriate policy response. The Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The central bank wants to take a wait-and-see approach, Powell added.</p>

The Danish foreign minister expressed concern, stating that "we do not spy on friends." The Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) has taken note of US interest in Greenland.</p>

She has spent fewer than 14 days at the White House since her husband's inauguration 108 days ago.
