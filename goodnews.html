          <p>The White House has declared a trade agreement with China following negotiations in Geneva, where Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted substantial progress. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated that the rapid agreement suggested smaller-than-expected differences, emphasizing the U.S.'s goal to resolve a significant trade deficit. While Bessent mentioned that Trump was informed of the progress and details would be forthcoming, the specifics of tariff reductions or concessions remain undisclosed. The agreement aims to address the economic imbalance that prompted the U.S. to impose tariffs in the first place.</p>

The lavish gift is likely to raise questions surrounding the legality of the move, as a new commercial Boeing 747-800 costs roughly $400 million.
