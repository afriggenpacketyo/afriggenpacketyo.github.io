          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that many tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are not legally permissible, striking a blow to his trade strategy. The court found that the president exceeded his authority under federal economic emergency laws, calling the power to levy tariffs a core congressional power. The ruling, which will not take immediate effect, allows the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court and directs a lower court to reevaluate if a universal injunction is appropriate.</p>

          <p>Coffee chains like Costa are facing challenges as younger consumers gravitate towards newer, trendier options such as matcha-based drinks, popularized by brands like Blank Street. Analysts suggest that changing tastes, cost-of-living pressures, and the rise of artisanal shops are impacting traditional coffee giants that haven't innovated their offerings. Costa's owner, Coca-Cola, is reportedly exploring a sale of the chain, which has struggled with operating losses amid these market shifts.</p>

The updated vaccines are now approved for all seniors but are restricted to younger individuals with existing health conditions, ending broader emergency use authorizations.

          <p>Prince Harry's upcoming visit to the UK has fueled speculation about a potential meeting and reconciliation with his father, King Charles. While the rift between the royal brothers remains wide, recent signs, including a meeting between their communication teams, suggest a possible easing of tensions between father and son. The last meeting occurred briefly after the King's cancer diagnosis, and with legal battles over security now concluded, this visit is seen as a significant opportunity for a private resolution.</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has responded to the controversy surrounding the original cover art for her album "Man's Best Friend," stating she was surprised by the backlash. The image, which depicted her at a man's feet, drew criticism from some fans for its perceived submissiveness, while others saw it as satire. Carpenter explained her artistic intention was to explore themes of control and the lack of it, emphasizing that she creates art for her fans and isn't concerned with pleasing all critics.</p>

          <h2>Review: 'Caught Stealing' Presents a Gritty but Stylistically Prioritized Thriller</h2>

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new crime comedy, "Caught Stealing," stars Austin Butler as a bartender inadvertently caught in New York City's criminal underworld in 1998. The film evokes the grungy, nostalgic atmosphere of the director's early work but struggles to make its mistaken-identity plot as compelling as its setting. Despite a strong cast including Zoë Kravitz and Regina King, the characters are thinly drawn, and the film prioritizes a pulpy, stylish aesthetic over narrative depth and genuine stakes.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta is undertaking a 105-mile solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg to protest severe budget cuts to public transportation.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. The court upheld a lower court's ruling, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's action was unlawful. The judges found that the Department of Homeland Security secretary lacked the authority to end a prior extension of TPS, a program designed to be insulated from shifting political dynamics.</p>
