          <p>A video clip showing French First Lady Brigitte Macron playfully pushing her husband, President Emmanuel Macron, as they were about to disembark their plane in Hanoi, Vietnam, has gone viral, igniting a wave of commentary online. Macron downplayed the incident, stating that it was merely a lighthearted moment between him and his wife. His office also echoed this sentiment, describing it as a moment of complicity and playful teasing after a long trip, aimed at decompressing before the start of their tour in Southeast Asia. Macron argued that the reaction to the images offered a cautionary tale about disinformation in the social media age, adding that people need to calm down regarding the situation.</p>

          <p>A mobile prison project is visiting schools in the U.K. to educate children about the realities and consequences of crime. The project features replica prison cells built with items from local jails, aiming to provide an interactive and realistic experience of life behind bars. Students are scanned, photographed, and fingerprinted before entering the cells, and organizers say the experience opens the door to tough conversations about drugs, alcohol, violence, and other issues. The goal is to inform young people about their responsibilities and help them make informed choices, especially since children as young as 10 can be arrested in the U.K.</p>

          <p>Former New York Rep. Charles Rangel, a prominent figure in Congress for over four decades and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, has died at the age of 94. Rangel served in the House from 1971 to 2017, during which he chaired the House Ways and Means Committee and achieved numerous milestones, including becoming the first Black chair of the Ways and Means Committee in 2007. Despite facing an ethics scandal and censure in 2010, Rangel remained a respected figure, known for his dedication to his Harlem district and his service in the Korean War, for which he received a Purple Heart and Bronze Star with Valor. Tributes have poured in from fellow politicians, highlighting his legacy as a transformational force and a champion for justice and equality.</p>

He retired in 2016 after winning a 23rd term, making him the ninth-longest continuously serving member of the House in American history. He was instrumental in persuading Hillary Clinton to enter electoral politics by running for the Senate from New York, and despite an ethics violation that forced him to give up his chairmanship in 2010, Rangel remained a respected figure known for his gregariousness and political agility.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano resumed its sporadic eruption on Sunday, shooting lava hundreds of feet into the air and releasing large plumes of ash and volcanic material. Lava fountains from the mountain's north vent reached heights of more than 1,000 feet, while those from the south vent reached over 800 feet. The volcano also released an eruptive plume that reached at least 5,000 feet, containing ash, volcanic rock, and volcanic glass shards. While the lava flows remained within Kilauea's summit caldera and did not affect residential areas, the observatory warned of potential hazards from volcanic fragments carried by the wind.</p>

          <p>England completed a dominant T20 series clean sweep against the West Indies with a 17-run victory in the third and final match, despite a stellar performance from West Indies' Hayley Matthews, who scored 71 runs. A rain delay disrupted West Indies' chase, leading to a collapse from 109-3 to 127-8, with Lauren Bell taking the crucial wicket of Matthews. Heather Knight's unbeaten 66 ensured England had enough runs on the board after Matthews had earlier claimed 3-32 in England's innings. England now prepares for a three-match one-day international series, pending Knight's fitness due to a hamstring injury.</p>

Prime Minister Mark Carney, who campaigned on standing up to Trump, met the royal couple in Ottawa. The King is scheduled to deliver a 'Speech from the Throne' to Canada's Parliament, asserting Canada's sovereignty and rejecting calls for a takeover by the U.S., echoing his mother Queen Elizabeth II's previous addresses. This visit is a diplomatic balancing act, as King Charles maintains relations with both Canada and the UK, where he also extends invitations to President Trump.</p>

          <p>George Lucas, creator of the 'Star Wars' franchise, has stepped back into a leadership role at his Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles as it approaches completion after years of delays. The museum recently parted ways with its director and eliminated several positions, prompting Lucas to appoint himself head of 'content direction'. The museum's mission is to explore how narrative art influences societies, but some cultural leaders say that art that tells stories is ubiquitous and can take just about any form. The museum's collection will include items amassed by Lucas over the years, including Hollywood memorabilia, book and magazine illustrations, comic books, and Norman Rockwell paintings.</p>

          <p>Jesse Armstrong, creator of 'Succession,' has created a caustic new movie, 'Mountainhead,' which satirizes nihilistic tech oligarchs holed up in a mountain mansion in Utah. The film, premiering on HBO, explores a preposterous nightmare world where billionaires fantasize about taking over failing nations and replacing the president. The author highlights the film's lens on the rapid degeneration of the country and the terrifying power amassed by Silicon Valley big shots. While 'Succession' was about a media industry in decline, 'Mountainhead' is about men who feel they own the future, making them frightening at a moment when institutions are in free fall.</p>

          <p>EU leaders are expressing optimism for a quick resolution to the trade war with the United States after President Donald Trump delayed his threatened 50% tariffs on the bloc until July 9. The delay follows a 'very nice call' between Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, where they agreed to fast-track trade negotiations. The EU trade commissioner is scheduled to speak with the U.S. commerce secretary, and the EU's offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods remains on the table. Despite this progress, Trump's 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars remain in place, and the EU has suspended retaliatory tariffs that could kick in on July 14 if a deal is not reached.</p>

The plane was hit by enemy fire in 1944, killing all 11 men aboard, and their remains were initially deemed non-recoverable. A remarkable investigation by family members and a recovery mission by Navy divers led to the discovery of the wreckage and the recovery of remains.

          <p>President Trump is considering redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the U.S., escalating his attacks on the Ivy League institution. This threat follows his recent moves to block Harvard from enrolling international students and freeze billions in federal funding, citing the institution's alleged failure to address anti-Semitism on campus. Harvard has filed lawsuits in response to these actions, alleging they are unlawful and retaliatory, and a federal judge temporarily blocked the administration from preventing Harvard from enrolling foreign students. Trump has also expressed a desire to strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status and exert control over its policies.</p>
