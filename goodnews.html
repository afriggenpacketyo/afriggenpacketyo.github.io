        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children unless they possess a formal deportation order. The ruling came hours after lawyers alerted the court to a rapid government effort to deport hundreds of children, with planes already prepared for takeoff from Texas. Judge Sparkle Sooknanan's order mandated that all 76 children slated for Sunday's deportations be deplaned and returned to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services. This extraordinary measure aims to uphold legal protections for these minors, who lawyers argue could face abuse or persecution if returned without proper asylum proceedings.</p>

          <p>The Guatemalan government has asserted that it proposed the return of unaccompanied Guatemalan minors from the U.S. to prevent them from remaining in shelters and to facilitate family reunification. This statement, released after a U.S. federal judge blocked deportations, suggests Guatemala's proactive role, though NPR noted a factual error regarding the timing of the proposal to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. Attorneys representing the children dispute the government's claims of due process, arguing that the U.S. attempted to deport minors without allowing them to pursue asylum claims, violating federal laws and the Constitution. This article provides a crucial counter-narrative to the unfolding immigration situation, highlighting differing accounts and legal challenges.</p>

Analysts anticipate Snowflake will continue to outpace Nvidia's earnings growth, and with its total addressable market projected to more than double by 2029, the company is positioned for sustained strong performance in the long run.

          <p>Despite current US-China tensions, the American Volunteer Group (AVG), famously known as the "Flying Tigers," continues to be revered in China for their crucial contributions in aiding the country against Imperial Japan during World War II. These American mercenary pilots, mechanics, and support personnel were instrumental in destroying hundreds of Japanese planes, with their shark-mouthed warplanes becoming an iconic symbol. The enduring bond between the two nations is underscored by the invitation of the Flying Tigers' founder's daughter and granddaughter to a military parade in Beijing commemorating the end of WWII.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion, making it the fifth-largest prize in the game's history, after no one matched all six winning numbers in Saturday's drawing. While the top prize remains unclaimed, nine tickets across the U.S. successfully matched five white balls, with four of these winners located in California, each receiving over $1.1 million. The next drawing offers the winner a choice between periodic payments totaling $1.1 billion or a lump sum of $498.4 million before taxes.

          <p>Canadensys Aerospace is developing Canada's inaugural lunar rover, a key component of NASA's Artemis program aimed at establishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon. Scheduled for a 2029 launch, the rover will explore the Moon's south polar region to search for water and measure radiation levels, crucial steps for future manned missions. Engineers face significant challenges, including surviving extreme lunar temperatures and navigating sticky regolith. The potential discovery of water could revolutionize space exploration, transforming the Moon into a vital "petrol station" for spacecraft, though geopolitical questions about lunar ownership are emerging as space becomes more accessible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha, driven by its superfood reputation and post-pandemic tourism, has led to significant supply shortages and soaring prices in Japan. Tencha, the tea used for matcha, has seen auction prices jump 170% in a year, and retailers are reporting doubled matcha prices. Japanese farmers struggle to meet this demand due to labor-intensive production and an aging workforce, despite government consideration of subsidies. The "matcha mania" has forced shops to ration supply and major companies like Ito En to create dedicated divisions, raising concerns that future heatwaves could further exacerbate supply issues.</p>

          <p>The Met Office, alongside Met Éireann and KNMI, has released the new list of storm names for the 2025-26 season, including Amy, Bram, and Chandra. These names are assigned to storms forecast to cause "medium" or "high" impacts, primarily from strong winds but also significant rainfall or snow that could lead to flooding or travel disruption. The selection process incorporates public suggestions and aims for diverse, easily pronounceable names, avoiding controversy. This standardized naming system, in place since 2015, helps to communicate clear and consistent information about severe weather, improving public safety and preparedness, as evidenced by high awareness rates during recent storms.</p>

          <p>Two high school seniors from St. Mary's Academy in New Orleans, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, have made mathematical history by independently developing new trigonometry proofs for the 2,000-year-old Pythagorean Theorem. This achievement was previously considered impossible using only trigonometry. Their groundbreaking work, initially a school math contest entry, garnered international recognition, challenging societal expectations for young African American women in STEM. The students, who have since discovered additional proofs and a general format for more, exemplify how ingenuity and perseverance can overcome long-standing intellectual barriers, inspiring widespread admiration for their remarkable academic accomplishment.</p>

          <p>Will Smith's pinch-hit, walk-off home run delivered a crucial 5-4 victory for the Dodgers against the Arizona Diamondbacks, averting a potential series sweep. The win, described by manager Dave Roberts as showing "a lot of fight," came despite the team blowing a late-game, three-run lead and reliever Tanner Scott's struggles. Smith, who had been in a slump, hit a 420-foot missile into the left-field pavilion, securing his fourth career pinch-hit, walk-off homer. This timely win, though tempered by the team's season-long inconsistencies, aims to be a momentum-builder as the Dodgers enter the final month, emphasizing the need for sustained focus and execution.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles men's team achieved an unprecedented "three-peat" in The Hundred cricket tournament, dominating for three consecutive years through expert team building and a stable core of players. Their success is attributed to a diverse bowling attack, powerful batting, and strong leadership. However, this era of dominance might be drawing to a close, as new investment and ownership are set to take operational control, potentially leading to significant changes in the tournament's format, possibly converting to a T20 event, and squad restructuring through new auction systems. Players acknowledge this could be the last time this successful group plays together.</p>
