          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 18:07:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that Justice Clarence Thomas has significantly influenced the Supreme Court's stance against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs by advocating for individual rights over group rights. It highlights Thomas's long-standing belief, dating back to his time at the EEOC, that civil rights laws should protect individuals from discriminatory practices rather than favoring specific groups. The article cites examples from Thomas's judicial opinions, including his criticism of Brown v. Board of Education and his concurrence in the 2023 affirmative action decisions. The recent Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services decision, where the Court unanimously rejected a heightened evidentiary standard for majority-group plaintiffs in discrimination claims, is presented as evidence of Thomas's influence. </p>

          <p>Chinese officials are reportedly working to comply with President Xi Jinping's austerity rules, which aim to curb overspending and improve the Communist Party's image. Inspectors are conducting checks on offices, meal receipts, and gifts. The campaign, ongoing since 2012, targets spending and protocol in areas like official events, buildings, and travel. Analysts suggest the campaign is also intended to ensure wise spending in China's competition with the United States and to identify politically loyal cadres for promotion. </p>

The article highlights the achievements of several athletes, including Giselle Fernandez, Khaliq Muhammad, and the Herbst twins, emphasizing that their accomplishments should have been the focus of the event.
