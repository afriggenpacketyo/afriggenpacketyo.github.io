          <p>Former WNBA player Angel McCoughtry has criticized Chicago Sky rookie Hailey Van Lith, suggesting her large social media following played a significant role in her draft selection. McCoughtry questioned whether Van Lith would be in the league without her popularity, asserting that there may be more talented but less popular players. Van Lith, a guard who played for Louisville, LSU, and TCU, was one of the most-followed collegiate athletes on social media. McCoughtry later apologized for singling out Van Lith, acknowledging that she worked hard for everything she has achieved. Van Lith has been limited to a bench role in her rookie season, averaging 5.1 points and 1.5 assists per game.</p>

          <p>Kenan Yildiz scored two goals, leading Juventus to a 4-1 victory over Wydad in their Group G match at the Club World Cup in Philadelphia. Yildiz was instrumental in the opening goal, forcing an own goal from Wydad defender Abdelmounaim Boutouil, and later scored a spectacular goal from the edge of the box. Despite Thembinkosi Lorch reducing the deficit for Wydad, Yildiz completed his brace in the 69th minute, and Du≈°an Vlahoviƒá added a penalty in added time to secure the win. The result eliminates Wydad from the competition, while Juventus will qualify for the last 16 if Al Ain fails to beat Manchester City.</p>

          <p>As war spreads between Israel, Iran, and the United States, local Iranians in Los Angeles are finding comfort in Persian restaurants and cultural hubs like Tehrangeles. Restaurants like Azizam are offering complimentary tea and backgammon to provide a safe space for the community to connect. Many Iranian Americans express fear for their families in Iran but also hope to bridge the divide between the two countries. Despite differing opinions on the Iranian regime, there is a shared desire for a peaceful resolution and a recognition of the common concerns among Iranians and other Americans.</p>

          <p>Tens of millions of people across the Midwest and East Coast are facing dangerously hot temperatures as a rare June heatwave continues to grip parts of the U.S. Many areas are under heat advisories, with heat indices expected to exceed 100¬∞F. Cities are opening cooling centers and issuing heat emergencies to protect residents from the extreme conditions. The heatwave is expected to persist into the coming week, with meteorologists attributing the extreme temperatures to a heat dome, a large area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity. The widespread nature of the heatwave is unusual for this time of year.</p>

Earlier, England was bowled out for 465, trailing India by six runs in the first innings. Brook's innings was marked by aggressive strokes, but he was ultimately caught out, missing his century. The game is finely poised, with both teams having moments of dominance.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher on Sunday after the United States entered the war between Israel and Iran, striking three key Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, while Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed down slightly. Egypt's EGX30 was a major gainer, closing 2.7% higher. Analysts suggest that the Gulf markets have distanced themselves from the conflict, calling for a peaceful resolution. Fadi Arbid of Amwal Capital Partners noted that the market might be pricing in the removal of the Iranian threat, which could be viewed positively by international investors.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda identifies five toxic phrases that make children refuse to listen: "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," "Stop crying. You're fine," "How many times do I have to tell you?" and "You know better than that." She suggests alternative phrases that honor a child's autonomy while holding boundaries, promoting cooperation. These phrases emphasize respect, emotional safety, and involvement in the process, reducing power struggles and fostering emotional resilience. The key is to view defiance as a signal for connection, clarity, or emotional support.</p>

The agreement comes as NATO members prepare for an upcoming summit where they are expected to set the 5% spending goal for annual defense and security related by 2035. (not investment advice)</p>
