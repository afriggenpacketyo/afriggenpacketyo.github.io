          <p>As AI usage grows, researchers are uncovering more instances of harmful outputs, such as hate speech and copyright infringements, which are compounded by a lack of regulations and testing. AI researcher Javier Rando stated that achieving intended model behavior remains challenging. Red teaming, a method common in cybersecurity, involves testing AI systems to identify potential harm, but Shayne Longpre notes a shortage of red team personnel. Longpre suggests opening testing to third parties and adopting standardized AI flaw reports to improve evaluation and risk understanding. </p>

          <p>A parenting expert, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, suggests avoiding threats, bribes, and harsh consequences, and instead using language that fosters cooperation. Phrases like "Because I said so" or "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]" trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. The expert recommends explaining decisions respectfully, giving children agency over their behavior, and validating their emotions. Shifting from punishment to partnership and addressing the root causes of defiance can create conditions where cooperation feels natural. </p>

          <p>A Florida Republican congresswoman, Kat Cammack, experienced difficulty receiving treatment for an ectopic pregnancy due to concerns about Florida's abortion law. Cammack blames fearmongering from pro-abortion groups for the reluctance of hospital staff to administer the necessary medication. The incident occurred after Florida's six-week abortion ban took effect, causing medical staff to worry about potential legal repercussions. Cammack, who opposes abortion, hopes her experience will promote common ground between opposing political groups. </p>
