          <p>Jake Larson, a World War II veteran who became a beloved TikTok personality known as "Papa Jake," has passed away at the age of 102. Larson, who enlisted in the National Guard at 15, was a D-Day survivor who landed on Omaha Beach and later shared his wartime experiences with over a million followers online. Known for his humor and poignant reminders of war's realities, he was recently awarded an Emmy for an interview with Christiane Amanpour. His granddaughter confirmed he died peacefully, and tributes have poured in from around the world, honoring his service and legacy.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," a violent confrontation between police and miners during the 1984-85 miners' strike. The incident, which occurred outside a coking plant in Rotherham, resulted in over 100 injuries and the arrest of 95 miners, whose prosecutions later collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry aims to address unanswered questions that have persisted for four decades. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for 13 years, expressed cautious elation at the decision to investigate the events and their aftermath.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Bond ETF Assets Exceed $50 Billion Amid Deflationary Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 02:23:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investor demand in China for bond-tracking exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has surged, pushing total assets under management past $50 billion as of June. This represents a fivefold increase from the beginning of last year, driven by a search for low-risk returns in a deflationary economic environment. Investors are particularly drawn to ETFs targeting corporate notes, which offer diversification, lower costs, and better liquidity compared to direct bond investments. The trend reflects hedging against economic uncertainty and weak consumption, even as China's central bank has warned about risks from an over-extended bond rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with executives from approximately 30 major companies, including Siemens and Deutsche Bank, to encourage new domestic investment and restore economic confidence. The "Made for Germany" initiative aims to revive the nation's economy after two years of recession, with the government emphasizing that private sector participation is crucial alongside public funds. This article also notes other German news, including a call from abuse survivors for the Vatican to act against a Cologne Cardinal and a bizarre car accident in Lower Saxony where a vehicle landed in a barn's attic.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is set to complete a season-long loan move to FC Barcelona after arriving in Spain. The 27-year-old player received permission from his club to finalize the deal, which includes an option for Barcelona to buy. This move follows Rashford's expressed desire for a new challenge after being dropped by United's head coach and a previous loan spell at Aston Villa. He is expected to undergo a medical this week and could potentially join Barcelona's pre-season tour, where he might face his former teammate Jesse Lingard, who now plays for FC Seoul.</p>

          <p>China is expected to begin receiving iron ore shipments from Guinea and Algeria this year, following the completion of critical railway and port infrastructure projects by Chinese firms. For years, logistical challenges, specifically the lack of rail lines connecting mines to ports, have hindered exports from these African nations. In Guinea, the Simandou mine is now projected to start shipping ore by November. Similarly, a new railway will connect the Gara Djebilet mine in Algeria's Sahara Desert to Mediterranean ports, unlocking a significant new source of iron ore for China's industrial needs.</p>

          <p>China's stock market has seen a rally in sectors like solar and steel, fueled by investor optimism that the government will address the "involution" of intense price wars. These cut-throat competitions have eroded corporate profits and increased global trade friction, with China's producer price index in a nearly three-year decline. In response, Beijing has signaled a crackdown on this "disorderly" competition, and some industry groups, like solar panel glass makers, have already agreed to cut production. While the long-term success of these measures is uncertain, the news has boosted shares in affected industries. (not investment advice)</p>

Thorpe, who earned 100 Test caps for England, struggled with depression and anxiety, particularly after a difficult coaching tour under COVID restrictions.

The company aims to expand its robotaxi fleet to 1,000 vehicles by the end of 2025 and is developing robotrucks for freight delivery.
