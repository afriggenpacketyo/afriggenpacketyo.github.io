          <h2>Author Claims New Evidence Solves 500-Year-Old Mystery of the Princes in the Tower</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 11:34:51 EDT</div>

          <p>A new book by author Philippa Langley, who previously helped locate the remains of King Richard III, presents a controversial theory about the two young princes who vanished from the Tower of London in the 15th century. Langley's 'Missing Princes Project' argues that, contrary to the popular narrative popularized by Shakespeare, the boys were not murdered by their uncle, Richard III. Instead, she claims to have uncovered extensive archival evidence suggesting both princes survived and lived under different identities. This re-evaluation of history challenges the long-held belief of Richard III's guilt, attributing the child-killer narrative to propaganda from the subsequent Tudor dynasty.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act, establishing the first significant federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States. The legislation, which passed with bipartisan support, primarily targets the $250 billion stablecoin market, aiming to create clearer rules for digital currencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The bill was part of a broader "Crypto Week" in Congress that also saw the passage of legislation to regulate other digital commodities and prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a retail central bank digital currency. The signing ceremony occurred amid ongoing political pressure regarding the release of files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 11:30:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to valuable oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, rejecting Exxon Mobil's claim of a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region's Stabroek Block. While Exxon stated it respects the ruling, the outcome is a major strategic victory for Chevron, solidifying its position in one of the world's most promising new oil discoveries. The integration of the two companies is expected to result in some headcount reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta has declined to sign the European Union's new artificial intelligence code of practice, arguing that its measures are an overreach that will stifle innovation and growth. Joel Kaplan, Meta's global affairs chief, stated that the code introduces legal uncertainties and goes beyond the scope of the EU's recently passed AI Act. The voluntary code, which aims to improve transparency and safety, has drawn criticism from other major tech companies as well. Meta's public refusal aligns it with other businesses that fear the EU's regulatory approach will throttle the development of advanced AI models and hinder European companies building on the technology.</p>

          <p>A recent financial article explores how reverse mortgages can serve as a tool for retirees to supplement their Social Security benefits, particularly for those who are "house rich but cash poor." It outlines three primary strategies: creating a steady monthly income stream from home equity, accessing funds for unexpected healthcare costs, and delaying Social Security claims to secure larger future benefits. The article suggests this financial product could help homeowners aged 62 and older convert their home's equity into usable income without having to sell their property. However, it also stresses the importance of understanding the product's complexities before making any decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new book, "Me, But Better," author Olga Khazan details her attempt to overcome introversion and social anxiety by enrolling in an improv comedy class. Describing herself as having "high loneliness" and a "very low" extroversion score, Khazan chose improv as a commitment device to force herself into social situations, despite finding the art form itself uncomfortable. The excerpt humorously recounts her first class, filled with awkward warm-up games like "Zip Zap Zop" and juggling invisible objects. The experience is framed as a form of "rehab for perfectionists," challenging her to embrace making mistakes in a supportive, low-stakes environment as part of her personal growth journey.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are increasingly distinguishing themselves from their competitors, capturing over 86% of the profits among the seven largest U.S. airlines last year. Analysts suggest their strategic focus on premium travel, international routes, and strong loyalty programs allows them to better navigate challenges like falling domestic airfares and weaker demand from price-sensitive consumers. While both carriers have trimmed their 2025 outlooks, they are outperforming rivals by generating significant revenue from premium cabins and partnerships, such as Delta's lucrative American Express deal. This performance gap highlights a growing segmentation within the airline industry's top tier. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," recounts the author's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River, a trip he undertook to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." Traveling incognito, Twain observed how the advent of railroads was diminishing the steamboat culture he cherished and how the river's changing course had altered the landscape he once knew intimately. Despite these changes and the challenges of his newfound fame, the experience of once again piloting a steamboat had a profound effect on him. It allowed him to reconnect with a cherished past, feeling as though the intervening years of war, mining, and literary fame had momentarily slipped away.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment has improved for the second consecutive month, with fears about future inflation falling to their lowest levels since before President Trump's major tariff announcements in April. The University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers for July showed the one-year inflation outlook dropped to 4.4% from 5.0% in June, a significant decrease from its recent peak. Despite this improvement, the report notes that consumers still perceive a substantial risk of future price increases, as expectations remain above pre-2025 levels. The data suggests that while concerns have eased, the economic uncertainty caused by fluctuating trade policies continues to weigh on the public's financial outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

Key details, including which specific occupations qualify, are still pending clarification from the IRS, which is expected in October. Further complicating matters are changes to reporting thresholds for forms like the 1099-K, which could affect how gig economy and other workers document their income to qualify for the new deduction.

After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, police determined there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction for any offense. The group had previously condemned the investigation as an act of "political policing intimidation," while their performance at the festival was not livestreamed by the BBC.</p>

Speaking at a supply chain expo, David Trujillo, a commercial counsellor at the Mexican Embassy in China, addressed concerns ahead of the trade deal's review next year. He suggested that any revisions to the USMCA would likely focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements for products, rather than targeting companies based on their country of origin. This indicates that Chinese investors using Mexico as a manufacturing base may continue to enjoy tariff advantages for North American trade.</p>

Egan believes the concept of "having it all" is unrealistic without better support systems, and she has had to adjust her fundraising timeline to accommodate her family life.

The artifact was found in Lake Lednica on a structural beam that was likely part of a defensive rampart for a medieval Slavic settlement. Experts believe the face, which features realistic eyes, a nose, and a mouth, had a mystical or spiritual purpose, possibly depicting a deity or protective spirit meant to ward off evil. The discovery, along with similar finds in other Slavic cities, provides a rare and valuable glimpse into the artistic and spiritual practices of the region during the early Middle Ages.</p>

          <p>In the increasingly competitive streaming market, children's programming like "CoComelon" and "Bluey" has become a crucial tool for retaining subscribers. Industry experts note that kids' content is highly effective at reducing customer churn because children watch shows repeatedly, providing sustained engagement at a lower production cost than adult-oriented content. This makes deep libraries of family-friendly shows a valuable asset for services like Disney+, Netflix, and Paramount+. As media companies focus on profitability, the consistent viewership driven by children offers a unique advantage in stabilizing subscription numbers, even as services also compete for eyeballs on platforms like YouTube.</p>
