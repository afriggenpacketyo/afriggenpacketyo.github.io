          <p>Pewabic Pottery, a Detroit institution founded in 1903, continues to flourish by maintaining its commitment to handcrafted ceramics, a contrast to the city's history of mass manufacturing. Despite Detroit's economic turmoil over the decades, the pottery has survived by focusing on the Arts and Crafts movement's principles, creating unique tiles and vessels with distinctive, iridescent glazes. Now operating as a nonprofit, Pewabic recently had its most successful year, demonstrating a renewed public appreciation for artisanal goods in an age of increasing automation and artificial intelligence. The studio's resilience highlights a business model that values craftsmanship.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported second-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations, even as net income fell 23% year-over-year due to lower global oil prices. The company's strong performance was driven by record production in the Permian Basin and Guyana, reaching its highest second-quarter output since the Exxon and Mobil merger. While profits from its production business declined, its refining division saw earnings increase by 44% thanks to higher margins. Exxon continues to return significant capital to shareholders, paying out $9.2 billion through dividends and share buybacks during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR interview delves into the influence of political commentator Hasan Piker, one of the most prominent progressive voices on the streaming platform Twitch. The discussion addresses whether Piker serves as a left-wing counterpart to right-leaning figures like Joe Rogan, and examines his appeal to young men through a blend of "bro culture" and leftist politics. Piker argues that masculinity and hobbies like gaming are not inherently conservative and that Democrats need to focus on substantive policy changes rather than just charismatic messengers to win over voters. He also highlights the growing ideological investment in far-right ideas among young conservatives online.</p>

          <p>Chevron's second-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street estimates, although net income dropped by about 44% from the previous year because of lower crude oil prices. The company achieved record worldwide production of 3.4 million barrels per day, bolstered by a significant jump in U.S. output. Following its recently finalized $53 billion acquisition of Hess, Chevron expects the deal to start contributing to its earnings in the fourth quarter and to generate $1 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The company returned $5.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Pakistan have announced a new partnership focused on trade and energy, including a deal for the joint development of Pakistan's oil reserves. The agreement is part of a broader effort to expand economic ties, which also saw the U.S. lower its tariff rate on Pakistani imports to 19%. While the extent of Pakistan's oil reserves is debated, the deal signals a strategic shift in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship toward economic cooperation. Analysts suggest the move could serve U.S. geopolitical interests by countering China's influence in the region and establishing a presence in the resource-rich but volatile province of Balochistan.</p>

          <p>Jason Nellis, a chief product officer for a U.S.-based tech company, has moved his family from Washington, D.C., to the south of France, seeking a different pace of life and a broader cultural experience for his two young sons. The move, which cost around $20,000, was made possible by his wife obtaining a talent visa to start a hospitality business and his ability to work remotely. Nellis has adjusted his schedule to overlap with U.S. time zones, stating the change has forced him to be more efficient. The family's decision reflects a desire to prioritize family relationships and slow down from the career-focused culture prevalent in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is developing a pilot program to provide Medicare and Medicaid coverage for popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. The five-year experiment, set to begin in 2026 for Medicaid and 2027 for Medicare, would allow state programs and Part D plans to voluntarily cover these GLP-1 medications for weight management. This move aims to address the U.S. obesity crisis but raises concerns about the high cost of these drugs, which can be up to $7,000 per year. The plan marks a potential shift in federal policy, as these programs have previously not covered drugs solely for weight loss.</p>

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace the inflation rate. This article provides an overview of current CD rates as of late July 2025, noting that while national averages are low, top online banks offer highly competitive rates, with some reaching up to 4.45% APY for short-term CDs. It explains the phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently offer higher rates than long-term ones. The piece advises savers to shop at online banks and consider laddering CDs to maximize returns in the current environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the state of mortgage and refinance rates for prospective homebuyers and current homeowners as of late July 2025. Despite a challenging market with high rates, average 30-year mortgage rates are around 6.78%, while 15-year loans are near 6.00%. The report suggests that borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure good rates and that there may be future relief if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. It provides practical advice on how to secure a better rate, such as improving one's credit score and shopping around with different lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

She was detained in May during what she believed was a routine green card application interview, despite having just given birth to her second child. Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, said he felt "betrayed" by the arrest, which stemmed from a years-old deportation order she was unaware of. After advocacy from her lawyer and the office of Senator John Kennedy, Paola was released on bond with an ankle monitor, though the family still faces a lengthy legal process to resolve her immigration status.</p>

          <p>This article examines the price of gold, a popular safe-haven asset, and the various factors that influence its value. As of August 1, 2025, the price of gold stood at $3,343.92 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant fluctuation. The report details key drivers of gold's price, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Because gold is priced in U.S. dollars, currency movements also play a significant role, with a weaker dollar typically making gold cheaper for foreign investors and increasing demand.

          <p>Electric aircraft developer Joby Aviation is partnering with defense contractor L3Harris to create a next-generation hybrid military craft that can be operated with a pilot or fly autonomously. The vehicle will be based on Joby's vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft but will use a gas turbine instead of being fully electric. The companies aim to begin testing this fall, with operational demonstrations planned for 2026, targeting applications like airborne surveillance and logistics in contested environments. The partnership reflects a growing military interest in smaller, cheaper, and more adaptable autonomous aircraft for low-altitude support missions.</p>

          <p>Yu Zidi, a 12-year-old swimmer from China, has won a bronze medal at the world swimming championships in Singapore, becoming one of the youngest medalists in the sport's history. She earned the medal by competing in the preliminary heats for China's 4x200-meter freestyle relay team, which ultimately placed third in the final. Yu has also narrowly missed individual medals, placing fourth in two separate events. Her success has prompted World Aquatics, the sport's governing body, to review its age-limit rules, which currently allow athletes under 14 to compete if they meet a difficult time standard.</p>
