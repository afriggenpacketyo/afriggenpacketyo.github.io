          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris recorded the fastest time during the single practice session for the United States Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin. He outpaced title rival and teammate Oscar Piastri, with Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg surprisingly splitting the two McLaren drivers to take the second-fastest time. Norris's leading lap places him in a strong position ahead of the sprint qualifying event. Following the top three were Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Max Verstappen of Red Bull, setting the stage for a competitive race weekend as the Formula 1 season continues with six races remaining.</p>

          <p>Amid market volatility and shifting interest rates, many retirees and investors are seeking stable financial products, with annuities gaining attention for their guaranteed income streams. This article suggests that fixed annuities currently represent the safest option, offering a guaranteed interest rate for a set period, similar to a certificate of deposit but with tax-deferral benefits. With rates in the 5% to 6% range, they provide a secure return shielded from market downturns. The choice of annuity ultimately depends on individual goals, such as income generation versus principal protection, and requires careful consideration of the issuer's financial strength and contract terms.

          <p>Electric utility companies are struggling to accurately predict how much new power generation will be needed to support the artificial intelligence boom, creating a multibillion-dollar forecasting challenge. While AI companies are planning massive data centers that could consume as much electricity as cities, they are often shopping the same projects to multiple utilities, making it difficult to determine which demand forecasts are real. This uncertainty risks either over-investing in unneeded infrastructure or failing to build enough capacity, which could jeopardize grid reliability. The ambiguity has not stopped a major rally in utility stocks, as investors bet on a massive buildout. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Swiss running shoe company On is facing a class-action lawsuit filed by customers who allege a design defect in its popular shoes causes a "loud, embarrassing" squeaking sound with every step. The complaint claims the noise originates from the company's signature CloudTec sole design, where rubber components rub together during use. The plaintiffs argue they would not have purchased the premium-priced shoes, which retail for up to $180, had they known about the issue. According to the lawsuit, the company has dismissed customer complaints by categorizing the squeaking as "normal wear and tear," which is not covered by its warranty.</p>

          <p>While many homebuyers are anticipating another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve at its late October meeting, this article suggests that mortgage rates could fall even before the official announcement. Historical patterns show that mortgage rates often decline in anticipation of Fed action, as lenders "price in" the expected cut beforehand. For example, significant rate drops occurred just before Fed cuts in September 2024 and September 2025. Borrowers are advised to prepare by improving their credit scores and monitoring the market daily to capitalize on a potential, limited window of opportunity for lower rates.

          <p>The South African women's cricket team secured a dominant 10-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in a match shortened by rain at the Women's World Cup in Colombo. Chasing a revised target of 121 runs in 20 overs, South Africa reached the goal with ease in under 15 overs. The victory was led by an unbroken opening partnership between captain Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits, who scored 60 and 55 runs, respectively. This fourth consecutive win moves South Africa into second place in the tournament standings, just behind Australia, while Sri Lanka remains winless and is unlikely to advance to the semi-finals.</p>

          <h2>California Attorney General Sues Plastic Bag Makers Over False Recyclability Claims</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against three major plastic bag manufacturers, alleging they are illegally marketing their products as recyclable when they are not. The lawsuit claims that the thicker plastic bags sold in stores since the state's 2014 single-use ban are not accepted by the vast majority of California's recycling facilities. This deception leads to billions of bags ending up in landfills and the environment. Alongside the lawsuit, the state announced a settlement with four other producers who will halt sales and pay over $1.7 million in penalties for similar violations, effectively phasing out these types of bags statewide.</p>

          <h2>Gold's Record Performance Prompts Rethink of Traditional 60/40 Stock-Bond Portfolio</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 13:52:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent record-breaking surge in gold prices is accelerating a shift away from the classic 60/40 investment portfolio, which allocates 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds. Some strategists now advocate for a 60/20/20 structure, reducing the bond allocation and dedicating 20% to alternatives like gold and cryptocurrency. The argument is that bonds no longer provide sufficient protection against inflation and geopolitical risk, as they increasingly move in tandem with stocks. This change reflects a growing acceptance of gold not as a fringe asset but as a core holding to hedge against economic uncertainty and currency debasement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Review: Ethan Hawke Delivers a Profound Performance as a Troubled Songwriter in 'Blue Moon'</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Richard Linklater's new film, "Blue Moon," features a deeply vulnerable performance by Ethan Hawke as Lorenz Hart, the brilliant but self-destructive lyricist of the Rodgers and Hart songwriting duo. The film imagines Hart on the opening night of "Oklahoma!," the first major success for his former partner Richard Rodgers with a new collaborator. Set almost entirely in the Sardi's restaurant, the story unfolds as Hart confronts his professional irrelevance, envy, and personal demons. Hawke's portrayal is described as touchingly diminished and poignantly egoless, capturing the fragility and self-loathing of an artist consumed by the fear of being a has-been.</p>

          <p>In response to pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices, Genentech will begin selling its flu pill, Xofluza, directly to some consumers at a significant discount. The new program is designed to help uninsured or underinsured patients by offering the single-dose antiviral treatment for a $50 cash price, which is 70% below its list price. The medication will be available through partnerships with Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drug Company and other pharmacies offering home delivery. This move makes Genentech the latest pharmaceutical company to adopt a direct-to-consumer model as the industry faces increasing scrutiny over the high cost of medicine in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A moment from a New York City mayoral debate is gaining widespread attention online after candidate Zohran Mamdani delivered a pointed one-liner against his opponent, Andrew Cuomo. During the debate, Mamdani questioned why New Yorkers would trust the former governor who "sent seniors to their death in nursing homes" during the pandemic. He then concluded with a memorable line: "What I don't have in experience I make up for in integrity, and what you don't have in integrity you could never make up for in experience." The exchange has been widely shared on social media, with many users praising Mamdani's communication skills and sharp critique.</p>
