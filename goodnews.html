          <p>H&M's shares experienced a significant 10% jump after the fashion retailer reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results, signaling a successful turnaround and renewed market confidence. Operating profit climbed an impressive 40% year-on-year to 4.9 billion Swedish krona, comfortably surpassing the 3.7 billion forecast by analysts in an LSEG poll. Net sales for the three months to August also exceeded expectations, coming in at 57 billion Swedish krona versus the 56.8 billion anticipated. This robust financial performance suggests that the company's strategic initiatives are effectively boosting profitability and market position, indicating a positive trajectory for the brand's future.

          <p>European stocks opened lower on Thursday as investors anticipated the release of the latest U.S. jobs data, influencing global market sentiment. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell by 0.6%, with most sectors experiencing negative territory in early trade. However, the retail sector provided a notable exception, with H&M's shares surging 9.2% after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent comments on a cooling labor market, potentially leading to interest rate cuts, also contributed to the cautious market outlook across the continent.

He is now developing a new 'Milan' beer for the 2026 Winter Games, aiming to inspire British athletes. Pembroke, whose eyesight is deteriorating, is also motivated by the prospect of his child watching him at the LA Paralympics, aspiring to break the 75m mark and advocate for visually impaired individuals.</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was found in Spain over 20 years ago has been identified as 31-year-old Russian citizen Liudmila Zavada, thanks to the international police campaign Operation Identify Me. Ms. Zavada's body, dubbed "the woman in pink," was discovered in July 2005 near Barcelona, with suspicious circumstances surrounding her death. Her identity was confirmed through fingerprints matched in a Turkish database and DNA from a relative in Russia. This marks the third identification through the Interpol-led initiative, offering renewed hope for other cold cases and providing new leads for investigators in ongoing probes.</p>
