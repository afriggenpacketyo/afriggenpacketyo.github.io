          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents discovered and disabled a nearly 3,000-foot-long drug smuggling tunnel connecting Tijuana and San Diego. The tunnel, found in early April while under construction, ran beneath the Otay Mesa Port of Entry and was designed to exit near a commercial warehouse in San Diego. The underground passageway was equipped with lighting, electrical wiring, ventilation, and a track system for transporting contraband. Authorities found the entrance in a house in Tijuana, recently concealed with fresh tile, and plan to fill the tunnel with concrete to prevent future use, with over 95 tunnels having been decommissioned in the San Diego area since 1993. The acting chief patrol agent emphasized the importance of disrupting narcotics smuggling tunnels to protect American lives.</p>

Despite conditions such as an $11 billion investment in U.S. Steel operations and a golden share issued to the U.S. government, Hashimoto believes the deal is efficient and profitable for both companies. Under the national security agreement, the U.S. president has the right to approve key management decisions, including facility closures. Nippon Steel aims to increase its global capacity to 100 million tons and expand into overseas markets to compensate for declining domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

While he did not rule out the possibility of China acting as a mediator in the conflict, he indicated that Israel's primary concern remains its military operation.

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster to reveal remarkable frescoes from a luxurious Roman villa in central London. Discovered in 2021, the frescoes depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, providing insights into the affluence of the area during Roman times. The team believes the building may have been home to a wealthy family or a hotel for rich travelers, and the art was created by skilled painters who traveled the Roman empire. The discovery sheds light on the expansion of Roman London and the city's rich history.</p>

Xie criticized the "unreasonably high" tariffs on Chinese imports and argued that the U.S. goods deficit would persist due to export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms. He suggested that the U.S. should ease restrictions on exports of competitive products like semiconductors to reduce the deficit. Recent talks have produced a framework to implement a trade consensus, including reduced tariffs on Chinese imports, signaling potential progress in easing trade tensions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. imposes tariffs, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower their duty payments by altering their products to fit different harmonized system codes. This legal practice involves changing an item's materials or dimensions to qualify for lower tariff rates. Companies are tweaking products to meet specific tariff classifications, such as adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry or adding fuzzy-felt fabric to sneaker soles to classify them as slippers. This strategy is most easily implemented in sectors like fast-moving consumer goods and garments, though challenges exist in heavily-regulated industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AstroAI has recalled nearly 250,000 mini-fridges due to fire and burn hazards caused by a short circuit in the electrical switch. The recalled 4-liter mini-fridges, sold online for about $40 between June 2019 and June 2022, have been linked to at least 70 reports of smoke, burning, melting, or fire, including two fires that caused over $360,000 in property damage. Consumers are urged to stop using the recalled fridges immediately and contact AstroAI for a replacement, while disposing of the units according to local waste disposal procedures. The model number of the recalled fridges is LY0204A.</p>
