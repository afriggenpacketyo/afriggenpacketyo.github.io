          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled against the government's request to force Google to sell its Chrome browser as part of a major antitrust case. While allowing Google to retain Chrome, the judge mandated that the tech giant must share some of its valuable search engine data with competitors to curb its monopolistic power. This decision follows a finding that Google illegally maintained its dominance in online search through exclusive default-engine agreements, and it aims to foster more competition in a market increasingly influenced by artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Air Lease, a prominent aircraft leasing company, has agreed to a $7.4 billion deal to be taken private by an investor group including Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital. The acquisition, valued at approximately $28.2 billion including debt, reflects ongoing consolidation within the airplane-renting industry, which owns over half the world's passenger jets. This move comes as the sector grapples with record rental rates driven by aircraft shortages and supply chain issues, while some airlines reconsider capacity amid fluctuating demand.

          <p>Veteran Washington lawyer Abbe Lowell is representing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook in an unprecedented legal battle after President Trump attempted to fire her. Lowell, known for representing high-profile clients across the political spectrum like Hunter Biden and Jared Kushner, is challenging what he calls executive overreach by the Trump administration. His strategy involves suing the administration over the firing, arguing the allegations against Cook are unsubstantiated and do not meet the legal threshold for removal "for cause," positioning him at the forefront of a major fight over regulatory independence.</p>

The move represents about 600 workers, including park rangers, scientists, and first responders, who are seeking a stronger voice in their workplace. Organizers say the unionization effort gained momentum amid turmoil within the National Park Service, which has faced significant staff and budget cuts under the Trump administration, leaving remaining employees to manage parks under strained conditions.</p>

The company has begun notifying users that the program will end on October 1, 2025, and guests will need to purchase their own memberships. Amazon is instead directing users to its Amazon Family program, which allows sharing of benefits but requires all members to share the same primary residential address, tightening the rules on account sharing.</p>

Webb stated that the intervention did not meet the high threshold required for VAR to overturn an on-field decision, confirming it was an incorrect application of the protocol.</p>

          <p>For individuals facing substantial credit card debt, such as $20,000, several effective repayment strategies are available. Options include working with a debt relief company for management or settlement, consolidating multiple debts into a single loan with a potentially lower interest rate, or adopting a disciplined payment method like the "debt avalanche" or "debt snowball." Additionally, increasing income through a side hustle or taking out a home equity loan can provide the necessary funds to accelerate debt repayment, though the latter carries significant risks.
