          <p>Bitcoin's value climbed to a new all-time high above $113,000, extending its recent rally amid broader investor confidence in risk assets. The surge was amplified by significant short liquidations, where traders betting against the cryptocurrency were forced to buy back in, further driving up the price. This upward momentum, supported by institutional buying and positive regulatory developments, has also lifted other cryptocurrencies, with altcoins like Ether and Solana seeing notable gains.

          <p>Delta Air Lines' shares surged after the company reinstated its 2025 profit forecast, signaling a more stable travel market than previously anticipated. While the full-year earnings projection is lower than initial estimates from January, CEO Ed Bastian noted that booking patterns have stabilized after a dip earlier in the year. The airline beat second-quarter expectations, driven by strong demand for premium seating and its lucrative partnership with American Express, even as overall revenue per seat mile declined.</p>

Experts suggest checking credit reports for accuracy, working to improve credit scores, and researching lenders to find the most competitive offers. This proactive approach can position borrowers to secure better terms once the rate environment becomes more favorable. (not investment advice)</p>

Before a storm, families should create an evacuation plan, know their flood risk, and pack a "go bag" with essential supplies. During a flood, the primary rule is to seek higher ground immediately and never attempt to walk or drive through floodwaters, as just six inches can be enough to sweep a person away.</p>

One common mistake to avoid is assuming rates will only drop after an official Fed announcement, as banks often adjust their offerings in anticipation. Savers are also cautioned against being distracted by slightly higher short-term CD rates, as longer-term CDs can lock in a favorable rate for an extended period, protecting against future declines.
