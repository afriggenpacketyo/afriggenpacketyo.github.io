        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a comprehensive hole-by-hole analysis of the Bethpage Black golf course, the designated venue for the 2025 Ryder Cup. It details the yardage, par, and specific challenges of each of the 18 holes, from the nerve-wracking first tee to the deceptively sloping final green. The guide offers insights into the strategic decisions players will face, highlighting key features like elevated greens, deep bunkers, and long, arduous par-fours that define the course's notorious difficulty. The text explains how certain holes, like the picturesque but reachable par-five 4th, offer scoring opportunities, while others, such as the punishing 15th, consistently rank as the hardest on the course.</p>

          <h2>Manchester United's New Goalkeeper Senne Lammens Awaits His Debut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 02:16:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three weeks after his £18.1 million transfer to Manchester United, 23-year-old goalkeeper Senne Lammens has yet to make his first appearance for the club. Despite impressing in training with his calm presence and strong fundamentals, head coach Ruben Amorim has opted for the more experienced Altay Bayindir, citing the need for stability in a new league. However, Bayindir's recent performance metrics have been weak, leading to widespread speculation that it is a matter of when, not if, Lammens will be given his chance. The team's early elimination from the EFL Cup has removed a potential 'soft landing' for his debut, meaning his first start will likely be in a high-pressure Premier League match.</p>

          <p>Liverpool midfielder Ryan Gravenberch, once burdened by comparisons to Dutch legend Frank Rijkaard, has overcome a difficult season at Bayern Munich to establish himself as one of Europe's elite players. Since manager Arne Slot took charge, Gravenberch has thrived, initially in a holding role and now with greater attacking freedom, becoming Liverpool's standout performer this season. His transformation was catalyzed by Slot's faith in him after a planned transfer for another midfielder fell through. Analysts praise his unique ability to carry the ball through defensive lines, and his improved performance has made him a key figure for both his club and the Dutch national team.</p>

The company is advancing its experimental weight-loss injection, CT-388, into a phase III trial, the final stage before seeking regulatory approval. This move is part of a broader strategy that includes a pipeline of treatments acquired through recent biotech purchases and partnerships, such as the promising Petrelintide drug candidate. Roche's CEO expressed confidence in this goal, aiming for a suite of obesity treatments to be launched by 2030 in the rapidly growing market.</p>

          <p>State-affiliated buyers in China, collectively known as the 'national team,' held approximately US$553.1 billion in domestic stocks as of June, reinforcing a recent bull run in the market. This strategic holding, led by Central Huijin Investment, now surpasses the total holdings of foreign investors and accounts for 4.8% of the market's free-float capitalization. The intervention aligns with the government's emphasis on financial stability and promoting the stock market as a vehicle for household wealth, especially as the property market faces a downturn. This state support, which functions like an unofficial stabilization fund, is expected to persist and potentially drive stocks higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has announced its commitment to speeding up the global rollout of BeiDou, its domestically developed satellite navigation system and rival to the U.S.-owned GPS. At a recent summit, Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang stated that after 31 years of development, the system has entered a new phase of global expansion with improved service and widespread applications. Named after an ancient Chinese term for the Big Dipper constellation, BeiDou has already achieved over 70% market share within China, powering a vast range of consumer products from smartphones to shared mobility services. The government is now focused on enlarging its 'circle of international friends' to increase global adoption.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 5-4 extra-innings victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks, reducing their magic number to one for the National League West title. The win was highlighted by an unconventional strategy that saw starting pitchers Roki Sasaki and Clayton Kershaw deliver scoreless innings of relief. After the regular bullpen squandered a 4-1 lead in the eighth inning, Kershaw made his first relief appearance since 2019 to get the game to extras. Tommy Edman's RBI single in the 11th inning provided the winning run, showcasing the team's resilience and adaptability as they prepare for the postseason.</p>

He is advocating for the United Nations to lead a contact group to facilitate discussions, reviving a proposal he made last year. This diplomatic effort follows a rare alignment in March when Brazil and China supported a U.S.-led ceasefire initiative at the UN Security Council.</p>

The decision halts the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) plan while the farm's owners appeal the cull order, a case that has drawn international attention. The owners were briefly arrested for obstructing agents who had a warrant to enter the property and take control of the birds. The CFIA maintains that the flock poses a risk for virus mutation and potential human health impacts, but the court has ordered that the birds be maintained with appropriate care while it decides whether to hear the full appeal.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's widely publicized investment in OpenAI, which could reach up to $100 billion, will primarily be structured as a lease arrangement for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs).

While Nvidia is providing an initial $10 billion in equity to help finance the first new AI supercomputing facility, the majority of the investment will flow back to Nvidia as payment for leasing the essential hardware. This structure helps OpenAI manage its finances while providing Nvidia with a long-term, committed customer. (not investment advice)</p>

A new study shows that this surge, led by South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria, reflects the continent's accelerating adoption of solar energy, driven by falling technology costs and the development of large-scale power plants by Chinese firms. As China dominates global solar panel production, these import figures serve as a strong indicator of Africa's growing renewable energy capacity, helping to rewire the continent for a more sustainable future.</p>

          <p>In Massachusetts, some cranberry farmers are opting to convert their unproductive bogs back into natural wetlands through a state-sponsored ecological restoration program. Facing economic headwinds from global competition, rising costs, and extreme weather, farmers are paid to undertake these projects, which restore the land's natural hydrology. The program has already restored over 500 acres, with another 500 planned. These restored wetlands offer significant environmental benefits, including water filtration, carbon storage, and storm resilience, while also providing public access for recreation. For many farmers, it is a way to preserve their land's legacy and ensure it remains in good hands for future generations.</p>
