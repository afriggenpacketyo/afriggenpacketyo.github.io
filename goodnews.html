          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland, citing insufficient justification for the deployment without the state's approval. Judge Karin Immergut stated that the protests in Portland were "not significantly violent or disruptive" enough to warrant such action. The ruling emphasizes the importance of the separation between civil and military rule and warns against government overreach. Oregon officials celebrated the decision, with Governor Tina Kotek stating that "justice has been served, and the truth has prevailed."</p>

          <p>Six Democratic candidates for governor of California addressed labor leaders in San Diego, focusing on issues such as housing affordability, the cost of living, and healthcare cuts. Candidates highlighted their experiences and policy proposals to differentiate themselves and appeal to the union members. Former Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon emphasized his millennial perspective, while former HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra touted his experience in government. The candidates discussed their support for a proposed state constitutional amendment to assist UC workers with housing loans and their commitment to supporting striking Kaiser health employees. The forum underscored the importance of labor support in the upcoming gubernatorial election.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, a significant milestone for the denomination. Curry succeeds the Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, the first woman to lead the ELCA. As leader of the largest American Lutheran Church body, Curry will face challenges common to other mainline Protestant denominations, including theological disputes and membership declines. Curry's unique path to leadership, starting as a social worker and teacher before becoming a pastor, highlights the diversity within the Lutheran Church. His appointment is seen as a positive step toward greater inclusivity and representation within the ELCA.</p>
