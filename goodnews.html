          <p>South Korea's new President Lee Jae Myung, from the liberal Democratic Party, has vowed to prioritize pragmatism to overcome the crisis caused by his predecessor's imposition of martial law. Lee emphasized the need for a pragmatic approach in diplomacy, while also vowing to strengthen trilateral cooperation with the United States and Japan. He also instructed the military to closely monitor developments with North Korea, as tensions escalate on the divided peninsula. Lee's five-year term commenced immediately after winning the snap election, with the presidency vacant since April 4, when Yoon was removed following a Constitutional Court ruling. </p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce a ¬£15 billion investment in transport projects across mayoral authorities in the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. The investment, which will include trams, trains, and buses, aims to stimulate economic growth and improve connectivity in these regions. This move marks a shift from the Treasury's traditional Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the South-East. The funding allocation spans five years, from 2027/28 to 2031/32, and will double the current spending allocation by 2029-30.</p>

The bill addresses tax policy, border security, defense, energy production, and adjustments to SNAP and Medicaid. Senator Rand Paul is a "no" on the legislation because it will increase the nation's debt limit, which as of Tuesday was $36.2 trillion. The White House maintains that the bill will stimulate economic growth and lead to more tax revenue, offsetting the projected deficit increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia's economy grew less than expected in the first quarter of 2025, with a year-on-year growth of 1.3%, unchanged from the previous quarter and below the estimated 1.5%. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy expanded by 0.2%, also falling short of expectations. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the soft growth to shrinking public spending, weakened consumer demand, and reduced exports. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) expects domestic GDP growth to pick up in 2025, driven by a recovery in consumption and continued strength in public demand. (not investment advice)</p>
