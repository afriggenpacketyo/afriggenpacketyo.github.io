          <p>A SkyWest pilot performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 bomber during landing approach in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that the military aircraft was not communicated by the control tower, which lacks radar, leading to the surprise encounter. The FAA, Air Force, and the airline are all investigating the incident, which occurred over the North Dakota State Fair where the B-52 was performing a pre-approved flyover. The airline confirmed all 76 passengers and four crew members landed safely.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, President Trump's universal tariffs have a potential positive side effect. It suggests the tariffs are compelling nations like Canada, China, and the European Union to confront and dismantle their own long-standing internal trade barriers and protectionist policies. The piece posits that by exposing this hypocrisy, the tariffs could spur significant domestic economic reforms that ultimately boost global commerce. The author notes that progress is being seen in Canada and China, while the EU's focus may be shifting elsewhere. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 19:58:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A non-profit organization in Connecticut is working to revitalize the Long Island Sound's ecosystem by returning used oyster shells to the water. The group collects discarded shells from over 50 local restaurants, cures them for a year to eliminate contaminants, and then deposits them back into the Sound. These old shells provide an ideal surface for new baby oysters to grow, which in turn helps filter the water, prevent erosion, and create habitats for hundreds of other species. This initiative aims to reverse the effects of overfishing and improve the overall health of the vital waterway.</p>

          <p>A new, officially licensed "One Piece Cafe" has opened in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, attracting large crowds of fans of the popular Japanese anime and manga series. The permanent restaurant features a nautical, pirate-ship theme and a menu with dishes inspired by the show's characters, along with exclusive merchandise. The cafe's launch highlights the growing mainstream appeal of anime culture in L.A., which has recently seen collaborations between the franchise and major sports teams like the Dodgers and Lakers. The establishment is also seen as a positive force for other local businesses in a neighborhood recovering from recent disruptions.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has highlighted a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase (dubbed "PARC")—that he believes will continue to perform strongly due to relentless enthusiasm from retail investors. He noted that these companies represent a "two-track market" separate from the broader S&P 500, driven by passionate, sometimes irrational, belief rather than traditional metrics alone. While cautioning that investors should exercise discipline and take profits, Cramer suggested that the rally in these names is likely to persist until a wave of new IPOs or insider selling changes the market dynamics.

          <h2>Earth's Accelerated Rotation May Force Timekeepers to Consider Unprecedented "Negative Leap Second"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 19:01:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth is currently spinning faster, resulting in slightly shorter days and prompting discussions about an unprecedented timekeeping adjustment. This acceleration, caused by factors like atmospheric changes and the planet's liquid core, could eventually require the removal of a second—a "negative leap second"—from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to keep atomic clocks synchronized with Earth's rotation. While climate change-induced ice melt is currently counteracting this effect by slowing the spin, the trend has raised concerns about potential disruptions to computer systems and telecommunications that rely on precise time.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has confirmed the withdrawal of all 700 active-duty U.S. marines who were deployed to Los Angeles last month amid protests against immigration enforcement. The deployment, which both the LA mayor and California governor had called unnecessary and provocative, was intended to protect federal property. A Pentagon spokesperson stated the marines' presence helped restore order and that their mission was complete, following the earlier withdrawal of National Guard troops. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reiterated her view that the deployment was an "inappropriate misuse of our troops."</p>

          <p>Argentina has announced it will ease visa requirements for Chinese nationals in a move to strengthen ties with Beijing. Effective immediately, Chinese citizens who hold valid visas for the United States or the European Union will no longer need a separate Argentine visa for tourism or business travel. This policy change comes as Argentina's President Javier Milei seeks to recalibrate his foreign policy. The move is seen as a strategic overture to China amid a delicate balancing act as the South American nation also courts a closer relationship with the United States.</p>

          <p>WNBA players wore shirts with the message "Pay us what you owe us" during warm-ups at the All-Star Game to highlight their ongoing contract negotiations. Having opted out of their last collective bargaining agreement, the players are seeking a new deal with higher salaries and a more equitable revenue-sharing model. Players currently receive just over 9% of league revenue, a stark contrast to the roughly 50% split in the NBA. Amid record viewership and expansion, the players argue their compensation should grow with the business they have helped build.</p>
