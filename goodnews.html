          <p>Patsy Widakuswara, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit fighting Donald Trump's order to dismantle Voice of America, is calling on the media to resist increasing attacks from the administration. Widakuswara's lawsuit, backed by Reporters Without Borders and several unions, argues that the Trump administration is attempting to unlawfully dismantle VOA's operations because they deem it contrary to the government's agenda. The lawsuit claims Trump's executive order violates press freedom, the First Amendment, and laws to prevent executive overreach, with VOA funding approved by Congress, not the president.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey reveals that the biggest inconvenience for foreign visitors to Japan is the scarcity of trash bins in public areas, including train stations. While the situation has improved slightly from the previous year, many tourists still struggle to dispose of their trash and end up carrying it back to their accommodations. This issue has become a public concern as littering in tourist spots has increased due to the removal of trash bins for safety reasons. The survey also highlights communication difficulties and overcrowding as other challenges faced by visitors.</p>
