          <h2>Bipartisan Lawmakers Reintroduce Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:01:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-FL) and Veronica Escobar (D-TX), has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act. This comprehensive immigration reform bill aims to provide a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for at least five years. The proposal includes enhanced border security measures, a seven-year "Dignity Program" requiring restitution payments, and expedited asylum processing. The reintroduction comes amid ongoing debate and legal challenges surrounding the Trump administration's mass deportation policies and enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>Kai Trump, an 18-year-old golf prodigy committed to the University of Miami, spoke about the strong bond she shares with her grandfather, former President Donald Trump, particularly through their mutual love for golf. She credits him with influencing her passion for the sport and appreciates the resources he has provided for her development as an athlete. The article also touches on her recent NIL partnership with Accelerator Active Energy, joining other high-profile athletes like Livvy Dunne and Travis Kelce.

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from federal duty in Los Angeles, about half the force deployed by President Trump over a month ago. The troops were federalized to respond to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests, a move opposed by Governor Gavin Newsom. The Pentagon stated the "lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding," justifying the drawdown. Governor Newsom has called for the remaining troops to also be released, describing their deployment as a political maneuver by the president.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. has reached a trade deal with Indonesia, reducing planned tariffs on Indonesian goods from 32% to 19%. In exchange, Trump stated that American firms will gain "full access" to Indonesian markets with zero tariffs. As part of the agreement, Indonesia has also reportedly committed to purchasing $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. This pact is the latest in a series of negotiations following the administration's threats of widespread tariffs on major trading partners earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Forty-six years after assassinating President Park Chung-hee, the former head of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), Kim Jae-gyu, is being retried by a Seoul court. His family is seeking to overturn his 1980 conviction for insurrection and murder, arguing his actions were a patriotic effort to prevent bloodshed and restore democracy, not a self-serving coup. The case revisits a pivotal and traumatic moment in South Korean history, forcing a re-evaluation of both the assassin and the dictator he killed. The retrial occurs as the nation grapples with contemporary questions about its democracy.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 11,700 Afghans in the U.S. The administration had planned to revoke the protections, arguing the situation in Afghanistan has improved, but the court has paused the termination for one week to review briefs. Advocacy groups praised the ruling as a critical, albeit brief, reprieve for families who fled Taliban persecution after the 2021 U.S. withdrawal. The White House criticized the decision, stating TPS was never intended to be a permanent program.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has called on the financial industry to change the "negative" narrative surrounding investing in stocks and shares for everyday savers. In a speech, she argued that the focus has been too much on risk rather than the potential benefits of growing the economy. The government is consulting with the Financial Conduct Authority to create a new type of targeted support for consumers. This push aims to encourage a shift of some of the £300 billion held in cash savings accounts into UK investments. (not investment advice)</p>
