          <p>As September brings uncertainty about interest rates and global growth, investors are seeking advice on gold investments. Experts recommend considering physical gold, gold ETFs, and gold mining stocks based on individual investment goals and risk tolerance.

Before investing, investors should clarify portfolio goals, liquidity needs, and comfort with short-term volatility.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exporters are reportedly bearing 9% of the cost burden from tariffs imposed by the U.S., indicating their strong bargaining power. According to CICC analysts, U.S. importers struggle to fully pass tariff costs to consumers or shift the burden to exporters, resulting in compressed profit margins. Regression analysis of shipment sizes, tariff rates, and price changes in U.S. imports revealed a 2.4% drop in average prices of goods imported from China between April and July, despite a 27 percentage point tariff increase. This suggests that Chinese goods maintain a competitive edge in the market. The article suggests that China's economy is doing well and absorbing the cost of tariffs. </p>

          <p>The Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa is planning to restart operations by 2028, driven by the increasing electricity demands of AI data centers. NextEra Energy, the plant's owner, seeks a power purchase agreement to revive the facility, which could bring over 600 megawatts back to the grid. The recommissioning has garnered commercial interest from major American companies, with NextEra aiming to capitalize on the growing demand for nuclear power. Restarting Duane Arnold would be a capital-intensive process, but it could offset lost earnings from phasing out renewable energy tax credits. The article signals a resurgence of nuclear power amid growing energy demands. </p>
