          <p>As Republicans consider legislation to cut billions from the Affordable Care Act (ACA), a KFF poll indicates that 45% of adults enrolled in ACA marketplace plans identify as Republicans. The proposed cuts could lead to approximately 15 million people losing health insurance if tax credits are not extended. The self-employed, who tend to lean Republican, are more likely to obtain coverage through ACA exchanges, and many Republicans reside in states that did not expand Medicaid, making them more reliant on ACA subsidies. This situation means that a significant portion of Republicans could face coverage losses if the proposed legislation is enacted. (not investment advice)</p>

This announcement follows a two-year selection process and underscores Britain's commitment to nuclear power, coinciding with a ¬£14.2 billion investment in the Sizewell C power station. The government anticipates the SMR project will create thousands of jobs, bolster regional economies, and enhance energy security. The Labour government projects that these SMRs could power the equivalent of 3 million homes once connected to the grid in the mid-2030s, marking a significant milestone for Rolls-Royce.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has advocated for accelerating the application of new scientific and technological advancements, as China seeks to reduce its reliance on US technology and develop a leading industrial base. During a State Council meeting, Li emphasized the importance of linking innovation with industry to drive new products and services. His remarks come as China faces increased US export restrictions on crucial technologies, including jet engines and chip design software. While US officials have hinted at easing these restrictions if China allows more rare earth mineral exports, the situation highlights China's continued dependence on US technology in strategic sectors.</p>

The increasing demand for new locations is putting pressure on European races, with Zandvoort hosting its last race next year and Spa in Belgium having a limited contract. Thailand is also pushing for a race in Bangkok, and F1 is seeking a venue in Africa, though finding a suitable host is proving challenging.</p>
