        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump called for a full-point interest rate cut from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, even after a strong jobs report indicated a decrease in unemployment. Trump has consistently pressured Powell to lower rates to stimulate the economy, arguing that such cuts would enable the U.S. to reduce long- and short-term debt costs. He also suggested that Powell could raise rates again if inflation were to increase, criticizing the Fed's current policies as costly to the country. Trump's remarks follow a Labor Department report showing that nonfarm payrolls rose by 139,000, exceeding expectations, though analysts had anticipated weaker results due to Trump's tariff policies.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's visit to Washington D.C. and meeting with President Trump was largely overshadowed by the public dispute between Trump and Elon Musk. Despite the distraction, analysts suggest the meeting was a success for Merz, as it diverted attention from potentially controversial topics. Merz addressed key issues such as strengthening U.S.-German relations, tariffs impacting German industries, support for Ukraine, and increased NATO defense spending. Merz also gifted Trump his grandfather's birth certificate to emphasize Trump's family connection to Germany.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food firms are increasingly attempting to reduce the number of ingredients in their products, driven by growing consumer concern over ultra-processed foods. This trend is highlighted by the success of retailers like M&S, which launched a range of products with six or fewer ingredients. Plant-based brands are also responding to surveys indicating shoppers are avoiding meat replacement products due to their processed nature. Nutritionists, however, caution against oversimplifying the issue, arguing that removing fortified nutrients can be detrimental to public health.</p>

          <p>Used vehicle prices decreased slightly in May after reaching a recent high in April, according to Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index. The index, which tracks wholesale prices, fell 1.5% from April to May but remains 4% higher than the previous year. The slight decline comes after consumers, anticipating tariff-related price increases, drove up demand in April. Despite the recent dip, used vehicle prices remain elevated due to relatively strong demand and low inventory levels.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping reportedly appealed to President Trump to restrain those attempting to undermine the U.S.-China trade truce. China's message to Trump was framed as a request from one strong leader to another to maintain control and stay on course. The call reinforces China's desire for stability in trade relations, despite internal pressures and differing viewpoints within the U.S. government. Xi's remarks suggest concerns about the influence of hardliners on U.S. trade policy.</p>
