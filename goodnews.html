          <p>Hurricane Iona has formed in the central Pacific, becoming the first hurricane of the season in that region. Currently a Category 1 storm, it is located hundreds of miles southeast of Honolulu and is not expected to pose a direct threat to the Hawaiian Islands. Forecasters predict Iona will strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane before gradually weakening later in the week as it moves westward. The storm's development follows an active season in the eastern Pacific, which has already seen several named storms.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by an investment fund, Azoria Capital, which sought to compel the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The court ruled that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not subject to the "Sunshine Act" that mandates open meetings for government agencies. The judge questioned if the lawsuit, brought by a fund whose CEO is a known Trump ally critical of the Fed, was a publicity stunt. This decision upholds the long-standing practice of the FOMC meeting in private to deliberate on monetary policy.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve prepares for its July meeting, investors are closely watching the gold market, where prices have recently surged towards the $4,000 per ounce mark. While lower interest rates historically boost gold prices, the metal's value has remained high due to persistent inflation concerns. With the Fed widely expected to hold rates steady this week, analysts suggest the price of gold may remain stable in the short term. However, future price movements could be influenced by the Fed's post-meeting commentary, inflation data, and evolving geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing trade disputes, some of Wall Street's worst fears about a tariff-induced recession are subsiding. Economists note that while tariffs are higher, the effective rate appears to be settling in a 15%-20% range, lower than the more aggressive levels initially threatened by President Trump. This, combined with strong global growth and easing financial conditions, has led some analysts to lower their recession risk forecast. However, strategists caution that the situation remains fluid and further trade escalations could still tip the economy toward a slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to maintain Medicaid reimbursements for all Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide while a lawsuit proceeds. The ruling blocks a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to "defund" the organization by ending its Medicaid payments for one year. The judge stated that restricting access to care could lead to adverse health consequences, such as an increase in unintended pregnancies and untreated STIs. Planned Parenthood had argued that losing Medicaid funds would force the closure of nearly 200 clinics, affecting over a million patients.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is dominating the high-end real estate market, with Paris Hilton and her husband's recent $63 million purchase of a Beverly Hills mansion leading June's most expensive sales. The home was previously owned by actor Mark Wahlberg, who sold it for $55 million in 2023. Real estate agents report that demand is being driven by wealthy buyers displaced by recent wildfires, as well as increasing interest from foreign buyers. This activity suggests continued strength in the L.A. luxury market, with several other high-value properties also recently sold or generating strong interest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study has provided strong evidence that a combination of a healthy diet, regular exercise, and cognitive training can significantly improve thinking and memory in older adults. The two-year study involved over 2,100 sedentary people in their 60s and 70s. Participants who followed the intensive regimen showed cognitive function scores similar to people one to two years younger. These findings suggest that lifestyle interventions can alter the trajectory of age-related cognitive decline and may help delay the onset of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.</p>

The operation led to the shutdown of four websites that hosted millions of files and attracted over 120,000 members, resulting in the conviction of at least 18 leaders and users. Among them was a key administrator, nicknamed "Boss," who was sentenced to life in prison for his role in running one of the world's most significant platforms for sharing material depicting the sexual assault and abuse of children.
