          <p>Sony Financial Group's shares experienced a significant surge, rising 36% on its market debut after parent company Sony Group spun off the unit. This strategic separation aims to enable the financial arm, which includes Sony Life Insurance, Sony Assurance, and Sony Bank, to independently raise growth capital while maintaining brand synergy with the broader Sony ecosystem. The parent company cited competing demands for investment in entertainment and semiconductors as a key driver for the financial unit's newfound operational independence. This positive market performance contributed to a generally upward trend in Asia markets, despite a slight decline in Japan's broader indices following a recent record high.

          <p>USC women’s basketball star JuJu Watkins has announced she will miss the entire upcoming 2025-26 college basketball season to fully recover from a serious knee injury sustained during the NCAA tournament in March. The injury, which occurred during her stellar sophomore season, was a significant blow to USC’s championship aspirations, leading to their Elite Eight loss. While her absence is a major setback, the program, supported by coach Lindsay Gottlieb, will focus on her recovery, with new top prospect Jazzy Davidson expected to help fill some of the void. Watkins, a Compton native, transformed USC into national title contenders and earned numerous accolades, including the Wooden Award and Associated Press player of the year.</p>

          <h2>Expert Advice on Managing Friendships with 'Energy Vampires'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 20:36:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The phenomenon of 'energy vampires' in friendships, individuals who deplete one's emotional and mental vitality, is examined, with common indicators including an excessive demand for attention and a noticeable disinterest in others' lives. Psychologists and journalists suggest that the key to identifying such dynamics is the feeling of being drained after interactions, rather than uplifted. To effectively manage these relationships, experts recommend initiating honest conversations about feeling unheard, which can either foster improvement or reveal a fundamental lack of reciprocity. If direct communication proves ineffective, establishing clear boundaries, such as reducing shared time or altering activities, becomes crucial for self-protection.</p>

          <p>Ensuring a robust methanol supply is crucial for Hong Kong to achieve its ambitious targets in green marine fuels, according to Wang Yongxin, President of CM Energy. While Hong Kong has already successfully implemented liquefied natural gas (LNG) and biodiesel fueling operations, establishing a reliable supply chain for green methanol, from production to storage and distribution, remains a key challenge. This initiative would necessitate the tax-free importation, storage, and sale of mainland-produced green methanol within Hong Kong. The recent maiden voyage of CM Energy's dual-fuel vessel, CM Hong Kong, which utilizes a quarter green methanol, underscores the growing global shift towards sustainable shipping practices, anticipating increased methanol adoption due to Europe's carbon emissions tariff regime.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, is poised for a significant victory and a new parliamentary majority in elections crucial for the country's path to the EU. Despite warnings from Sandu about 'massive Russian interference' and claims of victory from pro-Russian opposition leader Igor Dodon before results, PAS secured nearly 50% of the vote. The election was marred by bomb scares at polling stations and arrests for alleged unrest plotting, which Sandu's party attributed to Moscow-backed criminal groups. This outcome reaffirms Moldova's pro-Western trajectory amidst regional instability and ongoing challenges like inflation and corruption.</p>

The fee, which includes museum and windmill access, seeks to control crowds and fund infrastructure improvements like new toilets. While some tourists express hesitation, local shop and restaurant owners fear a negative impact on their livelihoods, despite the council's plans to invest annual revenues in maintenance and new facilities.</p>

The scheme, building on a previous 'youth guarantee,' will collaborate with private companies to help individuals develop skills for full-time employment.
