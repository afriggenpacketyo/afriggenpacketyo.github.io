          <h2>Financial Planners Advise on Choosing Between Pretax and Roth 401(k) Contributions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 09:39:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding between traditional pretax and after-tax Roth 401(k) contributions can be complex, and financial planners suggest looking beyond simple marginal tax rates. While many weigh their current versus expected future tax brackets, it is more practical to consider one's effective tax rate in retirement, which is often much lower than anticipated. A single person with a $200,000 income might be in the 24% marginal bracket but have an effective tax rate of only 18.5%. This distinction is crucial, as pretax contributions could be more advantageous if a lower effective tax rate is expected during retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first rate cut of 2025 in September, experts anticipate that home equity loan and HELOC interest rates will continue to fall in October. The market is already pricing in expectations of another Fed rate cut later this month, which would further lower borrowing costs for homeowners. Financial experts note that while variable-rate HELOCs will see more immediate reductions, fixed-rate home equity loan rates will also likely trend downward more gradually. This environment could present a timely opportunity for homeowners looking to tap into their home's equity for more affordable financing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of early October 2025, national average interest rates for mortgages and refinances remain elevated compared to previous years, though a recent Federal Reserve rate cut may signal relief for borrowers. The average 30-year mortgage rate is currently around 6.34%, while a 15-year loan averages 5.64%. To secure the best possible rates, financial experts advise borrowers to strengthen their credit profiles, aiming for scores in the mid-to-high 700s. It is also crucial for potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance to shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders to find the most favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The World Trade Organization has increased its forecast for global trade volume growth in 2025 to 2.4%, up from a previous estimate of 0.9%. This upward revision is attributed to strong demand for AI-related goods, disinflation, and supportive fiscal policies in major economies during the first half of the year. However, the outlook for 2026 has been significantly downgraded, with expected growth slashed to just 0.5%. The WTO warns that the global economy is expected to cool and the full impact of higher trade tariffs will be felt, creating a headwind for commerce. (not investment advice)</p>
