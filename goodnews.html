          <p>The Planet Money newsletter explores the potential of revitalizing the manufacturing sector to promote economic growth in the American heartland and reduce regional inequality. Manufacturing, as a tradable sector, can attract new wealth from outside a community and foster economic ecosystems. Economists estimate that each manufacturing job can create additional jobs in the local community through multiplier effects. While manufacturing may not be the only solution for struggling communities, it presents a viable option for regionally diversified economic growth.</p>
