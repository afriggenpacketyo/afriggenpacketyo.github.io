          <p>Ireland's Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano by majority decision, winning the third and final fight of their historic boxing trilogy at Madison Square Garden. The bout was a tactical affair, with Taylor boxing smartly and effectively to retain her undisputed light-welterweight championship. Following the victory, the 39-year-old champion acknowledged the significance of the rivalry but remained noncommittal about her future in the sport, stating she would take time to decide her next steps. The event marked a significant moment for women's boxing, featuring an all-female card at the iconic venue.</p>

          <p>A fugitive who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May has been recaptured and extradited back to Kentucky to face multiple charges. The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared photos of the man, Sedrick T. Stevenson, smiling broadly while being escorted by multiple officers on a plane. Stevenson had been on the run for over a month after slipping away from a transport agent at a ticket counter. Authorities coordinated a multi-agency effort to ensure his secure return, with officials joking that he received "VIP service."</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior employees, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. As part of the agreement, Google is not investing in the company but will gain a nonexclusive license to certain Windsurf technology while the startup remains independent. This move highlights the intense competition for top talent in the artificial intelligence sector, following similar high-profile talent acquisitions by competitors like Meta and Microsoft. The deal was made after talks for Windsurf to be acquired by OpenAI fell through.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing significant criticism. The controversy arose when Prada showcased sandals at Milan Men's Fashion Week that closely resembled traditional Indian Kolhapuri chappals, without acknowledging their cultural origins. Following a social media outcry and calls for recognition from an Indian commerce chamber, Prada engaged in talks to discuss future collaborations. This move is seen as a step toward respectful engagement between global fashion brands and traditional craft communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration raids in several Southern California counties. The ruling sides with a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other groups, which argued that federal agents were using unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling and warrantless arrests. The judge found there was a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims and enjoined agents from making stops based solely on factors like race, language, or location. The order comes amid heightened enforcement that has instilled fear in local immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company deceptively used their voices to create AI clones for its text-to-speech platform after hiring them for what they were told were internal projects. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to their voices, key allegations of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to training data will proceed. The decision is seen as a significant step for artists seeking accountability from AI companies.</p>

This expansion reflects a proactive response to changing global economic dynamics and a push from Beijing to support its companies' international ventures.

          <p>Chinese manufacturers of portable power banks are facing intense scrutiny after several incidents where defective units caught fire during commercial flights. In response, China's Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC) has implemented an emergency ban on carrying substandard power banks on domestic flights. Specifically, any portable battery lacking the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark is now barred from aircraft. This new rule has led to widespread confusion among air travelers and large piles of abandoned power banks at Chinese airports.</p>

          <p>Chinese pharmaceutical companies are actively developing more than 60 drugs intended to compete with popular weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy. This surge in development is driven by the upcoming expiration of the patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in these drugs, in China next year. Analysts predict that the entry of numerous generic versions into the market will significantly increase competition and drive down prices. This could make these highly sought-after treatments for diabetes and obesity much more affordable and accessible for patients in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

The Czech Railway Authority plans to dismantle the bridge, citing corrosion and the need for a new, three-track structure to handle growing rail traffic. However, a coalition of architects, engineers, and heritage campaigners argues that the plan is unnecessary and that the bridge can be repaired and preserved in place. They have garnered public support and an endorsement from Unesco, proposing an alternative that would save the historic structure while still expanding capacity.</p>
