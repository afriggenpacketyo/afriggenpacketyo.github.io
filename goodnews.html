          <p>Simon Yates, a British cyclist, delivered an exceptional performance in the penultimate stage of the Giro d'Italia, seizing the pink jersey from Isaac del Toro to secure his second Grand Tour title. Yates launched a decisive attack on the Colle delle Finestre, overcoming a previous setback at the same location in 2018. His Visma-Lease A Bike team strategically positioned Wout van Aert in the breakaway group, enabling Yates to catch him on the descent and establish a significant lead. Yates expressed his emotions after the victory, acknowledging the years of hard work and setbacks that led to this achievement, becoming the third British rider to win the Giro. The win solidifies Yates's place among cycling's elite, marking a significant milestone in his career.</p>

          <p>Blue Origin successfully launched six passengers on a sub-orbital trip to the edge of space, providing them with a few minutes of weightlessness and views of Earth. The New Shepard rocket climbed to nearly 65 miles above Earth, allowing the crew to experience weightlessness before descending back to the West Texas landing site. The flight marked Blue Origin's twelfth passenger flight since July 2021, bringing the total number of passengers launched to 68, including four who have flown twice. Blue Origin has dominated the sub-orbital passenger market since Virgin Galactic paused flights to focus on upgrading its spacecraft.</p>

The surgery involved removing part of her eye socket and cheekbone to reach the tumor, followed by reconstruction.
