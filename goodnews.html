          <p>Top tennis players are increasingly voicing concerns about the unsustainable physical demands of the current tennis calendar. Australian player Alex de Minaur attributed his early French Open exit to burnout, echoing sentiments shared by other players like Jack Draper and Iga Swiatek. Casper Ruud criticized the rankings "rat race," while de Minaur warned of shortened careers due to mental exhaustion. The ATP and WTA Tours acknowledge these concerns and state that player health and wellbeing are a priority. The search for solutions to alleviate the strain on players is ongoing.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that parents in Europe generally find their lives more meaningful compared to childfree individuals, but experience lower life satisfaction. The study, based on data from the European Social Survey, highlights that the level of satisfaction varies significantly depending on the country's family policies and social support systems. Scandinavian countries, with robust childcare and parental support, show less difference in life satisfaction between parents and non-parents. The study also suggests that greater gender equality contributes to higher parental satisfaction, particularly for mothers.</p>
