          <p>New York City Democrats headed to the polls to select their nominee for mayor in a race with national implications, viewed as a proxy war between the party's left-wing and moderate factions. The primary pits democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani against former Governor Andrew Cuomo, with Comptroller Brad Lander trailing behind. Mamdani, endorsed by prominent progressives, focuses on affordability with proposals like free public buses and universal childcare, while Cuomo, seeking a comeback after a sexual harassment scandal, emphasizes experience and public safety. Critics question Mamdani's ambitious promises, while Cuomo faces scrutiny over his past actions and management style, and the ranked-choice voting system adds further complexity to the election outcome. The results of this election will be closely watched by Democrats across the country as they attempt to take on Trump.</p>

          <p>Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old employee nicknamed "Big Balls," has resigned from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) less than a month after Elon Musk's departure. Coristine gained attention for his irreverent nickname and his efforts to investigate wasteful spending in the federal government, finding numerous payments lacking details about their recipients and purposes. He claimed the system distributing taxpayer money lacked accountability, making it susceptible to fraud and abuse. DOGE, established by the Trump administration and initially led by Musk, aimed to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, achieving approximately $180 billion in savings through various measures. Coristine's resignation adds to the staffing shakeup within DOGE following Musk's exit.</p>

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in the U.K. and consumed a week's supply of honey before falling asleep. The park stated that the bears posed no threat to the public, but visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. Keepers used recall training to encourage the bears back into their enclosure, and an investigation is underway to determine how the animals escaped due to an "operational error". Mish and Lucy were rescued in 2021 after being abandoned in the Albanian mountains.</p>

          <p>According to the UK's Climate Change Committee, electric car and heat pump adoption is growing, but further increases are needed to meet net-zero targets. The committee emphasizes the need for households to benefit from cleaner technologies through lower bills, urging the government to make electricity more affordable. While electric car sales have nearly doubled in two years and heat pump sales are up, they remain below target, and the CCC praised relaxed planning rules for heat pumps. The CCC suggests removing charges from electricity bills to support renewable energy projects to lower prices, but this would require government funding.</p>

The judge granted a partial injunction, ruling that the states' lawsuit would likely succeed, but the ruling did not apply to the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Vermont. The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the Biden administration's national electric vehicle infrastructure program. The Government Accountability Office previously found that the Trump administration violated the law by withholding the funding, but the White House challenged those findings.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have used the cosmic dance of dying stars to study the Milky Way's past, finding that stars born today spin up to 10 times faster than those formed billions of years ago. This extra spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to take shape. The study, based on data from Europe's Gaia space telescope and other sky surveys, presents the first direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time. The findings offer a new way to study how the galaxy has changed over time.</p>

Recent moves focus on expanding futures market access for foreign investors and allowing foreign currencies as collateral for yuan-settled trades.

          <p>A recovery in Hong Kong‚Äôs initial public offering (IPO) market has delivered returns above 30 per cent for investors, defying a sluggish economy and languid property market. Holding new shares from the 34 companies that have pulled off offerings in 2025 would generate an average return of 34 per cent. Institutional investors have returned to the stock market, and local investors have shifted from the property market to the IPO market. Mark Yue, a 36-year-old fintech worker, is one of thousands caught up in the frenzy, and he is subscribing to popular, high-capitalisation IPOs, usually funded by margin financing equivalent to 10 times the principal.

          <h2>Childhood Vaccination Efforts Face Challenges Despite Progress</h2>

          <p>Childhood vaccinations have saved an estimated 154 million lives in the past 50 years, but efforts to boost vaccination rates have stalled or reversed in many places since 2010. A study in The Lancet found that measles vaccination rates dropped in 100 countries between 2010 and 2019, and COVID-19 disrupted vaccination efforts. India has been successful in reducing the number of zero-dose children, and the world's changing birth rate presents both assurances and challenges for vaccination efforts. Funding cuts and vaccine misinformation also pose significant challenges.</p>

          <h2>LAPD to Use Drones as First Responders Under New Program</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Commission approved an updated policy allowing the LAPD to deploy drones on routine emergency calls. Citing successes in other police departments, the commission said the technology offers crucial, real-time information about potential threats to responding officers. The new guidelines list other scenarios for future drone use, including high-risk incidents and large-scale events, and transfers their command to the Office of Special Operations. The drones will not be equipped with weapons or facial recognition software, and footage captured will be subject to periodic audits.</p>

          <h2>Natural History Museum to Display Newly Identified Dog-Sized Dinosaur</h2>

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London will display a newly identified dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, a labrador-sized creature that lived 150 million years ago. Initially classified as a Nanosaurus, scientists now conclude it is a different animal, and the name means puzzling runner. The discovery sheds light on the evolutionary history of early small dinosaurs and the remains are the most complete of any in the world for early small dinosaurs. Scientists are untangling the mystery around the names and categorization of dinosaurs to understand how many species exist.</p>
