        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, led the New York City Democratic primary, potentially becoming the city's first Muslim mayor. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded after Mamdani secured 43.5% of the vote with 90% counted. New York City utilizes a ranked-choice voting system, meaning the Board of Elections will tally second-choice candidates, likely benefiting Mamdani due to his cross-endorsement with Brad Lander. Given the city's Democratic lean, the primary winner is likely to win the mayoral election in November, marking a significant shift in the city's political landscape.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral primary is being closely watched nationally as a battle between the Democratic Party's left-wing and moderate factions. Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, is challenging former Governor Andrew Cuomo, viewed as the establishment candidate. Mamdani's platform focuses on affordability, including free public buses and universal childcare, but critics question the feasibility of his ambitious promises. With ranked-choice voting in place, the outcome remains uncertain, but the race highlights the ongoing internal struggle within the Democratic Party to define its future direction.</p>

          <p>Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old with the nickname "Big Balls," has resigned from his post at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), following Elon Musk's departure. Coristine, a software developer, gained attention for his irreverent nickname and his work investigating wasteful spending in the federal government. He claimed to have found a multitude of outgoing payments from the Treasury Department lacking details about their recipients or purpose, describing the system as lacking accountability. DOGE has reportedly achieved roughly $180 billion in savings through various cost-cutting measures since its inception.</p>

Coristine's youth and online moniker became a pop-culture meme as DOGE implemented job cuts across federal agencies. Prior to joining DOGE, Coristine worked at Musk's Neuralink and ran a company called DiamondCDN that provided network services. Reports indicate that DiamondCDN's users included a website run by a cybercrime ring, raising questions about Coristine's past activities.</p>

The bears posed no threat to the public, and visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution.

          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports that more people are buying electric cars and installing heat pumps, but further increases are needed to meet net-zero targets. The government needs to ensure households benefit from cleaner technologies through lower bills, and the committee argues that achieving net zero by 2050 is achievable and could bring long-term economic benefits. While electric car sales are rising, heat pump sales remain below target, and electricity costs need to be addressed to make these technologies more affordable. The committee suggests removing charges from electricity bills to support renewable energy projects.</p>

The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion allocated under the national electric vehicle infrastructure (Nevi) program.

          <p>Chinese astronomers have used the slowing spin of dying stars to understand how stars are born, finding that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. Using data from Europe's Gaia space telescope, researchers studied thousands of stars and found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than older ones. The extra spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form, providing evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>
