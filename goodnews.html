        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI startup Perplexity has made a surprising $34.5 billion bid to acquire Google's Chrome, the world's most popular web browser. In a letter to Google's parent company, Alphabet, Perplexity argued that moving Chrome to an independent operator would enhance user safety and choice. The offer comes as Google faces intense antitrust scrutiny, with a federal judge potentially ordering a breakup of its search business. However, industry investors have dismissed the bid as a "stunt," noting the offer is significantly below Chrome's estimated value and that it is unclear if Google has any intention of selling the browser.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has mandated that the Trump administration reinstate hundreds of National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants for UCLA that were abruptly frozen. The ruling stated the administration's suspension of the funds, which affected over a third of a $584 million freeze, violated a previous court order. The government had justified the cuts by citing allegations of discrimination and antisemitism at the university. This case represents the first legal challenge to the mass grant suspensions, with the judge determining that the indefinite suspensions were effectively terminations and ordering the administration to report on its compliance.</p>

          <p>United Launch Alliance (ULA) has successfully launched its new Vulcan rocket on its first operational mission for the U.S. Space Force, deploying two military satellites into geosynchronous orbit. The launch from Cape Canaveral marks a major milestone, as the Vulcan is now certified to carry high-value national security payloads. This new American-made rocket is designed to replace ULA's legacy Atlas V and Delta launchers, the former of which relied on Russian-built engines. The successful flight positions ULA to better compete in the national security launch market, particularly for complex missions to high orbits.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has introduced a year-long initiative to subsidize interest costs on personal consumer loans in an effort to boost household spending and support domestic demand. Under the plan, the government will cover one percentage point of the annual interest on qualifying loans, with the central government funding 90% of the cost. The policy targets a range of purchases, including smaller transactions and larger ones for cars and education. This move is part of Beijing's broader strategy to unlock consumer spending potential and shore up the nation's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While overall cancer survival has doubled in the last 50 years, a new study highlights a growing disparity, with survival rates for some of the deadliest cancers showing little improvement. Cancers affecting the pancreas, oesophagus, stomach, and lungs still have 10-year survival rates below 20%. In contrast, survival for melanoma and breast cancer has risen dramatically due to advances in early detection and targeted treatments. Researchers and cancer charities are calling for a new government strategy to focus on cutting wait times, improving early detection, and investing in research for these harder-to-treat cancers.</p>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will add questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to the car and motorcycle theory test starting in early 2026. The initiative aims to equip the millions of learner drivers who take the test each year with life-saving knowledge, as drivers are often the first to arrive at the scene of a medical emergency. Learning materials have been updated to include information on how to perform CPR and use a public access defibrillator. Officials hope this change could help prevent avoidable deaths by increasing the number of people trained in basic first aid.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers rookie receiver Ladd McConkey is now able to learn directly from veteran Keenan Allen, whose practice film he studied before Allen's recent return to the team. McConkey, who surpassed Allen's rookie records, has been actively seeking advice from the veteran, who is renowned for his precise route-running. The two are now participating in practice sessions together, and the team's offensive coordinator noted Allen's presence creates flexibility and strengthens the offense. Their on-field collaboration is highly anticipated as the team prepares for the upcoming season with a versatile group of receivers.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has declared the water safe to drink for residents in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch, lifting a boil water notice that was in effect for a week. The advisory impacted about 9,200 households following a water service outage caused by a faulty, decades-old valve that became stuck. After resuming water flow, the DWP confirmed the water meets safety standards. The agency is urging residents to thoroughly flush their home plumbing systems and appliances before consumption and will issue a $20 credit to affected customers.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has officially acknowledged that France used "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the African nation's fight for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for events that cost "tens of thousands of lives." This admission follows a 2022 report commissioned by France which detailed how the French army used forced displacement, internment camps, and brutal militias to suppress the independence movement. The acknowledgment is part of a broader, though often contested, effort by Macron for France to confront its colonial history.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested four teenagers allegedly connected to a string of burglaries targeting high-profile celebrities, including a recent raid on actor Brad Pitt's home. The suspects, described as street gang members, were identified after an investigation into the June burglary where thieves broke into Pitt's Los Feliz property. Police Chief Jim McDonnell stated the crew targeted actors and professional athletes, sometimes using sophisticated methods like surveillance cameras and Wi-Fi jammers. Stolen property was recovered during searches of the suspects' homes, highlighting the vulnerability of public figures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market rallied significantly, with major indices approaching record highs, following the release of a new inflation report. Data for July showed consumer prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, which was slightly below economists' expectations and fueled hopes for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. This positive data increased traders' bets on a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, which would lower borrowing costs and stimulate the economy. The report provides the Fed with more flexibility as it navigates its goals of managing inflation while maintaining a healthy job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexico has extradited 26 inmates, described as "key operatives" of major drug cartels like Jalisco New Generation and Sinaloa, to the United States to face charges. This marks the second major transfer this year and comes as the White House continues to pressure Mexico to intensify its crackdown on drug trafficking. The extradited individuals are wanted for violent offenses and organized crime. The move demonstrates ongoing, albeit tense, collaboration between the two countries on security issues, particularly the fight against fentanyl smuggling, with Mexico stipulating that none of the prisoners would be eligible for the death penalty.</p>

          <p>The National Police Chiefs' Council in the UK has issued new guidance encouraging police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile and sensitive cases. The change aims to increase transparency and combat misinformation that can risk public safety, as seen after the 2024 Southport riots. While the decision to release such information will remain with individual forces, the new framework seeks to create more consistency. The move comes after public debate and is part of a wider review of how police interact with the media in an age of rapid social media speculation.</p>
