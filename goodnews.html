          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder, gave his first network interview since being detained during a citizenship interview. Mahdawi, who helped lead Columbia's protests against the Israel-Hamas war, was detained under a rarely used law revoking visas for people the Secretary of State believes could pose "adverse foreign policy consequences." He addressed President Trump directly, stating he wouldn't be silenced and emphasized his role as a peacemaker. Mahdawi sued in federal court, arguing his First Amendment rights were violated, and was subsequently released by a judge who cited substantial claims of retaliation for protected speech.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to assist qualifying students with private school tuition. The bill allows most students attending accredited private schools to receive $10,000 annually, while students with disabilities can receive up to $30,000, and home-schooled students will get $2,000 a year. Democrats argue that the legislation will harm public schools by diverting funds to wealthier students already in private education. The bill's passage marks a significant victory for school choice advocates in Texas. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility in South Texas is progressing towards becoming an official city named Starbase, with a vote approving its formal organization.

          <p>A federal judge ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a State Supreme Court race, marking a significant legal victory for Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs. The ruling rejected Republican challenger Judge Jefferson Griffin's efforts to discard thousands of votes, with the judge stating that retroactively invalidating ballots would violate voters' due process rights. Judge Griffin has been given seven days to appeal the decision, but if the ruling stands, it will conclude an election dispute that has lasted nearly six months.
