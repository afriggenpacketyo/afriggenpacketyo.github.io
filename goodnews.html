        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Best Buy has lowered its full-year sales and profit forecast, citing the impact of higher tariffs on consumer electronics. CEO Corie Barry mentioned that the company has already increased prices on some items to offset these costs, although she didn't specify which ones for competitive reasons. The retailer's fiscal first-quarter earnings also revealed a drop in net income and revenue compared to the previous year, with comparable sales declining due to decreased purchases of home theaters, appliances, and drones. Best Buy is adjusting its import mix and encouraging vendors to manufacture in multiple countries to mitigate tariff effects. (not investment advice)</p>

McAfee reposted Mellencamp's statement on X, acknowledging his role in instigating the behavior.

          <p>A court has sided with the California Coastal Commission in its fight against Sable Offshore Corp., ordering the company to halt construction and repairs until it obtains official approvals. The ruling upholds a cease and desist order issued by the commission, which argues that Sable violated the Coastal Act by upgrading oil pipelines without necessary permits. Sable insists it is only repairing existing pipelines and doesn't need new permits, but the court found that the work constitutes "development" under the Coastal Act. Sable plans to appeal the ruling.</p>
