          <p>Despite recent underperformance and challenges, including tariffs and perceived lack of innovation, CNBC's Jim Cramer remains optimistic about Apple's future. He argues that historical downturns for the company have consistently presented strong buying opportunities for long-term investors. Citing faith in CEO Tim Cook's leadership and Apple's projected 14% earnings growth, Cramer suggests the stock's value should be considered in the context of its growth potential. He believes there is a price point at which the stock becomes too cheap to ignore. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that federal authorities have arrested over 2,700 alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) since President Trump took office. The announcement came during a White House briefing, where Bondi emphasized that violent criminal immigrants are a top priority for deportation. The Trump administration has designated TdA as a terrorist organization, a move that facilitates the expedited removal of its members under the Alien Enemies Act. Bondi credited the administration's policies for making the country safer from such violent criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>NASA has advised residents of Southern California not to be alarmed by unusually low-flying aircraft in the coming days. Two research planes, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will be flying between 1,000 and 10,000 feet over the Los Angeles Basin, Salton Sea, and Central Valley. The flights are part of NASA's Student Airborne Research Program, designed to collect atmospheric data and measure land and water surfaces. The aircraft will perform unusual maneuvers, including vertical spirals over urban areas and simulated missed landings to gather air samples.</p>

          <p>Australia defeated the West Indies by a commanding 159 runs in the first Test match, largely due to a remarkable bowling performance from Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies team collapsed in the final session of the third day, losing all ten of their wickets and falling well short of the 301-run victory target. Hazlewood was the chief destroyer, taking five wickets for 43 runs to dismantle the hosts' batting lineup. Despite some resistance from Justin Greaves and Shamar Joseph, Australia's ruthless display secured the win with two full days to spare.</p>

His capture leaves one fugitive, Derrick Groves, still at large.

          <p>A team of specialized divers has successfully completed the first human exploration of the SS Nemesis, a steamship that sank during a storm off the coast of Sydney in 1904, killing all 32 people aboard. The shipwreck, discovered in 2022, lies at a depth of about 525 feet, requiring a complex technical dive in complete darkness. The team had only nine minutes at the wreck site to survey and film its condition, noting scattered coal but no visible personal artifacts. The six-hour ascent was the most time-consuming part of the mission, which provided new insights into the century-old maritime disaster.</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed optimism that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be finalized within the next week. The administration has been actively pushing for a pause in the conflict, which began after Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023. A previous proposal for a 60-day ceasefire was met with amendments from Hamas that were deemed unacceptable by the U.S. The ongoing war has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The president's statement suggests renewed momentum in diplomatic efforts to halt the fighting and secure the release of remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>Financial advisor Ric Edelman has significantly increased his recommended allocation for cryptocurrencies in investment portfolios, now suggesting a range of 10% to 40%. This marks a substantial shift from his previous advice, reflecting what he calls the "evolution of crypto" into a mainstream asset. Edelman argues the traditional 60/40 stock-to-bond model is obsolete due to increased human longevity, requiring assets with higher growth potential. He posits that crypto's lack of correlation with traditional assets makes it a valuable tool for portfolio diversification and achieving higher returns. (not investment advice)</p>

The increases come as the federal minimum wage has remained unchanged at $7.25 per hour since 2009.
