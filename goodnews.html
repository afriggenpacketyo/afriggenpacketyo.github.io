          <h2>Demand for Workers with AI Skills Surges in US Job Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 17:37:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Brookings Institution report reveals a significant increase in U.S. job postings requiring artificial intelligence skills, with a more than 100% rise in the last year alone. While overall AI job growth has been accelerating, it still constitutes a small portion of the total labor market, with peak adoption expected in the early 2030s. These positions, spanning tech hubs and expanding into other sectors like finance and marketing, offer an average salary premium of 28% compared to similar roles without AI requirements. This trend reflects growing corporate integration of AI and is creating new roles in AI consulting and ethics.</p>

          <h2>Former Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn Announces Formation of New Political Party</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 17:37:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, is launching a new political party aimed at challenging the established political order and advocating for wealth redistribution. Alongside independent MP Zarah Sultana, Corbyn stated the yet-unnamed party will offer a community-led alternative to what he describes as Labour's centralized control and the divisive politics of Reform UK. The initiative seeks to capitalize on left-wing political energy, focusing on issues like child poverty and corporate profits. While the party's platform will be determined at a future conference, it is positioned to the left of Labour on key policies.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is launching a test of ten new beverages in hundreds of its U.S. restaurants, marking a new phase in its beverage strategy. The move is a direct response to growing demand from Gen Z customers for flavorful and unique cold drinks. This initiative follows the company's decision to shutter its standalone beverage-focused chain, CosMc's, and instead integrate its popular concepts directly into the main restaurant menu. The new drink lineup, which includes items like a Strawberry Watermelon Refresher and Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew, will first be available in select markets starting in September.</p>

          <p>Alice Bag and Kid Congo Powers, influential figures from the 1970s Los Angeles punk scene, have formed a new musical duo called Juanita y Juan. The project, which they describe as "loud lounge," explores Latin and tropical rhythms and was born after they collaborated on a song for a television series. In a recent interview, the two Chicano artists reflected on their early days in a punk scene that included many Latino musicians whose identities were often overlooked. They discussed how their shared heritage and outsider status bonded them, and how their music continues to resonate with new generations.</p>

          <p>UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster delivered a poised and confident address at the Big Ten media day, a stark contrast to his widely criticized, unrehearsed performance a year prior. Foster humorously acknowledged his previous stumbles while confidently outlining his vision for the team, which is entering its second season under his leadership. After a difficult start last season, the team showed significant improvement, and Foster has since overhauled his staff and improved recruiting, notably landing quarterback Nico Iamaleava from the transfer portal. His confident demeanor reflects a program that believes it is on an upward trajectory despite low preseason expectations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued an order to block a lower-court ruling from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that would have severely weakened the Voting Rights Act. The appeals court decision had stated that only the U.S. Justice Department, not private citizens or civil rights groups, could sue under a key provision of the landmark 1965 law. The case originated from a redistricting dispute in North Dakota brought by two Native American tribes. The Supreme Court's temporary stay preserves the right of private parties to file such lawsuits for now, with three conservative justices dissenting from the order.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The iconic heavy metal touring festival Ozzfest was created in 1996 as a direct result of Lollapalooza rejecting Ozzy Osbourne as an artist. According to his wife and manager, Sharon Osbourne, she was told Ozzy was "not relevant," which prompted her to launch their own festival. The first Ozzfest was a two-date event but quickly grew into a juggernaut that provided a major platform for both established and emerging metal bands like System of a Down and Disturbed. The festival became a defining cultural force in heavy music, celebrated for its commitment to a subculture often overlooked by the mainstream.</p>

BT, which owns EE, apologized for the inconvenience and stated that the issue was caused by a technical fault that has now been fixed, with all services returning to normal operation.</p>

          <p>San Francisco's public transit agency, Muni, has wrapped three of its vehicles in tie-dye and paisley designs to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Grateful Dead. The themed buses and train will help transport fans to a series of Dead & Company concerts in Golden Gate Park. City officials, including Mayor Daniel Lurie, hope the celebration will provide a significant economic boost, citing a previous Dead & Company show that generated $31 million for the local economy. The initiative is also seen as a way to promote public transit at a time when Muni is facing a substantial budget deficit despite ridership recovering.</p>

          <p>Intel's second-quarter revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, but the company also announced significant spending cuts in its chip manufacturing division. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan stated there would be "no more blank checks," canceling planned factory projects in Europe and slowing construction of a new facility in Ohio. This strategic shift aims to address a period of excessive investment without sufficient demand. The company's client computing and data center groups saw mixed results, and Intel plans to reduce its workforce by 15% as part of a broader effort to cut operating expenses and regain market competitiveness.

          <p>The ride-sharing company Lyft is rolling out a new feature that allows riders to designate specific drivers as a "favorite." After a positive ride experience, a user can favorite the driver in the app, and Lyft's system will then prioritize matching them with that driver for future scheduled rides. The company says this function is designed to foster better connections between riders and drivers and give users more control over their experience. For drivers, the feature offers priority access to ride requests from customers who have favorited them, potentially leading to more consistent earnings and relationships.</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant jump, positioning it as the newest meme stock to capture the attention of individual investors. The rally appears to be fueled by discussion on Reddit's Wall Street Bets forum and the company's high short interest, which makes it a target for a potential short squeeze. Adding to the buzz, the company announced a new marketing campaign for its denim line featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. This surge follows similar volatile trading in other stocks like GoPro and Krispy Kreme, driven by coordinated interest from retail traders this week. (not investment advice)</p>
