        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Trump-appointed judge in California has blocked the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing inadequate due process. This ruling is the latest in a series of legal challenges to the administration's practice of rapidly deporting individuals accused of gang membership under the 1798 law. The judge, John Holcomb, stated that the government had not provided sufficient notice for individuals to challenge their deportation, emphasizing that individuals should have the opportunity to contest their designation as an alien enemy. While other judges have questioned the legality of using the Alien Enemies Act for gang-related deportations, Holcomb focused on the lack of due process afforded to the migrants, adding to the complicated legal landscape surrounding the Act. </p>

          <p>An escaped zebra caused traffic disruptions on a busy Tennessee roadway after escaping from its owners over the weekend. The zebra, which had been recently "obtained" by its owners, was reported missing on Saturday and was later spotted near Interstate 24. Deputies closed lanes of traffic to ensure the safety of both travelers and the animal as it ran through the highway. The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office did not disclose how the owners acquired the zebra or where it was being housed at the time of its escape, but authorities were able to capture the zebra after a brief chase. </p>

          <p>Leaders from the fashion industry, including Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour, met with White House officials to discuss potential tariff relief. The fashion industry, which supports ten million American jobs, has historically faced high tariffs compared to other sectors of the economy. The goal of the meeting was to discuss balanced trade and strategies to maintain jobs in the U.S. while preserving American prosperity. The industry argues that tariffs have burdened fashion companies, leading to increased prices for consumers and hindering the industry's growth.</p>

          <p>The San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California have settled a 15-year legal battle over water costs. The agreement establishes a fixed price for delivering water supplies, starting at $671 per acre-foot in 2026, with annual adjustments for inflation. The settlement ends years of conflict and enables greater collaboration between the agencies to improve their finances and efficiently move water where needed. This agreement brings greater fiscal certainty to both agencies and creates new opportunities to move water to communities that need it most, stabilizing water rates for San Diego County residents.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight USDA outposts in California, following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. The lawmakers argued that closing these offices would negatively impact farmers' access to essential resources such as loans, grants, and technical assistance. The original closures were part of a broader effort led by Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency to cut costs, but the reversal highlights the importance of these offices to California's agricultural sector. The USDA will continue discussions regarding the Mt. Shasta office, the only remaining location slated for potential closure.</p>
