          <p>The United Kingdom recorded its hottest day of the year, with temperatures exceeding 32¬∞C, and Suffolk became the first area to officially enter a heatwave after three consecutive days above 27¬∞C. Amber heat health alerts are in effect across England, with warnings of potential strain on health and social care services, and temperatures are expected to peak at 33¬∞C on Saturday, with some areas potentially experiencing "tropical nights." Fire services are issuing water safety warnings, and health organizations are advising precautions for vulnerable individuals, while a change in wind direction on Sunday is expected to bring cooler temperatures and break the heatwave. The Met Office declares a heatwave when a threshold temperature is met for at least three consecutive days. The heatwave is due to an area of high pressure situated across the UK which, with a south-easterly wind, draws in hot weather from other parts of Western Europe.

The video-sharing app faced potential banning unless sold, and the new deadline for securing a buyer is now September 17. TikTok expressed gratitude for Trump's support in keeping the app available for its 170 million US users, and the authorities in Beijing must approve any sale. The law prompting the sale stems from fears that the Chinese government could compel TikTok or ByteDance to hand over data on US users. </p>
