          <p>France is significantly increasing its stake in satellite operator Eutelsat, positioning it as a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. The French state led a ‚Ç¨1.35 billion investment, becoming the largest shareholder in an effort to bolster Europe's technological sovereignty in the space sector. However, experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to match Starlink's scale, noting its LEO satellite constellation is less than a tenth the size of its American rival's. While Eutelsat may struggle in the mass market, it is well-positioned to serve security-sensitive and enterprise segments that prioritize European jurisdictional control. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quemoy Island, a territory administered by Taipei but located less than 10km from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in the cross-strait relationship. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. Despite its history as a symbol of Taipei's governance model, on-the-ground observations reveal the limitations of influence from both Beijing and Taipei. The island's 130,000 residents navigate a complex identity, highlighting the nuanced realities that exist beyond the broader geopolitical standoff between the two powers.</p>

While his pitching was strong, allowing just one single and a walk, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats during the game.

          <p>New regulations have gone into effect across France, banning smoking on all beaches, in public parks, and near schools and libraries. The move is part of a broader government strategy to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and protect children from the dangers of passive smoking, which causes thousands of deaths annually. The ban, which does not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants, comes with potential fines up to ‚Ç¨700. Despite having one of the higher smoking rates in Europe, the habit is reportedly declining in France.</p>
