          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 08:40:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labor Department reported that the annual inflation rate in April was 2.3%, slightly below the anticipated 2.4%, indicating a potentially slowing U.S. economy affected by President Trump's tariffs. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% for the month, aligning with Dow Jones consensus estimates. Core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, also increased by 0.2% monthly and 2.8% year-over-year, matching forecasts. This data provides an early look at the economic impacts of the tariffs, though economists suggest the full effects may take several months to materialize due to front-loading of purchases by consumers and businesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended Prime Minister Keir Starmer's use of the phrase "island of strangers" in a speech about cutting immigration, arguing he aimed to highlight the impact of rising migration and support for integration. Starmer's remarks drew criticism from some Labour MPs who compared the language to that of Enoch Powell, but Cooper dismissed these comparisons. Downing Street also rejected the comparison, emphasizing Starmer's argument that migrants contribute to the country but migration needs control. Other politicians weighed in, with London Mayor Sadiq Khan stating he would not have used the same phrase, and Conservative Robert Jenrick claiming the warning was "already" true in parts of the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reduced tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% for a limited time, signaling a potential shift in trade strategy amid concerns about rising prices and economic strain. This move comes after President Trump initially imposed high tariffs, leading to warnings from retailers about potential price increases and supply shortages. China is reciprocating by lowering its tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%, and both sides will continue trade negotiations. Despite the reduction, tariffs remain higher than pre-Trump's second term, impacting prices on various imported goods. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.3% in April, indicating that inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Economists are closely monitoring the impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, as tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. companies, which are typically passed on to consumers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has stated that the central bank is adopting a wait-and-see approach to the tariffs, acknowledging their potential to increase inflation and slow economic growth. Some consumers and businesses have accelerated orders to avoid the tariffs, potentially delaying the tariffs' impact on economic data.</p>

          <p>Consumer prices increased by 2.3% in April compared to the previous year, slightly cooling down and defying initial concerns about an inflation surge following President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. While economists initially worried about price hikes, government data indicates that significant price increases have not yet occurred. However, analysts anticipate a potential resurgence of inflation as retailers restock inventory with goods imported after the tariffs took effect. The Trump administration has since rolled back some tariffs, including temporarily reducing tariffs on China from 145% to 30%, which is expected to reduce the average cost of tariffs per household this year.</p>

          <p>A trade truce between the U.S. and China has provided some relief after President Trump's tariffs significantly impacted manufacturing in North America and Asia. The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index indicated a sharp decline in April purchasing activity following a rush to stockpile supplies. While the tariff pause offers a temporary respite, concerns remain about long-term risks associated with China. North American companies have been aggressively stockpiling inventory, while manufacturing activity in Asia has weakened.

The 2026 model year updates include a 25% increase in EV range, up to a 50% improvement in horsepower, and fast-charging capabilities.

The U.S. and China agreed to lower tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30% for 90 days, and low-value packages shipped to the U.S. from China will now be taxed at 54%, down from 120%. This tariff cut is expected to allow the companies to increase shipments from China and fulfill existing orders, and experts suggest that it will help them reassess their long-term strategies.
