        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia reported a significant 56% surge in revenue, reaching $46.7 billion for the second quarter, primarily driven by robust demand for its sophisticated AI chips from major tech firms like Meta and OpenAI. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the ongoing "AI race" and the company's crucial role in AI infrastructure, projecting further revenue growth. Despite this boom, Nvidia continues to navigate geopolitical challenges, including US-China trade tensions and export restrictions on its high-end chips. The company is actively lobbying the US government to approve sales of its next-generation Blackwell chips to China, a critical market, while China concurrently fosters domestic competition in the chip sector.

          <p>European markets are poised for a higher open as investors assess Nvidia's latest earnings report, which indicated continued strong sales growth in the artificial intelligence sector. While Nvidia's overall revenue surpassed expectations, a slight miss in data center revenue and concerns over future China sales led to a dip in after-hours trading. Beyond tech, French spirits giant Pernod Ricard reported a sales decline due to weak consumer sentiment in China and US tariff uncertainties. Additionally, new data revealed a 7.4% rise in EU car registrations for July, with Chinese EV maker BYD experiencing significant growth while Tesla's European registrations declined.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>News of Taylor Swift's engagement has sparked widespread emotional reactions among fans, prompting a discussion on "parasocial relationships"—one-sided connections where individuals feel intimacy with a celebrity who doesn't know them. Psychologists describe this as "my friend who doesn't know me," fueled by the increased availability of personal details through social media and reality shows. While these relationships can offer a sense of connection and community, experts caution that they cannot replace reciprocal, real-life friendships. Such bonds, though entertaining, lack the "nutritional content" of genuine human interaction.</p>

          <p>Argentine authorities are actively searching for an 18th-century Italian portrait, believed to be Nazi-looted art, after it was spotted in a real estate advertisement. The painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi, was part of Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker's extensive collection and was allegedly stolen by fugitive Nazi officer Friedrich Kadgien. Police raided a villa linked to Kadgien's descendants, finding German documents but not the artwork itself. This discovery reignites efforts to recover art plundered during World War II, shedding light on Argentina's history as a refuge for fleeing Nazis and their ill-gotten gains.</p>

          <p>Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev has received a substantial fine of almost £31,500 ($42,500) for his unsportsmanlike behavior during a first-round exit. Medvedev's meltdown, which included obliterating a racket, was reportedly sparked by a photographer entering the court during his match against Benjamin Bonzi. The penalty, imposed by the United States Tennis Association, means the Russian player will forfeit approximately 40% of his first-round prize money. Medvedev acknowledged he was prepared for a hefty punishment, choosing not to elaborate further on the incident.</p>

          <p>The 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's death is being commemorated with a train ride from Chicago to Mississippi, retracing his fateful 1955 journey. Organized by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, the event includes Till's cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., the last surviving eyewitness to his kidnapping. Till, a 14-year-old boy, was brutally lynched after allegedly whistling at a white woman, and his mother's decision for an open-casket funeral is credited with igniting the modern Civil Rights Movement. This solemn remembrance serves to highlight progress while acknowledging that America still has healing to do from such historical injustices.</p>

Official medical reports from the Physician to the President concluded Trump remains in 'excellent health,' with no signs of heart failure or renal impairment, firmly refuting the viral claims.</p>
