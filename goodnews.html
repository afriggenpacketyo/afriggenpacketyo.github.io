          <p>Lego reported a robust 12% increase in revenue for the first half of 2025, achieving a record $5.44 billion, propelled by its innovative botanical-themed brick collection and successful brand partnerships. Collaborations with Formula 1 and the popular children's series "Bluey" proved highly effective, with an upcoming multi-year deal with Pokémon expected to further boost sales. CEO Niels Christiansen highlighted the broad appeal of their diverse product range across all ages and interests, noting the botanical theme's popularity around holidays like Valentine's Day. The company also expanded its global presence by opening 24 new stores, reaching a total of 1,079 worldwide, reinforcing its market leadership in the toy industry against competitors like Mattel and Hasbro.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's shares surged over 8% after the company announced it would abandon its controversial new logo and reinstate the original design. This decision came amidst widespread criticism from social media users and a public statement from President Donald Trump urging the company to revert. The proposed redesign had removed the iconic "Uncle Herschel" character and "Old Country Store" phrase, drawing accusations of the brand going "woke" from conservatives. A YouGov poll indicated 76% of Americans preferred the old logo. The company thanked customers for their feedback, affirming its commitment to its core values and classic American branding, which led to further congratulations from Trump.</p>

          <p>The nonprofit "Robbie's Hope," founded by Kari Eckert after her 15-year-old son's suicide in 2018, is actively working to prevent teen suicide by fostering open conversations about mental health and providing creative outlets. The organization, driven by insights from Robbie's friends, emphasizes the importance of parents normalizing mental health discussions and being vulnerable with their children. With teen ambassadors in high schools across all 50 states, Robbie's Hope also hosts an annual art competition, with this year's winners featured in a Denver museum exhibit. This initiative aims to expand mental health dialogue and ensure young people, like singer-songwriter Sloane Simon, feel supported and at home.</p>

          <p>Morgan Lake made history at the Diamond League Final in Zurich, becoming the first British woman to clear two meters in the high jump. Her impressive 2.00m leap, achieved on her first attempt, secured her a third-place finish behind Olympic silver medallist Nicola Olyslagers and world champion Yaroslava Mahuchikh. The 28-year-old athlete, visibly emotional after surpassing her previous personal best of 1.99m, expressed immense happiness and a newfound belief in her capabilities. This landmark achievement comes just weeks before the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, inspiring belief that she can achieve a first global podium following her fourth-place finish in Budapest two years ago.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is set to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings, with analysts expecting adjusted earnings per share of $1.01 and revenue of $46.02 billion, representing 53% year-over-year growth. This explosive growth is largely attributed to insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) in the generative AI era, particularly from its data center business, which accounts for 88% of total sales. Key questions for CEO Jensen Huang include sales performance of the new Blackwell chips, where demand outstrips supply, and the state of the company's China business, which faces uncertainties due to US export controls and China's push for homegrown chips. Most analysts expect China to be excluded from guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An archaeologist group's pre-dawn excavations in the Negev desert revealed well-preserved remnants of Mamshit, an ancient Nabataean oasis city. The site, once a formidable trading hub known for its frankincense trade, features surprisingly intact baptismal pools—a smaller one for babies and a larger, cross-shaped one for adults—reflecting the Nabataeans' transition to Christianity around the 4th century A.D. Despite the punishing desert conditions, these structures endure, offering a poignant reminder of the constant change people and societies undergo.

Drey's win, by a significant 20-point swing from Trump's previous performance in the district, is seen as a rejection of the "Maga agenda," which Prosch had aligned with, promoting conspiracy theories and extreme views. She attributed her success to voters' frustration with the current state of affairs, including Iowa's economy and maternal healthcare. This marks the second state senate seat flipped by Democrats in Iowa this year, potentially signaling trouble for Republicans in upcoming midterm elections, as Democrats consistently overperform in such special elections.</p>
