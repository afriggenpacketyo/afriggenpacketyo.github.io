          <p>OnePay, the financial technology company majority-owned by Walmart, is launching its own branded wireless plan, marking a significant step in its ambition to become an all-encompassing "super app." The new service, OnePay Wireless, will offer unlimited 5G data, talk, and text on the AT&T network for a monthly fee. This move aligns with a broader trend of fintech firms embedding services like mobile connectivity to create a more integrated user experience, similar to international apps like WeChat. The partnership aims to lower customer acquisition costs, potentially offering consumers more affordable mobile plan options.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alphabet's stock value rose significantly after a U.S. District Judge ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in a major antitrust case. The court decided that Google will not be required to divest its Chrome browser or be barred from making payments to companies like Apple to be the default search engine on their devices. While finding that Google holds an illegal monopoly in internet search, the ruling avoids a structural breakup of the company, which investors viewed as a major victory. This outcome removes a significant overhang on the stock and is seen as preserving Google's core business model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Macy's surged after the department store chain reported second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street expectations and raised its sales and profit guidance for the full year. The company credited its positive performance to strong sales trends at revamped stores and resilience among consumers, particularly in categories like denim and women's apparel. CEO Tony Spring expressed cautious optimism, stating that while tariff impacts are a factor, the company is well-positioned to manage headwinds and gain market share. The strong results suggest Macy's strategic initiatives are yielding positive results in a challenging retail environment. (not investment advice)</p>

Starting in February 2026, Topshop collections will be available in 32 John Lewis department stores, with its menswear counterpart, Topman, in six. The brand, which was acquired by online retailer Asos, is aiming for a major comeback by re-establishing a physical retail presence. This partnership is seen as a strategic move for both brands, allowing Topshop to reconnect with its customer base and helping John Lewis attract new, younger shoppers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An exploration of art history reveals how the depiction of children has evolved from religious icons and symbols of dynastic ambition to representations of individual identity. In the Middle Ages, Jesus was the primary child subject, while Renaissance and Baroque portraits often depicted aristocratic children as miniature adults to signal their future roles and secure marriage alliances. The concept of a modern, unburdened childhood emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, leading to more sentimental and playful portrayals. The article traces this artistic journey, showing how shifting societal views on childhood, family, and class have been reflected in art over the centuries.</p>

The government faces the challenge of balancing public finances, stimulating sluggish economic growth, and managing rising borrowing costs, all while adhering to its pledge not to raise key taxes on working people. The announcement initiates a 10-week process for the Office for Budget Responsibility to produce an independent economic forecast to accompany the chancellor's statement.</p>

          <p>Despite a challenging first half of the year, major property developers in China can expect a business pickup in the second half, according to an analysis by Morgan Stanley. The report predicts that the pace of decline in sales and profitability will slow, with a potential for sales to rebound in the fourth quarter, particularly in higher-tier cities. This optimistic outlook is based on developers' positive guidance for margin recovery and rental income growth, as well as the anticipated start of the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate cut cycle. The forecast suggests the worst of the multi-year slump may be receding. (not investment advice)</p>
