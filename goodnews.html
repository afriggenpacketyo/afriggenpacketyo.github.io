          <p>Shares of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group surged by 13%, hitting a record high after the company reported a fiscal first-quarter profit that significantly exceeded expectations. The company posted a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a sharp turnaround from the loss reported in the same period last year. This strong performance was largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, which benefited from the performance of portfolio companies like Grab and Swiggy. The positive results have boosted investor confidence, with several more of SoftBank's portfolio companies expected to go public soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued another nationwide injunction against President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens and temporary residents. This marks the fourth time a court has blocked the policy since a Supreme Court ruling in June limited the scope of such injunctions. The judge certified the lawsuit as a class action, a legal pathway left open by the high court, arguing the plaintiffs were 'extremely likely' to win on the merits that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The order, which directs agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents to these individuals, remains on hold.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano has reached a settlement with Disney and Lucasfilm in her lawsuit over being fired from the Star Wars series 'The Mandalorian'. Carano, who played Cara Dune, was dismissed in 2021 after making controversial social media posts, including one comparing the political climate for Republicans to the experience of Jews during the Holocaust. The lawsuit, which was financially backed by Elon Musk, alleged wrongful termination and discrimination. While the terms of the settlement are confidential, Carano expressed hope for healing, and a Lucasfilm statement described her as a respected and professional colleague.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance's office has stated it was unaware of a Secret Service request to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to raise the water level of Ohio's Little Miami River for a family boating trip. The Secret Service confirmed it made the request to ensure 'safe navigation' for its security detail after a boat allegedly ran aground during a scouting mission. The agency emphasized that such protective measures are often planned independently without the Vice President's involvement. The incident drew some public criticism and comparisons to a similar situation involving former Vice President Al Gore in 1999.</p>

          <p>The Southern Small White butterfly, a species typically found in Southern Europe, has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, with its identification confirmed by experts. This sighting is part of a broader trend that has seen the species rapidly expand its range northward through Europe over the past two decades, moving at a rate of about 100 kilometers per year. While a warming climate is believed to be a contributing factor, its expansion has been much faster than scientific models predicted.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is auctioning off the Amadea, a 348-foot superyacht valued at over $300 million, which was seized from a sanctioned Russian oligarch. The vessel, which features a helideck, a mosaic pool, a glass elevator, and a marble fireplace, was taken in Fiji in 2022 as part of efforts to pressure allies of Vladimir Putin. The U.S. Marshals Service is managing the sealed-bid auction, with a required deposit of $10 million to participate. The Justice Department maintains the yacht was owned by oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, though another non-sanctioned Russian businessman has claimed ownership.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps and embracing in-person singles events as a way to find partners. Organizers of events like 'Date Cincy' in Cincinnati report rising popularity, as people seek more authentic, face-to-face connections without the potential for misrepresentation common in online profiles. This trend aligns with market data showing a decline in the value of dating apps like Bumble and a significant increase in attendance at singles events. For many, the chance to gauge real-life chemistry is proving more appealing than swiping through digital profiles.</p>
