          <p>Shares of USA Rare Earth saw a significant jump after CEO Barbara Humpton confirmed the company is in "close communication" with the White House. This follows the Trump administration's recent equity stakes in other rare earth miners, including Lithium Americas and MP Materials, aimed at bolstering the domestic supply chain and reducing dependence on China. Humpton expressed support for these investments, stating that the rare earth sector will require many players. The company is developing a mine in Texas and a magnet facility in Oklahoma, keeping the administration informed of its plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Delta Air Lines planes, operated by subsidiary Endeavor Air, experienced a low-speed collision on a LaGuardia Airport taxiway in New York. Endeavor Air Flight 5047, arriving from Charlotte, struck the wing of Flight 5155, which was preparing to depart for Roanoke. One flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was hospitalized, but airport operations were not impacted. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, recovering flight recorders for analysis. Passengers were safely deplaned and offered new flights and hotel accommodations, as Delta apologized for the disruption.</p>

The Tigers will now face the AL West champion Seattle Mariners in the Division Series, with Game 1 scheduled for Saturday. This victory comes after the Guardians' impressive regular-season comeback, which ultimately fell short in the best-of-three series.</p>

          <p>An updated EAT-Lancet Commission report reiterates that a healthy diet for people and the planet involves increased consumption of nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, with significantly less meat, dairy, and sugar. This "planetary health diet" could prevent up to 15 million premature deaths annually and drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from food systems. The article notes the 2019 report faced a "coordinated campaign" of misinformation, often linked to the meat and dairy industry, which is expected to resurface.

          <p>California is rolling out a redesigned driver's license and identification card featuring new security measures, including a first-in-the-nation digital signature and the removal of the magnetic stripe. The updated design showcases California's redwoods, poppies, and coastline, replacing previous state imagery. While existing licenses remain valid until their expiration, the new cards incorporate "next-generation technology" to enhance anti-counterfeit protections. This marks the latest update since 2010, with the 2018 REAL ID implementation also bringing security upgrades for federal identification purposes.</p>

          <p>Luka Doncic is taking a measured approach to the Lakers' training camp after a demanding offseason playing with Slovenia's national team. The plan is to ease him back into play to prevent injuries, a priority emphasized by coach JJ Redick following the team's early playoff exit last season. Doncic, who has slimmed down, has impressed in camp with his creativity and court vision. While teammates are adapting to his style, the team is collectively embracing the rigorous physical and mental conditioning demanded by Redick to achieve championship shape.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a significant deal with Pfizer, where the pharmaceutical giant pledged to lower its drug costs in the United States to match prices in other developed countries. This agreement, a long-sought victory for Trump, includes launching new drugs at international parity and offering substantial discounts for Medicaid patients. Pfizer also agreed to participate in TrumpRx, a new website for discounted direct-to-consumer drug sales. The deal, which includes a three-year exemption from 100% tariffs on non-U.S. manufactured drugs, marks a shift in the pharmaceutical industry's stance against "America First" pricing, with Trump now pushing other major drugmakers for similar concessions.

          <p>The article explores the surprising and often contentious history of college rankings, tracing their evolution from informal lists in the 1930s to today's influential U.S. News & World Report. Early attempts, like Edwin Embree's 1934 list, faced intense backlash and even federal suppression, highlighting the sensitivity surrounding institutional prestige. However, as higher education became a mass-consumer good by the 1980s, rankings transformed into a vital tool for navigating the American meritocracy. The article details how institutions have adapted to, and sometimes gamed, these metrics, revealing how rankings have shaped public perception and admissions practices despite their initial controversial reception.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that focusing solely on China's economic stagnation overlooks a profound transformation driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs. Unlike their predecessors, this cohort, largely born after the famine era, is technically trained, innovation-driven, and adept at co-creation with government and other partners. Many hail from provinces known for strong business cultures and combine their experience of past scarcity with market and technological opportunities. This entrepreneurial dynamism is fostering competitiveness at scale and continuing to integrate China into global systems, suggesting a resilient and evolving economic landscape.

          <p>A team of divers from 1715 Fleet-Queens Jewels LLC has discovered over 1,000 silver and gold coins, estimated to be worth $1 million, off Florida's "treasure coast."

The recovery offers valuable historical insight, with dates and mint marks still visible on some pieces. This discovery is celebrated not only for its monetary value but also for the stories it tells, providing a tangible link to the Spanish empire's golden age.</p>

          <p>This article delves into Lucumí, also known as Santería, an Afro-Caribbean spirituality rooted in Yoruba cosmology, emphasizing its role as a practice of survival and healing for enslaved Africans in Cuba. Practitioners, like Francisco Álvarez León, find grounding and connection through offerings to orishas, deities representing nature's energies. Scholars are working to destigmatize Lucumí, which has historically been demonized and misunderstood, particularly within white and white-adjacent Latine communities. The article highlights how the religion, focused on character, balance, and community, adapted to resist colonial oppression and continues to offer protection and holistic health despite ongoing discrimination and sensationalized portrayals.</p>
