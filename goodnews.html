          <p>The renowned chaplain for the Loyola University Ramblers men's basketball team, Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, has retired from her duties at the age of 106. Her retirement, prompted by health concerns, marks the end of an era for the university where she became an international celebrity during the team's 2018 Final Four run. Sister Jean began her tenure at Loyola in 1991 after its merger with Mundelein College, later serving as a crucial academic advisor and spiritual guide for student-athletes. In a final message, she encouraged students to pursue their dreams and become future leaders, leaving behind a celebrated legacy of dedication and inspiration.</p>

          <p>Betty Reid Soskin, the oldest park ranger in U.S. history, celebrated her 104th birthday at a Bay Area middle school named in her honor. Soskin gained national recognition in her 80s as a ranger at the Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park, where she shared stories of African Americans during World War II, particularly the Port Chicago explosion. An activist who stood against Jim Crow laws in the East Bay, she has become a symbol of civic engagement and community impact. The celebration highlighted her enduring legacy as an inspiration for future generations, with her story now adorning the walls of the school.</p>

          <p>The first family, consisting of three people, has arrived in the United Kingdom under the new "one in, one out" migrant agreement with France. This pilot scheme allows the UK to return a migrant who crossed the Channel illegally for every refugee with a valid protection case that it accepts from France. So far, four migrants who arrived by small boat have been removed from the UK under this program. The government hopes the policy will deter people-smuggling gangs, though it has faced criticism from political opponents who question its effectiveness and from rights groups who advocate for more safe and legal routes for asylum seekers.</p>

For over two decades, the organization has been dedicated to helping women in similar situations regain stability and independence.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor Company is aiming to increase sales of its F-150 pickup truck by offering special financing to consumers with subprime credit scores, typically below 620. The promotion provides these buyers with lower interest rates usually reserved for those with higher credit ratings, a move intended to boost affordability and reduce inventory. While such programs can expand market reach, they also carry risks, as subprime borrowers are more likely to default on loans, particularly during economic downturns. Ford Credit stated it only finances customers it deems creditworthy and has used similar national programs in the past to meet market demands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shanaz Hemmati, co-founder of the $1.7 billion startup ZenBusiness, advises entrepreneurs that the most crucial first step is to validate their business idea by talking to potential customers. Before launching their AI-powered software for small businesses, she and her co-founder spent nearly a year interviewing dozens of entrepreneurs to understand their primary challenges. This research led them to pivot from targeting existing businesses to focusing on first-time owners who needed help navigating complex legal processes. Hemmati emphasizes that this early feedback was invaluable, providing the insight and confidence needed to build a successful product that directly addressed a market need.</p>

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a proposal to remove the $25,000 minimum equity rule for individuals classified as pattern day traders. This long-standing rule, established during the dot-com bubble, required traders making four or more day trades in five days to maintain a significant account balance. The new amendment, which awaits SEC approval, would instead apply existing maintenance margin rules to intraday trading, making active trading more accessible to retail investors with smaller accounts. This change reflects the evolution of trading technology and could potentially increase activity in options and for brokerage firms like Robinhood. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent 25-basis-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve, average 30-year mortgage rates have fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%. For a $250,000 mortgage, this new rate translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $1,520, which is about $150 less per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of the year. This reduction in borrowing costs has spurred an increase in mortgage applications from both new homebuyers and existing homeowners looking to refinance. Over the full 30-year term, the lower rate could save a borrower around $54,000 in total interest charges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce has voiced his strong dislike for the NFL's expanded jersey number rules, which allow more position groups to wear single-digit and other non-traditional numbers. Speaking on his "New Heights" podcast, Kelce expressed frustration that the numbers no longer signify a player's position, particularly for defensive linemen and linebackers. He argued that the old system, where a player's number immediately identified their role on the field, held an iconic value that has now been lost. Kelce specifically lamented seeing defensive ends wearing numbers like 1 or 11, stating that players on the line of scrimmage should wear "big" numbers.</p>

          <p>A pediatric neurologist is studying the off-label use of leucovorin, a drug derived from folic acid, as a potential treatment for speech delays in some children with autism. The theory suggests that some autistic children have a blockage preventing folate from reaching the brain, and leucovorin can bypass this issue. One family reported their nonverbal son began speaking just days after starting the treatment. While several small-scale studies have shown positive effects on speech, researchers emphasize that more extensive, FDA-level clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy, determine correct dosages, and identify which children would benefit most from the inexpensive, generic drug.</p>

The issue appears to affect all models, including the Pro and Pro Max, and is attributed to the anodized aluminum frame. When the top colored layer is damaged, it exposes the silver aluminum underneath, making scratches very noticeable. Additionally, a prominent tech reviewer pointed out that the camera bump on the Pro models has a sharp edge, making it prone to chipping. Experts suggest the damage is permanent, recommending a protective case as the only solution.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit against The Hershey Company that claimed its Halloween-themed Reese's candies were deceptively packaged. The plaintiffs argued that the wrappers depicted artistic details, such as carved faces on pumpkins and ghosts, which were absent on the actual chocolate products. However, U.S. District Judge Melissa Damian ruled that the consumers failed to demonstrate they suffered economic harm. She noted that while the appearance may have been disappointing, the candies were not worthless and still provided the value of being edible chocolate, and the complaint was based on subjective expectations rather than a concrete injury.</p>

          <p>Sales of new single-family homes in the U.S. rose by 20.5% in August, reaching the fastest pace since early 2022. This unexpected surge is largely attributed to homebuilders offering significant price discounts and other incentives to attract buyers who have been sidelined by affordability issues. Easing mortgage rates, in anticipation of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, also contributed to the increase in activity. While this signals a potential thaw in the housing market, analysts caution that the data is often volatile and new homes represent only a small fraction of total sales, with the broader market still constrained by high prices and borrowing costs.
