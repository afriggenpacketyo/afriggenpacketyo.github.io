          <p>FedEx announced fiscal first-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to rise over 5% in after-hours trading. The company reported adjusted earnings of $3.83 per share on revenue of $22.24 billion, beating analyst forecasts. CEO Raj Subramaniam highlighted the company's resilience amid global trade volatility, noting improvements from higher domestic package volumes. The company is also navigating headwinds from the elimination of the "de minimis" tax exception for small shipments and is proceeding with its plan to spin off FedEx Freight.

          <p>The helicopter carrying President Donald Trump, known as Marine One, was forced to make an unscheduled landing at Luton Airport due to a minor hydraulic issue during his state visit to the UK. The White House confirmed the diversion was made out of an abundance of caution, and the president and first lady were safely transferred to a support helicopter to continue their journey to Stansted Airport. The incident occurred as Trump concluded a multi-day visit that included meetings with King Charles and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. Emergency services were present at Luton, but the situation was resolved without further incident.</p>

          <p>In an interview at The Atlantic Festival, former Vice President Mike Pence addressed the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, stating that while private employers have the right to make such decisions, he would have preferred the FCC chairman not intervene. Pence expressed concern over a rising tide of political violence but maintained his belief that former President Donald Trump has not fundamentally changed the Republican Party, which he expects will return to its traditional conservative roots. He also reflected on his duty during the January 6th Capitol riot, his subsequent strained relationship with Trump, and the importance of civility in public discourse.</p>

          <p>The UK's foreign intelligence service, MI6, has launched a secure portal on the dark web to recruit new agents, with a particular focus on individuals in Russia. The platform, named Silent Courier, is designed to allow potential informants to contact the agency securely with sensitive information related to national security threats like terrorism or hostile state activities. This initiative aims to bolster the UK's intelligence capabilities by leveraging modern technology to reach sources who might otherwise be inaccessible. The move follows a similar strategy employed by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to target potential Russian assets.</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced a landmark $5 billion investment in Intel, forming a collaboration to co-develop custom chips for AI data centers and personal computers. The partnership aims to fuse Nvidia's leading AI and accelerated computing technology with Intel's extensive CPU and x86 ecosystem.

Following the announcement, Intel's shares surged nearly 23%, marking its best single-day performance since 1987, while Nvidia's stock also saw gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The popular Pfeiffer Falls Trail in California's Big Sur region has reopened after being closed for repairs since a 2023 storm caused a redwood tree to destroy its pedestrian bridge. This reopening marks the latest chapter in the trail's troubled history, which includes a devastating wildfire in 2008 that led to a 13-year, $2 million renovation. The short, scenic hike is a major attraction in Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, drawing thousands of visitors annually to its 60-foot waterfall. Repair crews have now replaced the damaged bridge section with a stronger, fiber-reinforced polymer to better withstand the region's notoriously fragile environment.</p>
