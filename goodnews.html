          <p>Comedian and actor Marc Maron has announced he will end his influential podcast 'WTF' this fall after a 16-year run. Maron explained the decision stemmed from concerns about burnout and maintaining the quality of the show, preferring to conclude with a strong body of work. In an interview, he reflected on the profound personal impact of the podcast's deep conversations and the challenge of finding similar connections in his personal life. Maron also discussed his new HBO special, 'Panicked,' and the ongoing process of grieving the loss of his partner, Lynn Shelton, in 2020.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A German court has convicted three men for the 2022 theft of 483 ancient Celtic gold coins from a museum in Manching, Bavaria. The defendants received prison sentences of up to 11 years for the heist, which was executed in just nine minutes after the thieves disabled local communication networks. The stolen treasure, dating to around 100 B.C., was considered the largest trove of Celtic gold discovered in the 20th century. Most of the coins remain missing, and authorities fear they have been melted down, as lumps of gold were found on one of the suspects upon arrest.</p>

          <h2>Salvador Dali Painting, Originally Bought for £150, Could Fetch £30,000 at Auction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 12:17:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A painting by Surrealist artist Salvador Dali, which was purchased at a house clearance sale in Cambridge for only £150, is now expected to sell for up to £30,000. The artwork, titled 'Vecchio Sultano,' was authenticated as an original illustration from a series based on 'The Arabian Nights' that Dali was commissioned to create in the 1960s. The art dealer who bought the piece discovered it had been previously attributed to Dali at a Sotheby's sale in the 1990s but had since lost its attribution. The rediscovery is considered significant for Dali scholars, and the piece will be offered by Cheffins auctioneers in October.</p>

          <p>During a visit to his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland, President Donald Trump hosted UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer for wide-ranging discussions and announced a major trade deal with the European Union. The deal involves the EU purchasing billions in American energy and military equipment in exchange for a 15% tariff on European goods, down from a threatened 30%. In talks with Starmer, Trump agreed to work with the UK to establish food centers in Gaza and signaled a shorter deadline for a ceasefire in Ukraine. The visit combined political diplomacy with promotion of his commercial interests.</p>

          <p>Following two days of high-level trade negotiations in Stockholm, China and the United States have agreed to extend the current pause on tariff increases. While no major breakthroughs were announced, the agreement continues the suspension of a 24% reciprocal tariff from the U.S. and corresponding countermeasures from China. Li Chenggang, China’s Vice-Minister of Commerce, stated that both nations were satisfied with the implementation of previous agreements and had engaged in comprehensive and candid discussions. This marks a continued effort by the world's two largest economies to manage trade tensions and maintain dialogue on economic issues.</p>

          <p>Boeing has shown significant signs of recovery, reporting sharply reduced quarterly losses and a 35% jump in revenue to $22.75 billion. The aerospace giant delivered 150 airplanes in the second quarter, its highest number since 2018, indicating improved production stability under CEO Kelly Ortberg, who called 2025 the company's "turnaround year." The company's adjusted loss per share was better than analysts expected, and it significantly reduced its cash burn. While challenges remain, including delays in certifying new 737 MAX models, the results suggest Boeing is making progress after years of crises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Union Pacific has proposed an $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, a deal that would create the first single-entity transcontinental railroad in the United States. The merger would connect Union Pacific's extensive network in the western U.S. with Norfolk Southern's tracks across 22 eastern states. Proponents argue it would streamline deliveries and reduce delays, but the deal faces intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators, who have set a high bar for railroad consolidation after previous mergers led to significant service disruptions. The move could pressure the remaining major railroads, BNSF and CSX, to pursue their own merger. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eloghosa Osunde's second novel, 'Necessary Fiction,' is praised in this review for its poignant exploration of kinship and community among a group of queer Nigerians. The story centers on characters who, feeling alienated from their biological families, forge new, chosen families to survive and thrive in a society that often shuns them. The reviewer highlights a key scene, the "truth circle," where characters affirm their bonds through vulnerable conversation. By focusing on connection as an act of sustained intention rather than inherited obligation, the novel offers a compelling vision for building meaningful relationships in an increasingly atomized world.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, attributing the improvement partly to a softening of some U.S. tariffs on imported goods. The organization now projects 3.0% growth in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, an increase from its April predictions, also noting a surge in U.S. imports as firms moved to preempt new taxes. Despite the improved outlook, the IMF warns that higher tariffs and ongoing uncertainty could still dampen economic activity and that global inflation will likely remain above target in the United States.

According to sources familiar with the matter, JPMorgan has emerged as the leading contender after other potential issuers like American Express and Barclays stepped aside. For Goldman Sachs, offloading the business would mark an exit from a challenging consumer venture that faced high growth costs and regulatory scrutiny. For Apple, partnering with JPMorgan, the largest U.S. credit card issuer, would bring stability to its financial product after a tumultuous period under Goldman's management.</p>

To combat fire risks from drought, the railway is also testing new vegetation management techniques and using AI to monitor potentially dangerous trees.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has maintained that with a solid labor market and the potential for new tariffs to reignite inflation, no immediate cuts are necessary.
