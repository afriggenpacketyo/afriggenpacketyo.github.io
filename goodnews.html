        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the cost of popular all-inclusive holidays rises, travelers are employing creative strategies to reduce expenses on their summer getaways. Methods include booking trips at the very last minute, traveling during off-peak seasons, and searching for deals that offer free places for children. Other cost-saving hacks shared by vacationers involve using home-swapping websites to eliminate accommodation costs, accumulating credit card loyalty points for flights, and opting for house-sitting arrangements to explore new destinations affordably. These approaches demonstrate a growing trend towards more flexible and resourceful travel planning.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Caltech are transforming jellyfish into 'biohybrid' cyborgs by embedding them with microelectric controllers to help explore the ocean's depths. The technology allows scientists to remotely control the jellyfish's movements, directing them to collect environmental data on temperature and pressure in specific locations. Because jellyfish lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, the process is considered humane, and the low-cost, scalable nature of the project could make sophisticated ocean research more accessible. The team is now working on improving the device's durability for deep-sea conditions and enabling horizontal steering.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several high-profile companies, including Microsoft, Costco, and Netflix, are being watched as potential candidates for stock splits in 2026 due to their high share prices. While fractional shares have made splits less critical for accessibility, they remain relevant for managing price-weighted indexes like the Dow Jones and for employee stock compensation plans. Companies with stock prices approaching or exceeding $1,000 are often considered for splits to make shares more psychologically appealing and manageable for retail investors and employees.

          <p>Six years after his triumphant victory, Irish golfer Shane Lowry is returning to Royal Portrush for the 2025 Open Championship. His 2019 win was a historic moment, as he became the first Irish champion on the island of Ireland in 68 years, finishing six strokes clear of the field. Lowry reflects on the incredible experience, particularly the energy of the crowd on the final day, and acknowledges the increased expectations he will face this time as a returning champion. Now a more experienced player, he hopes to channel the positive memories of his past success into another strong performance.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before crashing into the Sahara desert, where it was found in Niger in 2023. Scientific analysis confirmed its origin by comparing its distinct chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking Mars probe. This rare specimen is about 70% larger than the next-largest Martian meteorite found on our planet.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has initiated a disarmament process, declaring an end to its four-decade armed conflict with Turkey in a move that could reshape regional stability. The first step saw 30 PKK fighters ceremonially destroy their weapons in Iraqi Kurdistan, following a call for peace from imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan. The success of the process now hinges on concessions from the Turkish government, with PKK demands including Ocalan's release and amnesty for fighters. While Ankara remains cautious, a parliamentary commission is expected to be formed to address a political solution.</p>

          <p>Forty years after its historic broadcast, the Live Aid concert is remembered as a monumental moment of global unity and a fundraising powerhouse for famine relief in Ethiopia. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the event set a new standard for benefit concerts and brought a humanitarian crisis to the forefront of the global political agenda. However, the legacy is also viewed critically through a modern lens for its lack of diversity, featuring almost no African or female performers. While lauded for its impact, Live Aid is also seen as a symbol of a 'white savior' approach to aid that has faced increasing scrutiny over the years.</p>

          <p>A campaign is calling for cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English rather than the standard Latin-based scientific names to better protect people with severe allergies. Proponents, including a Member of Parliament with a nut allergy, argue that the current system, known as INCI, is inaccessible to most consumers who cannot recognize allergens like 'Arachis Hypogaea' as peanut oil. While the industry defends the Latin system for providing a universal global standard, families affected by allergic reactions say clear, plain-language labeling, similar to food packaging, is essential to prevent potentially life-threatening situations.</p>
