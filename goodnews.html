          <h2>US and China to Hold Trade Talks to De-escalate Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US and Chinese officials are scheduled to meet in Switzerland from May 9-12 to discuss de-escalating the ongoing trade war. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will represent China, while US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent the United States. Experts anticipate that these negotiations will be protracted, potentially lasting several months, and will primarily focus on de-escalation rather than reaching a comprehensive trade agreement. Financial markets reacted positively to the news, with gains in mainland China, Hong Kong, and US stock futures. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill is set to be introduced in Parliament that would allow judges to impose an additional two years of imprisonment on criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings in England and Wales. This legislation aims to prevent offenders from avoiding the consequences of their actions and to provide a sense of justice for victims' families. The families of Sabina Nessa, Zara Aleena, and Jan Mustafa, whose killers did not attend sentencing, have actively campaigned for this change. The bill has received support from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Justice Minister Alex Davies-Jones.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents of the Tahitian Terrace mobile home park in Pacific Palisades, which was largely destroyed in a January fire, are now eligible for federally funded debris removal. This decision reverses an initial exclusion and brings residents "one step closer to returning home," according to Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) cited the unique characteristics of the property and the presence of friable asbestos as justification for the inclusion. The cleanup will be conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, offering hope to residents facing uncertainty about the community's future.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 5-4 extra-innings loss to the Miami Marlins, highlighting the strain on their overworked bullpen. Despite solid performances from Tony Gonsolin and Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' bullpen faltered in the later innings, with journeyman reliever JP Feyereisen giving up the walk-off single. Manager Dave Roberts was forced to use less-than-ideal pitching options due to workload concerns, ultimately contributing to the defeat.</p>

          <p>A Canadian retailer is cutting out US middlemen and forging direct ties with Chinese suppliers due to deepening trade tensions and supply chain disruptions. The CEO of the company is searching for suppliers at Yiwu's small-commodities market, the world's largest wholesale hub, located in eastern China. The shift is adding weeks of legwork and logistical hurdles but may also be steering him toward a more sustainable and cost-efficient supply chain. The move reflects a broader trend of businesses seeking alternative sourcing strategies amid the ongoing trade war.</p>
