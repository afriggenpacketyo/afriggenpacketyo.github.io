          <p>The US and China have reported substantial progress in recent trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential de-escalation of trade tensions. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as productive, while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted the in-depth and candid nature of the talks. These meetings mark the first formal negotiations since significant tariffs were imposed earlier in the year, causing market turmoil and recession fears. While details are forthcoming, experts anticipate possible tariff cuts, although disagreements persist regarding the extent of these reductions.

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court has discovered documentation associated with the Nazi regime among its archives, including propaganda material intended to spread Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina during World War II. The discovery was made while preparing for the creation of a museum with historical documents.

The president of the Supreme Court has ordered a thorough analysis and preservation of the material.

The affected products were distributed in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington, and sold in various locations, including hospitals and airports. While no illnesses have been directly linked to the recalled food, the company is taking precautionary measures to ensure consumer safety.</p>
