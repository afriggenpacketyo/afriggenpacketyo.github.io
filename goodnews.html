          <p>Economists anticipate a slowdown in hiring for May, with predictions of around 125,000 new jobs, a decrease from April's 177,000. The report will be a balancing act between concerns of a slowing labor market and rising inflation, with the potential to influence Federal Reserve policy. Data this week from ADP showed that private payrolls essentially were flat last month, growing by just 37,000 in May, a two-year low, and jobless claims have also been edging higher. Markets will also be watching trade developments as President Trump continues negotiations on tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
