          <p>Williams Formula 1 driver Alex Albon reflects on his strong performance this season, particularly in comparison to his highly-rated teammate, Carlos Sainz. Albon attributes his success to feeling more comfortable with the car, drawing a parallel to how athletes in other sports perform better with equipment that suits them. He discusses the mental aspect of racing, his partnership with professional golfer Muni He, and their shared approach to sports psychology. Albon remains realistic about Williams' ambitions, targeting consistent front-end contention by the 2028 season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, India has taken firm control over England, largely thanks to a monumental innings from captain Shubman Gill, who scored 269 runs. His performance, the highest by an Indian batter in England, propelled his team to a massive total of 587. In response, England's top-order batsmen struggled, collapsing to 77-3 by the close of day two. With a significant lead and England already three wickets down, India is in a commanding position to level the series.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at record highs in a holiday-shortened trading week, continuing a strong start to the year's second half. Tech stocks, led by Nvidia surpassing a $3.9 trillion market cap, were a primary driver of the gains. A stronger-than-expected June jobs report indicated economic resilience, though it may temper expectations for immediate Federal Reserve rate cuts. The market's positive performance also reflects optimism about a major legislative spending and tax cut bill advancing through Congress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Commerce has lifted its export controls on chip-design software for China, a move announced by major industry players Siemens, Synopsys, and Cadence.

The reversal comes after restrictions were imposed in May, tightening controls on technology vital for designing advanced semiconductors. This policy change is seen as a significant step in a potential trade truce between the two economic superpowers, leading to a surge in the companies' stock prices. (not investment advice)</p>

This early access to Nvidia's most powerful processors gives CoreWeave, a smaller competitor to giants like Amazon and Microsoft, a key market differentiator.

          <p>The UK government has outlined a 10-year reform plan for the NHS in England, emphasizing a shift from hospital-centric care to community-based services. The strategy includes establishing up to 300 new neighborhood health hubs, expanding prevention efforts like an "obesity moonshot," and leveraging technology through the NHS app. Other proposals involve new alcohol warning labels and measures to improve access to dentistry. Critics have raised questions about funding, staffing for the new hubs, and the notable absence of a detailed plan for the struggling social care sector.</p>

The maximum purchase discounts available to tenants will also be significantly reduced.
