          <p>Andrew Cuomo conceded the New York City Democratic mayoral primary to Zohran Mamdani after initial results showed Mamdani leading with 44% of the vote. Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's successful campaign and his ability to inspire young voters. Despite the concession, the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count as no candidate reached the 50% threshold, and Cuomo indicated he might consider an independent run in the general election. Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, focused on a progressive platform including a rent freeze and fare-free buses, while Cuomo emphasized his experience and past confrontations with Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her case against the ABC, with a court ruling she was unfairly dismissed over a social media post about the war in Gaza. Lattouf shared a post from Human Rights Watch accusing Israel of war crimes, leading to her dismissal. The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, awarding her damages. The ABC has since apologized, acknowledging it let down its staff and audiences in its handling of the matter, raising questions over its independence and support for culturally diverse staff.</p>

Witkoff condemned the leaking of an initial intelligence assessment suggesting the U.S. strikes only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months, labeling it "treasonous." The U.S. Central Command and the Defense Intelligence Agency's initial assessment concluded that U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities did not completely destroy the country's nuclear program.</p>

Li emphasized that engaging in the international economy is a way of "reshaping the rules and order," calling on countries to keep to the "right" path.

          <p>California's governor and Democratic lawmakers reached a tentative agreement on a $321 billion budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal reflects resistance to the governor's proposed cuts, relying on borrowing, reserves, and shifting funds to address a $12 billion deficit. The budget includes a "poison pill" requiring passage of a bill to lessen environmental review requirements for building projects. Key elements include changes to Medi-Cal funding, shifting money from various programs, and addressing uncertainty related to potential federal policy changes.</p>

The park stated that the bears posed no threat to the public. An investigation is underway to determine how the animals escaped due to an operational error.</p>

          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports progress in electric car and heat pump adoption, but says more is needed to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The committee emphasizes the need to lower electricity bills to incentivize households to switch to cleaner technologies. While electric car sales are rising, heat pump installations remain below target. The CCC also suggests removing charges from electricity bills to support renewable energy projects to make electricity cheaper.</p>

          <p>A US district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. The judge granted a partial injunction to the states that filed suit against Trump‚Äôs Department of Transportation. In February, the Trump administration ordered states not to spend $5bn in funds allocated under the Biden administration as part of the national electric vehicle infrastructure (Nevi) program. During his campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump voiced a hatred for electric vehicles that ran counter to his growing friendship with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.</p>

Stewart also reflected on his previous Glastonbury performance in 2002, which he doesn't remember. He also discussed his nickname "Phyllis," coined by Elton John.</p>
