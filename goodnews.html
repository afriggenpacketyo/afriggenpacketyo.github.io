          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter of 2025, totaling 497,099 units. This sales surge is partially attributed to U.S. buyers rushing to purchase electric vehicles before a key federal tax credit expired at the end of September. Despite the quarterly rise, the company's production numbers saw a slight decline compared to the same period last year, and year-to-date deliveries are down approximately 6%. The results reflect a mixed performance for the automaker, which has faced sales slumps in Europe but saw a temporary boost from policy changes in the United States.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical division of Occidental Petroleum, in a cash deal valued at $9.7 billion. This acquisition represents Berkshire's largest since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash reserve of $344 billion. Occidental plans to use a significant portion of the proceeds, $6.5 billion, to reduce its corporate debt, a move its CEO believes will unlock shareholder value and allow for the resumption of stock buybacks. The deal deepens the existing financial relationship between the two companies and is expected to close in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>Shares of chipmaker Intel have experienced a significant rally, increasing by over 50% in the last month to pass the $37 mark. This surge has substantially increased the value of the U.S. government's 10% stake in the company to approximately $16 billion. The Trump administration had invested $8.9 billion in Intel in August, purchasing over 433 million shares. The stock's strong performance reflects positive momentum for the semiconductor company and has resulted in a substantial paper gain for the federal government's strategic investment in the domestic chip industry, a move celebrated by the administration.</p>

          <p>Obtaining a $10,000 personal loan has become a streamlined, digital process, but securing favorable terms requires careful preparation. Lenders are placing significant emphasis on credit scores, with higher scores potentially yielding interest rates several points lower. Prospective borrowers should check their credit reports for errors, pay down credit card balances, and compare offers from online lenders, traditional banks, and credit unions. Prequalifying with multiple lenders using soft credit checks can help identify the best rates without impacting one's credit score, which is crucial in a market where the average personal loan rate is above 12%.

While a tropical storm warning remains in effect, the worst conditions have passed, and the system is now moving farther out into the Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center has issued its final advisory for Imelda but notes it will remain a large system. Swells generated by Imelda, along with the remnants of Hurricane Humberto, are still expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac, the company behind the FICO credit score, announced a significant change to its business model that will allow it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders. This move, which could bypass credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, sent Fair Isaac's stock soaring over 20% while shares of the bureaus declined. The new plan aims to eliminate what the company calls unnecessary mark-ups on FICO scores, giving lenders more choice and potentially better pricing. The change is seen as a major disruption in the credit scoring industry, shifting power dynamics between the score creator and its distributors.</p>

          <p>In recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, CBS Miami entertainment reporter Lisa Petrillo has publicly shared her private 10-month battle with breast cancer. Her journey began in January when, just before a live report, she received a call confirming a tumor in her right breast. The discovery was made only after she insisted on an examination of a lump she found during a self-check, leading to an early Stage One diagnosis. Petrillo underwent a lumpectomy and radiation, continuing to work through most of her treatment. She now hopes her story will encourage others to be proactive about their health.</p>

Emana, who is now a nurse at the same Dallas hospital, was finally able to identify Perry from an old photograph.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a climate of economic uncertainty with rising inflation and potential interest rate cuts, a six-month certificate of deposit (CD) offers a stable option for savers. With current rates around 4.30%, these short-term accounts provide a guaranteed return without locking up funds for an extended period. For example, a $10,000 deposit could earn approximately $212 in interest over the six-month term, with the principal being FDIC-insured. This makes CDs an attractive alternative to high-yield savings accounts, which have variable rates that are likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve continues to lower its benchmark rate.

          <p>A free-floating "rogue planet," not tethered to any star, has been observed accreting gas and dust at the record-breaking rate of six billion tons per second. Located about 620 light-years away, the object, named Cha 1107-7626, is undergoing a massive growth spurt that blurs the lines between a planet and a star. Scientists were surprised to detect magnetic activity driving the accretion process, a phenomenon previously seen only in stars. This discovery challenges existing theories about planetary formation, suggesting that some massive, planet-like objects may form in a manner similar to stars, from contracting clouds of gas and dust.</p>

          <p>With the average interest rate for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) falling below 8%, homeowners can now borrow significant sums more affordably than in the recent past. A $70,000 HELOC with a 10-year repayment period would currently cost approximately $845 per month, down from about $875 per month last fall when rates were higher. Because HELOCs have variable rates, borrowers benefit automatically from declining market rates without needing to refinance. With the Federal Reserve expected to make further rate cuts, HELOCs are becoming an increasingly cost-effective option for accessing home equity. (not investment advice)</p>

The shift is a complex, multi-year process involving reformulating recipes to ensure color stability and consistent flavor without affecting the consumer experience.
