          <p>Cisco announced fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that slightly exceeded analyst predictions, with revenue growing 7.6% year-over-year to $14.67 billion. The company also issued an optimistic forecast for the upcoming fiscal year, projecting adjusted earnings and revenue in line with or slightly above consensus estimates. A significant highlight was the growth in AI infrastructure orders, which surpassed $2 billion for the fiscal year, more than doubling the company's initial goal. This performance indicates strong demand in networking and a strategic focus on the expanding artificial intelligence market. (not investment advice)</p>

It explores the 1867 sale of the Alaskan territory from Russia to the United States for $7.2 million. The piece notes that this historical transaction remains a point of contention for some in Russia, who still question the legitimacy of American sovereignty over the region. This background provides a unique perspective on the geopolitical setting of the high-stakes diplomatic summit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Authorities in Juneau, Alaska, report that newly installed temporary barriers have successfully prevented widespread damage from a record-setting glacial outburst flood. The Mendenhall River crested at a new record high after an ice dam at the Mendenhall Glacier released a massive surge of water. While some minor flooding occurred, the 10,000 'Hesco' barriers protected over 460 properties, a significant improvement over previous years which saw hundreds of homes inundated. Scientists attribute the increasing intensity of these annual floods to the effects of climate change on Alaska's rapidly melting glaciers.</p>

          <p>In a significant act of security cooperation, Mexico has transferred 26 high-ranking cartel figures to U.S. custody. The extradited individuals include leaders from groups like Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and the Sinaloa Cartel, who are wanted for charges including drug smuggling and murder. This move comes amid increased pressure from the Trump administration for Mexico to crack down on cartels and fentanyl production. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the men will face severe consequences, while Mexican officials emphasized the transfers are a strategic measure to dismantle criminal networks.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams have seen their franchise valuation soar to $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable team in the NFL, behind only the Dallas Cowboys. This marks a dramatic turnaround from a decade ago when the team, then in St. Louis, was valued at just $930 million. The increase is largely attributed to the team's relocation to Los Angeles and the development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. The valuation reflects the monetization of the venue and the team's strong fan base and recent competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire real estate investor Grant Cardone has offered blunt advice to young people, stating that they should not prioritize investing in Bitcoin.

Cardone emphasized that this reliable income stream should be the primary focus, and only after it is secured should one consider converting excess cash into assets like Bitcoin. He stressed the importance of having a dependable financial foundation before speculating on volatile investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining approximately 2% in a single session, bucking the trend of declining megacap technology stocks. This market rotation is being driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates as early as September. Lower interest rates are expected to particularly benefit smaller companies, which often rely on borrowed capital for their operations and expansion. Despite the recent gains, the small-cap index has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 since late 2022. (not investment advice)</p>
