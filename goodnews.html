          <p>A growing number of couples are incorporating their pet dogs into their wedding ceremonies, treating them as integral family members. Dogs are taking on roles such as ring bearers, flower girls, and greeters, reflecting a cultural shift where pets are seen as providing significant emotional support. This rising demand has led to the expansion of specialized dog chaperone services, which handle everything from canine temperament consultations to dressing the dogs in tuxedos and floral arrangements for the big day. The trend is so popular that even guide dogs are participating, with one bride having her guide dog, Tudor, walk her down the aisle, highlighting the deep bond between humans and their canine companions.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's social media company, X, has reached a settlement in principle with former employees who filed a $500 million lawsuit over unpaid severance. The lawsuit was initiated after Musk's 2022 takeover of the platform, then known as Twitter, led to the termination of approximately 6,000 employees. The former workers alleged they were denied the full severance benefits promised under the company's original plan, with some receiving only one month's pay or nothing at all. While details of the agreement have not been made public, both parties have requested a postponement of an upcoming court hearing to finalize the terms, which will require judicial approval to be finalized.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old from Northern California, Julian Her, is awaiting official confirmation for a potential new junior world record after catching a massive 63.7-pound white sea bass. The catch occurred during a family fishing trip in Tomales Bay and significantly outweighs the current junior record of 59 pounds, set in 2002. The young angler, who himself weighs only about 15 pounds more than the fish, fought the bass in a memorable struggle that his family initially mistook for a much smaller bat ray. The family is now working with the International Game Fish Association to certify the catch, which requires documenting the weight on certified scales and submitting the tackle used for verification.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver a highly anticipated speech at the central bank's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, amidst significant political pressure and market uncertainty. Financial markets are expecting Powell to provide signals regarding a potential interest rate cut in September, continuing a trend where his Jackson Hole addresses have foreshadowed major policy shifts. The speech will also cover the Fed's long-term policy framework, with speculation that the bank may roll back its 2020 "flexible average inflation targeting" policy in favor of a more preemptive stance against rising inflation. Powell's remarks are being closely watched for their impact on the economy and how he navigates criticism from the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Miami has ordered the closure of the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility within 60 days, delivering a significant blow to the Trump administration's immigration policies. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ruled that the hastily constructed tent camp causes severe and irreparable harm to the fragile ecosystem of the Florida Everglades. The injunction prohibits any new detainees from being brought to the site and mandates the removal of all construction materials and fencing after the 60-day period. The decision represents a major victory for the environmental groups and a Native American tribe that sued the government, arguing the facility violated environmental protection laws.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has announced the successful removal of a large-scale illegal marijuana farm from a remote area of Sequoia National Park. The operation involved eradicating nearly 2,400 marijuana plants and clearing about 2,000 pounds of trash from the 13-acre site, which had caused significant environmental damage. Authorities discovered the farm was using hazardous chemicals, including methamidophos, an insecticide banned in the U.S. that is highly toxic to wildlife and humans. The growers had terraced hillsides, diverted a creek for irrigation, and established campsites, degrading the federally protected wilderness and posing a risk to the region's water supply and delicate ecosystem.</p>

MSRA's Beijing lab, established as Microsoft's largest research facility outside the U.S., has been a pioneering force in AI, voice, and facial recognition technologies. The departure underscores the intense competition for top AI talent in China as universities and domestic companies strive to advance their own research capabilities in the critical technology sector.</p>

          <p>Meta has entered into a six-year agreement to spend more than $10 billion on Google's cloud services, a significant deal focused primarily on artificial intelligence infrastructure. This move highlights Meta's massive investment in AI as it develops its Llama family of models and integrates AI features across its platforms. The contract is a major win for Google Cloud as it competes with larger rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for major enterprise clients. Despite being long-time competitors in the online advertising market, Meta is diversifying its infrastructure sources, which already include its own data centers as well as services from Amazon and Microsoft, to support its extensive AI ambitions.</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt content and to cease promoting snack products for infants under one year old. The guidance also aims to restrict marketing claims that suggest health benefits without scientific backing, a practice that critics say misleads parents. This move follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply with the new recommendations, after which the government may consider alternative measures if the industry fails to make sufficient changes to improve the healthiness of their products.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., has expressed puzzlement over the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite what he described as an exceptionally strong quarterly performance. Walmart raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, yet its stock was the biggest loser on the Dow for the day. Simon highlighted the retailer's success in growing its top line, expanding margins, and absorbing tariffs, calling it "about as good of a quarter as any retailer could have." He speculated that investors may have overreacted to a minor earnings miss caused by one-time expenses, while overlooking the company's strong underlying business fundamentals and its ability to attract and retain shoppers.

          <p>In an effort to reverse six consecutive years of declining sales, Jeep's parent company Stellantis has unveiled a redesigned 2026 Jeep Cherokee. The new model, which was discontinued in 2023, marks the debut of Stellantis's first hybrid powertrain in North America, featuring a 1.6-liter turbo-four engine. The revamped midsize SUV is designed to be longer, taller, and wider than its predecessor, with 30% more cargo capacity and a technology-rich interior. The reintroduction of the iconic Cherokee nameplate is a key part of CEO Antonio Filosa's strategy to recover Jeep's market share and reinvigorate the brand amid broader company challenges, including the impact of U.S. tariffs.</p>
