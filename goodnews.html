          <p>Stock trading platform eToro's shares experienced a significant surge of 30% during its Nasdaq debut after a successful initial public offering that raised almost $310 million. The company, based in Israel, priced its shares above the expected range, indicating strong investor interest. This IPO is being closely watched as a potential indicator of renewed enthusiasm for IPOs after a period of market hesitancy, and eToro's financial performance has been strong, with net income increasing thirteenfold in the past year. The company has also seen substantial growth in its cryptocurrency business, although crypto assets are expected to account for a slightly smaller portion of its trading commission in the upcoming quarter.

          <p>Esa-Pekka Salonen's recent appearances as conductor laureate with the Los Angeles Philharmonic have sparked speculation about a potential return to the orchestra, especially after his departure from the San Francisco Symphony. Salonen's performances, including a tribute to Pierre Boulez, have been met with enthusiasm from audiences and musicians. With Gustavo Dudamel leaving the L.A. Phil at the end of next season, the orchestra may be without a music director for a couple of years, and Salonen's return could provide guidance during the transition. While Salonen has expressed a desire for a break from institutional demands, his history with the L.A. Phil and the unique venue of Disney Hall make a return a possibility.</p>

          <p>A new study by Australian podiatrists examines the correlation between Barbie's foot posture and her social standing, revealing that the doll's feet have evolved over time from arched to flat, reflecting changing social roles. The researchers analyzed 2,750 dolls produced from 1959 to 2024, finding that employed dolls are more likely to have flat feet, while fashion-focused dolls are more likely to have arched feet. Mattel confirmed that foot design was a deliberate part of Barbie's evolution, with reimagined footwear options supporting Barbie's bold steps forward, and the study also explores the reputation of high heels in society.</p>

          <p>US drug overdose deaths fell 27% in 2024, marking the largest one-year decline ever recorded, with an estimated 80,000 deaths compared to 110,000 in 2023. Experts attribute the reduction to increased availability of naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, shifts in drug use, and the impact of opioid lawsuit settlement money. Despite the significant drop, annual overdose deaths remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, and some worry that recent declines could be slowed or stopped by reductions in federal funding and the public health workforce.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have advanced a bill that includes trillions of dollars in tax breaks as part of President Donald Trump's economic package, but the debate over the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) remains unresolved. The House Ways and Means Committee passed the bill, which would raise the SALT cap to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less. The full House vote may come as early as next week, but the legislation could see significant changes in the Senate.</p>
