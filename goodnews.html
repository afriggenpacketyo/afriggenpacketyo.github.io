          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, mediated by the United States, following rising tensions stemming from an April attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Indian officials have both confirmed the agreement, which was first announced by President Donald Trump. Secretary of State Marco Rubio commended Prime Ministers Modi and Sharif for choosing the path of peace, while Indian officials initially reported Pakistani attacks across 26 locations. This ceasefire aims to de-escalate the conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbors, who have exchanged cross-border fire and strikes in recent days. The optimism surrounding this ceasefire is guarded, pending sustained adherence by both sides.</p>

          <p>Derek Carr, the New Orleans Saints' starting quarterback, has announced his retirement from the NFL after 11 seasons due to a labral tear and degenerative rotator cuff injury in his right shoulder. Carr, 34, was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in 2014 and joined the Saints as a free agent in 2023, achieving a 14-13 record as a starter. Despite mixed results and injuries during his time with the Saints, Carr accumulated 41,245 passing yards and 257 touchdowns throughout his career. His retirement follows the Saints' selection of Tyler Shough in the recent draft, potentially signaling a future quarterback transition for the team.</p>

The probe, part of the Venera program, failed to reach its destination due to a malfunction in its launch vehicle's upper stage. Roscosmos confirmed that the spacecraft reentered the atmosphere west of Jakarta, Indonesia, with no immediate reports of damage. Experts had previously warned that the probe's sturdy construction, designed to withstand Venus's harsh atmosphere, could allow it to reach Earth's surface largely intact.</p>

          <p>As negotiations for President Donald Trump's tax agenda intensify, the House Ways and Means Committee has released a preliminary text of its portion of the bill. The article highlights the key issues and potential impacts of the proposed tax cuts on millions of Americans. Republican lawmakers aim to pass the package without Democratic support through a process known as "reconciliation," which requires adhering to a limited budget framework. Competing priorities and the narrow Republican majority in the House could make the process difficult, influencing individual provisions.</p>

          <p>Kosmos 482, a Soviet-era spacecraft launched in 1972 as part of the Venera program, has reentered Earth's atmosphere after failing to reach Venus. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed the uncontrolled reentry, with the European Space Agency's space debris office also indicating the event. It was not immediately known where the spacecraft reentered or how much of it survived the descent. Experts had anticipated that some parts of the half-ton spacecraft, built to withstand Venus's atmosphere, might survive.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management has reached a cooperation agreement with Charles River Laboratories, leading to changes in the board of directors and a strategic review. The article identifies three ways to create value for shareholders: a reconciliation of value due to market overreaction, an evaluation of the Manufacturing Solutions business for potential sale, and the acquisition of smaller competitors. The potential sale of the Manufacturing Solutions business, a high-quality and low capital intensity segment, could unlock significant value, while the strategic review could lead to further value-accretive acquisitions or even a sale of the whole company.</p>
