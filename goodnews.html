          <p>Bill Gates announced he will donate 99% of his remaining wealth to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, earlier than previously planned, with the goal of saving tens of millions of lives. Inspired by Andrew Carnegie's "The Gospel of Wealth," Gates aims to spend $200 billion over the next 20 years to combat preventable deaths, eradicate infectious diseases, and improve education. He expressed concern that progress could be stalled by U.S. and European countries scaling back foreign aid, and said he had discussed his foundation's initiatives with President Trump.

          <p>Bill Gates announced he will donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, allowing the foundation to spend an additional $200 billion over the next 20 years. This pledge is among the largest philanthropic gifts ever, outpacing historic contributions from industrialists like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie. Gates' donation signals sustained support for global health and education, and an eventual end to the foundation's immense worldwide influence. The foundation will maintain a budget of around $9 billion a year and will narrow its focus to top priorities. The optimism score is 80.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the potential impact of a trade deal between Britain and the United States, which is expected to ease the impact of recent tariff increases. The agreement could support sectors like the auto industry and lift consumer sentiment, but its overall effect on the British economy may be limited due to the dominance of services in trade flows. While the deal is unlikely to be a full-blown free-trade agreement, it is seen as a welcome development that could overshadow recent setbacks in local elections. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced a new, faster timeline to give away his fortune and close the Gates Foundation, committing to spending $200 billion over the next 20 years.

Gates predicts "incredible" progress in the next 20 years, with breakthroughs in HIV, tuberculosis, and neglected diseases. However, he also anticipates that childhood mortality will increase due to foreign aid cuts, and he emphasizes the importance of artificial intelligence in achieving the foundation's goals.

          <p>A judge ruled that Bryan Kohberger's immediate family members will be allowed to attend his upcoming quadruple-murder trial, even if they might be called to testify. The judge balanced Kohberger's right to a public trial with the state's interest in obtaining forthright testimony. He noted that the scope of their proposed testimony is narrow, and they have previously given recorded interviews. Kohberger is charged in the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students and faces the death penalty if convicted. The optimism score is 60.</p>
