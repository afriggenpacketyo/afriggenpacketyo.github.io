          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Halve Sewage Discharges into Waterways by 2030</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 06:16:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a plan to significantly reform the water industry, aiming to reduce sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 50% by 2030. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the current system as "broken" and promised tougher regulations, including potential prison sentences for non-compliant water company executives. This new target follows public outrage over increased pollution and large bonuses paid to water bosses. While the plan includes a ban on plastic-containing wet wipes, critics note the pledge is political and not yet legally binding.</p>

          <p>China and Vietnam are scheduled to conduct their first joint army training exercise, a move that signals deepening military cooperation between the two neighbors. The drills, themed around joint border patrol, will take place in China's Guangxi region, which shares a border with Vietnam. This development occurs as both nations seek closer ties, partly in response to the ongoing US-China trade war. The exercise marks a significant step in their defense relationship, building on China's recent participation in Vietnamese military celebrations.</p>

          <h2>Fossil Discovery in China Suggests Some Pterosaurs Were Herbivores</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 06:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare fossil discovery in northeastern China provides the first direct evidence that some pterosaurs, the flying reptiles of the dinosaur era, may have been plant-eaters. Researchers found phytoliths, which are microscopic plant minerals, inside the stomach of a Sinopterus atavismus fossil. The presence of these plant remains, along with small quartz crystals likely used as gastroliths to grind tough food, challenges previous assumptions about their diets. This finding renews a long-standing debate among paleontologists about the dietary habits of these ancient creatures that once dominated the skies.</p>

          <h2>An Unscheduled Summer: A Mother Reflects on Parenting Pressures and Financial Realities</h2>

          <p>A mother and teacher shares her experience of forgoing expensive summer camps for her children, opting instead for an unscheduled summer primarily for financial reasons. This personal choice is contrasted with the recent media trend debating the merits of letting kids have a "wild" or "rotting" summer, which she argues often misses the economic realities most families face. The article contends that the intense discussion around summer activities is a symptom of a larger societal failure to support modern families, particularly mothers who bear the majority of the mental load. Ultimately, the desire for a less-structured summer is less about child development philosophies and more about parents needing a break from relentless pressure.</p>

          <h2>Astronomers Observe Earliest Signs of Rocky Planet Formation Around Young Star</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, astronomers have directly observed the initial stages of rocky planet formation around a very young, sun-like star named HOPS-315. Using the James Webb Space Telescope and the ALMA array, researchers detected silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing in the star's surrounding disk. This discovery provides a glimpse into the processes that likely formed Earth and other rocky planets in our own solar system over 4.5 billion years ago. The findings suggest that the building blocks for Earth-like planets may be common during the earliest phases of star and planet development.</p>

          <p>England forward Beth Mead, who was the star player and top scorer of Euro 2022, is embracing a different role at the current Euro 2025 tournament. Having started only one of four games so far, Mead has become one of the squad's key substitutes, or "finishers," a term used to highlight their importance. She emphasized the need to be ready for any situation, including playing in unfamiliar midfield positions to support the team's needs. The strategy has been effective, with England's substitutes contributing crucial goals throughout their run to the semi-finals.</p>

          <p>With a potential 30% US tariff looming, South Africa is actively working to increase its exports to China to address a significant trade deficit that favors Beijing. A high-level South African delegation visited Beijing to promote investment and diversify exports beyond raw commodities to higher-value goods like pharmaceuticals and automotive products. Deputy President Paul Mashatile highlighted the need to overcome market access barriers and create a more balanced trade relationship. While China presents a crucial alternative market, observers caution that it is not a simple replacement for the US and carries its own trade complexities.</p>

          <p>The Sunbeam "Blue Bird," the first car to break the 150 mph barrier, will return to Pendine Sands in Wales to celebrate the 100th anniversary of its historic achievement. In 1925, driver Malcolm Campbell set a new world land-speed record of 150.766 mph on the seven-mile beach, a feat that brought him international fame. The car, now cared for by the National Motor Museum, will be started on the beach in a ceremony attended by Campbell's grandson, Don Wales. The event commemorates a pivotal moment in automotive history at a location that was central to land-speed record attempts in the 1920s.</p>

          <p>In a notable Wisconsin murder trial, data from a Fitbit provided a crucial alibi for a man initially suspected of killing his girlfriend, Nicole Vander Heyden. Doug Detrie was arrested after his girlfriend was found beaten and strangled, but his Fitbit data corroborated his story that he was home and mostly inactive during the time of the murder. Subsequently, investigators used DNA evidence and Google Dashboard location data from another man's phone to identify and charge George Steven Burch with the crime. The case highlights the growing role of personal technology in criminal investigations, capable of both implicating suspects and exonerating the innocent.</p>

Defender Maya Yoshida scored on a glancing header in the 97th minute, capping a dramatic comeback for the struggling Galaxy.
