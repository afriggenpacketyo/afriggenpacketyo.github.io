          <p>After five consecutive weeks of decline, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage now stands at 6.75%, offering a slight reprieve for potential homebuyers. This downward trend occurred despite the Federal Reserve maintaining its key interest rate, highlighting the influence of other factors like the 10-year Treasury yield. Experts are cautious about predicting whether this relief will continue into July, as future movements depend heavily on upcoming inflation data and signals from the Federal Reserve. Prospective buyers are advised to monitor the market closely for opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale was forced to make an emergency landing in Fort Myers, Florida, after a passenger's portable battery caught fire mid-flight. The flight crew successfully extinguished the flames, but the plane was diverted due to residual smoke in the cabin as a precautionary measure. All 185 passengers and six crew members landed safely with no injuries reported. The incident is now under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration, highlighting growing concerns over the risks of lithium-ion batteries on aircraft.</p>

          <p>TikTok is reportedly planning to release a new, separate application for its U.S. users as its parent company, ByteDance, faces a September 17 deadline to sell its U.S. operations or face a ban. The new app, potentially available by September 5, is expected to be part of a strategy to address national security concerns raised by the U.S. government regarding the company's ties to China. American users would eventually need to migrate to the new app to continue using the service. This development comes as potential buyers, including Oracle and Amazon, are being considered for the acquisition of TikTok's U.S. assets.</p>

          <p>AI-focused cloud infrastructure provider CoreWeave has announced its intention to acquire data center operator Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $9 billion. The acquisition will give CoreWeave ownership of 1.3 gigawatts of data center capacity, significantly expanding its access to power and real estate while eliminating future lease obligations. Core Scientific, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, has increasingly focused on high-performance computing, making it a strategic fit for CoreWeave's AI-driven business. The deal is expected to close in late 2025.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's self-driving car company, Waymo, is expanding its operations to Philadelphia, where it will begin testing a limited fleet of vehicles with human safety drivers. The company will use the "road trip" to collect mapping data and assess its autonomous driving technology's performance in a new urban environment with unique traffic patterns. This move is part of Waymo's broader strategy for a national rollout, following similar testing initiatives in New York City. Waymo currently operates paid ride-hailing services in four U.S. cities and plans to launch in three more by 2026.</p>

          <h2>Satirical Column Lampoons Workplace Trend Pieces by Re-labeling Everyday Activities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 15:48:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic pokes fun at the media's obsession with inventing names for mundane workplace behaviors, particularly among Gen Z employees. The author humorously recounts a typical workday using the language of trend pieces, rebranding sleep as "Microdeath," commuting without internet as a "Tiny Detox," and using the restroom as a "Microspa." The piece critiques the alarmist tone of such articles by applying it to perfectly normal activities like breathing ("Lung Bathing") and talking to colleagues ("Voice Quitting"). The satire highlights the absurdity of pathologizing the routine actions of a younger generation of workers.</p>

          <p>A new mural in North Hollywood by artist Louie Palsino honors Dodgers utility player Kiké Hernández for his public support of immigrants. The artwork was inspired by a recent social media post from Hernández, a native of Puerto Rico, in which he expressed his anger over the treatment of immigrants and stated that Los Angeles has adopted him as one of its own. The mural, which features Hernández's image alongside the words "Born X Raised" and "Los Angeles," celebrates his stand for "what is right." The artist has created other Dodgers-themed murals in the same location.</p>

          <p>A month after returning to his two-way role, Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani is demonstrating encouraging progress on the pitcher's mound following his recovery from Tommy John surgery. While his pitching outings have been kept short, he has allowed only one run and is showcasing high-velocity fastballs and effective breaking pitches. His hitting numbers have seen a slight dip during this period, though he still leads the National League in home runs and maintains MVP-caliber statistics overall. The team is carefully managing his workload to balance his dual responsibilities as they look to defend their World Series title.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut looking increasingly likely, homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) can take proactive steps now. This article advises prospective borrowers to first check their credit report and score, as a higher score will secure better rates and terms. Second, they should shop around and compare lenders beyond their current mortgage provider to establish a baseline of competitive offers. Finally, it is crucial to calculate potential repayment costs under various interest rate scenarios, as the variable rate on a HELOC can change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chicxs Rockerxs summer camp, a program for girls and gender-nonconforming youth in Southeast Los Angeles, canceled its in-person activities and moved entirely online to protect campers and their families from the recent surge in ICE raids. Organizers made the decision after hearing that some students were staying home out of fear. Instead of canceling, the nonprofit restructured its program for a virtual format, dropping off instruments and supplies at campers' homes. The move allowed the camp to continue providing a safe, creative space for youth to learn music and bond with peers.</p>
