          <h2>States Forfeit Millions in Tax Revenue to Attract Data Centers</h2>

          <p>States are forfeiting hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue to attract data centers, benefiting tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google. These companies receive sales tax exemptions on equipment and energy, but the facilities often create few permanent jobs. Watchdog groups question the tradeoffs, citing the immense electricity consumption. Some states are examining the economic impact of these exemptions, with Virginia finding a moderate economic benefit but acknowledging the lost revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tokyo police and prosecutors have issued apologies to two men for their wrongful arrest and indictment in a 2020 case involving the suspected unauthorized export of sensitive equipment. The apology follows a high court ruling ordering compensation for the men. The men were arrested on suspicion of exporting equipment that could be used to produce biological weapons, but the indictment was later withdrawn. The family of a third man involved, who died during detention, expressed dissatisfaction with the apology.</p>
