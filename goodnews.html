          <p>GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, used for weight loss and diabetes management, are being studied for potential mental health side effects. While some studies suggest a link between these drugs and mood changes like anxiety and depression, others indicate that genetic variations may play a role. Doctors emphasize the importance of considering pre-existing mental health conditions in patients and maintaining close communication with medical providers. Some patients report improved mood due to the positive effects of weight loss and stabilized blood sugar levels, highlighting the complexity of the issue.</p>

          <p>This article draws parallels between President Trump's current legislative efforts and Ronald Reagan's economic policies in 1981, dubbed "Reaganomics." Both administrations sought significant tax cuts and increased military spending through budget reconciliation, a process that bypasses the Senate filibuster. Similar to Reagan's efforts, Trump's plan aims to stimulate the economy and reduce the burden of government. The article also highlights the role of unelected officials, such as Elon Musk in the current administration and David Stockman in Reagan's, in driving these sweeping changes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that discussions about wealth should move beyond simple "rich lists" and address the issue of "extreme wealth." The gap between the wealthiest individuals and the average person has tripled since 1989, leading to concerns about the concentration of power and its impact on society. The author proposes establishing an "extreme wealth line" to define the point at which wealth becomes harmful and to guide policy interventions aimed at curbing wealth accumulation. Such a line could provide a mandate for higher taxes or compel charitable donations from the super-rich.</p>

The AfD, which garnered significant support in recent elections, faces scrutiny for its views on ethnicity and human dignity, but major political parties remain hesitant to form coalitions with the party.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. The study, published in the journal Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, which allowed them to study patterns of population history, migration and adaptation over thousands of years.</p>
