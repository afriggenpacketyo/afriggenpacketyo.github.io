          <p>At WWE's SummerSlam event, Tiffany Stratton successfully defended her WWE Women's Championship against Jade Cargill, extending her title reign beyond 200 days. The match, which was the first SummerSlam appearance for both competitors, featured a high-energy, back-and-forth contest with numerous aerial assaults and powerful moves. Despite Cargill hitting her finisher, Jaded, Stratton managed to get her foot on the ropes to break the pin. Stratton ultimately secured the victory by countering a top-rope maneuver and hitting her own finisher for the pinfall.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the 25-year-old wife of a Marine Corps veteran, has been released from ICE custody after being detained for two months in Louisiana. Clouatre, who was breastfeeding her newborn at the time of her arrest, was taken into custody during what she believed was a routine green card interview. Her detention stemmed from a 2018 deportation order she was unaware of, issued after her mother, who had abandoned her as a teen, missed an immigration hearing. Now released on bond with an ankle monitor, her case highlights the current administration's stricter immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former judge and prominent Fox News personality, to the position of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia in a 50-45 vote. Pirro, a staunch supporter of President Trump, had already been serving in an acting capacity since May. This powerful role oversees the prosecution of both federal and local crimes in the nation's capital. Her nomination proceeded with relatively little pushback from Democrats compared to the president's previous nominee, who had lost support due to controversial statements about the January 6th Capitol attack.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme involving the purchase of military drones and electronic warfare systems. The scheme allegedly involved signing state contracts with suppliers at prices inflated by as much as 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, praising the agencies' work. The arrests follow a recent controversy where Zelensky's government restored the independence of these anti-corruption bodies after public backlash against a bill that would have curtailed their power.</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch from a Berlin loft, the Ethereum blockchain has evolved from a niche experiment into a foundational technology for global finance, now valued at $420 billion. Initially a "programmable money" concept, it now underpins decentralized finance, NFTs, and is increasingly integrated into Wall Street systems. Major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are building on Ethereum, leveraging its stability and programmability for tokenized assets and funds. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin reflects on the platform's unexpected growth while emphasizing the need to maintain its decentralized principles as it achieves mainstream adoption.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts how federal immigration agents can conduct "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area. The decision affirms that agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, speaking Spanish, or being in a particular location, as this does not constitute reasonable suspicion. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over Trump administration sweeps in Southern California that sparked widespread fear and protests. The court found that these factors describe a broad profile that violates the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures.</p>

          <p>NBA superstar Luka Doncic has signed a contract extension with the Los Angeles Lakers, ending speculation about his potential departure and solidifying his role as the future of the franchise. Doncic, who was acquired in a trade from the Dallas Mavericks in February, announced the deal himself on social media, expressing his commitment to winning championships for the team. The Lakers organization praised him as one of the game's "most transcendent players" and the leader who will guide them in the post-LeBron James era. The 26-year-old also pledged a $5 million donation to help young athletes.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are launching a new left-wing political party in the UK but have yet to decide on a name. Rather than choosing one themselves, they are inviting their supporters, who reportedly number over 600,000, to suggest a name that reflects the party's values. This unconventional approach means the party cannot field election candidates until a name is officially registered with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties. The move highlights the challenge of creating a modern political brand that resonates with voters.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have formally committed to Luka Doncic as the franchise's centerpiece by signing him to a three-year, $165 million contract extension. This move, celebrated with a major press conference, signals a clear shift in the team's focus and raises questions about the future role of LeBron James. James, who is under contract for only one more season, is accustomed to being the focal point of any team he plays for. The article suggests an uneasy dynamic, as the organization has now clearly passed the torch to the 26-year-old Doncic, a transition that never fully materialized with Anthony Davis.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has stated that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was a key factor in his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Hill, who had qualified as a doctor in 1988, felt unsuited for medicine and recalled feeling "completely out of my depth" when breaking tragic news to patients. His stepfather's death made him realize he did not want to spend his life in a job he was not passionate about, fearing he would not live to enjoy retirement. This realization set him free to pursue a new path in entertainment in the early 1990s.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-standing mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II died has been solved. For decades, it was rumored the animal, named Winston, died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, recent archival research by students at the University of Sydney has revealed a more likely cause. By analyzing the platypus attendant's logbook, researchers found that water and air temperatures on the ship rose well above the safe threshold for the species as it crossed the equator. The evidence strongly suggests the platypus essentially overheated, rather than dying from the stress of war.</p>

          <p>In a discussion based on a recent Foreign Affairs article, Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute explores the role conservatives can play in challenging and shaping U.S. foreign policy in the current political landscape. The conversation touches upon the theme of a "Dispensable Nation" and what America's place in the world might look like in a post-American or altered international order. The piece examines how conservative thinkers and policymakers might navigate and influence foreign policy debates, particularly in relation to the approaches established during the Trump administration. This provides a perspective on the internal debates within the conservative movement regarding international engagement.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense targeting individuals who use the internet to advertise or promote illegal small boat crossings across the English Channel. The proposed law, part of the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, could result in up to five years in prison for those creating online material that facilitates breaches of UK immigration law. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the measure is aimed at disrupting the business model of "immoral" criminal gangs who use social media to sell false promises of a safe journey. The National Crime Agency has already removed over 8,000 such posts in 2024.</p>
