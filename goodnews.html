          <p>Reports have surfaced regarding a potential plan by the White House to deport migrants to Libya using a U.S. military plane. When questioned about this, former President Trump stated that the Department of Homeland Security should be consulted. The Government of National Unity in Libya has denied any involvement or knowledge of such plans, asserting that they reject the use of Libyan territory for migrant deportations without their consent. Attorneys representing migrants have filed an emergency motion in federal court to prevent potential removals to Libya.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, citing increased uncertainty in the economic outlook and potential risks from the Trump administration's trade policies. The decision reflects concerns about both rising unemployment and inflation, with tariffs posing a threat to both economic growth and price stability. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that the economy is currently in solid shape, allowing the central bank to remain patient while monitoring developments. The Fed's deliberations occur amidst ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and its major trading partners, with potential implications for economic growth, inflation, and market sentiment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article advises savers on whether to renew maturing certificate of deposit (CD) accounts given the likelihood of upcoming federal funds rate cuts. While rate cuts appear imminent, the article argues that renewing CD accounts can still be a smart move. The rate cut trajectory could change, and rate cuts are likely to be small, so savers shouldn't let that deter them. The alternatives to CDs are not as beneficial, and savers shouldn't lose the interest-earning opportunity in the interim.</p>

          <p>Senior British trade negotiators have arrived in Washington to accelerate discussions on a trade agreement between the UK and the US. The goal is to finalize an agreement before the planned UK-EU summit. However, recent tariff announcements by President Trump, particularly those affecting the film industry, have created setbacks. UK officials are targeting tariff relief on specific sectors, such as steel, aluminum, and cars, in exchange for a lower digital services tax. The negotiations face challenges related to pharmaceuticals and films, with Trump threatening tariffs on both industries.</p>
