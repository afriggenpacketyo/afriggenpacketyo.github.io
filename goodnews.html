          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown academic, has been released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled his detention violated his right to free speech and due process. US authorities had accused him of "spreading Hamas propaganda" and having "connections to a known or suspected terrorist," claims the judge refuted. The Justice Department argued for his continued detention until court proceedings finished, but the judge found no evidence supporting the government's claims. The ACLU, involved in Suri's defense, emphasized that "speaking out about what's happening in Palestine is not a crime," even as the Trump administration seeks to deport Suri in separate proceedings.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after spending over three decades behind bars for the 1989 killings of their parents. The brothers claim they acted in self-defense after years of alleged physical, sexual assault, and emotional abuse. The decision, opposed by Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman, was praised by the brothers' relatives, who expressed hope for their release. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings before it is sent to the governor's office for final determination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government will now allow foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines, reversing a previous ban prompted by a takeover bid of the Telegraph and the Spectator by a company backed by Abu Dhabi's ruling family. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated the changes would protect "media plurality" while enabling publishers to "raise vital funding." This shift comes after consultations revealed that many newspaper groups believed a complete ban was too restrictive for securing financing, balancing concerns over foreign influence with the financial needs of news organizations.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is supporting two bills aimed at streamlining housing development in urban areas by easing the permitting process for infill projects. Newsom also proposed including provisions in his revised state budget to reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and address other obstacles to new housing construction. The governor emphasized the need to accelerate urban infill and exempt such projects from CEQA to address the state's housing crisis. These proposals aim to reduce red tape and accelerate the development of much-needed housing in California.</p>

          <p>Santa Monica's City Council has approved a proposal to transform the Third Street Promenade into an "entertainment zone" by allowing visitors to purchase alcoholic beverages from participating businesses and consume them outdoors. The policy, effective from June, aims to boost foot traffic and support local businesses struggling since the pandemic. The "Entertainment Zone" will operate between Wilshire Boulevard and Broadway on Fridays through Sundays, requiring participants to be 21 or older and wear wristbands. While some residents expressed concerns about potential increases in crime and homelessness, the city hopes the initiative will revitalize the area.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, marking the most substantial progress in over a decade. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a nearly 27 percent drop in drug fatalities nationwide, with declines observed across major drug categories and in most states. Experts attribute this progress to changes in the illicit drug supply, improved access to treatment, and increased use of naloxone. However, concerns have emerged as the Trump administration proposes cuts to federal health programs addressing the drug crisis, potentially jeopardizing the momentum.</p>

          <p>President Trump has dismissed criticism regarding his plan to accept a luxury jet from the Qatari government, simultaneously announcing a $96 billion contract for Boeing to supply Qatar with 210 planes.

Trump defended the offer, citing the current Air Force One as outdated and inferior to the aircraft used by other nations.

          <p>The resentencing of Lyle and Erik Menendez has brought renewed attention to the cultural and political climate of the 1990s, which heavily influenced their initial trial and conviction. Their lawyer, Mark Geragos, argued that today's more lenient criminal justice policies warrant a second chance for the brothers. The case has also been influenced by social media campaigns and true-crime programming, contrasting with the vilification they faced in the 1990s. The article explores how changing attitudes towards sexual assault and criminal justice have shaped the brothers' legal journey.</p>

          <p>A 35-second window separates one Eurovision performance from the next, and an 'invisible crew' of stagehands, lighting technicians, and cleaners orchestrate the transition. Richard van Rouwendaal, a Dutch stage manager, likens it to a Formula 1 tire change, where each member has a specific task to ensure a seamless setup. The crew rehearses for weeks, mastering secret passageways and "smuggling routes" to quickly move props and equipment on and off stage.
