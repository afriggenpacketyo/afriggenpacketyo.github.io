          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge hit his 362nd career home run, moving him past Joe DiMaggio into fourth place on the team's all-time leaderboard. The historic milestone occurred during a game against the Boston Red Sox. This achievement came just one day after Judge hit two home runs in a game attended by President Donald Trump, who had visited the Yankees' clubhouse beforehand. Judge's recent performance has been exceptional, with three home runs in the two games following his meeting with the former president, further solidifying his MVP-caliber season.</p>

          <p>As astronomical autumn begins on September 22, sky-gazers can look forward to several notable celestial events. Saturn will be at its brightest and closest to Earth on September 21, when it reaches opposition, making it easily visible to the naked eye. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will peak around October 22, with ideal viewing conditions due to a new moon. These events offer opportunities for observation as the nights grow longer, providing a series of natural spectacles throughout the season for astronomy enthusiasts and casual observers alike.</p>

          <p>Three Austrian nuns in their 80s have escaped from a care home and returned to their former convent, Kloster Goldenstein, after being moved against their will. With the help of former students and a locksmith, Sister Bernadette, Sister Regina, and Sister Rita regained access to the home where they had spent most of their lives. The nuns stated they were unhappy in the care home and were exercising their right to live in the convent. Church authorities have called the move "incomprehensible," citing the nuns' health, but the trio has received an outpouring of support from their community.</p>
