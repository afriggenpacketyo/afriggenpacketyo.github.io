        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An excerpt from Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," details significant advancements in understanding and treating chronic pain. The article highlights a shift towards "reverse translational research," where patient experiences guide lab-based studies, rather than the other way around. This approach has enabled scientists to map the unique neural signatures of pain in the brain for the first time. This breakthrough has led to clinical trials using deep brain stimulation (DBS) to predict and interrupt pain signals, offering new hope for treatment, though the technology is not yet widely available.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—introduced surfing to the U.S. mainland in Santa Cruz, California. While studying at a nearby military school, they fashioned boards from local redwood and demonstrated the royal sport, an event documented by a local newspaper. This act of "surf diplomacy" planted the seeds for the sport's popularity, which would later be globalized by Duke Kahanamoku. A new museum exhibit in Santa Cruz highlights this pivotal moment, showcasing replicas of their massive, finless boards and celebrating the cultural exchange that brought the iconic sport to American shores.</p>

          <p>The Australian state of South Australia is set to ban the sale and distribution of fish-shaped soy sauce containers as part of its broader campaign against single-use plastics. Effective September 1, the policy targets the small, pre-filled containers popular with takeaway sushi, which are used for seconds but persist in the environment for centuries. Although made of recyclable plastic, their small size makes them difficult for recycling machinery to process. This move aims to reduce pollution and protect marine life, building on previous legislation that has already banned items like plastic straws and carrier bags.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Open's Signature Cocktail Price Has Outpaced National Inflation Over Last Decade</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 07:40:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Open's iconic Honey Deuce cocktail, priced at $23, has seen its cost increase at a rate faster than general inflation over the past decade. Since 2015, the price of the vodka-based drink has risen by approximately 53%, while the Consumer Price Index has increased by about 36% in the same period. If the cocktail's price had matched inflation, it would cost just over $20 today. Despite the high cost, the event sold over 550,000 Honey Deuces last year, generating nearly $13 million in revenue and cementing its status as a popular, albeit expensive, tournament staple.</p>

          <p>Renowned painter Alex Katz has created over 300 portraits of his wife, Ada, who has served as his primary muse for more than five decades. Their artistic and romantic partnership is the subject of an exhibition at New York's Jewish Museum. Katz, who developed his distinctive brand of realism during the rise of abstract expressionism, describes his connection to Ada as a simple visual attraction he felt compelled to paint. Curators note that his portraits focus more on style, light, and form rather than deep emotional expression, allowing viewers to see themselves reflected in the art, which has become a hallmark of his celebrated career.</p>

The Booker Prize-winning author reflects on her mother's death and the profound, almost shameful, intensity of her own grief. She describes her mother as a towering, unpredictable force in her life, woven into the very landscape of Kerala. The passage touches upon the family's long-running, morbid discussions about her mother's will and the legal battles she fought for inheritance rights, painting a picture of a formidable woman whose absence leaves an immense void.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 07:00:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay addresses the common feeling of guilt associated with experiencing personal happiness while the world faces numerous crises. Drawing on ancient religious and philosophical traditions, the author argues that humanity is like a single body where if one part suffers, all suffer. However, this interconnectedness also means that if one part rejoices, all should rejoice as well. The piece advocates for embracing "sympathetic joy" alongside empathy for pain, suggesting that focusing solely on global suffering leads to cynicism. Feeling both the world's horror and its delight is presented as a natural and healthy part of being a connected human, and a form of resistance against despair.</p>

          <p>The IRS has issued guidance clarifying how consumers can still qualify for the up to $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit, even if they don't take possession of the car by the September 30 deadline. According to the new rules, a buyer can secure the credit by entering into a "written binding contract" and making a payment, such as a deposit or trade-in, on or before the deadline. This allows consumers to order a vehicle now and claim the credit when it is delivered later. This clarification provides a crucial window for buyers as the popular federal incentive is set to expire under a new tax and spending law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met to improve bilateral ties amid ongoing border tensions. Modi, on his first visit to China in seven years, stated that New Delhi is committed to advancing relations based on mutual respect. The summit, which includes leaders from Russia, Iran, and Turkey, is seen by Beijing as an opportunity to strengthen a non-Western global order. The meeting between Xi and Modi is particularly significant as recent U.S. tariffs on Indian goods may be pushing the two regional powers closer together.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has issued a warning to parents about the importance of school attendance at the start of the new term. New data reveals that over half of pupils who missed any school during the first week of the 2024 term went on to be persistently absent for the year, compared to only 14% of those with full attendance. While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains below pre-COVID levels. Phillipson urged a collective effort from schools and parents to ensure a strong start to the school year, emphasizing that missing even a few days early on can have lasting consequences on a child's education.</p>

The mission, which launched from China, marks Mexico's first commercial venture into low Earth orbit and demonstrates growing international interest in China's launch services. The two femtosatellites, each weighing under 100 grams, are designed for educational and artistic purposes, aiming to make space accessible to students and amateurs.

          <p>This opinion piece draws on Toni Morrison's 1995 analysis of fascism to argue that its roots in America are deeply tied to racism. The author contends that the current political climate exhibits many fascist traits Morrison described, but warns against viewing it as a new phenomenon or one exclusive to a single political party. The article posits that Black history provides a powerful model for antifascist resistance through unwavering belief in democratic ideals, diverse forms of protest, and profound faith. By celebrating Black culture, as Beyoncé does, and continuing the fight for justice, Americans can draw strength from a legacy of prevailing against seemingly impossible odds.</p>
