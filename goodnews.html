          <p>A historic peace deal for Gaza was signed by President Donald Trump and several world leaders, marking a pivotal moment following the release of all remaining living Israeli hostages by Hamas. This agreement, achieved after two years of intense conflict, involved the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and a surge in humanitarian aid to the war-torn territory. While the signing represents a significant de-escalation, future negotiations are anticipated to address complex issues such as Gaza's postwar governance, Hamas's disarmament, and the aspiration for a Palestinian state, which remain major hurdles for enduring peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Atlanta Falcons defeated the Buffalo Bills 24-14, marking the Bills' second consecutive loss, largely powered by running back Bijan Robinson's career-best night. Robinson rushed for 170 yards, including an 81-yard touchdown, the longest in the NFL this season, and added 68 receiving yards for a total of 238 scrimmage yards. Despite Josh Allen's two touchdown passes, the Bills' offense struggled, failing to convert key fourth downs and experiencing a late interception. This article highlights how the Falcons, with contributions from Michael Penix Jr. and Drake London, secured a significant win, raising doubts about the Bills' earlier undefeated streak against weaker teams.</p>

          <p>The City of Cleveland and the Cleveland Browns ownership group have reached a $100 million settlement, which will facilitate the construction of the team's new $2.4 billion domed stadium in Brook Park. This agreement resolves prior lawsuits between the parties, with the Haslam Sports Group committing to an initial $25 million payment to the city and covering the estimated $30 million cost to demolish the current stadium. Additionally, the Haslams will contribute $5 million annually from 2029-2033 and $2 million annually from 2029-2038 for community benefit projects. The deal, which still requires City Council approval, aims to revitalize the lakefront and provide a modern facility for the Browns by 2029.</p>

Her inspiring journey was featured in the BBC series "Rose Ayling-Ellis: Old Hands, New Tricks," where she, alongside other older residents, achieved a Level 1 BSL qualification. Tina, a former RAF navigator and lawyer, found that BSL helped her express words she couldn't speak and relaxed her communication. This article underscores the significant value of BSL not only for deaf individuals but also for those with speech impediments, fostering confidence and improved emotional understanding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Milwaukee Brewers executed one of the most astonishing double plays in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the fourth inning with bases loaded, a deep fly ball by Max Muncy was initially misjudged by center fielder Sal Frelick but he recovered, throwing to the infield for a force out. Simultaneously, Dodgers runner Will Smith, who had failed to advance, was tagged out at third by catcher William Contreras, completing a rare and unexpected double play that prevented runs. Despite this defensive gem, the Brewers' offense struggled, ultimately losing the game 2-1 to the defending World Series champions.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy expanded faster than expected in the third quarter, with a 2.9% year-on-year GDP increase, surpassing economists' forecasts. However, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) warned that growth is likely to moderate in 2026, returning to a near-trend pace as global trade normalizes. Manufacturing and construction sectors showed signs of softening, though global investment in artificial intelligence is expected to support manufacturing. This article highlights that while current performance is resilient, the central bank anticipates an economic slowdown, maintaining its policy settings despite significant declines in headline and core inflation, signaling a "comfortable hold" rather than a dovish pause.

          <p>Vietnamese public perception of China is undergoing a significant shift, evolving from wary and "menacing" to increasingly "cool," influenced by social media platforms like TikTok and deepening economic ties. This article details how younger Vietnamese are expressing admiration for China's development and culture, despite a history of conflict and ongoing disputes in the South China Sea. This change in sentiment has enabled Vietnamese leaders to pursue sensitive infrastructure projects, such as high-speed rail links, that were previously met with protests. While economic interests are increasingly outweighing nationalism, some underlying skepticism persists, highlighting a complex and evolving relationship between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and over 20 world leaders convened in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to formally sign "The Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity," cementing the Gaza ceasefire agreement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was notably absent, citing a Jewish holiday, despite a direct invitation. The memorandum outlined broad commitments to resolving future disputes through diplomacy and negotiation, following the successful exchange of the remaining 20 living Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Trump proclaimed a "new dawn in the Middle East" and declared the war over, yet acknowledged that significant challenges persist concerning the long-term rebuilding of Gaza and establishing stable postwar governance.</p>

          <p>Missouri has implemented a new hands-free driving law aimed at curbing distracted driving, a significant cause of fatalities nationwide, with an average of nine deaths daily in the U.S. This article emphasizes the personal impetus behind the legislation, driven by the tragic death of Randall Siddens in a 2019 distracted driving incident. The state's Department of Transportation is now employing telematics data, anonymously collected from smartphones and vehicles, to pinpoint distracted driving "hot spots." This data indicates that actual distracted driving occurrences are likely three times higher than traditional crash reports suggest, allowing for more effective, targeted educational campaigns and increased law enforcement presence in high-risk regions.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation to significantly increase the wages for incarcerated individuals battling wildfires, raising their pay from approximately $1 an hour to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. This article highlights that while these wages remain below California's state minimum, the increase is a substantial improvement for the inmate fire crews who perform dangerous and vital work like clearing brush and digging containment lines. The legislation, which takes effect immediately, follows a $10 million budget allocation for these wages and addresses a prominent social justice issue concerning the extremely low pay for this hazardous occupation, though some opposed it due to cost.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation establishing a commission to study inequalities in youth sports, encompassing access based on gender identity, despite his earlier public comments questioning transgender women's participation in women's sports. Assembly Bill 749 aims to determine if a new state board is required to enhance sports access for all youth, regardless of race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, income, or geographic location. This article highlights the political contention surrounding the inclusion of "gender identity," with Republican critics arguing it's an indirect strategy to support transgender athletes. Proponents, however, stress the bill's broader objective of dismantling systemic barriers that limit youth sports participation.</p>

This article explores the mixed reactions, noting that while Jewish students express relief, pro-Palestinian groups insist their demands for university divestment from companies linked to Israel remain unmet. Despite increased university crackdowns on protests and a surge in allegations of antisemitism, student activism is credited with shifting American public opinion on Palestinians. The piece highlights the persistent divisions on campuses, marked by increased reports of antisemitism and anti-Muslim incidents, and ongoing disciplinary actions against students.</p>
