        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The consumer price index increased by 0.1% in May, bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.4%, which is below economists' expectations. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also came in lower than forecast, raising concerns among Federal Reserve officials about the impact of tariffs on inflation. Weakness in energy and services prices offset some increases, while vehicle and apparel prices declined, despite expectations of tariff-related increases. This report comes as the Trump administration continues trade negotiations and has imposed tariffs on U.S. imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite recent stock market volatility attributed to the Trump administration's tariff policies, investor portfolios have seen positive, albeit modest, returns. The S&P 500's annualized return during Trump's second presidency is 1.58%, despite several days of significant declines. This highlights the importance of staying calm during market fluctuations, as impulsive exits can be detrimental. Investors have experienced larger returns in the early days of previous presidencies, but the long-term trend generally shows healthy stock market returns across most presidential terms.

The feud had dissolved a close partnership that propelled Musk to spearhead the budget-slashing Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's opposition to the bill, which he claimed "undermines" the work of DOGE and increases the U.S. budget deficit, sparked the conflict.

          <p>The article explores the cultural emphasis on romantic relationships over friendships and suggests that friendships can be just as important. It highlights how society often places unnecessary limits on friendship, leading to systemic issues like fewer legal protections and cultural expectations centered on marriage and family. The piece suggests prioritizing both love and friendship by showing support for friends, reimagining free time, and recognizing jealousy as a sign of valuing a friendship. Ultimately, it argues for a more balanced view of relationships where friendships are not secondary to romantic love.</p>
