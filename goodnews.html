          <p>Belgian champion Tim Wellens secured his first career Tour de France stage victory on stage 15, triumphing with a decisive breakaway win. The UAE Team Emirates-XRG rider, typically serving as a domestique for race leader Tadej Pogacar, capitalized on a day liberated from his usual duties, launching a powerful attack on the final climb of the hilly 169.3km route. Wellens crossed the finish line with a significant lead, marking the fifth stage win for his team in this year's Tour. He expressed profound joy, calling the achievement a "very special victory" and a dream realized.</p>

          <p>US Vice-President JD Vance is reportedly planning a summer family holiday in the picturesque Cotswolds, following President Trump's recent visit to Scotland. This choice of destination marks a notable contrast to Vance's working-class Appalachian background. The trip, which will also include a stop in London despite his prior critical comments about the city's identity, follows Vance's public criticisms of European governments regarding free speech and immigration policies. The article notes that Vance may face a different reception in Scotland, given his past controversial remarks on abortion rights and "thought crime." This visit occurs as US tourist traffic to the UK has significantly plummeted, potentially influenced by Trump administration policies and rhetoric.</p>

          <h2>Former Obama Speechwriter Discusses Finding "Neutral Ground" Amidst Political Division</h2>

          <p>Former Obama speechwriter David Litt reflects on the challenges of finding "common ground" in a politically divided America, instead proposing the more practical concept of "neutral ground." Through his personal experience learning to surf with his brother-in-law, a Joe Rogan superfan, Litt discovered that shared activities can foster genuine connection and understanding despite profound ideological differences. He advocates for actively seeking out such neutral spaces where individuals can engage on shared interests, emphasizing that this approach allows for genuine discussions rather than mere arguments. Litt suggests that "disagreeing without being disagreeable" is crucial for navigating contemporary political polarization and building bridges across divides.</p>

          <h2>Child Psychologist Highlights "Self-Connection" as Most Crucial Skill for Children's Success</h2>

          <p>A child psychologist and author advocates for "self-connection"—the ability to tune into one's own emotions and inner voice—as the single most vital skill for a child's lifelong success and well-being. The article explains that seemingly innocuous parental responses that dismiss or invalidate a child's feelings can subtly undermine this crucial connection, potentially leading to anxiety and insecurity later in life. Self-connection, conversely, builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, cultivates authentic confidence, and significantly contributes to strong mental health. The article offers seven actionable strategies for parents, such as validating emotions and modeling self-awareness, to nurture this essential skill in their children.</p>

          <p>Newberry Springs, a small Mojave Desert community on historic Route 66, is poised for a potential revitalization as the iconic "Mother Road" approaches its 100th anniversary. Once a bustling hub, the town became a "ghost town" after Interstate 40 bypassed it in the 1970s, a decline famously echoed in the animated movie Cars. Despite its "frozen in time" appearance, local residents are actively planning events and infrastructure improvements, including a "musical highway," to capitalize on the anticipated surge in tourism. This initiative underscores the ongoing efforts to preserve Americana and stimulate economic growth in the many small towns linked to Route 66's enduring legacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gene Marks argues that traditional US labor market measurements, which primarily focus on "jobs," are increasingly obsolete given the evolving nature of work. He highlights the rise of "over-employed" individuals holding multiple jobs or diverse income streams, often working remotely or launching side businesses, which are not adequately captured by current metrics. Marks points to discrepancies in official job figures and advocates for a shift towards measuring "income" as a more relevant indicator of labor market health. He suggests leveraging data from tax returns and private platforms for a more accurate assessment, emphasizing the urgent need for this re-evaluation amidst the transformative impacts of AI, immigration, and the expanding gig economy.

          <p>This article explores the scientific premise that personality traits are not fixed and can be intentionally changed, challenging the conventional belief that personality is immutable after a certain age. Psychologist Shannon Sauer-Zavala's research indicates that conscious and sustained behavioral shifts can effectively alter one's characteristic ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. The article highlights the personal journey of author Olga Khazan, who successfully transformed her neurotic and introverted tendencies through deliberate actions like attending improv classes and consistent journaling. This approach, described as "fake it 'til you make it," suggests that by persistently adopting desired behaviors, individuals can genuinely reshape their personality, leading to significant personal growth and improved mental well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent SmartAsset study indicates a significant exodus of retirees from major U.S. cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., primarily driven by the high cost of living. New York City recorded the largest net outflow of residents aged 60 and over in 2023, with nearly 24,000 seniors relocating. Four of the top ten cities experiencing this trend are in California, a state where over $1.6 million in savings is typically required for a comfortable retirement. This demographic shift highlights retirees' preference for more affordable locations, often in states offering lower living expenses and more favorable tax laws for their post-career years.
