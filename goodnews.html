          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a series of meetings with U.S. congressional leaders in Washington to discuss security cooperation and the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. He met with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President JD Vance, emphasizing the strong U.S.-Israel partnership under President Trump, particularly in countering Iran. Netanyahu stated that their joint efforts have created new opportunities for peace, but stressed the immediate need to defeat Hamas in Gaza and secure the release of all hostages before a different future can be realized for the region.</p>

          <p>United Airlines has announced it will be the first major U.S. airline to resume flights to Tel Aviv, Israel, starting July 21, following a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. The airline, which had halted services last month, cited its longstanding commitment to the route and stated the decision was made after a detailed operational assessment and consultation with pilot and flight attendant unions. While this move signals a step towards normalizing travel in the region, the U.S. State Department continues to maintain a "Reconsider Travel" advisory for Israel due to the unpredictable security situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to lift a lower court's injunction against a new Florida immigration law, keeping it blocked for the time being. The law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, makes it a misdemeanor for an undocumented person to enter the state. A federal judge had previously halted its enforcement, ruling it was likely unconstitutional, a decision an appeals court upheld. The Supreme Court's denial of Florida's emergency request means the law will remain on hold as the legal challenge against it continues to move through the court system.</p>

          <p>Pop star Olivia Rodrigo is being praised as "the dreamiest boss of all time" after it was revealed she provided free and accessible therapy for her entire tour crew. Rhythm guitarist Daisy Spencer shared that the 22-year-old singer and her tour manager, Marty Hom, offered the mental health resource throughout the 102-date "Guts" world tour. Rodrigo, whose father is a therapist, has been open about her own positive experiences with therapy, and this initiative follows a trend of musicians like Lewis Capaldi and Ariana Grande promoting mental health support.</p>

          <p>Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic has secured his place in the Wimbledon semi-finals after a challenging four-set victory over Italy's Flavio Cobolli. The win marks Djokovic's 14th semi-final appearance at the tournament, surpassing Roger Federer's all-time record. He will now face world number one Jannik Sinner, who defeated American Ben Shelton in straight sets despite concerns over an elbow injury. This sets up a highly anticipated rematch of their French Open semi-final, where Sinner was victorious, though Djokovic has won both of their previous encounters on grass at Wimbledon.</p>

          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting show that while most officials believe an interest rate cut will be appropriate this year, they are divided on the timing and extent of such reductions. The summary revealed a debate between concerns over potential inflation from tariffs and signs of a weakening labor market. Opinions ranged from some officials who felt no cuts were needed this year to a couple who suggested a cut could come as soon as July. This division highlights the central bank's cautious, data-dependent approach amid economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With a new law set to overhaul federal student loan programs, this article outlines ways for borrowers to make their payments more affordable before the changes take effect. Key strategies include enrolling in existing income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which cap payments based on income, before they are replaced with a stricter single option in 2026. Other recommendations include exploring temporary payment pauses like deferment for short-term hardship, looking into employer or state-based repayment assistance programs, and setting up autopay to receive a small interest rate discount from servicers.

          <p>In an effort to win back budget-conscious consumers, McDonald's is refreshing its menu by bringing back the popular Snack Wrap and introducing new spicy breakfast sandwiches. The Snack Wrap, which was discontinued in 2016, returns on July 10 after a long-running social media campaign by fans demanding its revival. This move comes as the fast-food giant faces declining same-store sales and reduced traffic from low-income customers, prompting a renewed focus on value offerings and popular, easy-to-prepare items to drive business in an inflationary environment.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club has increased its price target for Honeywell from $235 to $255 per share, citing an improving comeback story for the industrial conglomerate. The positive outlook is attributed to the company's ongoing push to simplify its business, make strategic acquisitions, and a belief that it is positioned for strong earnings momentum. Analysts noted that Honeywell's initially conservative 2025 guidance set the stage for potential quarterly earnings beats and guidance raises, a prediction that proved correct in the first quarter, bolstering confidence in the stock's future performance.

          <p>The new HBO documentary "My Mom Jayne," directed by her daughter, actor Mariska Hargitay, offers a reassessment of Hollywood star Jayne Mansfield's legacy. The film challenges the common perception of Mansfield as merely a copy of Marilyn Monroe, instead portraying her as a talented and intelligent woman with serious acting ambitions. It explores how she strategically navigated the restrictive 1950s studio system, using her bombshell persona as a means to an end, even as it ultimately typecast her and prevented her from achieving the dramatic roles she desired.</p>

          <p>The Volkswagen Group announced a 47% increase in the sale of its electric vehicles in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year, with 465,000 units sold globally. The German auto giant saw a particularly strong performance in Europe, where EV sales surged by nearly 90%. However, the company faced regional challenges, with expected declines in North America, partly due to U.S. tariffs, and a one-third drop in EV sales in China's highly competitive market. Overall global deliveries for the group saw a slight increase of 1.3%.</p>

          <p>An earthquake swarm has been detected at Mount Rainier in Washington, marking the most significant seismic activity at the volcano since 2009. The U.S. Geological Survey reported that hundreds of small earthquakes have occurred since early Tuesday, though they are too small to be felt at the surface and are not expected to cause any damage. Scientists believe the swarm, which is likely to continue for several days, is not connected to recent warm temperatures but is probably caused by the movement of water within the earth's crust above the volcano's magma chamber.</p>

          <p>This analytical article explores the dynamic between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, suggesting their relationship is a partnership of mutual convenience. Trump is driven by a desire for a significant foreign policy achievement, such as a Gaza ceasefire, which he believes could lead to a Nobel Peace Prize. Netanyahu, in turn, requires indispensable U.S. support for Israel's security, especially in countering Iran. This codependence creates a complex situation where Netanyahu must balance giving Trump a political win while pursuing his own narrow security objectives for Israel.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analytical article investigates the reasons asylum seekers choose to come to the UK, challenging the French government's claim that the UK's informal economy is a primary draw. The piece notes that research indicates the UK's 'black market' is actually smaller than France's, and access to legal work is more restrictive. Instead, factors like the ability to speak English, the presence of family and community ties, and a general perception, often promoted by smugglers, that the UK is a good and fair place to live appear to be more significant drivers.</p>
