          <p>Support for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet has risen to 37% due to support for revising the government's rice production policy. A Kyodo News survey showed that 88.5% of respondents support revising the farming policy to boost rice production amid record-high prices and shortages. While 56.9% see the government's response to rising rice prices as insufficient, 36.6% said it was sufficient. The support increase comes ahead of the House of Councillors election.</p>
