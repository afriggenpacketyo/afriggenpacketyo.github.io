The city, which previously hosted the event in 1967 and 2015, won the bid over Innsbruck. This decision follows Austria's victory in the 2025 contest, where singer JJ's performance of "Wasted Love" secured the country the hosting rights. The announcement was made by ÖRF, Austria's public broadcaster, marking a celebrated return of the massive musical extravaganza to Vienna. The event is anticipated to draw significant international attention and tourism to the city.</p>

          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart saw its shares surge by 10% following the announcement of a nearly 400% increase in net profit for the first half of 2025. The company's revenue more than tripled, driven by the immense global popularity of its Labubu dolls, a line of sharp-toothed, big-eared characters that have become a cultural phenomenon. This financial success is largely attributed to strong overseas demand, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region and the Americas. Despite the impressive growth, some analysts express caution about the long-term sustainability of the brand's popularity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.K.'s Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sector is experiencing a significant wave of mergers and acquisitions, driven by the perception that many of these publicly traded property companies are undervalued. Private equity firms and larger trade buyers are actively acquiring smaller REITs, often at a discount to their net asset value. This trend is leading to consolidation and the creation of larger, more specialized landlords in areas like healthcare, logistics, and student housing. The activity suggests that investors are rewarding scale and focus, raising questions about the future of smaller REITs and traditional property giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As students await their GCSE results, the practice of offering rewards like cash, gifts, or even cars for good grades is being debated by parents, students, and experts. While some parents believe financial incentives provide motivation for studying, others feel that hard work should be its own reward. Psychologists suggest that rewarding effort rather than specific grades can be a more sustainable strategy, as it avoids making achievements feel purely transactional. Experts also caution that such rewards can create pressure and tension, advising that parental praise and involvement are ultimately more powerful motivators for long-term educational success.</p>

          <p>A woman who lost her ability to speak 25 years ago due to motor neurone disease (MND) has had her voice miraculously recreated using artificial intelligence. Sarah Ezekiel, who communicates using eye-gaze technology, was able to have her voice cloned from just eight seconds of distorted audio found on a 1990s family VHS tape. A technology company used advanced AI tools to isolate and reconstruct her voice, giving her back a personal and emotional means of communication. The experience has been deeply moving for her and her children, who had only ever known her to speak through a generic, robotic synthesizer.</p>

          <p>China adjusted the launch trajectory of its historic Chang’e-6 mission to the far side of the moon to prevent rocket debris from landing in maritime areas claimed by the Philippines. According to a paper from the mission's design team, engineers delayed the release of the Long March-5 rocket's nose cone by several seconds. This fine-tuning shifted the debris drop zone further into the Philippine Sea, away from what the paper described as "sensitive maritime areas." The adjustment reflects China's response to evolving territorial claims and new domestic regulations from neighboring countries, demonstrating the geopolitical complexities of space exploration.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Alex Call delivered the best performance of his career in an 11-4 victory over the Colorado Rockies. Call recorded a career-high four hits, including a double and a 453-foot home run, which stands as the longest by a Dodger this season. He scored three runs and drove in two, falling just a triple short of hitting for the cycle. The offensive outburst helped Call break out of a slump since being traded from Washington, providing a much-needed boost for both the player and his new team as they continue their push for the postseason.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming military parade on September 3 will feature new "combat-oriented joint formations," according to a military official. These groups will be organized by operational domains, including land combat, maritime combat, air defense, information warfare, and strategic strike capabilities. The parade is expected to last 70 minutes and will include flyovers of advanced aircraft in modular formations. Officials have indicated that many of the weapon systems on display will be "star" items, with some being shown to the public for the very first time, signaling a focus on integrated, modern warfare capabilities.</p>

          <p>Guangdong, a major economic hub in southern China, has unveiled a comprehensive plan to become a leader in the country's commercial space sector. The provincial government announced it will provide significant financial and policy support to companies developing low-orbit satellite constellations. The three-year plan aims to foster applications in advanced industries such as space mining, space tourism, telecommunications, and logistics. By offering government procurement, funding for research, and a fast-track approval process, Guangdong seeks to compete with other major Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai in the rapidly growing space economy.</p>

          <p>India and China have agreed to advance talks on their long-standing border dispute and take steps to improve trade relations, signaling a potential warming of ties. The two nations will form an "expert group" to explore an "early harvest" approach to delimitation, focusing first on less contentious sectors. This diplomatic shift comes as both Asian powers face increasing tariff pressure from the United States under the Trump administration. Analysts suggest that while deep mistrust remains, the shared challenge from Washington provides an opportunity for Beijing and New Delhi to demonstrate that they can push back and pursue other strategic options.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume its flight schedule after reaching a tentative agreement with the union representing over 10,000 of its flight attendants, ending a strike that began on Saturday. The labor dispute over pay and scheduling had grounded hundreds of flights and affected more than 500,000 passengers. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) announced the deal, calling it a "historic fight" that achieves "transformational change" for workers, including an end to unpaid work during boarding. While flights are beginning to resume, the airline noted it may take several days to restore full service.</p>
