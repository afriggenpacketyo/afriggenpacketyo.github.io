          <p>An advice columnist, Sigal Samuel, addresses a reader's dilemma about ethical non-monogamy in their marriage. The reader is not interested in exploring non-monogamy, while her husband is attracted to a colleague and hopes she will change her mind. Samuel advises the reader to clearly state her needs and boundaries, drawing on philosopher Erich Fromm's ideas about love and freedom. She suggests the couple work on strengthening their emotional connection and communication before considering opening up the relationship, and recommends the book "Polysecure" for guidance on building healthy non-monogamous relationships. The article is about the ethical considerations and practical steps in navigating the complexities of non-monogamy within a marriage. </p>

          <p>This article explores the history of golf's presence in the White House, focusing on how different presidents have approached the game and its intersection with their duties. Donald Trump's active golfing and use of the course for business contrast with predecessors like William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson, who preferred to separate official duties from leisure. The article also discusses how public perception of presidential golfing has evolved, from Teddy Roosevelt's concerns about appearing unserious to Dwight Eisenhower's frequent play and the criticisms George W. Bush faced during the Iraq War. The article provides insight into the personalities and leadership styles of various presidents through the lens of their golfing habits. </p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to hire skilled workers fast enough. The average age of aircraft mechanics is high, and the industry faces a shortage of 25,000 technicians by 2028. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the issue, leading to buyouts and layoffs of experienced workers. Airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger people to the field with competitive salaries and on-the-job training. </p>
