          <p>Starbucks is considering selling a stake in its China business as growth in the region stalls due to macroeconomic pressures and increased competition from domestic players like Luckin Coffee and Cotti Coffee. The coffee chain has contacted private equity firms and technology companies to gauge interest in the potential deal, which could value the assets at several billion dollars. Starbucks currently operates over 7,750 stores in China, generating significant revenue, but faces stiff competition in the rapidly evolving Chinese market.</p>

While the company's net loss widened due to stock-based compensation costs, CoreWeave provided optimistic guidance for future revenue and capital expenditures. CEO Mike Intrator emphasized that the increased spending reflects new client uptake and infrastructure demand, and the company does not foresee meaningful impact from President Trump's tariffs.</p>
