          <p>Following deadly floods in Central Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell is urging the Trump administration to invest in modernizing the nation's weather forecasting infrastructure, arguing it will save both lives and money. In a letter, she outlined bipartisan recommendations, including upgrading Doppler radar, replacing old satellites, and improving supercomputing capabilities for more accurate predictions. This plea comes as the administration plans significant budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which could terminate key research programs aimed at improving flood and storm warnings.</p>

          <p>Lynsi Snyder, the billionaire owner of the iconic In-N-Out Burger chain, has announced she is moving out of California, citing difficulties in raising a family and conducting business in the state. This move aligns with the company's eastward expansion, including a new corporate office planned for Tennessee by 2026. For over 75 years, In-N-Out has been a symbol of California culture, but this decision reflects a broader trend of corporations and wealthy individuals leaving the state due to its regulatory and economic climate. Snyder stated the bulk of stores will remain in California for now.</p>

          <p>Crowds of Tesla enthusiasts gathered in Hollywood for the anticipated opening of the company's futuristic, saucer-shaped diner, a project Elon Musk has planned since 2018. The restaurant complex is set to feature supercharging stations for electric vehicles and two drive-in movie screens, blending a retro aesthetic with high-tech elements. Despite social media speculation about a public opening on Monday, the diner remained closed to the general public, having only hosted a private soft opening for first responders and a Tesla club over the weekend. Musk has suggested more such diners could be established globally if this one is successful.</p>

          <p>An EF1 tornado struck a home in Clark County, Ohio, tearing off a significant portion of the roof while the family was inside. The homeowner, Steve Agee, reported hearing a loud noise and seeing a trampoline fly through the air before he and his wife took shelter in the basement. They emerged to find their roof missing and damage to several rooms, but were relieved that no one was injured. The family, who had never experienced a tornado in their 13 years in the home, expressed surprise and gratitude for the quick outpouring of community support.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has confirmed the withdrawal of all 700 active-duty U.S. Marines who were deployed to Los Angeles over a month ago by the Trump administration. The troops were sent to the city, against the objections of local and state leaders, to protect federal property during protests against immigration enforcement sweeps. A Pentagon spokesperson stated the deployment had achieved its aim of restoring order, calling their presence instrumental in upholding the rule of law. California officials had previously condemned the deployment as unnecessary and provocative, with the state's attorney general threatening legal action.</p>

          <p>Argentina's government has announced it will ease visa requirements for Chinese nationals, a significant foreign policy shift by President Javier Milei's administration. Under the new policy, Chinese citizens holding valid U.S. or European Union visas will no longer need a separate Argentine visa for tourism or business. This move is seen as an overture to Beijing and comes at a time of delayed trade talks with the United States. The policy change highlights Argentina's delicate diplomatic position as it navigates its relationships with both global superpowers, which have been competing for influence in Latin America.</p>

          <p>WNBA players used the platform of their All-Star Game to advocate for better compensation, wearing warm-up shirts with the message "Pay us what you owe us." The protest follows stalled negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement, with players seeking a more equitable revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and improved benefits. Players currently receive just over 9% of league revenue, compared to the roughly 50% split in the NBA. The demonstration highlights the players' frustration as they aim to secure a larger share of the WNBA's rapidly growing revenue and viewership.</p>

This forecast comes as Coinbase, which was recently added to the S&P 500, launched perpetual futures trading in the U.S. The company's stock has performed strongly, hitting an all-time high on the same day a major crypto-related bill was signed into law.

          <p>For homeowners needing $20,000, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) offer lower interest rates than personal loans or credit cards. As of July 2025, the average rates for both products are nearly identical, with a HELOC at 8.27% and a home equity loan at 8.28%, resulting in almost the same monthly payment. However, a key difference is that home equity loan rates are fixed, while HELOC rates are variable and can change with market conditions. Homeowners must consider their risk tolerance for potential rate increases when choosing between the two options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are offering unusually high interest rates, making them an attractive option for parking a sum like $20,000. Before investing, savers should consider that while short-term CDs provide protection against market fluctuations, long-term CDs may yield more total interest over time despite having slightly lower rates. Furthermore, the most competitive CD rates are typically offered by online banks, which may require moving funds from a traditional brick-and-mortar institution. It is important to weigh these factors to make an informed decision. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The late investor Charlie Munger, former vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, held a famously blunt view on homeownership, once stating he didn't care if single people ever bought a house. At a 1998 shareholder meeting, he advised that the time to buy a house is simply "when you need one," which for a married person, he joked, is "when your wife wants one." This perspective contrasted with Warren Buffett's capital allocation approach, focusing instead on practical utility. Munger's advice, which suggests homeownership is a lifestyle choice rather than a default milestone, resonates today amid a challenging housing market. (not investment advice)</p>
