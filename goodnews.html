          <p>Intel announced better-than-expected third-quarter revenue, indicating a recovery in demand for its x86 processors for PCs, leading to a 6% stock jump. The company also detailed significant investments from the U.S. government, now its top shareholder, and Nvidia, aiming to integrate CPUs with AI graphics processors. Despite a per-share loss due to accounting for government shares and a slight decline in data center CPU sales, Intel expects demand to outpace supply into next year. The article highlights Intel's strategic moves to revive growth and advance its foundry business, including starting production of advanced chips in Arizona.

          <p>Meta is laying off an unspecified number of employees in its risk organization as it transitions to using artificial intelligence to automate FTC-mandated privacy compliance reviews. This move is part of broader company restructurings, including recent cuts in its Superintelligence Labs AI unit. The risk organization, formed after a $5 billion FTC fine related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, is tasked with ensuring regulatory compliance. A Meta spokesperson clarified that the revamped system uses basic automation to apply rules, reducing human error and speeding up processes, rather than advanced generative AI. This strategic shift aims to innovate faster while maintaining high compliance standards, despite the job reductions.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor exceeded third-quarter earnings expectations but reduced its 2025 guidance, citing a $1.5 billion to $2 billion impact from a supplier fire disrupting production of profitable trucks and SUVs. The company plans to mitigate these costs by significantly increasing U.S. pickup truck production and adding 1,000 workers by early next year. CEO Jim Farley stated intensive efforts are underway to restore supplies and production, with the impacted plant section expected to restart by early December. The article also notes that changes by the Trump administration to tariffs reduced Ford's expected tariff costs by $1 billion, partially offsetting the fire's financial blow. Ford's strategic plan, Ford+, continues to aim for cost reductions and improved efficiency.</p>

          <p>Target is eliminating 1,800 corporate positions, approximately 8% of its headquarters workforce, as part of an 'enterprise acceleration' effort to simplify operations and boost growth. This marks the retailer's first major layoff round in a decade, following four years of stagnant sales and a significant drop in stock value since late 2021. Incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke stated the cuts are a 'necessary step' to reduce complexity, speed up decisions, and strengthen Target's retail leadership. Affected employees will receive pay and benefits until January 3rd, along with severance packages. The article emphasizes that store and supply chain roles are not impacted by these changes. This strategic move aims to position the company for future success.</p>

          <p>The price of gold recently experienced a significant 6% drop, prompting questions about whether it's a good time to buy, particularly from retailers like Costco. The article suggests that purchasing gold during price dips is generally a wise strategy, as such declines are often temporary, and many investors have seen substantial gains from earlier purchases. Costco offers a convenient and vetted option for physical bullion, potentially simplifying the process compared to other vendors. While gold investing companies provide broader options like IRAs and ETFs, buying physical gold from a trusted retailer can be a straightforward entry point for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have dropped to an average of 8.11%, nearing their lowest point since 2023, making them a more attractive borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards. This article suggests homeowners consider applying now, as significant further rate reductions from anticipated Federal Reserve cuts may be minimal, and rates could potentially tick upward again. Locking in a rate now provides stability, with the option to refinance if rates drop substantially later. Homeowners must, however, approach this strategically due to the home serving as collateral.

          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll indicates mixed opinions among California voters regarding potential 2028 presidential runs by Governor Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris. While Newsom enjoys a positive overall approval rating as governor and stronger support for a presidential bid among Democrats and independents, Harris garners less enthusiasm, even after winning her home state in 2024. The article highlights that Californians believe their state sets a good example in technology, culture, and environmental policy, but performs poorly in housing, tax, and economic policies. This nuanced view reflects voter concerns about the cost of living and skepticism towards both major parties. The poll suggests the 2026 gubernatorial race is still taking shape, with many voters undecided.</p>

Quantum firms, which have minimal revenue and are burning cash to develop technology not yet commercially scalable, are actively engaging with the U.S. government for funding opportunities. The article highlights the U.S. government's view of quantum computing as critical for national security and staying ahead of China, even as hyperscalers like Google and IBM make significant breakthroughs.

          <p>An article decodes common, often confounding, toddler behaviors like constantly saying 'no,' claiming everything as 'mine,' and resisting activity transitions. Pediatric psychologists and early childhood educators explain that these actions are developmentally appropriate, serving to build a child's sense of self and independence. For instance, a toddler's 'no' can be an assertion of newfound self-awareness. Experts offer practical parenting tips, such as modeling calm responses, offering positive choices, and teaching problem-solving instead of solely focusing on prohibitions. The article emphasizes that understanding the 'why' behind these behaviors helps parents respond strategically, fostering social and emotional learning rather than power struggles. This provides valuable guidance for navigating the challenges of toddlerhood.</p>
