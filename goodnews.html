          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized the critical need to develop a unified domestic market to gain an advantage in international competition and achieve national development goals. In an article published in Qiushi, the Communist Party's theoretical journal, Xi outlined six key tasks, prioritizing measures to combat excessive competition. He urged industry associations to guide companies toward improving product quality over price and to oppose low-quality goods, echoing discussions from a July Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission meeting. This strategy aims to strengthen China's internal economic resilience.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite extensive flooding and heavy rainfall impacting Indian farmlands, analysts predict that the overall effect on India's inflation for fiscal year 2026 will not exceed the central bank's 4% target. Although consumer inflation briefly rose to 2.1% in August due to increased food prices, limited impact on cereal production and ample stocks are expected to keep food inflation in check. Experts also anticipate that a forthcoming cut in goods and services tax will further mitigate inflationary pressures, potentially allowing the Reserve Bank of India to ease rates.

          <p>The United States and China have reportedly agreed on a "framework" deal concerning the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations, potentially paving the way for American control. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the agreement during trade talks in Madrid, with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to finalize it on Friday. This development comes ahead of a looming September 17 deadline for TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. business or face a ban due to national security concerns. The deal is seen as a significant step in broader US-China trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has hired Mike Liberatore, previously the finance chief at Elon Musk's xAI, as its new business finance officer, tasked with managing the AI startup's substantial infrastructure spending. Liberatore's appointment intensifies the ongoing rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Musk, who co-founded OpenAI before their public falling out. This move follows OpenAI's recent restructuring into a for-profit entity, valued at $500 billion, and its $300 billion compute deal with Oracle, further cementing its position in the competitive AI landscape. The company aims to bolster its financial operations amidst rapid expansion.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are contemplating using two-way star Shohei Ohtani as a relief pitcher in certain playoff scenarios, despite plans for him to primarily start. President of baseball operations Andrew Friedman confirmed Ohtani would be a starter but acknowledged the unpredictable nature of October baseball, citing past examples of starters transitioning to relief. The potential move presents logistical challenges, including Ohtani's batting order spot and MLB's two-way rules, which currently limit his ability to remain a designated hitter after pitching in relief.
