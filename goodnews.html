          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for 53 years. While experts are unsure of the exact re-entry location, the spacecraft's protective heat shield increases the likelihood that parts of it will survive the descent. The article provides estimates of the re-entry time and notes that if any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington, D.C., shortly before documents related to Adams' abandoned federal corruption case were released. While the stated purpose was to discuss city priorities, Trump suggested Adams came to thank him for past support. The released documents revealed that the F.B.I. investigated Adams for witness tampering, though he was never charged. The Justice Department's decision to drop the case against Adams led to resignations within the department, with critics suggesting a political bargain was struck.</p>

          <p>President Trump signaled a potential shift in trade policy by suggesting that the U.S. may be open to lowering tariffs on China to 80%. This announcement comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators in Switzerland for the first publicly announced meeting since the trade war began. The article notes that Wall Street investors are anticipating a resolution to the trade war, which has caused market volatility.

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual statewide quarantine on mussels that aren't commercially harvested, due to the risk of naturally occurring toxins. The quarantine, which runs through Oct. 31, warns against eating sport-harvested mussels off the West Coast because they may contain paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. The article explains why these toxins occur this time of year and notes that commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine. Symptoms of paralytic shellfish poisoning include tingling of the lips and tongue, loss of balance, and muscular paralysis.</p>
