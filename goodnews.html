          <p>The article discusses Justice Jackson's role in shaping the debate around diversity, equity, and inclusion (D.E.I.) in American institutions. The Supreme Court unanimously decided a case, Ames v. Ohio, where a heterosexual woman claimed she was discriminated against based on her sexual orientation. The court addressed the question of how much the law should treat a person as an individual versus a member of a group, focusing on the need to end malicious discrimination while considering assistance to targeted groups. The case underscores the complexities of balancing individual rights and systemic inequalities.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the top five reasons couples fight, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. Contempt, often expressed through tone, is a significant predictor of divorce. Arguments about family often reflect unmet needs, while those about chores stem from an uneven distribution of labor. Ineffective communication can escalate conflicts, and the psychologist recommends strategies like naming the effect, reassuring one another, and using a designated time-out phrase to navigate these common issues.</p>
