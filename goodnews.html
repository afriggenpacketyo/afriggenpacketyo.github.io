          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new vocational "V-levels" for 16-year-olds in England, aiming to simplify the current qualification landscape by replacing Level 3 BTecs and other technical courses. This initiative seeks to boost vocational training, with a target for two-thirds of young people to pursue university or technical qualifications. An alternative qualification will also be introduced to reduce the number of students resitting GCSE maths and English. The article notes concerns from the Sixth Form Colleges Association that V-levels may not adequately fill the gap left by BTecs, despite the government's efforts to streamline options and increase investment in further education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nottingham Forest is in advanced discussions to appoint Sean Dyche, the former Everton and Burnley manager, as their new head coach, with a deal anticipated to conclude swiftly. This move follows the swift dismissal of Ange Postecoglou, whose 39-day tenure became the shortest permanent managerial reign in Premier League history. Forest, currently struggling at 18th in the table with only one win in eight league games, is desperately seeking stability and a turnaround in form. Dyche, known for his pragmatic approach and experience in top-flight football, has emerged as the clear frontrunner after positive talks, overcoming initial interest in other candidates like Roberto Mancini and Marco Silva.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay showcased remarkable tactical adaptability, leading his team to a 35-7 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars despite star receiver Puka Nacua's absence. Historically favoring 11 personnel, McVay unexpectedly leaned heavily into 13 personnel (one running back, three tight ends, one receiver), running 24 plays from this grouping after only eight all season. Quarterback Matthew Stafford capitalized, throwing five touchdowns with under 200 yards, a rare feat. This strategic shift highlights McVay's coaching prowess and signals a potent, adaptable Rams offense heading into their bye week, making them a formidable opponent.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech firm Akeso experienced a significant boost in its Hong Kong-listed shares following the presentation of promising trial data for its cancer drug, ivonescimab, at a European medical symposium and its publication in The Lancet. The article emphasizes the drug's innovative combination of PD-1/VEGF strategies, designed to achieve a more potent and lasting anti-tumor response while demonstrating lower toxicity and no discontinuation. Industry analysts have lauded ivonescimab as a highly differentiated asset, potentially positioning it several years ahead of its competitors in the market. Despite this initial positive market reaction, Akeso's shares later saw a decline amidst a broader sell-off in Chinese biotech stocks, reflecting inherent market volatility even with groundbreaking medical advancements.

          <p>A new book, "The Land of Sweet Forever," compiles newly discovered short stories and essays by Harper Lee, written before "To Kill A Mockingbird." Her family describes these "apprentice stories" as revealing "a brilliant writer in the making," showcasing the evolution of her craft. The article notes familiar elements for fans, including early versions of characters and settings like Maycomb, Alabama. While some language and attitudes in the 1957 story "The Cat's Meow" are acknowledged as uncomfortable through a modern lens, reflecting the era's segregation, her family asserts the stories' continuing relevance to modern race relations.</p>

The article highlights that housebuilding is "flatlining" at 200,000 homes annually, far short of the 300,000 needed, due to cumbersome planning processes, environmental regulations, and skill shortages. Reed insists government reforms, including mandating local plans within 30 months and empowering him to review rejected schemes, will enable success. Proposed "grey belt" reforms aim to ease building on low-quality green belt land, but local authorities retain discretion.</p>
