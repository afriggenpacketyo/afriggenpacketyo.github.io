          <p>King Charles III is visiting Canada to highlight the country's sovereignty in light of suggestions from former President Trump about potential annexation by the United States. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited King Charles to deliver the speech from the throne, outlining the government's agenda. The visit underscores Canada's distinct identity as a constitutional monarchy within the British Commonwealth. While Canadians generally show indifference to the monarchy, Carney aims to emphasize the differences between Canada and the United States, asserting Canada's independent status.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced a delay in the implementation of 50 percent tariffs on imports from the European Union until July 9. The decision is intended to provide more time for trade negotiations between the U.S. and the EU. Trump had previously threatened to impose the tariffs on June 1, expressing frustration over the slow pace of negotiations. The delay follows discussions with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who requested additional time to reach a trade agreement. This move reflects the ongoing tensions and complexities in U.S.-EU trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

The government aims to reduce prices to around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. The new approach involves releasing approximately 300,000 tons of rice directly to major retailers, bypassing the auction system. The agriculture ministry has also established a special response team to address the issue of high rice prices.</p>
