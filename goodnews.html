          <h2>UK Airspace Design Service Aims to Reduce Flight Delays and Emissions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 04:31:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. The changes, the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s, will allow planes to climb and descend more smoothly, reducing aviation's climate change impact. The government says UKADS will be fully operational by the end of this year, which comes after there were about 2.7 million flights in UK airspace last year. Aviation Minister Mike Kane says modernizing airspace is one of the simplest ways to help reduce pollution from flying and will set the industry up for a long-term, sustainable future.</p>

          <p>Princess Catherine Hilda Duleep Singh, a British-born Sikh princess, defied social norms by living openly in a same-sex relationship in 1900s Germany and resisting Nazi Germany. She used her resources and influence to help Jewish individuals and families escape persecution, providing financial support and guaranteeing immigration documents. She hosted Jewish refugees in her home and advocated for those interned as "enemy aliens." Her story is now being recognized, with a Kensington Palace exhibition planned to focus on her and her sisters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "The Family Dynamic" by Susan Dominus, explores how sibling relationships and birth order influence a person‚Äôs life trajectory. Studies suggest eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests due to increased parental attention. Sibling influence can be powerful, with individuals often spurred to achieve success in different fields by what their siblings are doing. Siblings act as vivid mirrors, reflecting both positive and negative traits, which can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself, as well as a sense of being wholly known for best and worst traits.</p>

          <p>Germany's former foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has been nominated to become the new president of the United Nations General Assembly for a one-year term starting in September. While primarily ceremonial, the role involves organizing plenary sessions and is considered a stepping stone for future positions. Baerbock's nomination has sparked some internal grievance as Germany had initially planned to nominate diplomat Helga Schmid for the post. During her tenure as foreign minister, Baerbock was known for her commitment to a "value-based foreign policy" and her outspokenness on human rights and democratic freedoms.</p>

The profitability of the aviation industry is expected to improve in 2025, despite global gross domestic product growth being forecast to drop. The IATA said revenue, operating profits and net profits of the industry are expected to increase from 2024, mainly due to lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. The industry's net profit margin is also forecast to rise to 3.7% in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>
