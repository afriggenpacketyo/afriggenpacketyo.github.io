        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The umpire involved in a significant electronic line-calling error at Wimbledon, Nico Helwerth, was not on the duty roster the following day, with tournament officials stating he was having a scheduled "rest day." The controversy occurred when the ball-tracking system failed during a key point, and Helwerth opted to replay the point instead of making an overrule, a decision that drew criticism. The All England Club defended the umpire, stating he followed the established protocols correctly. The incident has reignited debate about the role of human officials and their authority in an era of increasing technological reliance in sports.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students at Johns Hopkins University has designed and built a specialized printer to create braille labels for a Maryland brewery. The invention was developed at the request of Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which needed a machine capable of embossing braille onto plastic beer labels that commercial printers couldn't handle. The student-designed printer features open hardware, allowing BISM's blind and low-vision employees to operate it by touch. The device will be used for an annual fundraiser, streamlining a previously manual process and showcasing a practical application of inclusive design.</p>

          <p>Doris Garcia, a 96-year-old Coloradan, has finally had a close encounter with penguins, 70 years after she was barred from a research trip to Antarctica solely because she was a woman. In the 1950s, Garcia was working for the US government in Argentina and was set to join the expedition before being told she could not go. Her lifelong dream was fulfilled this week at the Denver Zoo, in an event arranged by Compassionate Hospice. The story highlights the historical barriers faced by women in science while celebrating a moment of long-awaited personal joy and recognition.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 09:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Effective apologies from leaders require taking full responsibility, showing genuine empathy, and outlining a clear plan for corrective action, according to communication experts. The article notes that timing is critical; leaders should acknowledge a situation quickly but follow up with a thoughtful, well-planned response. Apologies that sound rehearsed, lack emotion, or use passive language can erode trust and harm morale. Ultimately, whether addressing a major tragedy or a minor workplace issue, the most effective apologies are human, vulnerable, and demonstrate that the leader cares and has a path forward.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) currently present a valuable opportunity for savers, with top accounts offering interest rates that outpace the current rate of inflation. While national average yields for one- to five-year CDs range from 1.70% to 2.01%, online banks are providing much more competitive rates, with some short-term CDs exceeding 4.40% APY. Experts note that the market is experiencing an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs often have higher rates than long-term ones. To secure the best returns, savers are advised to compare offers, particularly from online financial institutions that have lower overhead costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix continues to lure acclaimed directors like Greta Gerwig, Rian Johnson, and Martin Scorsese away from traditional studios, despite its limited commitment to theatrical releases. The streaming giant accomplishes this by offering two key incentives: significant financial backing for projects that other studios deem too expensive or risky, and extensive creative freedom. This strategy has made Netflix a haven for auteurs and has consistently placed its films in contention for major awards. By prioritizing its 300 million subscribers and saving on massive marketing budgets for theatrical runs, the company has built a successful model that challenges the conventions of Hollywood.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. The proposed amendment to the Employment Rights Bill, championed by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, aims to give grieving parents time away from work without needing to use sick leave. This change is being hailed by campaigners, including MP Sarah Owen and musician Myleene Klass, as a huge step forward in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a true bereavement.</p>

He was sentenced to a year in prison for having a consensual relationship with a 17-year-old girl while on holiday, as the age of consent in the UAE is 18. The case was reported by the girl's mother and drew attention from the campaign group Detained in Dubai, which advocated for his release. The case serves as a warning to tourists about the strict laws in the UAE and the potential for severe consequences for behavior not considered criminal in their home countries.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have honored 96-year-old designer Janet Bennett by installing a new tile wall in their clubhouse inspired by her iconic, yet long-uncredited, mosaic murals at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Completed in 1961, the colorful airport murals have been a symbol of Los Angeles for generations, but official credit was often given to Bennett's male boss. While LAX has not officially corrected the record, the Dodgers have placed a sign explicitly crediting Bennett's work as the inspiration for their own. The gesture provides public recognition for Bennett's contribution to the city's artistic heritage six decades later.</p>

The city of Nagasaki reversed an earlier decision and accepted Taiwan's request to attend its August 9 ceremony, after initially stating the island did not meet the criteria for an invitation. This diplomatic development is significant as it provides Taiwan a presence at a solemn international event. The move is likely to be closely watched by Beijing, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province and opposes its participation in international forums as a sovereign entity.</p>
