          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons, along with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen and substantially enlarge Alcatraz prison. Trump stated this action is necessary to combat "vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders" plaguing America. The reopened Alcatraz would serve as a symbol of law, order, and justice, according to Trump. The original Alcatraz closed in 1963 and is now a tourist site. Trump has previously clashed with courts over sending alleged gang members to a prison in El Salvador.</p>

          <p>The offshore yuan has strengthened to a six-month high, breaking past the 7.2 level against the US dollar, fueled by optimism regarding a potential thaw in trade relations between the United States and China. This shift in market sentiment is driven by expectations that the two countries may soon begin negotiations to roll back tariffs. President Trump indicated a willingness to lower tariffs against China in a recent interview, adding to the positive momentum. Despite this, uncertainties remain, and global investors are awaiting tangible signs of China's ability to withstand Washington's challenges before increasing their investments.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese scientists argue that "Shi‚Äôs Star Catalogue" is the world's oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years to around 335 BC. The researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming the observations' approximate years. If verified, this would predate the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece, which is currently recognized as the oldest known record of the stars. Experts believe that detailed astronomical studies began around the same time in both China and Greece.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Australian government has pledged to defend its film industry in response to President Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on film productions made outside the US. Trump cited a "National Security threat" due to foreign incentives drawing filmmakers away from America. Australia, known as "Hollywood Down Under," offers a 30% rebate for big-budget film projects, but these incentives may no longer be attractive enough with the tariffs. The Screen Producers Australia (SPA) expressed concern over the potential global impact of Trump's move.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the pivotal battle that sealed the defeat of Nazi Germany, Berlin still bears visible scars of the war. Despite decades of restoration and modernization, remnants of the past, such as bullet-riddled facades and gaps in rows of houses, remain. The Battle of Berlin in 1945 reduced much of the city to rubble, but the infrastructure was repaired relatively quickly. The city's division during the Cold War and subsequent reunification have shaped its identity, with preserved graffiti left by Soviet troops serving as a reminder of the war's end.</p>

The decline in Japan's donations was attributed to the yen's depreciation and the tapering off of projects that had been suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members also decreased in 2024, primarily due to reduced contributions to international organizations and aid for Ukraine.</p>
