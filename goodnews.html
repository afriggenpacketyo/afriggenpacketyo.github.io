          <p>Wales is launching a pilot program to offer significantly reduced bus fares, with £1 single tickets and £3 day passes for individuals aged 16-21, later extending to 5-15 year olds. This initiative, backed by £15 million from the Welsh government, aims to enhance young people's access to education, training, employment, and leisure opportunities. Transport for Wales has already received over 10,000 applications, indicating strong public interest. While seen as an "attractive proposition" for encouraging public transport use, an independent watchdog notes that young people's satisfaction with bus fare value in Wales is currently lower than in other UK regions. This program represents a concerted effort to foster sustainable travel habits among the younger demographic.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, urging member states to enhance artificial intelligence cooperation while explicitly rejecting a "Cold War mentality." The summit, the largest to date, included leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with China positioning itself as a global peacemaker amidst ongoing international tensions. Xi highlighted China's significant investments in SCO countries and pledged support for vocational education programs. The meeting aims to foster high-quality development and cooperation, with analysts suggesting improved relations with India could bolster Beijing's influence and challenge the narrative of China as a global troublemaker.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with a private survey indicating the fastest expansion in five months, driven by a recovery in new orders and export business. The RatingDog manufacturing PMI reached 50.5, surpassing Reuters' estimates and rebounding from July's contraction. This improvement was partly fueled by resilient external demand, despite tariffs, though domestic demand showed less significant improvement. While overall business confidence rose, employment in the manufacturing sector remained challenging, with job reductions continuing for a fifth consecutive month. Experts caution that the durability of this upturn depends on sustained export stability and a stronger pickup in domestic demand.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court Judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's attempt to deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came after immigrant advocacy groups sought an emergency injunction, citing reports of children being placed on planes for repatriation to Guatemala, where lawyers argued they faced risks of abuse and persecution. While the Guatemalan President and U.S. Justice Department claimed the action was for family reunification, advocacy groups disputed this in some cases, arguing it violated federal laws designed to protect unaccompanied minors. The order will remain in place for 14 days, preventing further removals without proper legal process.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met, with the engagement "turbocharged" by recent US tariffs on Indian imports, pushing India to seek new opportunities. This meeting, occurring after a seven-year hiatus in Modi's visits to China, signals India's policy of "strategic autonomy" amidst strained US-India ties. Key takeaways include a resumption of direct flights and simpler visa processes, though significant roadblocks like border disputes and India's burgeoning trade deficit with China remain. The article notes that how India navigates its relationships with China and the US will shape its geopolitical standing in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Despite current US-China tensions, China continues to revere the American Volunteer Group (AVG), known as the "Flying Tigers," who were American mercenary pilots and support personnel that aided China against Japan during World War II. The AVG, credited with destroying nearly 500 Japanese planes, formed a crucial bond with China, a contribution still remembered and celebrated. The article highlights that relatives of the Flying Tigers' founder are among the few Americans invited to China's upcoming military parade commemorating the end of WWII. This historical connection serves as a reminder of past cooperation between the two nations, even as their contemporary relationship faces challenges.</p>

          <p>European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen has disclosed that Europe is actively formulating "pretty precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine, intended to serve as post-conflict security guarantees. This prospective force, potentially comprising tens of thousands of troops, would receive critical assistance, including intelligence and surveillance assets, from the United States, with President Trump reportedly affirming American support. Concurrently, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has underscored Germany's preparedness for a protracted war in Ukraine, rejecting any notion of a swift resolution that would compromise Ukraine's independence. These developments signal a serious, long-term commitment from European and US leaders to Ukraine's future stability.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott reacted to the surprising trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, stating he wasn't entirely surprised due to the "personal" turn in negotiations between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. Parsons, who becomes the NFL's highest-paid non-quarterback with a $188 million deal, was traded for two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark. Prescott expressed relief that a solution was reached, preventing ongoing distractions for the team. He conveyed "good luck" to Parsons, acknowledging the significant impact this move will have on the Cowboys' roster and their upcoming season.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that Australia can implement its social media ban for under-16s using various technologies, but all methods carry risks and shortcomings. The ban, set for December, requires platforms to prevent and deactivate accounts for children under 16, aiming to mitigate harmful social media impacts. While popular with parents, experts raise concerns about data privacy and age verification accuracy. The study evaluated methods like identity document verification, parental approval, and facial assessment, finding technical feasibility but no universally effective solution. Communications Minister Anika Wells urged tech companies to combine methods, emphasizing their responsibility to use data and technology for child safety.</p>

          <p>A new book about the Royal Family reveals that Queen Camilla was the victim of an attempted sexual assault as a teenager, an incident she reportedly recounted to Boris Johnson in 2008. The article states that at age 16 or 17, on a train to Paddington Station, Camilla fought off her attacker using the heel of her shoe, following advice from her mother. She subsequently reported the incident, leading to the man's arrest. Buckingham Palace has not officially commented but is not disputing the account. This revelation contextualizes Queen Camilla's extensive public work supporting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, emphasizing the importance of destigmatizing such experiences.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong-listed shares experienced a substantial jump of almost 19% following the company's better-than-expected net income for the June quarter. This positive financial performance was largely propelled by accelerated sales within its cloud-computing unit and a continued revival of its core e-commerce business. Despite overall revenue slightly missing analyst estimates, net income increased significantly, partly attributed to gains from equity investments and the disposal of a Turkish e-commerce firm. The article emphasizes the robust growth in Alibaba's cloud division, which saw a 26% year-on-year revenue increase, driven by strong AI demand and aggressive investments in artificial intelligence and new e-commerce models.</p>
