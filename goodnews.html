          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from enforcing a stop-work order against an offshore wind farm being developed by Danish company Orsted. The Revolution Wind project, located off the coast of New England and nearly complete, can now resume construction. The judge ruled that Orsted was likely to succeed in its lawsuit, which argued the administration's order was unlawful and arbitrary. This decision represents a significant setback for the administration's stated goal of shutting down the U.S. offshore wind industry.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing via a home equity loan has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. This article provides a numerical breakdown, showing that a $100,000 loan with a 15-year term now has an approximate monthly payment of $974, a modest decrease from earlier in the year. The piece advises homeowners to weigh the stability of a fixed-rate loan against a variable-rate HELOC, which could benefit from potential future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>
