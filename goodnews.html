          <p>Target's CEO, Brian Cornell, cautioned about the potential for significant cost increases due to tariffs, indicating that raising prices would be a last resort. The company reported a sales decline in its recent quarter, attributing it to consumer anxieties about tariffs and a boycott related to adjustments in their diversity, equity, and inclusion policy. Cornell expressed concerns about declining consumer confidence and uncertainty regarding the impact of tariffs on consumers. While a recent U.S.-China trade agreement eased some tariffs, others remain in place, and Target anticipates continued top-line pressures in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lowe's has upheld its full-year forecast, driven by increased sales among home professionals, which offset slower demand from do-it-yourself customers. The home improvement retailer slightly missed quarterly sales expectations but exceeded earnings estimates, leading to a rise in shares. CEO Marvin Ellison credited investments in stores, technology, and customer service for navigating near-term uncertainties and housing market headwinds. Despite sluggish home improvement demand due to high interest rates, Lowe's anticipates a sales rebound this year, with full-year sales projected to range from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion.</p>

          <p>Half of U.S. states now have laws banning or regulating cellphone use in schools, reflecting a growing consensus that phones are detrimental to children's well-being and academic performance. Florida was the first state to pass such a law in 2023, and since then, many others have followed suit, with 16 states acting this year alone. While some states mandate school-day bans, others require districts to set their own policies, and there are exceptions for medical needs and special education plans. The trend is driven by concerns about academic distractions, mental health, and social development, though some parents and students have voiced opposition.</p>

However, the lack of certain smartphone features, like maps and music, presented challenges, and the author ultimately returned to her iPhone after a shorter period than planned due to travel logistics.
