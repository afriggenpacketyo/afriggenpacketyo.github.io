          <p>The UK government has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. This commitment includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas like resilience and security. The move aims to satisfy calls from the US for increased allied spending while providing EU countries with flexibility. Critics argue that the announcement lacks immediate funding, given current geopolitical threats, but the government defends the long-term strategy as vital for economic and national security. The commitment demonstrates a proactive approach to evolving global challenges.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski released a memoir documenting her years as a politically moderate politician who often stood up to President Donald Trump. She acknowledges the impact of Trump's dominance on rightwing politics and the intensity surrounding the security of democracy. Murkowski believes that Congress needs to ensure the executive is kept in check and fulfill its constitutional duties. She highlights upcoming votes on a war powers resolution and a White House proposal to slash foreign aid funds as opportunities for oversight.</p>
