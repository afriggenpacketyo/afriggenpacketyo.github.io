          <p>Chelsea has emerged as the frontrunner to sign striker Liam Delap from Ipswich, after their relegation triggered a ¬£30 million release clause, due to Champions League football, Cole Palmer, and the Premier League's youngest squad. Manchester United, Everton, Nottingham Forest, and Newcastle also expressed interest, but Chelsea's Champions League qualification proved decisive. Delap was granted permission to speak with interested clubs and was spotted at Stansted Airport before undergoing a medical examination. Chelsea's co-owner Behdad Eghbali met with Delap's agent, and head coach Enzo Maresca directly pitched to the player.</p>

          <p>India's economy exhibited robust growth, expanding at an annual rate of 7.4% in the March quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts amidst global economic uncertainties. This growth marks the strongest quarterly performance in the fiscal year 2025, with the overall economy expanding by 6.5% for the full fiscal year. Strong domestic consumption and lower dependence on exports have helped to cushion the impact of trade policies. The White House has been resorting to protectionist trade policies to address trade imbalances, and India ran a nearly $46 billion surplus with the U.S. in 2024.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. is set to become the first major automaker to offer racing karts, aiming to inspire a new generation of auto enthusiasts. The company plans to develop and sell karts at about a quarter of the current market price to make them affordable for families with children interested in motor sports. This initiative hopes to spark greater interest in automotive careers by providing easier access to motor sports for children, with the goal of inspiring future drivers, engineers, and mechanics. Currently, racing karts in Japan retail for about 1.5 million yen ($10,400), posing a significant barrier to wider popularity.</p>

          <p>American retail giants are reportedly demanding that their Chinese suppliers shoulder 50% to 66% of the cost of US import duties, as the US-China trade war intensifies pressure on businesses' bottom lines. These demands come after US retailers initially agreed to bear the full cost of the tariffs when asking Chinese suppliers to resume shipments in late April. Negotiations are ongoing, and the details of how tariff costs will be divided are not yet finalized as both sides navigate a challenging time for the industry. The negotiations involve suppliers in both China and parts of Southeast Asia who serve companies including Walmart, Target, Nike, Puma, and Adidas.</p>

Joe Walsh, the first person living with Alzheimer's to receive the treatment, has shown a decrease in brain inflammation, according to researchers. The experimental treatment is part of a larger effort to find new ways to interrupt the cascade of events in the brain that lead to Alzheimer's dementia. While it remains unclear if the decrease in inflammation will improve Walsh's thinking and memory, his wife has observed positive signs in his engagement with social activities.</p>

Lagarde emphasized that the euro could earn greater global influence through a solid geopolitical foundation, a reinforced economic base, and a bolstered legal framework. A euro with raised reserve currency status would bring benefits to Europe, including lower borrowing costs, insulation from exchange rate volatility, and protection from sanctions. Market watchers are divided on the euro's potential to seize some of the dollar's share of global FX holdings, with some seeing upside for the euro as investors diversify away from the greenback (not investment advice).</p>

Firefighters have made significant progress since the fires broke out around May 12, although air quality alerts remain in effect in the Arrowhead region due to smoke. The U.S. Forest Service believes the Jenkins Creek Fire was human-caused, while the Camp House Road Fire has destroyed over 150 structures, and the Munger Shaw Fire is nearly 100% contained. The Horse River Fire, located in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, is being fueled by thick duff and dead balsam fir trees, complicating containment efforts.</p>

          <p>A neuroscientist challenges the conventional understanding of animal instincts, arguing that the term is often misused and oversimplified. He advocates for the phrase "species-typical behavior" to describe behaviors common to a species, without presuming their origin or control. The neuroscientist emphasizes that behaviors grow up in bodies under environmental experiences and explicit learning, which shape them. He uses examples such as tailorbirds sewing nests and border collies herding to illustrate the complex interplay of genetics, environment, and learning in shaping animal behavior.</p>
