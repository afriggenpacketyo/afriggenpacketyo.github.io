          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in its third-quarter vehicle deliveries, reaching 497,099 units and surpassing analyst expectations. This growth was partly driven by U.S. buyers rushing to take advantage of a federal EV tax credit before its expiration. However, the company faced challenges, including a sales slump in Europe due to increased competition and consumer reaction to CEO Elon Musk's political rhetoric. Tesla also reported significant growth in its energy storage division, deploying 12.5 GWh of its battery products during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, for $9.7 billion in cash. This marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and utilizes a portion of its substantial cash reserves, which total $344 billion. Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO believes will stabilize the company's finances and allow it to resume its stock buyback program. The deal deepens the existing financial relationship between the two companies, as Berkshire already holds a significant stake in Occidental.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese Vice-Premier Cheng Li-chun has firmly stated that Taiwan will not agree to a proposal from Washington to evenly split semiconductor production between the two countries. She clarified that Taiwan's negotiators have never committed to such a '50-50' division and are instead focused on a strategic partnership model. This model emphasizes supply-chain cooperation and preferential tariffs while allowing Taiwanese tech firms to maintain their primary operations at home. The goal is to support the industry's expansion abroad without conceding domestic production capacity, securing key support from the U.S. on regulations and logistics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New analysis of data from the Cassini space probe reveals that the hidden ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus contains complex organic molecules, strengthening the case for its potential habitability. Scientists examined ice particles ejected from geysers on the moon's south pole, which were collected directly by the spacecraft. These particles confirm the presence of compounds that are precursors to amino acids, the building blocks of life. While this discovery enhances the likelihood that Enceladus could support life, researchers emphasize that being habitable is different from being inhabited, and further missions are needed for confirmation.</p>

          <p>German chess player Matthias Blübaum has become the first from his country in 35 years to qualify for the prestigious World Championship Candidates Tournament after placing second at the FIDE Grand Swiss. His success highlights a recent upswing in German men's chess, with top-ranked player Vincent Keymer also having a chance to qualify. However, the article notes a significant gap in performance and support for German women's chess compared to leading nations like India and China. Experts suggest that while Germany has strong individual talent, it lacks the depth and systematic promotion seen in India's chess programs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners seeking affordable borrowing options, home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) present viable choices with interest rates currently lower than those for personal loans or credit cards. As of early October, average rates for 10-year home equity loans are around 8.34%, while HELOCs average 7.88%. The article explains the key differences between these two products: fixed-rate lump sums for home equity loans versus variable-rate revolving credit for HELOCs. Both options may offer tax benefits if used for eligible home renovations. (not investment advice)</p>

It also emphasizes the importance of comparing offers from multiple lenders to secure the most favorable terms. A potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could provide some relief for borrowers in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a record number of foreign visitors, the practice of tipping remains a cultural taboo in Japan, often causing confusion or awkwardness for service staff. In Japanese culture, excellent service is considered a standard part of the job, not something that requires an additional payment. While a few establishments in tourist-heavy areas have introduced tip jars, the concept is widely resisted by locals who believe employees should earn a sufficient wage without needing gratuities. Many restaurant owners report that staff will often chase down customers who leave cash on the table, assuming it was forgotten.</p>

          <p>Speculation is growing that China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, is preparing to officially enter service after it was photographed berthed next to the country's second carrier, the Shandong, at a naval base in Sanya. The Fujian, which features advanced electromagnetic catapults for launching aircraft, recently completed sea trials off the coast of Hainan. Its deployment to the southern naval base marks a significant step in its development. The side-by-side positioning of the two carriers suggests the People's Liberation Army Navy is advancing its carrier operations and power projection capabilities.</p>
