          <p>President Trump's recent announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria took senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise, creating confusion regarding the specifics and timeline of the rollback. The announcement lacked clarity on which measures would be affected, prompting discussions within Treasury to determine the scope and pace of implementation. Despite the surprise, Treasury officials affirmed their commitment to executing the president's vision for peace and stability in the Middle East, with Secretary Scott Bessent aware of and involved in the decision-making process.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates is expanding its economic and strategic presence in Africa, filling the void as the United States and China reduce their investments and aid. Emirati corporations are investing heavily in key sectors such as ports, renewable energy, and critical minerals, with announced deals dwarfing those of other countries since 2019. This push is part of a broader strategy to diversify the UAE's economy away from fossil fuels and increase its influence over global supply chains, while the US reduces its involvement in the region.</p>

He argues that the museum strikes a balance between acknowledging tragedy and celebrating triumph, offering a complex and nuanced portrayal of the Black experience in America.</p>

Kim's ability to get on base has significantly boosted Shohei Ohtani's RBI numbers, and his speed has influenced how opponents pitch to Ohtani, making him a valuable asset to the team's success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Walmart, urging the company to absorb the costs of tariffs on imported goods rather than raising prices for consumers. This response follows Walmart's warning that prices on various products could increase due to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The president insisted that Walmart, which made billions in profits last year, should prioritize its customers by "eating the tariffs." A spokesperson for Walmart stated the company is committed to keeping prices as low as possible, given the constraints of small retail margins.</p>
