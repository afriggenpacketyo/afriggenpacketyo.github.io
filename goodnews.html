        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor is aiming to increase sales of its F-150 pickup truck by offering promotional financing to consumers with subprime credit scores, typically below 620. This strategy provides lower interest rates to riskier borrowers in an effort to boost affordability and reduce inventory levels amid high average vehicle prices. Ford Credit stated that these promotions do not alter its fundamental credit decisions and that it only finances customers it believes are creditworthy. The move is being closely watched as truck sales are often seen as an indicator of economic health for small businesses and skilled labor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to a series of deaths and injuries, the New York City Police Department is utilizing drones to detect and prevent "subway surfing." The program, initiated in 2022, allows officers to spot individuals riding on top of trains and intervene at the next station, having already saved over 200 people. This initiative was partly inspired by the death of 15-year-old Zackery Nazario, whose mother is now suing social media companies, alleging their platforms popularized the dangerous trend. One of the drones even carries an image of Zackery to honor his memory and serve as a reminder of the initiative's purpose.</p>

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a proposal to remove the $25,000 minimum equity requirement for pattern day traders, a rule that has been in place since 2001. The change, which awaits SEC approval, will make active day trading more accessible to retail investors with smaller accounts. Instead of a fixed equity minimum, the new regulation will base intraday buying power on the margin requirements of the positions taken during the day. This overhaul reflects the significant technological and market access changes that have transformed retail trading over the past two decades. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Rate Cut Lowers Monthly Payments on a $250,000 Mortgage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 14:22:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, average 30-year mortgage rates have dropped to a three-year low of 6.13%, offering financial relief to homebuyers. For a $250,000 mortgage, this new rate translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $1,520, which is about $150 less per month compared to rates seen earlier in the year. This reduction not only makes homeownership more affordable on a monthly basis but also results in significant long-term savings, potentially over $54,000 in total interest over the life of the loan. The article highlights that this favorable rate environment has spurred an increase in mortgage applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Former Eagles Center Jason Kelce Criticizes NFL's Expanded Jersey Number Rules</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recently retired Philadelphia Eagles star Jason Kelce has voiced his dislike for the NFL's updated jersey number rules, which allow more positions to wear a wider range of numbers. Speaking on his "New Heights" podcast, Kelce expressed frustration that the changes have diluted the tradition of a player's number signifying their position. He specifically mentioned seeing defensive linemen wear single-digit numbers, stating he prefers when "big body" players wear "big" numbers. The rule changes, implemented in 2021, were intended to give players more flexibility but have been met with criticism from traditionalists like Kelce.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying leucovorin, a generic drug derived from folic acid, as a potential treatment for speech issues in some children with autism. The theory suggests that the drug helps bypass a blockage that prevents folate from reaching the brain, a condition known as cerebral folate deficiency, which may be present in a high percentage of children with autism. One family reported their nonverbal son began speaking just days after starting the off-label treatment. While preliminary studies are positive, researchers emphasize the need for larger clinical trials to confirm its efficacy and secure FDA approval, a process hampered by the drug's low cost.</p>

          <p>The first asylum seekers, a family of three, have arrived in the United Kingdom as part of the new "one in, one out" pilot scheme with France. Under this agreement, for every migrant returned to France who crossed the Channel illegally, the UK will accept one refugee with a valid protection claim who has not made the crossing. This arrival follows the removal of four migrants from the UK to France under the same program. The government hopes the plan will deter illegal crossings and disrupt human smuggling networks, though it has faced criticism from opposition parties and rights groups for its limited scope.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN, President Trump posted on social media that he believes Ukraine is in a position to "fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form." This marks a significant pivot from his previous stance, where he suggested Kyiv would need to cede territory for peace. Trump's new position appears to endorse continued support from European and NATO allies to help Ukraine restore its original borders. Zelenskyy praised the meeting as "productive" and called Trump's apparent shift a "game changer," though some Ukrainian politicians remain cautiously optimistic about the change.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates near a three-year low following a Federal Reserve rate cut, prospective homebuyers are advised to approach the market with caution. Experts suggest buyers should first determine the actual interest rate they qualify for based on their credit, as it may differ from advertised averages. It is also important to explore alternatives for securing a lower rate, such as buying mortgage points or considering an adjustable-rate mortgage. Finally, buyers must weigh the risk of waiting for rates to fall further against the possibility that they could rise again, as has happened in the recent past. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Honda has confirmed it will stop producing the Acura ZDX electric vehicle, which was being built in partnership with General Motors at a plant in Tennessee. The decision to end production of the 2026 model year vehicle is attributed to shifting market conditions and a desire to align its portfolio with customer needs. While the ZDX is being discontinued, Honda will continue its collaboration with GM on another EV, the Honda Prologue, which is assembled in Mexico. Honda plans to launch a new all-electric Acura RSX in 2026, which will be produced at its own EV facility in Ohio.</p>

          <p>For homeowners considering an $80,000 home equity loan, recent interest rate cuts have made borrowing slightly more affordable. Currently, a 15-year loan at an average rate of 8.31% would result in a monthly payment of approximately $779, a modest decrease from the nearly $789 payment seen earlier in the year. The article notes that while the savings are not dramatic, they still represent a more favorable borrowing climate compared to previous months. Homeowners are advised to carefully calculate their potential costs and compare them with other options, as home equity loans offer the predictability of a fixed interest rate.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit against The Hershey Company that claimed its Halloween-themed Reese's candies were deceptively packaged. The plaintiffs argued that the candies lacked the detailed spooky faces, such as carved eyes and mouths on pumpkins, that were depicted on the wrappers. However, the judge ruled that the consumers failed to demonstrate economic harm, stating that while they may have been disappointed, the products were not worthless. The ruling concluded that the plaintiffs' claims were based on subjective expectations of how the chocolates should have looked, not a concrete financial injury.</p>

While human candidates typically spend around 1,000 hours studying, advanced AI like Gemini 2.5 Pro can pass mock exams in minutes. The study, from NYU and GoodFin, highlights the rapid evolution of AI's analytical reasoning capabilities, which previously struggled with the exam's final level. Despite this technological leap, experts believe AI will not replace human financial analysts, as it still lacks the ability to understand human context.</p>
