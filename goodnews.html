          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" remained at the top of the North American box office, earning $40 million in its second weekend. However, this represents a steep 66% decline from its strong debut, a more significant drop than other recent Marvel films. The film's global total has reached $369 million. Following behind were two new comedy releases, "The Bad Guys 2" which opened with $22 million, and "The Naked Gun" which earned $17 million. Analysts note that while the summer box office started strong, its overall success will depend on the sustained performance of upcoming releases.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, rattling parts of the New York City metropolitan area. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake, which prompted brief shaking and confusion among residents but caused no significant damage or injuries. The event follows a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the region in April 2024. Officials and seismologists noted that while such events are uncommon on the East Coast, a quake of this magnitude is not considered significant and is not a cause for major alarm.</p>

          <p>Florida has surprisingly surpassed California in the addition of new utility-scale solar capacity, driven largely by major utilities like Florida Power & Light. This growth is attributed to favorable economics, as solar becomes cheaper than natural gas, and a state rule that fast-tracks the approval of solar projects under 75 megawatts. However, the future of this boom faces challenges, including the federal rollback of solar tax credits, which is expected to significantly reduce rooftop solar installations. The state must also address emerging grid constraints to maintain its momentum in renewable energy development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government has announced new plans to combat illegal immigration by targeting people smugglers who use social media to advertise their services. Under the proposal, individuals facilitating illegal crossings of the English Channel online could face up to five years in prison. This move aims to give law enforcement more tools to dismantle criminal gangs that promote dangerous journeys. The plan comes as the UK faces increasing pressure to address the "small boats" crisis, with a record number of migrants making the perilous crossing this year.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on strategic base running and timely hitting rather than power to score their runs. After struggling offensively for much of the series, the Dodgers manufactured runs through aggressive base-running, a key double-steal, and a sacrifice fly. Starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the shutout. The victory allowed the Dodgers to conclude their nine-game road trip with a winning 5-4 record, providing some positive momentum despite ongoing concerns about their slumping lineup.</p>

Lacking traditional political backgrounds, they are running for offices ranging from the U.S. House to state attorney general, citing the dismantling of DOJ divisions as their reason for leaving and entering the political arena.</p>
