          <p>A 13-year-old Glasgow student, Rebecca Young, has been named one of Time magazine's 'Girls of the Year' for inventing a solar-powered blanket designed to help homeless individuals stay warm. Her idea, developed in a school engineering club, uses solar panels to charge a battery pack during the day, which then provides heat at night. Engineering firm Thales produced a working prototype, with 35 units distributed by Homeless Project Scotland, demonstrating a practical solution to a pressing social issue.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals struggling with high-interest debt, two primary relief strategies are debt forgiveness and debt management, each with distinct benefits and drawbacks. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to pay back less than the full amount owed, which can provide significant savings but severely damages credit scores and may have tax implications. In contrast, debt management involves creating a structured repayment plan with lower interest rates, which helps preserve credit but requires repaying the debt in full over several years. The best choice depends on an individual's specific financial situation and long-term goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council has reversed its decision to introduce higher fees for wider burial plots following significant public criticism, with opponents labeling the proposal a 'fat tax.' The council had initially planned a 20% surcharge, citing increased demand for larger graves due to rising obesity rates in the area. However, after backlash from residents and funeral directors who called the move discriminatory and unfair, the local authority announced it would not proceed with the plans.</p>

          <p>Aviva's chief executive, Amanda Blanc, has firmly reiterated the insurance giant's commitment to its net zero climate goals, despite increasing political pushback against such initiatives in the U.S. and the U.K. Blanc highlighted that addressing climate change is a business imperative, directly linked to the rising frequency and cost of extreme weather events that the company insures against. This stance contrasts with several major financial firms that have recently withdrawn from climate alliances, indicating a divide in corporate environmental strategy.</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage in the United States has dropped to 6.58%, its lowest point since October of the previous year. This marks the fourth consecutive week of declining rates, providing some relief and increased purchasing power for potential homebuyers. The trend is attributed to a fall in the 10-year Treasury yield, which is influenced by growing speculation that the Federal Reserve may soon cut its benchmark interest rate to stimulate the economy.
