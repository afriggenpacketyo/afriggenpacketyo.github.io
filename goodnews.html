        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lending experts predict that U.S. housing affordability this fall will largely hinge on mortgage rate stability and housing inventory levels. While significant rate drops are not anticipated, stability is seen as beneficial for market confidence, allowing both buyers and sellers to plan more effectively. National inventory is rising, which could ease prices, but conditions vary significantly by local market, with some areas seeing bidding wars while others have ample supply. Overall, home prices are expected to see modest growth or slight declines, making it a complex environment for potential homebuyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brentford forward Yoane Wissa has returned to first-team training after constructive discussions with the club's head coach, Keith Andrews, following a period of strained relations. Despite rejoining the squad, the 28-year-old is still actively seeking a transfer to Newcastle, which would offer him Champions League football. Wissa had previously left Brentford's pre-season training camp and expressed his desire to leave the club. Sources indicate Brentford is open to a sale but values the player at a price significantly higher than Newcastle's current offer of £25 million plus add-ons.</p>

          <p>Elaine Castillo's new novel, "Moderation," delves into the life of a content moderator for a major tech company, exploring the psychological strain of her work and the ways technology is used to suppress difficult emotions.

The article praises the book for its sharp commentary on the tech industry and its poignant rendering of a character repressing grief and trauma.

          <p>A 250-kg unexploded British bomb from World War II was successfully defused in the German city of Dresden, necessitating a large-scale evacuation. Approximately 17,000 residents were ordered to leave their homes after the bomb was discovered during demolition work on the Carola Bridge. The evacuation zone included famous historical landmarks like the Frauenkirche and the Zwinger palace complex. The discovery of unexploded ordnance from the war is a regular occurrence in Germany, often leading to significant, but well-managed, public safety operations in major cities.</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are falling in certain U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant drops in median listing prices compared to their 2022 peaks, driven by rising housing inventory from new construction and homes staying on the market longer. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices due to tighter inventory and fewer new homes being built. This regional divergence creates a varied landscape for homebuyers, with more balanced conditions emerging in some areas while others remain highly competitive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is auctioning the Amadea, a 348-foot superyacht valued at over $300 million, which was seized from a sanctioned Russian billionaire three years ago. The vessel was impounded in Fiji in 2022 as part of the Justice Department's "Operation KleptoCapture," which targeted oligarchs following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Potential bidders must have a net worth of at least $500 million and place a $10 million deposit to participate in the September auction. A holding company tied to the yacht disputes its ownership, but the claim has been rejected by U.S. authorities.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 10:18:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising retirees on the difficult choice between selling their home or obtaining a reverse mortgage to supplement a fixed income in today's high-cost economy. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners to access their equity without a monthly payment, which can help cover rising living expenses, but it reduces the inheritance left to heirs. Selling the home provides a lump sum of cash and the opportunity to downsize but involves transaction costs and potential capital gains taxes. The best choice depends on individual circumstances, such as the desire to stay in the home versus relocating. (not investment advice)</p>
