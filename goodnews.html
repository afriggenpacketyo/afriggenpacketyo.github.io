          <p>As negotiations between Russia and Ukraine falter, the Trump administration is redirecting its diplomatic efforts toward the Middle East, seeking to broker deals in Gaza and with Iran. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced progress toward a temporary truce in Gaza, potentially leading to a peaceful resolution. The administration believes new terms for ensuring continued talks after an initial hostage release and ceasefire will appeal to both Israel and Hamas. Trump also revealed he advised Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu against striking Iranian nuclear facilities, citing progress in negotiations with Iran and the potential for a nuclear agreement. Optimism surrounds these developments, though challenges remain, especially with Hamas. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts ordered the Trump administration to lift a pause on various immigration applications, stating that it was not in the public interest for immigrants to lose their legal status. The ruling affects immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, and Ukraine, whose ability to remain and work in the U.S. was threatened. The judge found the government's actions arbitrary and capricious, violating federal administrative law. The ruling impacts programs relying on parole, allowing temporary admission on humanitarian grounds, and prevents the administration from halting parole extension requests. </p>

Salesforce also announced the acquisition of Informatica, aimed at strengthening its Data Cloud and AI strategy. While Salesforce's second-quarter revenue and earnings guidance came in above expectations, investors remain cautious due to the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>
