          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intent of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere after a rocket malfunction left it stranded in orbit for 53 years. Experts predict the re-entry will occur on Friday or Saturday, but the exact location remains unknown. The spacecraft, designed with a heat shield to survive Venus‚Äôs atmosphere, has a chance of partially surviving its descent to Earth, but the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low. If any pieces of the spacecraft are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington, D.C., as documents related to his abandoned federal corruption case were released. The stated purpose was to discuss city priorities, but Trump suggested Adams was there to thank him. The released documents revealed the F.B.I. investigated Adams for witness tampering, though he was never charged. The case was dismissed after a request from the Justice Department, raising concerns about a potential bargain in exchange for immigration policy concessions.</p>

          <p>President Trump signaled openness to lowering tariffs on China, suggesting an 80% tariff "seems right" ahead of meetings between U.S. and Chinese negotiators in Switzerland. This conciliatory tone comes amid a tense trade standoff, with the U.S. previously announcing tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, prompting retaliation from China. Investors are hoping for a resolution to the trade war, which has caused market volatility and price hikes for consumers. UBS analysts suggest tariffs may ultimately settle around 34%.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual statewide mussel quarantine, effective through October 31, warning against eating sport-harvested mussels due to naturally occurring toxins. The quarantine covers the California coastline from Oregon to the Mexican border, including all bays, inlets, and harbors in Los Angeles County. Mussels may contain paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins, which can be fatal if consumed. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt, as they are regularly tested for toxins.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a federal judge ordered her release on bail. Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked by the Trump administration, allegedly due to her pro-Palestinian activism. The judge criticized the government for lacking evidence against her, aside from an op-ed she co-wrote criticizing the university's response to resolutions about Israel. Ozturk's lawyers argued that she was being targeted for her protected speech, and the judge agreed that her detention chilled free speech.</p>
