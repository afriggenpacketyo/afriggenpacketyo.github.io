          <p>Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, the former president of Mongolia, is urging Japanese lawmakers to abolish the death penalty, despite significant public support for it in Japan. Elbegdorj successfully terminated capital punishment in Mongolia in 2017 and suggests that the Japanese government should provide more information about the death penalty to foster an open debate. He emphasizes that the death penalty goes against the spirit of democracy and respects human rights, while also pointing out the risk of executing wrongly convicted individuals. Elbegdorj highlights that abolishing the death penalty led to a decrease in violent crimes in Mongolia, and he believes Japan would have a better relationship with Mongolia if it abandoned the practice.</p>

          <p>Following two days of negotiations in London, U.S. and Chinese negotiators have agreed on a "framework" to move forward on trade talks. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that this framework aims to implement the Geneva consensus, and both U.S. and Chinese sides will now seek approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. This agreement comes after a period of escalating trade tensions, including disputes over visas, minerals, and microchips, which threatened to derail a fragile truce reached in Geneva last month. The Geneva agreement involved a 90-day suspension of tariffs imposed by both countries in an escalating trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A lawyer for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and later returned to the U.S., argues that his case is about protecting due process rights. Chris Newman, representing Abrego Garcia's family, asserts that the case is not solely about immigration but about defending constitutional protections for everyone. Abrego Garcia faces charges of human smuggling, and the Trump administration has accused him of MS-13 membership, which his family denies. Newman accuses the administration of defying court orders and disparaging Abrego Garcia, while the administration maintains it has complied with court orders by returning him to the U.S.</p>

The service will be geofenced, limiting its initial operational area, and employees will remotely monitor the fleet.
