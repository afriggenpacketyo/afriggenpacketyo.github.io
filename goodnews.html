          <h2>Japan Implements New Rice Sales System to Lower Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 23:53:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to combat rising prices, aiming to reduce them to approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This move bypasses the traditional auction system, allowing the government to have greater influence over prices by directly contracting with major retailers. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi emphasized the urgency to address public concerns about skyrocketing rice prices, which have doubled compared to the previous year due to a poor harvest. The government plans to sell rice produced in 2021 and 2022 at around 11,556 yen per 60 kg, covering transportation costs to regional areas, and is considering online sales for broader distribution. optimism score.</p>

The company's enhanced detection methods and stricter policies against incentivized reviews contributed to the increase in identified fake reviews. Tripadvisor employs a three-pronged approach involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to moderate submissions, with auto-detection rejecting 7% of submissions before posting and flagging another 5% for human review. The trust and safety team ultimately moderated over 4.2 million reviews, with paid reviews, often originating from Asia, being a smaller but more pernicious category of fakes. optimism score.</p>

          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner, suggests that China's annual GDP growth target should be lowered for the next five years to around 4%, considering potential rivalry with the United States and the need to address structural issues. This target is lower than some market estimates of around 4.5% annual growth from 2026-30, factoring in China‚Äôs shrinking population, falling savings, and other economic headwinds. Xu emphasized that expanding employment and controlling the debt ratio are critical, stating that a 4% GDP growth would be very good if these factors are managed effectively. China did not provide a quantitative growth target in its 2021-2025 development plan, but the market has largely estimated an annual expansion of at least 4.8% until 2035. (not investment advice)</p>
