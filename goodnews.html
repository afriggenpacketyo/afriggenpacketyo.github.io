          <p>The 18-year-old cold case of Jennifer Kesse, who vanished from her Orlando condo in 2006, is now an active investigation following the discovery of new DNA evidence. Her father, Drew Kesse, who has relentlessly pursued the case, was informed by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) that they have narrowed down persons of interest. The breakthrough is credited to the family's private investigation team and new technology, including AI enhancement of security footage showing Kesse's car being moved by an unidentified person.</p>

          <p>A recent study from the Africa Centre for Strategic Studies describes the military relationship between China and Tanzania as "very special" and unlike any other on the African continent. According to the research, Tanzania's military structure, including its inventory, doctrines, and order of battle, is heavily influenced by China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). This deep-seated connection is part of a broader trend of close ties between China and African nations governed by former liberation movement parties that have maintained power since independence.</p>

          <p>Whitewater rafting enthusiasts staged a unique protest by carrying a raft for 16 miles along a dewatered section of the Kern River in California. Their eight-hour trek was intended to highlight how water diversions for a Southern California Edison hydropower plant render this stretch of the river impassable for boating. As Edison seeks to renew its federal license for the plant, the protesters and local businesses are demanding that more water be left in the river to support recreation and the local economy.</p>

          <p>The Central Intelligence Agency and Hollywood share a long-standing, mutually influential relationship that goes beyond simple on-screen portrayals. The CIA actively recruits creative talent from the entertainment industry, valuing skills in storytelling, makeup, and illusion for espionage, and collaborates with productions to inspire a new generation of spies. This connection has historical roots, such as the "Argo" mission which involved a makeup artist, and continues today with the agency assisting on films and TV shows filmed at its Langley headquarters.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal made landfall early Sunday morning near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, with sustained winds of 50 mph. The storm, which had briefly strengthened to 60 mph winds before hitting the coast, is bringing heavy rainfall and the threat of flash flooding to the coastal Carolinas. Tropical storm warnings remain in effect for a portion of the coastline, and flood watches have been issued for areas including Myrtle Beach and Raleigh as the storm is expected to dump 2 to 4 inches of rain.</p>

          <p>As part of a massive national healthcare fraud enforcement action, four women from Pensacola, Florida, have been federally indicted for their alleged role in a scheme to forge prescriptions for controlled substances. The women, who worked at a local medical practice, are accused of using the clinic's system to illicitly obtain and resell over 330,000 opioid pills. This local case is part of a larger Department of Justice takedown that has charged 324 defendants nationwide in schemes totaling $14.6 billion in fraud against Medicare and other programs.</p>

          <p>Researchers from Peking University have developed a novel data sorting system that is faster and more energy-efficient, potentially overcoming a key bottleneck in AI and scientific computing. The system uses memristors, a type of electronic component with memory capabilities, to perform "sort-in-memory" operations, which reduces the data transfer limitations of traditional computer architecture. The team's hardware prototype demonstrated significant speed and efficiency improvements in tasks like route finding, offering a new path for advancing data-intensive applications.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a clinical trial, with some participants' hearing rapidly improving within weeks. The research, published in Nature Medicine, focused on individuals with hearing loss caused by a mutation in the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. All 10 participants, including children and adults, showed considerable hearing improvement, with one seven-year-old girl regaining nearly full hearing, offering hope for treating other genetic forms of deafness.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has demonstrated that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping "brain criticality," the crucial balance between excitement and inhibition in neural activity. This balance is known to be essential for the brain's information processing capabilities and overall cognitive function. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the research establishes a link between genetics, brain criticality, and cognitive abilities, positioning criticality as a biological phenotype that could help in understanding brain function and disorders.</p>

          <p>Chilean tennis player Nicolas Jarry is preparing to face Cameron Norrie in the fourth round of Wimbledon after what he describes as a "year of battles" with his health. Jarry has been suffering from vestibular neuritis, a condition affecting the inner ear nerve that causes severe vertigo and balance issues, leading to a drop in his world ranking. His emotional run at Wimbledon, his favorite tournament, marks a significant return to form and matches the achievement of his grandfather, who reached the same stage in 1974.</p>
