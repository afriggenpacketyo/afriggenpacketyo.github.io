        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average achieved a new record high, primarily boosted by Home Depot's stock performance, even though the retailer reported slightly weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue and earnings. Despite this, Home Depot reaffirmed its full-year outlook, with analysts highlighting strong month-by-month sales trends that suggest positive momentum for the third quarter. Concurrently, Nvidia is reportedly developing a new, more advanced AI processor specifically for the Chinese market, aiming to deliver samples as early as next month. This strategic move allows the Club chipmaker to navigate export restrictions while evaluating various products to compete within regulatory frameworks, potentially under a deal structure similar to its recent agreement with the Trump administration.

          <p>A California couple, Anteres Anderson Turner and Louis Turner, raising twin boys, successfully found a "surrogate grandmother" named Janet Firestein Daw through a Facebook group called Surrogate Grandparents USA. The Turners sought a "village" for their children, as their own parents were either geographically distant or deceased, leaving a void. Firestein Daw, who deeply longed for grandchildren, connected with the family and quickly became an integral part of their lives, affectionately known as "Nana J." This heartwarming and unconventional arrangement highlights a growing trend where families seek intergenerational connections, fostering a sense of completion and mutual fulfillment for all involved, demonstrating the power of community in modern life.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the earning potential of a substantial $150,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) account, noting that current interest rates, though slightly cooled from 2023-2024 peaks, still make them a compelling option for savers. CDs offer a secure and predictable way to earn interest, as they lock in rates for the entire term, providing a valuable hedge against stock market volatility. For a $150,000 deposit, potential earnings vary significantly by term, ranging from approximately $1,587 over three months to over $34,000 across a five-year commitment. The article highlights that while CDs won't yield the sky-high gains of riskier assets, they provide substantial, guaranteed returns coupled with peace of mind, making them an attractive choice for those seeking financial stability.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>S&P Global has maintained its AA+ rating on long-term U.S. sovereign debt, anticipating that "meaningful" federal government revenue from President Trump's broad tariff policies will largely counteract the weaker revenue projected from his recently enacted tax-and-spending bill. The credit rating agency warned, however, that the rating could be lowered if high deficits increase due to political inability to contain spending or manage revenue implications from tax code changes. S&P also cautioned that the rating could be pressured if political developments undermine U.S. institutions or the Federal Reserve's independence, potentially jeopardizing the dollar's status as the world's leading reserve currency.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly changing the work of teachers, with many educators, like 5th-grade teacher Jerome Ong, integrating AI tools into their weekly lessons. Ong not only uses AI to prepare for classes but also teaches students about its limitations, fostering critical thinking. Major tech companies, including Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic, are investing $23 million to train hundreds of thousands of American Federation of Teachers members on AI utilization. While proponents highlight time savings and enhanced learning, critics raise concerns about potential cheating and a self-reported decline in critical thinking skills when AI is used irresponsibly, advocating for better teacher support over tech alliances.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. government expects an equity stake in Intel in exchange for CHIPS Act funds, converting what was a grant under the Biden administration into equity for the Trump administration. This move, which has no voting or governance rights attached, aims to ensure the American taxpayer benefits from the investment in the struggling chipmaker. Lutnick suggested similar deals might be pursued with other CHIPS Act recipients like TSMC, emphasizing the administration's goal to boost domestic chip manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign companies. The policy reflects a shift from outright grants to a more ownership-oriented approach in supporting the semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

This diverse list includes current Fed governors, regional Fed presidents, economists, and Wall Street experts, signaling the Trump administration's urgency to fill the position despite current Chair Jerome Powell's term not ending until May 2026. Bessent reiterated the administration's strong desire for interest rate cuts, believing such easing would significantly help the struggling U.S. housing market by facilitating a pickup in home building. The upcoming interviews and Powell's final keynote address at Jackson Hole will be closely watched for signals on future monetary policy direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Air Canada has announced it will gradually resume operations after reaching a tentative agreement with the union representing 10,000 flight attendants, effectively ending a strike that severely disrupted travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers. The deal, brokered with the help of a mediator after the union had defied two previous return-to-work orders, addresses a major point of contention by guaranteeing flight attendants pay for work performed while planes are on the ground. While flights are set to restart Tuesday evening, the airline cautions that full restoration of regular service may require seven to ten days, urging customer patience. The resolution avoids further travel chaos during the peak summer season, although the airline still faces the complex task of stabilizing its schedule.</p>

          <p>The Powerball lottery jackpot has swelled to an estimated $643 million, marking the largest prize of the year, after no tickets matched all six numbers in Monday night's drawing. Although the grand prize went unclaimed, two fortunate Powerball players successfully won $1 million each by matching five numbers. The next opportunity to win the massive jackpot is scheduled for Wednesday night, with the odds of securing the top prize remaining a challenging 1 in 292 million. Despite these long odds, Americans collectively demonstrate a strong interest in lotteries, spending approximately $103 billion on tickets annually across the 45 participating states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>

Despite a "deferral mindset" among homeowners due to economic uncertainty, big-ticket transactions increased, and both pro and do-it-yourself segments saw growth.

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has taken emergency action to ban the sale of "designer Xanax," or bromazolam, by classifying it as a Schedule 1 controlled substance. This move empowers law enforcement to make arrests for selling or possessing the highly potent synthetic drug, which has been linked to nearly 50 overdose deaths in Kentucky last year. The action follows a coalition of 21 state attorneys general, led by Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, urging the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to impose a federal emergency ban. The drug, often passed off as prescription benzodiazepines, lacks quality controls and poses a growing public health threat, especially when combined with opioids.</p>

Trump stated he spoke with Putin, who "picked it up very happily," and aims for the two leaders to meet first, with Trump joining later to "wrap it up" if progress is made.

          <p>Apple has reportedly increased iPhone production at five factories in India, including new plants and facilities belonging to Tata Group and Foxconn Technology, as it prepares for the launch of its new iPhone 17 models. This expansion comes as India faces pressure from the White House due to its purchases of discounted Russian oil during the Ukraine war, leading to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accusing India of "profiteering." President Trump has already hiked tariffs on India to 50% and threatened further increases. Apple's shift to India aims to reduce reliance on China and aligns with its commitment to invest in U.S. manufacturing, potentially mitigating the impact of these tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
