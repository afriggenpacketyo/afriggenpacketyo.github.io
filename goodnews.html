          <p>President Trump announced at a U.S. Steel facility in Pennsylvania that the U.S. will double tariffs on steel imports to 50%. This announcement follows indications that Trump will approve a controversial merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. The deal involves Nippon investing $14 billion in U.S. Steel, with the headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh and the U.S. maintaining control, and this agreement includes a "golden share" for the U.S. government to ensure production levels are not cut, representing a national security agreement.

Trump praised Musk's contributions, describing them as a "colossal change" and the "most sweeping and consequential government reform program in generations."

          <p>Algerian Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif will be banned from World Boxing competitions until undergoing newly mandated genetic sex testing, according to World Boxing. The organization is introducing mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers, prompted in part by controversy surrounding Khelif after they won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics. Concerns arose from the boxer's potential participation in the upcoming Eindhoven Box Cup in June. The testing will involve a PCR genetic test to determine sex at birth and eligibility to compete, ensuring safety and competitive fairness for all athletes.</p>

          <p>China is expanding the use of AI in urban management, as demonstrated by Nanjing's drone patrols that target areas often overlooked by human patrols. This is part of a broader "smart cities" initiative aimed at improving urban governance and addressing challenges related to rapid urbanization. Despite progress, China faces challenges in AI governance, including privacy protection and limited community involvement. These challenges mirror those faced by governments worldwide as they increasingly adopt AI technologies.</p>

The Snowdonia course was technically challenging, involving traversing rugged terrain and steep ascents, and Case finished with a time of just over 16 hours and 53 minutes.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge showed price growth slowed in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% compared to a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March. Despite rising incomes, spending by Americans slowed, possibly reflecting caution in response to higher goods prices. The figures indicate inflation is declining from its post-pandemic peak, though economists warn that widespread tariffs could push prices higher. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the impact of tariffs on inflation and jobs, while a court ruling on the legality of Trump's tariffs adds uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

Reyes was involved in a dispute with another man who is currently in jail for allegedly physically assaulting him, and authorities are exploring whether the letter was sent to frame Reyes and get him deported.
