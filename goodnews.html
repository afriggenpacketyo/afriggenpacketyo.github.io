          <p>The family of U.S. Army Air Corps Staff Sgt. Michael Musashe, who went missing in action in 1944, has been reunited with his personal Zippo lighter. A relative discovered the lighter, inscribed with Musashe's name and hash marks for his 27 missions, in a Facebook post by a Swiss collector. After being contacted by U.S. officials, the collector graciously returned the artifact to the family. The airman's 95-year-old sister, who last saw her brother as a child, was able to hold the memento, fulfilling a long-held wish to have a piece of him home.</p>

          <p>A CNBC study has identified the best states for workers in 2025, considering factors like workforce education, STEM job concentration, training programs, and net migration of skilled labor. Texas claimed the top spot due to its large talent pool and high concentration of students in career-focused fields. Florida ranked second, praised for its success in attracting talent and effective worker training programs, while Georgia placed third for its leadership in career and vocational education. The report notes that while the nationwide labor shortage has eased, a skilled workforce remains a critical factor for business location decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a court ruling that blocked a new federal rule to automatically remove medical debt from credit reports, consumers must take personal action to address these financial burdens. This article outlines several effective strategies for individuals seeking to clear medical debt from their credit history. Key methods include disputing billing errors, negotiating a settlement with collection agencies, and applying for financial assistance or forgiveness programs offered by many healthcare providers. Additionally, consumers should verify that any medical collection under $500 has been removed, in accordance with credit bureau policies established in 2023.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, IMAX presents a compelling investment opportunity within the movie industry due to its unique and resilient business model. Unlike traditional theater chains, IMAX primarily sells or leases its high-end theater systems to operators and earns recurring revenue from maintenance. The company has demonstrated strong momentum, reporting its best-ever first quarter and securing agreements for numerous new systems globally. With a growing presence in international markets and partnerships with major studios and streamers for exclusive releases, IMAX appears well-positioned for continued growth.

          <p>Cryptocurrency markets experienced a rebound as investor optimism grew for the potential passage of key stablecoin legislation in the U.S. House this week. Bitcoin and ether both saw price increases, along with stocks for companies like Circle and Coinbase, after an initial dip when the bills failed to advance. President Trump indicated that several Republicans who initially blocked the legislation have since changed their position following a White House meeting. Analysts suggest the passage of these regulatory bills is a matter of when, not if, which could reduce market uncertainty and be a net positive for the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Model and actress Emily Ratajkowski is making her return to the screen in the new Netflix romantic comedy "Too Much," created by Lena Dunham. Ratajkowski had taken a step back from acting around 2020 to reassess her career and priorities, a period during which she fired her professional team and wrote a book. She explains that returning for this project felt right, particularly as it was her first time working with a female director and for a role Dunham wrote specifically for her. The series explores millennial life, with her character grappling with unfulfillment despite apparent success.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to a strong performance from its trading divisions. The bank's profit increased by 22% to $3.72 billion, with revenue climbing 15% to $14.58 billion. The equities trading desk was a standout, generating $4.3 billion in revenue, a 36% jump from the previous year. This performance reflects a broader Wall Street trend where market volatility, spurred by President Trump's tariff policies, has created a favorable environment for trading in bonds, currencies, and stocks.

          <p>President Donald Trump has revealed that First Lady Melania Trump has influenced his thinking on the war in Ukraine, leading to a wave of positive attention on Ukrainian social media. The president recounted how his wife would point out the contradiction of him having a "nice phone call" with Vladimir Putin shortly before Russia launched more missiles into Ukraine. This insight reportedly contributed to Trump setting a 50-day deadline for a ceasefire. Observers note that the first lady, who grew up in the former Yugoslavia, may have a unique perspective on the threat posed by Russia.</p>

          <p>In a significant reversal, Republican senators have amended a spending cut package to exempt the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) from budget reductions. The initial proposal sought to cut $400 million from the globally recognized HIV/Aids program, but bipartisan concern prompted lawmakers to protect its funding. The broader rescissions bill still targets $9 billion in cuts, primarily aimed at international aid and public broadcasting. The amendment was welcomed by global health advocates, who had warned that the original cuts posed a huge threat to the lives of people in lower-income countries.</p>
