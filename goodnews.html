          <p>Philadelphia District Attorney Lawrence Krasner, backed by George Soros, won his primary challenge against Judge Pat Dugan in a heavily Democratic city. However, Dugan might have a rematch against Krasner in November if he receives enough Republican write-in votes, giving Republicans an opportunity to potentially oust Krasner. Krasner, seeking a third term, has faced criticism for his progressive criminal justice policies and even impeachment proceedings. While homicides decreased in 2023, they previously spiked under his tenure, and he has ceased charges for certain offenses and sought more lenient sentences.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has suspended its bonus scheme for senior executives following public and governmental criticism that rewarding executives for failure is unacceptable. The scheme, potentially worth 50% of senior bosses' pay, was linked to securing a ¬£3bn rescue loan for the troubled company. The decision comes as the company faces scrutiny over sewage discharges, leaks, and a ¬£20bn debt pile. Thames Water will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with turnaround objectives and public expectations.</p>

          <p>A new test has been developed that dramatically reduces the time it takes to diagnose brain tumors, from weeks to just hours. This "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing has been hailed as a "game changer" by surgeons, potentially improving care and treatment for thousands of patients. The technique, developed by scientists at the University of Nottingham, has been successfully used in 50 operations, providing diagnoses while patients are still in surgery. Faster classification allows for quicker radiation or chemotherapy treatments and reduces patient anxiety.</p>
