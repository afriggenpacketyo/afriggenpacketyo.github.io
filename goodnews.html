          <p>Goldman Sachs and UBS have revised upwards their economic growth forecasts for China after signs of easing trade tensions with the United States. Goldman Sachs increased its GDP growth forecast to 4.6% from 4%, citing tariff reductions. UBS also raised its forecast to between 3.7% and 4%, depending on the scale of US tariffs and Beijing's policy stimulus. The analysts believe that a stronger yuan could offset tariff reductions, pointing to the strength of China's export sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The book, citing anonymous sources, suggests Biden's condition was so poor that aides considered putting him in a wheelchair. A spokesperson for Biden defended his effectiveness as president and said that evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity. The book also quotes a former campaign worker saying the Democratic party was negatively impacted by Biden's late exit from the race.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. The league is changing its policy on permanent ineligibility, saying bans will expire at death. Rose agreed to a permanent ban in 1989 for betting on baseball, while Jackson was implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame will now consider their eligibility, though voters are also instructed to consider a player's integrity and character.</p>

          <p>Three GPs offer their views on assisted dying as the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill is debated in Parliament. Dr. Abdul Farooq opposes it due to religious beliefs and concerns about end-of-life care resources. Dr. Susi Caesar supports it based on patient choice and her father's experience. Dr. Gurpreet Khaira is conflicted, balancing personal experiences with concerns about vulnerable patients. Each GP's opinion is shaped by their personal and professional experiences.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria after speaking to the Saudi crown prince, calling it an effort to ‚Äúgive them a chance at greatness.‚Äù The decision, which came a day before an expected meeting with Syria‚Äôs new president, was welcomed by Syrians who hope it will alleviate the crushing poverty that the majority of the population faces. The move represents a sea change for Syria, breaking the economic stranglehold on a country seen as critical to the stability of the Middle East.</p>
