The announcement, made on the 25th anniversary of her debut album "Whoa, Nelly!," follows recent instances where the artist faced online body-shaming. While she will no longer perform, Furtado expressed gratitude for her career and stated she will continue to write music, which she has always considered a beloved hobby. She recently addressed online critics and affirmed her commitment to "body neutrality."</p>

          <p>The audacious daylight robbery of nine "priceless" jewels from the Louvre Museum has captivated the public, quickly becoming a source of widespread internet memes and marketing opportunities. While French authorities continue their investigation into the seven-minute heist, brands like IKEA and Böcker have used the event in cheeky advertisements. The incident has also inspired Halloween costumes and commentary from celebrities like George Clooney, reflecting a public fascination with the non-violent, movie-like nature of the crime. This cultural phenomenon has given the stolen items more attention than they ever received while on display.</p>

          <p>The popular investment strategy of passively buying S&P 500 index funds, like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), may be losing its appeal due to a lack of diversification. Financial experts note that the technology sector now comprises a record 35% of the index, while defensive sectors are at an all-time low weighting, creating an imbalance. As a result, some investors are looking beyond large-cap stocks and showing renewed interest in small-cap alternatives, such as the Russell 2000 index, which recently hit an all-time high.

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the EU is actively working to end its reliance on rare earth elements imported from China. This move is a response to Beijing's recent export curbs on these critical materials, which are essential for producing high-tech goods like smartphones, electric vehicles, and military equipment. The EU's strategy includes securing alternative sources, boosting recycling efforts, and forming partnerships with other producing countries like Australia, Canada, and Ukraine. Von der Leyen emphasized that Europe must strive for independence in critical raw materials to ensure its economic security.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban suggests that one of the most effective financial strategies for the average person is not picking stocks but buying household consumables in bulk. He argues that saving a significant percentage on items like toothpaste and toilet paper by purchasing them in large quantities can yield a guaranteed return, unlike the uncertainties of the stock market. Cuban emphasizes the importance of using cash for these purchases, cautioning against the use of credit cards and accumulating debt. This practical advice stems from his own experiences with financial discipline before he achieved his wealth.</p>

          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history on the Klamath River, the waterway is showing remarkable signs of recovery, with salmon returning to headwaters for the first time in a century. To mark this milestone, 28 Indigenous teenagers became the first to kayak the full length of the newly freed river, an initiative of the "Paddle Tribal Waters" program. This journey has not only deepened their connection to their ancestral lands but has also inspired other Indigenous-led environmental movements worldwide. The success on the Klamath serves as a powerful model for ecological restoration and collective action.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at record highs this week, buoyed by strong corporate earnings and a consumer price index report that was cooler than anticipated. The September inflation data, which showed a 0.3% monthly increase, has increased expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates again. Approximately 87% of S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have surpassed earnings expectations, further boosting investor confidence. These positive financial indicators overshadowed ongoing concerns about the federal government shutdown and trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Independent left-wing candidate Catherine Connolly is set to be the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded defeat. While vote counting is still ongoing, polls have consistently shown strong support for Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister and lawmaker. As president, she will hold a largely ceremonial role, representing Ireland on the world stage but without direct power over legislation. Connolly, who has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza, will be Ireland's 10th president and the third woman to hold the office.</p>

Described as an "underwater phantom," the drone is made from a transparent hydrogel material, weighs only 56 grams, and mimics the appearance and movement of a real jellyfish. Its design allows for low power consumption and nearly silent operation, making it ideal for covert monitoring in sensitive marine ecosystems or for inspecting underwater structures without causing disruption.
