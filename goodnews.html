        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against a Louisiana law that required the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public school classroom, deeming it unconstitutional. The court affirmed a lower court's decision, siding with civil liberties groups who argued the law violates the separation of church and state and could isolate non-Christian students. Republican backers of the law claimed the Ten Commandments are foundational to U.S. law and should be displayed for historical context. The legal challenge was brought by parents from various religious backgrounds who argued the mandate infringes upon religious freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil from U.S. immigration detention, where he was held for over three months due to his activism against Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza. Judge Michael Farbiarz stated that Khalil is not a flight risk and does not pose a danger to the community. Khalil's arrest was widely criticized as an attack on free speech, and he has not been charged with a crime. The Trump administration had accused Khalil of antisemitism and pro-Hamas advocacy without providing evidence, while Jewish students and faculty submitted court documents in his support.</p>

          <p>Jia Zhangke's latest film, "Caught by the Tides," uses footage from nearly 25 years of his movies to create a poignant story about globalization and alienation in China. The film follows Qiaoqiao (Zhao Tao) as she navigates love and loss amidst China's rapid industrialization. Jia's fans will recognize scenes and outtakes from his earlier movies, creating a bittersweet sense of d√©j√† vu. The film serves as a primer on Jia's fascination with China's political, cultural, and economic evolution, amplifying those themes across a quarter-century.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with a limited number of vehicles debuting on June 22. Initial rides will be in the Model Y, and access is by invitation only, with trips to or from airports excluded and service potentially limited by bad weather. A Tesla Safety Monitor will be present in the front passenger seat during trips, which will be confined to a geofenced area of the city and monitored remotely. Elon Musk aims to start with a small number of vehicles and scale up gradually, but Tesla still lags behind competitors like Waymo in the autonomous driving market.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that his administration is close to reaching a "deal" with Harvard University, while a federal judge blocked the Department of Homeland Security from preventing Harvard from hosting foreign students.

Trump stated that Harvard has "acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations" and appears committed to doing what is right. The battle over international students has significant implications for Harvard, where about one in four students are from outside the United States.</p>
