          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his place in the US Open quarter-finals with a straight-sets victory over Arthur Rinderknech, marking the first time in his career he has reached this stage of a Grand Slam without losing a set. This achievement makes him the youngest man in the Open era to reach 13 Grand Slam quarter-finals. In the women's draw, fourth seed Jessica Pegula also advanced to the quarter-finals after overcoming a period of poor form leading into the tournament. Meanwhile, Daniil Medvedev has ended his partnership with long-time coach Gilles Cervara.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old woman sought advice from personal finance expert Dave Ramsey after co-signing a $27,000 car loan for her daughter, who subsequently failed to refinance it and accumulated traffic tickets. The mother was considering taking a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or cashing out other funds to pay off the car. Ramsey strongly advised against this, stating that her actions had hurt, not helped, her daughter by placing her in an unaffordable vehicle. He and his co-host recommended selling the car and helping her daughter purchase a more affordable one.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued an emergency order to halt the Trump administration's plan to deport nearly 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came after immigrant advocates filed a lawsuit arguing the plan was illegal and deprived the minors of due process to seek asylum. Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan's order, which applies broadly to Guatemalan minors in government custody, required that children be taken off planes that were reportedly preparing for departure. The government contended it was reuniting children with their families, a claim disputed by the children's lawyers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool secured a 1-0 victory over Arsenal at Anfield, thanks to a late free-kick from Dominik Szoboszlai in the 83rd minute. The match between the two Premier League title contenders was a cautious and largely defensive affair. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta's conservative strategy resulted in his team failing to create significant scoring opportunities against a resilient Liverpool defense. The result extends Arsenal's winless streak at Anfield to 13 league games and gives Liverpool an early psychological advantage in the title race.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Kiko has formed in the eastern Pacific Ocean, located over 1,000 miles off the coast of Mexico, and poses no immediate threat to land. The U.S. National Hurricane Center reported that the storm developed early Sunday with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. Forecasters expect Kiko to strengthen over the next few days, likely becoming a hurricane by Tuesday as it moves westward across the ocean. Kiko is the eleventh named storm to form in the Eastern North Pacific basin during the current hurricane season.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris acknowledged that his retirement from the Dutch Grand Prix due to an oil leak was a significant blow to his Formula 1 world championship aspirations. The retirement allowed his teammate, Oscar Piastri, to win the race and extend his lead in the standings to 34 points. Despite the setback, Norris remains determined, stating he will now "just go for it" in the remaining nine races of the season. The incident highlighted the intense but fair competition between the two McLaren drivers this year.</p>

          <p>Gordon Ramsay announced that he was recently diagnosed with skin cancer and has undergone surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from the side of his face. The celebrity chef shared photos of his post-surgery bandage and stitches on social media, using the experience to urge his followers to wear sunscreen. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer and rarely spreads, with a very high cure rate when detected and treated early. This is not the first time Ramsay has used a personal health scare to promote safety awareness.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, recorded his second hole-in-one during the final round of the Junior Players Championship in Florida. The ace occurred on the par-three third hole at TPC Sawgrass from a distance of 177 yards. His first hole-in-one was achieved last December at the 2024 PNC Championship while playing alongside his father. Charlie is steadily building his own list of achievements in the sport, though still trailing his father's impressive record of 10 career holes-in-one.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The warships will be constructed at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, a move expected to support thousands of UK jobs into the 2030s. This strategic partnership aims to strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a combined UK-Norwegian fleet to operate jointly in the North Atlantic to counter potential threats from Russian submarines.</p>

          <p>During informal talks in Copenhagen, EU foreign ministers brainstormed new ways to bolster support for Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. Key ideas discussed included imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" production sites for Ukrainian arms companies on EU soil. Ministers also revisited the contentious debate over seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv. Another proposal involved shifting the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops onto Ukrainian territory in the event of a ceasefire.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A massive restoration project off the coast of Southern California has successfully revived a vital kelp forest by removing nearly 5.8 million invasive purple sea urchins. Over the past decade, the urchin population had exploded due to ecological imbalances, creating vast underwater "barrens" by devouring the kelp. Led by The Bay Foundation, an army of divers armed with hammers systematically culled the urchins across 80 acres, allowing the fast-growing kelp to return. The restored ecosystem now provides critical habitat for hundreds of marine species and protects the coastline.</p>
