          <p>The UK government is set to announce the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, many of which were established in the 1950s. The initiative aims to reduce flight times and delays by allowing planes to climb and descend more efficiently. Aviation Minister Mike Kane stated that modernizing airspace is a simple way to reduce pollution from flying and will set the industry up for a sustainable future. UKADS is expected to be fully operational by the end of the year, marking the largest redesign of UK airspace in decades, accommodating the significant increase in flights since the 1950s. This transformation prioritizes environmental impacts and community well-being.</p>

          <p>South Korea is holding a snap presidential election following the impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol, with opposition party leader Lee Jae Myung projected to win according to polls. Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, holds a significant lead, with a Gallup poll showing 49% of respondents favoring him. Goldman Sachs noted that both Lee and his rival, Kim Moon Soo, share goals of economic growth and stable financial markets, but differ on economic policy platforms. Lee favors fiscal support for strategic industries, while Kim prefers revitalizing private entrepreneurship through deregulation and tax cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former yokozuna Hakuho, who holds a record 45 top-division championships, will retire from the Japan Sumo Association on June 9. The decision follows uncertainty surrounding the future of his Miyagino stable, which has been closed since April 2024 after his protege Hokuseiho was found to have physically abused two junior wrestlers. Hakuho, now known as elder Miyagino, plans to return from Mongolia later this week and will hold a press conference on the day of his retirement. The Miyagino stable's wrestlers and elders have been transferred to the Isegahama stable indefinitely.</p>

The camp's approach is rooted in research showing that adverse childhood experiences are linked to lifelong physical and mental health problems. Parents have reported that the camp has provided their children with a sense of normalcy, safety, and connection with friends during a difficult time.</p>

The rice has been fortified with the micronutrient catechin, and the researchers behind it say it can provide the health benefits of tea without any side effects from caffeine.

          <p>A new book, *The Family Dynamic* by Susan Dominus, examines how sibling relationships influence a person‚Äôs life trajectory, including birth order and achievements. Studies suggest that eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests due to increased parental attention. Sibling influence can be powerful, spurring individuals to achieve success in different fields. The author reflects on her own sibling relationships, noting how her brother pursued STEM subjects while she pursued humanities, possibly as a result of their early dynamics.</p>

Her ministry was forced to clarify a remark she made during a meeting of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in January 2023, when, during a call for unity among western allies, she said, in English: "We are fighting a war against Russia, not against each other."</p>

          <p>Richie Mo'unga credited Michael Leitch with helping him find his way in Japan over the past two seasons, culminating in back-to-back titles with Sunday's 18-13 win over the Kubota Spears. The former All Black wanted to share the moment at Tokyo's National Stadium with captain Michael Leitch. Mo'unga, who was visibly emotional at the end of the match in front of 51,009, likened the Brave Lupus No. 8 and Japan's 2019 Rugby World Cup skipper to a "big brother" whose influence was felt throughout the Toshiba-owned club, based in the western Tokyo city of Fuchu. Todd Blackadder said the joint leadership provided by Mo'unga and the 36-year-old Leitch had been the bedrock for Brave Lupus as they became the first two-time champions in the League One era.</p>

          <p>India estimates a "minor impact" from U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to increase tariffs on steel and aluminium products as the South Asian country exports low volumes to Washington, the federal steel minister said on Monday. Trump said last week he intends to increase tariffs on imported steel and aluminium to 50% from 25% currently, spurring declines on Monday in steelmakers' stocks in South Korea and Vietnam - major Asian exporters to the U.S. Roughly a quarter of all steel used in the U.S. is imported, the bulk of it from neighbours Mexico and Canada or close allies in Asia and Europe such as Japan, South Korea and Germany.
