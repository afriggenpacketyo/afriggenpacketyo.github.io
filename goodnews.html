          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 06:00:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jordan Maynard, chair of the Massachusetts gaming commission, is advocating for nationwide regulations on advertising and exclusion lists within the rapidly expanding US gambling industry. He likens the current environment to a "highway without speed limits," emphasizing the need for regulators to ensure responsible practices and protect citizens from potential harm. Maynard stresses the importance of balancing the economic benefits of legal betting with the social impact of gambling's rise, including concerns about underage gambling and the need for transparency from operators. He believes that artificial intelligence could be used to promote healthy betting behaviors, and he pushes back against the industry's use of the unregulated market as a deterrent to proposed regulations. </p>

          <p>David French analyzes Justice Jackson's role in shaping the discussion around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) by focusing on the balance between individual rights and group considerations. The Supreme Court's unanimous decision in *Ames v. Ohio*, authored by Justice Jackson, underscores the importance of treating individuals as individuals rather than solely as members of a group. The case involved a heterosexual woman who alleged discrimination based on sexual orientation, highlighting the complexities of DEI and the need for institutions to avoid malicious discrimination. Justice Jackson's opinion emphasizes the necessity of ceasing discriminatory practices while prompting reflection on the extent to which institutions should actively assist targeted groups to increase diversity. </p>

          <p>Democrats are engaged in extensive self-reflection following Kamala Harris's election loss, with leaders questioning the party's message and appeal to key voter groups. While some see this introspection as necessary for future success, others criticize it as excessive self-pity that distracts from the need for strong opposition to the current administration. The article explores whether the Democratic Party's ideals are truly unappealing to voters or if external factors, such as right-wing influence, are to blame. Despite the loss, the article suggests that the Democratic Party still holds value and that over-interpreting the significance of a single election can be misleading.</p>
