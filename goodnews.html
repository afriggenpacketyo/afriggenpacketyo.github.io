The phone call follows a period of heightened tension, after President Trump threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports in response to Beijing's new export controls. Despite the recent friction, the planned conversation suggests a potential step toward de-escalation and progress in the complex U.S.-China economic relationship, with President Trump stating he believes the U.S. will "do fine with China."</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has offered condolences following the death of former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, referring to him as an "old friend" of the country. Murayama is remembered for his landmark 1995 statement expressing "deep remorse" for Japan's actions during World War II, a declaration that significantly contributed to Sino-Japanese relations. During his tenure, he became the first sitting Japanese prime minister to visit the Marco Polo Bridge, the site marking the start of Japan's full-scale invasion of China in 1937, cementing his legacy as a figure of reconciliation.</p>

          <p>A senior analyst at Moody's Ratings has stated that the U.S. banking and private credit markets remain fundamentally sound, despite recent market anxiety over bad loans held by some midsize banks. Marc Pinto, the agency's head of global private credit, acknowledged concerns over lending standards but found no evidence of systemic risk or contagion that could trigger a broader financial crisis. He highlighted the resilience of the U.S. economy and noted that default rates on high-yield debt are low and expected to decline, suggesting credit quality is in a relatively strong position.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has lost its legal bid to prevent a judicial review of its decision to proscribe the direct-action group Palestine Action under terrorism laws. The Court of Appeal ruled that the group's co-founder, Huda Ammori, can proceed with a High Court challenge next month, rejecting the government's argument that a separate, slower de-proscription process was the only available option. This ruling is significant as it allows for a faster legal examination of the ban's lawfulness, which could impact the ongoing criminal cases against individuals charged with supporting the group.</p>

          <h2>Energy Experts Propose 'Demand Flexibility' to Manage Rising U.S. Power Consumption</h2>

          <p>A policy solution known as "demand flexibility" is being proposed to help the U.S. manage the surging energy needs of AI data centers and manufacturing while potentially lowering household electricity bills. This approach involves rewarding customers, from large data centers to individual homes, for reducing power usage during peak hours or selling stored energy back to the grid. A recent Duke University study suggests this bipartisan tool could add over 100GW of new capacity, equivalent to 50 Hoover Dams, offering a scalable way to enhance grid efficiency and prevent blackouts without relying on new fossil fuel infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An estimated one billion birds are killed each year in the United States from colliding with glass windows, a threat second only to cats and habitat loss. Birds are unable to perceive transparent or reflective glass, mistaking it for open sky or habitat, leading to fatal impacts. In response to a mass-collision event in Chicago, over a hundred organizations have formed the Bird Collision Prevention Alliance to share resources and promote scientifically-backed solutions, such as window films with dotted patterns. These treatments have been shown to reduce collisions by up to 95% in some locations.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has ceased allowing its video generation tool, Sora, to create deepfake videos of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. after his daughter, Bernice A. King, publicly requested people to stop. The company acknowledged that some user-generated content depicting the civil rights leader was "disrespectful" and will pause his likeness while it improves safeguards for historical figures. The move highlights the growing ethical debate surrounding AI-generated content of deceased public figures, as the technology's ability to create hyper-realistic and often offensive scenarios has become more accessible.</p>

          <p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has been appointed co-chair of Prosecutors Against Gun Violence (PAGV), a bipartisan national organization focused on reducing gun violence. Bragg intends to use his "big city experience" to help the group address the illegal flow of firearms between states, a major contributor to urban gun violence. He emphasized the importance of prosecuting traffickers and stopping the proliferation of "ghost guns," while also highlighting the need for collaboration with community groups to support victims and prevent retaliatory violence, especially in minority communities disproportionately affected by shootings.</p>

          <p>A team from Tsinghua University in China has developed a powerful new imaging chip, named Yuheng, that could revolutionize visual intelligence in various technologies. The chip reportedly overcomes the traditional trade-off between resolution and efficiency, enabling it to distinguish colors with unprecedented sharpness, roughly 100 times greater than comparable imagers. Researchers plan to test an engineering model of the chip on the Gran Telescopio Canarias in Spain, the world's largest single-aperture optical telescope, to demonstrate its potential for rapidly mapping celestial objects and advancing astrophysics.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author recounts her decision to marry her partner of three decades primarily to gain access to his SAG-AFTRA health insurance after she lost her own coverage. The arrangement, initially a pragmatic solution, became complicated when the union's 'forever' insurance was later revoked for senior performers, including her husband. This experience, combined with discovering a racist covenant in their home's original deed, leads her to reflect on the illusory nature of permanence, whether in legal contracts, property ownership, or marriage itself, concluding that true commitment is a daily choice, not a guarantee on paper.</p>

          <p>Three men who followed a Nazi ideology have been sentenced to prison for planning terrorist attacks against mosques and synagogues in the UK. Christopher Ringrose, Marco Pitzettu, and Brogan Stewart were part of an online group preparing for an assault on an Islamic education center in Leeds before their arrest by counter-terrorism police. The group had amassed over 200 weapons, including machetes and a 3D-printed firearm, and styled themselves as a military unit preparing for a "race war." The judge stated that all three men continue to adhere to their violent, extreme right-wing ideology.</p>

          <p>Chicago has successfully reduced its drug overdose fatalities by 37% since the national crisis peaked in 2023, the largest reduction among counties with the top 10 U.S. cities. The city's public health department credits a multi-faceted approach, including one of the nation's most robust drug supply surveillance and overdose prevention systems. Key initiatives include using advanced technology to quickly identify new, dangerous adulterants in street drugs, providing naloxone and drug test strips at public libraries, and using real-time data to target overdose spikes at a hyper-local level.</p>
