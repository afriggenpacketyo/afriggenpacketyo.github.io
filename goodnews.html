          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 20:50:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK has successfully grown its first rice crop in an experimental trial in east England, a development aided by the country's hottest summer on record. Ecologist Nadine Mitschunas, the UK's sole rice-grower, leads this ambitious project by UKCEH to explore future food production methods amidst climate change. While currently risky for commercial planting, researchers believe rice could become a viable crop if average temperatures continue to rise. Beyond food, growing rice on waterlogged peat soils could help lock away greenhouse gases, offering a potential model for sustainable farming and climate change mitigation.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son, David, are rapidly expanding their influence in the US media industry, with deals involving major companies like TikTok and Paramount. Their growing power is partly attributed to Larry Ellison's close relationship with former President Donald Trump, who has endorsed their ventures. David Ellison's Skydance recently acquired Paramount, gaining control of CBS, and the family is reportedly eyeing Warner Brothers Discovery, which includes CNN. This surge in media ownership has sparked concerns about market concentration and potential political influence, with some lawmakers calling for scrutiny of their acquisitions.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how foul-smelling shoes affect the user experience of shoe racks. Their research, inspired by cluttered hostel corridors, identified the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius as the culprit behind shoe odor. Experiments demonstrated that a short blast of ultraviolet-C (UVC) light effectively kills these microbes and eliminates the smell. The article highlights their innovative prototype for a UVC light-equipped shoe rack, aiming to improve domestic comfort and hygiene, showcasing the delightful intersection of mundane problems and scientific inquiry.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has reached a confidential settlement with Dominion Voting Systems in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit over his unsubstantiated claims of election rigging in 2020. Dominion sued Giuliani in 2021 for leading efforts to cast doubt on the election results, alleging its systems were manipulated. This settlement follows similar agreements by Fox News and Newsmax with Dominion over election claims. The article notes this is another legal and financial setback for Giuliani, who has also faced disbarment, bankruptcy, and a $148 million judgment for defaming former Georgia election workers.</p>

The article highlights Europe's historic performance, achieving their largest-ever pre-singles lead, while American galleries were criticized for thuggish and personal insults directed at European players like Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry. Despite attempts by some US players to quiet hecklers, the atmosphere was marred by poor sportsmanship, leading to security interventions and widespread disappointment among spectators. Europe's captain, Luke Donald, emphasized the job is not yet done, but expressed pride in his team's resilience.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new book, 'Life, Law, & Liberty,' offers insights into his 30 years on the bench, where he often served as the swing justice. Kennedy expresses deep concern about the current state of American discourse, noting a shift from reasoned debate to antagonistic conversation, and worries about partisanship even within Supreme Court opinions. He details his pivotal votes on same-sex marriage and abortion, explaining how personal realizations and a commitment to liberty's evolving meaning shaped his decisions, often conflicting with his conservative colleagues. The article also touches on his Western origins and a poignant reconciliation with Justice Antonin Scalia shortly before Scalia's death.</p>

          <p>Collagen, the body's most abundant protein, is widely marketed as an anti-aging supplement for skin, joints, and hair, but its effectiveness is subject to scientific debate. While some users report positive changes, dermatologists remain skeptical about oral supplements successfully reaching and boosting collagen in skin cells. The article explains that collagen must be broken down into smaller peptides to be absorbed, and even then, its targeted delivery to the skin is not guaranteed. Industry-funded studies often suggest benefits, but independent research shows little to no effect, with experts recommending sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as more impactful for skin health.</p>

          <p>The UK government will guarantee a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its supply chain, which has been severely impacted by a prolonged cyberattack that halted production. Business Secretary Peter Kyle stated the loan aims to protect jobs in the West Midlands, Merseyside, and across the UK, as JLR's 700 suppliers face financial strain. The car manufacturer, owned by India's Tata Motors, has suspended production for weeks, incurring an estimated cost of £50 million per week. This government intervention, through the Export Development Guarantee, seeks to boost JLR's cash reserves and ensure backlog payments to suppliers.</p>
