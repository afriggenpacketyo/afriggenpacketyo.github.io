          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago court. As a leader of the "Los Chapitos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, he admitted to overseeing a massive fentanyl trafficking operation that supplied a staggering amount of the opioid to the United States. As part of his plea agreement, Guzman Lopez must provide substantial cooperation to the government, which could lead to a sentence of less than life in prison. He also agreed to forfeit $80 million in assets, with his cooperation potentially requiring him to testify against other cartel members, including his own brother.</p>

          <p>UFC President Dana White has hinted at the potential return of recently retired superstars Jon Jones and Conor McGregor for an unprecedented event at the White House. The speculation follows President Trump's announcement of plans to host a UFC card to celebrate America's 250th birthday next year. White stated that Jones has re-entered the drug-testing pool and that his dream main event would be Jones versus Tom Aspinall for the heavyweight title. He also suggested that McGregor, who has shown interest in the event, could potentially fight on the same card, promising it would be the "baddest card of all time."</p>

          <h2>Bitcoin Surges to New All-Time High Above $118,000 Amid Strong ETF Inflows</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 16:15:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of Bitcoin soared to a new all-time high, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion, signaling strong market confidence. The rally was also influenced by speculation that future Federal Reserve leadership may adopt a more dovish stance on interest rates, which can be a positive catalyst for assets like Bitcoin. This upward momentum triggered over $550 million in short liquidations, further fueling the price increase as traders rushed to cover their positions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fast bowler Jofra Archer made a dramatic and successful return to England's Test cricket team after an absence of more than four years due to injury. In his first spell during the third Test against India, Archer displayed exhilarating pace, touching 93.3mph and dismissing key batsman Yashasvi Jaiswal with only his third delivery. The moment was met with a roar of celebration, releasing 1,596 days of frustration for the player. While questions remain about his ability to sustain this intensity over a full match, his explosive return demonstrates the X-factor England has been missing and adds a new dimension to their bowling attack.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to proceed. The lawsuit accuses the social media platform of intentionally using manipulative and addictive design features to exploit its young user base, aiming to keep children engaged longer to increase ad exposure and drive e-commerce sales. The judge ruled that the state's claims were specific enough and based on the app's allegedly dangerous features, not its user-generated content. This case is part of a growing legal trend where state attorneys general are targeting the design and safety policies of tech companies rather than their content.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal munitions against journalists covering protests. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by press rights organizations, which argued that LAPD officers have deliberately targeted and injured reporters during demonstrations against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The judge cited specific incidents, such as an Australian reporter being hit by a rubber bullet on live TV, as evidence that an injunction was necessary to protect First Amendment rights. The order also bars police from obstructing journalists from doing their work in protest areas.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is planning to introduce more segmented fare options within its premium cabins, applying a strategy similar to the one that created different tiers in economy class. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, stated that the goal is to provide more choices for customers with different needs in first and business class. This move comes as revenue from premium seats continues to show strong growth, outperforming the main cabin. While specific details have not been released, the changes could involve creating new fare types with varying levels of perks, such as lounge access or seat assignments, to further capitalize on the robust demand for high-end travel.</p>

          <p>A massive Antonov An-124 cargo jet was seen flying over Kyiv, a rare sight since Ukrainian airspace was closed to most non-combat aircraft at the start of Russia's 2022 invasion. The flight sparked speculation, but it is believed to be the evacuation of an An-124 that had been stranded at the Antonov plant in Kyiv for years. Flight tracking data showed the aircraft, registered to Antonov Airlines, later landed in Leipzig, Germany, where the company relocated much of its operations. The successful flight is seen by some as a symbol of Ukrainian resilience and a logistical success, as it evaded potential Russian threats to depart the country safely.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a development largely driven by a massive increase in revenue from customs duties. Tariff collections for the month were 301% higher than in June of the previous year, following the implementation of broad new tariffs on imports. This monthly surplus is a rare occurrence, with the last one in June happening in 2017. Despite the positive monthly figure, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains substantial at $1.34 trillion, and net interest payments on the national debt continue to be a major expense for the government.

          <p>For homeowners seeking to quickly tap into their home's equity, several strategies can expedite the process of obtaining a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). This article suggests that borrowers can significantly reduce approval times by using fully online lenders, which leverage digital platforms for faster processing. Other fast-track methods include applying for a low-documentation HELOC that minimizes paperwork, or choosing a lender that uses automated valuation models for property appraisals instead of slower, in-person ones. Working with the lender that already holds your primary mortgage can also streamline the process, as they have existing financial information on file. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The current season of the popular reality show "Love Island USA" is being viewed as a revealing portrait of Gen Z's approach to dating, which appears to be more emotionally guarded and hesitant than that of previous generations. This analysis piece from The Atlantic argues that the season has been defined by "situationships" rather than deep romantic connections, with many young contestants struggling to communicate directly or show vulnerability. Despite this, the show remains a phenomenon, and the contestants who do express genuine emotion and enthusiasm, even if messy, have become viral fan favorites, suggesting viewers are drawn to authenticity in a sea of caution.</p>

The program, funded through philanthropic partnerships rather than city money, will distribute cash cards worth a "couple hundred" dollars to help those who are afraid to leave their homes or have lost income due to a family member's detention. This aid is part of a broader city response that includes bolstering its sanctuary city protocols and demanding more information from federal agencies about the raids being conducted in the city.</p>
