          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a slight downturn following the release of mixed first-quarter results and cautious guidance for the upcoming period. The company anticipates gross profit growth in the high-teens percentage range, slightly below analysts' expectations, while revenue is projected to expand at a mid-20s percentage rate. Shopify's CFO, Jeff Hoffmeister, acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, which could impact the company's merchants, though he expects the expiration of the de minimis exemption to have limited effect in the short term. The company is actively monitoring the situation to support its merchants amidst potential market changes.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden discussed his relationship with Vice President Kamala Harris and her loss in the 2024 presidential election on ABC's "The View," attributing her defeat to sexism and racism. Biden emphasized Harris's qualifications but acknowledged the challenges she faced due to societal biases. He also mentioned ongoing self-reflection and plans to write a book, while refraining from commenting on Harris's future political aspirations, including speculation about a potential gubernatorial run or a 2028 presidential bid. Biden expressed hope that Harris would remain engaged in a significant capacity, though he stopped short of endorsing a specific path for her.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. This follows the withdrawal of Ed Martin's nomination, who faced criticism for his support of Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants. Trump believes Pirro, a former district attorney for Westchester County, New York, is highly qualified for the role. Pirro is a staunch supporter of Trump, who previously pardoned her ex-husband for tax evasion.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to unveil a "most favored nation" plan to lower Medicare drug prices. This plan would tie the prices of some high-cost Medicare drugs to the lowest prices drug manufacturers receive in other countries. A similar attempt during Trump's first term was blocked by court orders. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested the possibility of the policy returning, pointing to higher prices in Europe for drugs like Ozempic. The Trump administration is continuing to negotiate the cost of Ozempic in Medicare under talks launched by the Biden administration, but only for its uses to treat diabetes and other health conditions.</p>

The restaurant, known for its eclectic menu and fresh cocktails, has been a fixture on the Los Angeles dining scene. Owner Lien Ta also cited a loss of business post-pandemic as a contributing factor. Ta plans to reserve space for walk-ins and host pop-up events before the closure.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price climbed above $100,000 for the first time since February, driven by optimism surrounding a trade deal between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. The cryptocurrency's rise was further supported by a pro-crypto Trump administration and buying activity from spot-ETF investors. Analysts suggest that the recent market uncertainty has benefited Bitcoin, reinforcing its status as a safe-haven asset. However, rising tensions between India and Pakistan, as well as the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to interest rate cuts, could test Bitcoin's resilience.</p>
