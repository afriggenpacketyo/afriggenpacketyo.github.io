          <p>Max Verstappen of Red Bull secured victory in the United States Grand Prix sprint race in Austin, capitalizing on a dramatic first-lap collision between the two McLaren drivers, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. The teammates, who are rivals for the championship title, were both eliminated from the race after Piastri made contact with another car and subsequently crashed into Norris. The incident is a significant setback for the McLaren team, which has been trying to manage the intense competition between its drivers.

          <p>David Huerta, a prominent Southern California labor union president, will see a felony obstruction charge against him reduced to a misdemeanor. The charge stemmed from his arrest during a protest against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid in Los Angeles earlier this year. Supporters, including the AFL-CIO and California's governor, condemned the arrest as a politically motivated abuse of power by the Trump administration aimed at silencing dissent. Huerta's attorneys maintain his innocence, stating the case is an act of retaliation against those who oppose the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>With the average cost of a Halloween costume rising, Christophe Waggoner of Austin, Texas, is helping families in need by creating and donating costumes from thrifted items. For nine years, he has spent his own money to purchase, redesign, and repair used clothing, transforming them into unique costumes for children. He then hosts free giveaway events, which have become increasingly popular as families face financial pressures. Waggoner's effort not only provides children with the joy of Halloween but also inspires a cycle of giving, as many families return to donate their old costumes for others.</p>

          <p>Amid increasing market volatility, as indicated by the CBOE Volatility Index, some investors are seeking strategies to mitigate risk. John Burrello, a senior portfolio manager at Invesco, suggests that income funds utilizing options-based strategies can provide structural protection during wild market swings. These funds can offer downside protection and generate income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is particularly relevant as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates. He advises investors to seek out ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and be wary of unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to the popular stereotype that women are more eager for commitment, a recent study from the Kinsey Institute indicates that men are more likely to want to speed up relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The research found that while financial savings can be a motivating factor, a key reason is that men in heterosexual relationships often rely more heavily on their romantic partners for primary social and emotional support. Experts suggest that traditional notions of masculinity can limit men's ability to form close, intimate friendships, making romantic relationships particularly crucial for their psychological well-being.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines plane clipped the tail of another stationary United aircraft while taxiing toward its gate at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. No injuries were reported among the 113 passengers on the arriving flight from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, who were able to deplane normally after a delay. The incident involved the wing of one plane striking the horizontal stabilizer of the other. This event adds to a series of recent runway and taxiway collisions at U.S. airports that have raised concerns about aviation safety and ground control procedures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A NASA astrophysicist has proposed a new solution to the Fermi Paradox, suggesting the reason we haven't detected alien civilizations is due to "radical mundanity." The theory posits that other intelligent life in the Milky Way is likely only slightly more advanced than humans and faces the same immense physical and financial barriers to interstellar travel and communication. According to this hypothesis, aliens haven't built massive, observable megastructures or sent powerful signals because it's simply too difficult and costly. This sober perspective contrasts with more speculative theories involving hyper-advanced aliens or cosmic dangers.</p>

          <p>A complex repair plan is underway to restore the main power supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, which has relied on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, announced that both Russian and Ukrainian forces agreed to special ceasefire zones to allow the crucial repairs to proceed safely. The plant, which is Europe's largest, has been under Russian control since early in the full-scale invasion. Restoring a stable off-site power connection is considered essential for cooling the shutdown reactors and preventing a potential nuclear incident.</p>

Greene emphasizes that applying for scholarships is a numbers game and recommends applying to 100-200 to increase success rates.
