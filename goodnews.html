          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally mandate states to cooperate with immigration enforcement as a condition for receiving certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's policy aimed at penalizing "sanctuary" cities and states. The judge sided with 20 plaintiff states, asserting that the policy was "arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," and warned of irreparable harm due to the potential loss of critical emergency and disaster funds. This ruling underscores the ongoing legal and political battle over federal authority in immigration enforcement and its implications for state autonomy and public safety.</p>

          <p>Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska has unveiled the 12 contenders for its 2025 Fat Bear Week, an annual online competition celebrating the park's brown bears as they prepare for hibernation. Running from September 23-30, the event allows the public to vote for the fattest bear, emphasizing the crucial role of accumulating significant fat reserves for winter survival. Bears can gain up to 700 pounds, potentially exceeding 1,400 pounds. This popular initiative, which includes livestreams, aims to make the remote park more accessible, showcasing these magnificent animals' natural behaviors and the vital importance of their impressive weight gain.</p>

          <p>Parents of Mason Connor, a child diagnosed with autism, report that he began speaking just three days after starting leucovorin, an inexpensive generic drug primarily used to ease chemotherapy side effects. Pediatric neurologist Dr. Richard Frye is researching leucovorin's potential to bypass a folic acid transport blockage in the brain, a mechanism that may contribute to some autism symptoms and improve speech. Despite the absence of large-scale phase 3 clinical trials, the FDA has initiated the approval process for leucovorin as an autism treatment. This article highlights the challenges of securing funding and manufacturing the correct formulation for children with autism, as there is little financial incentive for drug companies to invest in an old, generic medicine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck western and northern Venezuela on Wednesday, as reported by the US Geological Survey. The tremor's epicenter was located at a depth of 7.8 kilometers, approximately 24 kilometers from Mene Grande, an oil town situated in a sparsely populated area of Zulia state. Crucially, initial reports indicated no immediate casualties or serious damage, offering a measure of relief given the earthquake's strength. This article highlights Venezuela's significant global position as the country with the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, estimated at approximately 303 billion barrels, though this specific seismic event did not appear to impact that vital industry or human life.</p>

          <p>Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa addressed the UN General Assembly, marking the first time a Syrian head of state has done so in almost 60 years, following the collapse of the Assad regime and the end of 14 years of civil war. Al-Sharaa declared Syria's return to the international community, condemning Israel's actions as a threat to regional stability and advocating for a security deal, despite Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's cautious remarks. He also highlighted the new government's progress in dismantling the illicit Captagon drug trade and urged Western countries to lift sanctions imposed on the previous regime. The historic speech, met with mixed reactions from the Syrian diaspora, emphasized a new chapter for Syria focused on stability and justice.</p>

          <h2>Brendan Rodgers Calls for 'Realism' Regarding Celtic's European Ambitions</h2>

          <p>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers urged "realism" after his team's Europa League opening draw away to Red Star Belgrade, signaling a potential new norm for the club's European ambitions. Following a painful Champions League play-off defeat, Celtic's return to the second-tier competition was initially impotent, but a goal from substitute Kelechi Iheanacho secured a crucial first point. Rodgers' call for realism reflects a period of scant summer transfer activity and the departure of key players, leading to fan protests and a perception of a weaker squad. This article analyzes the club's current European landscape, suggesting a more grounded approach is necessary compared to previous seasons where Champions League aspirations were higher.</p>

          <p>The Shreveport Fire Department responded to a house fire in the Southern Trace neighborhood, which is believed to have been caused by a lightning strike. This incident marks the second house fire in the neighborhood this year, though the previous one in March was attributed to an electrical issue. A substantial force of 25 fire units from Shreveport and two from Caddo Parish Fire District 5 battled the blaze, bringing it under control within 34 minutes. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, as the home was unoccupied at the time, and it sustained moderate to heavy damage but was not a complete loss. The cause of this fire remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald declared his team is "fuelled by something money can’t buy," in what appeared to be a subtle criticism directed at American rivals who are receiving $500,000 stipends. Donald emphasized that for Europe, the biennial tournament is fundamentally about "pride, representing your flag, your shirt and the legacy you leave behind," contrasting this with the American team's unprecedented player payments. While some American players, including Collin Morikawa, dismissed the idea that payment affects their desire to win, the move has drawn negative attention from critics who argue it undermines the Ryder Cup's traditional ethos and the spirit of the game.</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey vehemently criticized the common 3% retirement withdrawal rate, calling it "hope-stealing trash" and "bogus math" after a caller expressed confusion over his co-host's advice. Ramsey advocates for a significantly higher withdrawal rate, suggesting 7-8%, based on historical S&P 500 returns and average inflation, arguing that lower rates prevent people from truly living off their investments and discourage saving. He expressed strong frustration with what he calls "nerd rabbit holes" and overly cautious academic theories, asserting that such advice makes retirement seem unattainable and robs people of financial confidence and hope.
