          <p>Corporate travel and expense management startup Navan has officially filed to go public on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker "NAVN." The company, formerly known as TripActions, reported $613 million in revenue over the last twelve months and serves over 10,000 customers, including major corporations like Unilever and Adobe. The filing comes amid a resurgent IPO market, which has seen its most active year since 2021, driven by investor interest in technology and AI firms. Navan aims to disrupt the business travel sector with its all-in-one app that integrates AI to streamline booking and expense reporting.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly raising $10 billion in a new funding round that would value the company at an immense $200 billion. This follows a previous $10 billion fundraising effort and reflects the soaring valuations in the AI sector, with competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI also securing massive investments. However, Musk has publicly denied the report on his social media platform X, calling it "fake news" and stating that xAI is not currently raising capital. The reported funds would likely be used to acquire AI chips and build out the computational infrastructure needed to develop advanced AI models like its chatbot, Grok.</p>

As the world's number one team, England enters the match as the clear favorite, holding a 16-game winning streak against their French rivals. However, France will look to challenge England's dominance, recalling their narrow 43-42 loss in the recent Six Nations decider. The winner of this clash will advance to the final at Twickenham to play against Canada, who secured their spot by defeating defending champions New Zealand in a stunning upset.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year note reaching its highest point in two weeks, a counterintuitive move following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. Investors are weighing mixed economic signals, including strong GDP estimates and slightly higher inflation, against the Fed's more accommodative monetary policy. While the Fed's cut aims to lower short-term borrowing costs, investors in longer-term debt are also considering factors like future economic growth and the government's need to issue more debt. The market is now looking ahead to the upcoming personal consumption expenditures index for further insight. (not investment advice)</p>

The win marks the first time in 11 years that the Black Ferns have been defeated in the tournament and secures only the second-ever final appearance for the Canadian side. Canada dominated the match from the start, scoring four first-half tries to build a commanding lead that New Zealand could not overcome. They will now face the winner of the England vs. France semi-final, with the opportunity to claim their first world title.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Raiders offensive coordinator Chip Kelly has clarified the nature of his interactions with team minority owner Tom Brady, stating that the former quarterback is not involved in weekly game planning. This comes after an ESPN report during "Monday Night Football" suggested Brady was deeply involved, speaking with Kelly multiple times a week about the game plan. Kelly explained that while he uses Brady as a valuable resource for general football strategy and insights, particularly from Brady's extensive experience, these conversations are not part of the team's regular preparations. The NFL confirmed no rules prohibit an owner from sitting in the coaches' booth.</p>

          <p>A community-led nonprofit, the Molokai Heritage Trust, has formed with the ambitious goal of purchasing over 55,000 acres of land on the island of Molokai known as Molokai Ranch. The land, which includes critical infrastructure like a water system, has been owned and neglected by an absentee Hong Kong-based billionaire firm since 2008. The community's unprecedented effort aims to restore the land, which has suffered from erosion and mismanagement, and return it to Indigenous stewardship to ensure its long-term health. If successful, the $260 million purchase would be one of the largest land-back initiatives in Hawaiian history.</p>

          <p>A new forecast from Wolfe Research indicates that U.S. electricity demand is set to grow significantly over the next five years, driven largely by the power-hungry needs of new AI data centers. The report projects the addition of 265 gigawatts of electricity supply by 2029, a substantial increase from previous estimates, creating a bullish outlook for industrial companies. Firms like GE Vernova, which produces power-generating turbines, and Eaton, which supplies electrical equipment for the grid, are positioned to benefit from this sustained investment trend. The high demand is creating a multi-year backlog for manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The iconic towers of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris have officially reopened to the public, marking a major milestone in the restoration effort following the catastrophic 2019 fire. French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the reopened towers, which allow visitors to once again climb the 424 steps for panoramic views of the city. The cathedral itself reopened in December 2024 and has since attracted nearly 30,000 visitors daily. The successful and timely reconstruction, which cost nearly $1 billion and involved hundreds of artisans, is seen as a significant achievement for President Macron, who had pledged to complete the restoration within five years.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS have issued proposed regulations offering key details on President Trump's new "no tax on tips" policy. The provision, enacted in July, allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from 2025 to 2028. The new guidance clarifies which occupations qualify, excluding jobs in sectors like healthcare, legal, and financial services. Importantly, the regulations specify that automatic gratuities, such as those added for large parties at restaurants, will not be considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary payments from customers.</p>

          <p>Following a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, consumers have several increasingly affordable options for borrowing money. Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are currently one of the cheapest methods, with average rates around 8% and the potential to become even cheaper with future rate cuts due to their variable nature. Home equity loans offer slightly higher but fixed rates, providing more predictable payments. While personal loan rates remain in the double digits, they are still significantly less expensive than credit cards and do not require putting up a home as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In remembrances of actor and director Robert Redford, critics are highlighting a consistent theme throughout his career: the hollowness and corrupting influence of winning. From his iconic roles as athletes in "The Natural" and "Downhill Racer" to his directorial work in "Quiz Show," Redford repeatedly explored characters who were too deft for their own good. He was drawn to stories of Pyrrhic victory, believing that American culture's obsession with winning was a deception. This perspective, shaped by his own early experiences, allowed him to create a legacy of films that questioned the nature of success and championed the idea that life is a game that can't be won, only played.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is taking significant steps to win back the liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping trade it lost during recent years of severe drought. Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking slot system for LNG carriers next year and are developing a new "Interoceanic Energy Corridor," a 76-kilometer pipeline to transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus. This would free up canal slots for other vessels and provide an alternative transit method. These initiatives are designed to make the canal more attractive to energy shippers who had diverted to longer routes due to previous water-level restrictions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the legal filing violated federal rules by not being a "short and plain statement." U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday criticized the 85-page complaint as repetitive, superfluous, and more of a platform to "rage against an adversary" than a proper legal document. The judge has given Trump's legal team 28 days to file an amended complaint that adheres to court standards. The New York Times welcomed the swift ruling, stating the lawsuit was a political document intended to stifle independent reporting.</p>
