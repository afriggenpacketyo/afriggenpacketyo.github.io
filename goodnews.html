          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal framework with the U.K., aiming to lower tariffs and provide a political win for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term. While details are still being finalized, the agreement includes increased U.S. access to the U.K. market, particularly for agricultural products, and reduces non-tariff barriers. A 10% tariff on U.K. imports remains, but the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. are subject to that rate, with additional vehicles facing higher rates. The framework is expected to generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S.</p>

          <p>The House passed a bill introduced by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America," codifying an executive order signed by President Trump. The bill passed with a vote of 211 to 206, facing opposition from Democrats who view it as a waste of taxpayer money. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the name change would cost less than $500,000 over five years to update federal documents and maps. The White House has restricted Associated Press reporters' access over the news organization's decision to use the original name.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden criticized President Donald Trump's second term, calling it the "worst 100 days any president's ever had" during an appearance on ABC's "The View". Biden took responsibility for Trump's initial victory, citing voter concerns about border security and the cost of living during his administration. He expressed disappointment but not surprise at Vice President Kamala Harris's loss, attributing it to sexism. The Bidens addressed reports of cognitive decline and accusations that Jill Biden was isolating the former president, defending his capabilities and involvement in public life.</p>

          <p>Stocks experienced a surge following President Trump's announcement of a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both rising by 1%. The agreement aims to increase market access for American exports and eliminate non-tariff barriers, though a 10% baseline U.S. tax on imports from Britain will remain on some products. While the market reacted positively, analysts caution that headwinds and volatility are expected due to ongoing trade negotiations with other countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the U.S. is currently negotiating deals with 17 trading partners.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price soared above $100,000 for the first time since February, driven by President Trump's announcement of a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. The cryptocurrency's rise reflects its status as a bounceback asset amidst brightening prospects for U.S. trade deals. Analysts suggest that recent market uncertainty has benefited Bitcoin, as investors question the safe-haven status of the U.S. and seek clarity on trade policy. Bitcoin is also bolstered by a pro-crypto Trump administration and continued buying from spot-ETF investors.</p>

          <p>In a society increasingly characterized by loud egos and declining well-being, cultivating a quiet ego offers a countercultural strategy for personal happiness. A quiet ego, as defined by psychologists, involves balancing self-focus with consideration for others, perspective-taking, a growth mindset, and detached awareness. Research indicates that individuals with a quiet ego experience greater happiness, improved mood balance, superior life satisfaction, and a stronger sense of life's meaning. The article suggests practical ways to cultivate quiet ego through self-reflection, questioning conventional wisdom, and adopting virtues like charity, humility, self-awareness, and hope.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has lowered interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5% and hinted at more cuts in the coming months, citing concerns about the global trade war. Governor Andrew Bailey said future rate cuts are likely to be "gradual and careful". The bank considered an even bigger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit UK economic growth. The reduction in rates on Thursday marks the fourth cut within the past year.</p>

          <h2>Lee Jae-myung Poised for South Korean Presidency as Trial is Postponed</h2>

          <p>The Seoul High Court has postponed the trial of Lee Jae-myung, the opposition Democratic Party's presidential candidate, until after the June 3 election. Lee faces charges of violating election laws and other offenses, but the postponement has been criticized as potentially undermining the judiciary and ensuring his victory. While critics express concerns about the DP's influence on the judiciary, Lee's legal troubles have not significantly impacted his voter support, with experts suggesting he is likely to win the election and potentially halt the legal proceedings against him.</p>
