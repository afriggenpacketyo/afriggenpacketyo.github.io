          <p>Oprah Winfrey has announced her latest book club selection is "Culpability" by author Bruce Holsinger, calling it the must-read of the summer. Winfrey praised the novel for its prescient exploration of artificial intelligence and moral responsibility, themes she finds particularly relevant today. The story centers on a family whose self-driving minivan crashes, killing another couple, which raises complex questions of accountability in the age of AI. Holsinger said he wrote the book to examine how technology affects human autonomy and was shocked when he received the call from Winfrey herself.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Identifies Seven Phrases Common in Trusting Relationships</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a Harvard-trained psychologist, couples who have strong emotional security and trust often use specific phrases in their daily interactions. These expressions, such as "I trust you" and "We'll get through this," are indicative of a healthy connection where both partners feel safe and accepted. The article explains that this security is built on believing your partner is committed, compassionate, and has your best interests at heart. Fostering this environment allows for vulnerability, independence, and effective communication, which are foundational to a lasting relationship.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing economic uncertainty, financial advisors are recommending several strategies for individuals looking to secure and grow their savings. Popular choices for this month include high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, and laddered CDs, which offer a balance of competitive returns and security. Advisors stress the importance of aligning savings tools with specific financial goals, time horizons, and risk tolerance. While these options are ideal for short-term needs and emergency funds, they should be balanced with long-term investments for goals like retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is set to end its policy requiring passengers in general security lines to remove their shoes for screening. According to an internal memo, the new procedure will be rolled out at many major U.S. airports starting Sunday, with a goal of nationwide implementation soon after. This change reverses a policy that has been in place for nearly two decades, since the 2006 "shoe bomber" attempt. The move is intended to streamline and accelerate the airport security process for all travelers.</p>

          <p>Dan Osborn, a union leader and registered independent, has announced he will run for the U.S. Senate in Nebraska, challenging Republican incumbent Pete Ricketts. Osborn gained political prominence during his unexpectedly competitive but unsuccessful 2024 campaign against Sen. Deb Fischer. His new bid continues his populist platform, framing the race as a fight between the working class and the wealthy elite. Osborn is positioning himself as a moderate, supporting border security and opposing national abortion bans, while accusing Ricketts of being out of touch with everyday Nebraskans.</p>

The research, which followed over 100,000 people for 30 years, found a strong association between diets rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes and being free of chronic disease after age 70. The study identified the Alternative Healthy Eating Index as the dietary pattern most associated with positive health outcomes.

          <p>The German Armed Forces, or Bundeswehr, have experienced a significant increase in volunteer applications, with numbers rising by about 20% this year. Officials attribute this trend to heightened security concerns following the war in Ukraine, which has motivated more young people to serve. This comes as the German military aims to recruit up to 60,000 additional soldiers in the coming years to meet NATO demands. To achieve this goal, the defense minister is considering measures to make service more attractive and has not ruled out reactivating compulsory service.</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that many Americans are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," adjusting their financial habits based on their feelings about the economy. This has led to a trend of "revenge saving," a shift from the post-pandemic splurge of "revenge spending," as economic anxiety prompts people to build up their cash reserves. Financial experts advise that while saving more is positive, it should be intentional rather than emotional. They recommend strategies like reverse budgeting, automating savings, and creating separate accounts for different goals to build financial security effectively. (not investment advice)</p>
