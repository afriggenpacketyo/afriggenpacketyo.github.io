          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth uncrewed test flight of the Starship rocket, aimed at advancing Elon Musk's Mars ambitions. The launch reached orbit, marking progress, but a propellant leak led to a loss of attitude control, causing the spacecraft to spin. SpaceX lost contact with the upper stage, expecting it to disintegrate upon reentry over the Indian Ocean. The company will review data to improve Starship's reliability, emphasizing that success comes from learning during tests. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to fully pardon reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of evading taxes and defrauding banks of over $30 million. The pardon is part of Trump's pattern of using his clemency power to address what he views as the weaponization of the justice system. The Chrisleys, known for their show "Chrisley Knows Best," were found guilty in 2022 of financial fraud and tax evasion. Trump notified their daughter, Savannah, expressing his hope to finalize the pardon quickly, as the article indicates that Trump believes their treatment was "pretty harsh."</p>

          <p>Elon Musk voiced his "disappointment" with the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" passed by Republicans in the House, citing concerns over its impact on the budget deficit. Musk, who previously stepped back from running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), believes the bill undermines the work his team is doing to cut spending. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the tax provisions of the bill would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034. Musk stated that a bill can be big or beautiful, but not necessarily both.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States between 2016 and 2023. The percentage of mothers rating their mental health as "excellent" decreased, while those reporting "fair or poor" mental health increased, especially among single parents and those with uninsured children. Researchers suggest potential factors include high housing costs, childcare expenses, and the lack of national paid parental leave. Experts emphasize that these findings can help reassure struggling mothers that they are not alone.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines will implement its first checked bag fee, starting at $35 for the first bag and $45 for the second, effective tomorrow. This policy change applies to flights booked on May 28 or later, ending the airline's long-standing "bags fly free" policy. Certain customers, such as Business Select and A-List Preferred members, will receive free checked bags. The airline also announced changes to its flight credit policy, with credits expiring in six months to a year, depending on the fare type.</p>

          <h2>Tesco Shoppers Mock 'VAR'-Style Cameras at Self-Checkout</h2>

          <p>Tesco shoppers are humorously reacting to the supermarket's introduction of AI-powered cameras at self-checkouts, likening them to the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system used in football. The cameras aim to reduce shoplifting by identifying improperly scanned items and showing a replay to customers. While some shoppers joked about the technology, others expressed concerns about increased surveillance and vowed to avoid self-checkouts. The move comes as shoplifting in the UK has reached a record high, prompting retailers to implement enhanced security measures.</p>
