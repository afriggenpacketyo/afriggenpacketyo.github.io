          <p>Luke Humphries secured victory against Luke Littler in the Premier League Darts final, winning the ¬£275,000 prize. Littler initially took a 3-0 lead, but Humphries rallied to level the score and ultimately dominate the match with impressive darting. Despite Littler's strong performance throughout the campaign, setting a points record and claiming six nightly wins, he was unable to maintain his early lead. Both players displayed nerves, but Humphries found his rhythm after the break, securing the win with a double 10 finish. Despite his loss, Littler expressed satisfaction with his runner-up position and vowed to return next year, while Humphries and Littler are set to team up for England at the World Cup of Darts in Frankfurt in June.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have acquired former All-Star closer Alexis D√≠az from the Cincinnati Reds in an effort to bolster their bullpen amid early-season injuries. D√≠az, who had a successful rookie season in 2022 and an All-Star selection in 2023, has struggled recently and was demoted to triple-A. He will report to Arizona to work with the Dodgers' pitching group. The Dodgers gave up minor-league pitcher Mike Villani in the trade, hoping to revive D√≠az's once-promising career.</p>

          <p>Costco reported quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed estimates, driven by an 8% increase in sales. The warehouse club retailer's net income rose to $1.90 billion, or $4.28 per share, with comparable sales up 8% and e-commerce sales rising nearly 16%. Costco's competitive pricing and bulk discounts could benefit from economic uncertainties and potential tariff increases. The company's strong hand in price negotiations with suppliers further positions it favorably.
