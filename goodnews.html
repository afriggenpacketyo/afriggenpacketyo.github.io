          <p>OpenAI has secured a $200 million contract with the U.S. Defense Department to provide artificial intelligence tools, marking the first contract with OpenAI listed on the Department of Defense's website. The contract, part of a new initiative called OpenAI for Government, will focus on developing prototype AI capabilities for national security challenges. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed pride in engaging in national security areas, emphasizing that all use cases must align with OpenAI's usage policies and guidelines. This contract represents a small portion of OpenAI's revenue, which is generating over $10 billion in annualized sales.</p>

          <p>Singer Nezza sang a Spanish version of "The Star-Spangled Banner," titled ‚ÄúEl Pend√≥n Estrellado,‚Äù at Dodger Stadium, despite initial requests to sing it in English, as a response to immigration sweeps in Los Angeles. This performance has sparked renewed interest in the song's origins and the legacy of Clotilde Arias, a Peruvian immigrant who created the official Spanish translation of the anthem in 1945 at the request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Arias, a copywriter for major ad agencies, crafted lyrics that conveyed the original patriotic essence of the song, but her contribution remained largely unknown until her grandson rediscovered her work in 2006. Nezza views Arias's work as a symbol of American pride and a reminder of the significant contributions of Latinos to the nation.</p>

The White House clarified that the agreement was indeed with the UK, and Trump stated that it was not much different from one signed in May, emphasizing that it would produce jobs and income.</p>

The animals were found tethered to a leash outdoors in 99-degree weather, and Rainbow Brite's temperature was dangerously high upon arrival at the shelter. The owner surrendered the dogs, and they are now in foster care and will be available for adoption after spay/neuter surgeries and vaccines.</p>

Kim immediately denounced the failure as a "criminal act" and ordered immediate restoration, reflecting the regime's focus on naval power despite having an inferior fleet compared to its adversaries. Experts suggest that publicizing the capsizing was a deliberate political strategy, showing a shift from concealing negative truths to demonstrating accountability and addressing problems effectively.</p>
