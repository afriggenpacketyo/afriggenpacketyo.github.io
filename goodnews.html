          <p>The S&P 500 index closed at a new record, recovering significantly from a sharp decline in April caused by tariff concerns. Investor optimism has been fueled by calmer trade rhetoric from the Trump administration and expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. While recent positive trade news with China and India has bolstered the market, some analysts caution against complacency, noting that market volatility could return. The rally occurred alongside new data showing a slight increase in inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, ruling it was an unconstitutional violation of the First and Fifth Amendments. The order sought to punish the firm, which represented Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News, by restricting its access to federal buildings and targeting its clients and employee security clearances. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan described the order as a "shocking abuse of power" based on a "personal vendetta." This decision marks the fourth time a federal court has invalidated one of Trump's executive orders aimed at law firms he perceives as political enemies.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup provides significant financial rewards for participating clubs, with Manchester City and Chelsea already earning tens of millions just for playing. Manchester City could earn a total of approximately ¬£92 million if they win the tournament, a sum that eclipses the prize money from many other major competitions. The tournament's structure awards fees for participation, wins, and draws in the group stage, with prize money increasing substantially in the knockout rounds. These earnings have already been substantial enough for some clubs to cover the transfer fees of major new player signings, highlighting the tournament's significant financial impact on club football.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prominent financial advisor Ric Edelman now recommends that investment portfolios should allocate between 10% to 40% to cryptocurrencies, a substantial increase from his previous 1% suggestion. Edelman cites the evolution of crypto into a mainstream asset and the resolution of earlier questions about government bans and institutional adoption as reasons for his shift. He also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-to-bond model is obsolete due to increased human longevity, necessitating higher-return assets like crypto. He points to Bitcoin's lack of correlation with traditional assets as a way to improve portfolio diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

The club and Giroud mutually agreed to terminate his contract, with his final match scheduled for this Sunday before he returns to the French league to play for Lille. Although he had some memorable moments, including helping LAFC win its first U.S. Open Cup, he ultimately did not meet the high expectations set upon his arrival from AC Milan in 2024.

          <p>On July 1, minimum wage rates are set to increase in Alaska, Oregon, and Washington, D.C., as well as in a dozen other cities and counties, affecting over 800,000 workers. These state-level increases are the result of voter-approved ballot measures and automatic inflation adjustments, pushing baseline pay higher while the federal minimum wage has remained at $7.25 since 2009. According to the Economic Policy Institute, these raises will provide an average annual wage boost ranging from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska. The analysis also indicates that women, Black, and Hispanic workers will disproportionately benefit from the pay hikes.</p>

The deal aims to end a nearly three-decade-long conflict in eastern DRC that has resulted in millions of deaths and a severe humanitarian crisis. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump celebrated the agreement as a "glorious triumph for the cause of peace" and stated the U.S. would apply significant pressure, including financial penalties, to ensure both nations honor the terms. The agreement also reportedly allows for U.S. access to the DRC's significant mineral deposits.</p>

Manchester United is looking to strengthen its attack, having already signed another forward, but may face competition for Mbeumo from other clubs, including Tottenham.

The film "F1," starring Brad Pitt, provides not only spectacular racing sequences but also a solid, high-stakes drama that explores the broader industry beyond the drivers. In contrast, "M3gan 2.0" builds upon its predecessor with a larger scale and significantly more humor, though it leans less on horror. While the sequel's plot can be over-the-top, it serves as an effective and fun vehicle for action and sci-fi, with improved special effects and a clever commentary on artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>California legislators have voted to more than double the state's annual film and television tax credit program, increasing the cap from $330 million to $750 million. The move is a significant victory for Hollywood studios, unions, and workers who have been lobbying for support as other states and countries lure productions away with more generous incentives. Governor Gavin Newsom had called for the expansion to keep the industry competitive. A related bill aims to broaden eligibility for the credits and increase the rebate percentage, making California's program more comparable to those in states like Georgia, with the goal of bringing production back home.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the month of June, with its value surging over 40%. The rally is attributed to its recent inclusion in the benchmark index, positive regulatory developments like the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches. Analysts suggest the stock may have further to run, pointing to its strong revenue-sharing relationship with the recently listed and soaring Circle Internet Group. While declining crypto trading volumes present a potential risk, optimism remains high that legislative clarity could fuel further growth. (not investment advice)</p>
