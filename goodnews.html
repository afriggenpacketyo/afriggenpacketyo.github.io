        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Approximately 75% of the nation's health insurance providers have voluntarily committed to improving patient care by streamlining prior-authorization processes, which often delay treatments and create bureaucratic obstacles. Led by Dr. Mehmet Oz, the initiative aims to standardize electronic prior-authorization submissions for faster turnaround times, with a goal of operationalization by January 1, 2027. The commitments also include reductions in the use of medical prior-authorization and honoring existing approvals for 90 days when patients switch insurance plans. While the industry-led effort could improve patient experiences, it may also impact insurance companies' profits if patients seek care more frequently. </p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist recently released from ICE custody after being detained for over three months, spoke about his experiences in an interview. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained in March, with the Trump administration claiming his presence posed a risk to U.S. foreign policy, an assertion a judge rejected. Despite facing potential future detention, Khalil remains committed to advocating for Palestinian human rights, rejecting accusations of antisemitism and violence. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the judge's decision to release Khalil, claiming it undermined national security. </p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities without congressional approval has reignited the debate over the division of war powers between the executive and legislative branches. Article I of the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, while Article II designates the president as Commander in Chief. While presidents have historically engaged in military actions without formal declarations of war, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 sought to reassert congressional authority, though its effectiveness has been debated. Some legal scholars argue the recent strikes against Iran were unconstitutional without congressional authorization, while others suggest that informing Congress fulfills the resolution's requirements. </p>

          <p>Pixar's latest film, 'Elio,' experienced the studio's worst opening weekend ever, grossing only $21 million domestically. Despite positive reviews, the film's performance highlights the challenges original animated movies face in attracting audiences post-pandemic, especially when competing with established franchises. Analysts suggest that marketing may have played a role, as audiences may have been unfamiliar with the new title and characters. Disney remains hopeful that 'Elio' will find its audience throughout the summer, similar to the trajectory of 'Elemental,' and will continue to invest in original animated properties alongside sequels and franchise extensions. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top U.S. analyst suggests that China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, despite China's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil. Instead, China's approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its own interests, as demonstrated by its agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels. The analyst believes China's focus will remain on protecting its own economic interests rather than policing global waterways. While about 16% of China's seaborne crude comes from Iran, its approach would be shaped by long-standing economic interests. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged that the UK will meet a new NATO target of spending 5% of GDP on national security by 2035, with 3.5% allocated to core defense and 1.5% to defense-related areas such as resilience and security. The split target aims to accommodate both US pressure for increased spending and the financial constraints of EU countries. The government expects to reach 4.1% of GDP on national security by 2027, with the 1.5% resilience element met by the following year, but core defense spending is not expected to reach 3.5% until 2035. Alongside the spending commitment, the government published its National Security Strategy emphasizing competitiveness in science, education, trade, and technology. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran retaliated with a missile attack on a U.S. base in Qatar, which was reportedly intercepted with no casualties. President Trump characterized Iran's response as "very weak" and suggested that Iran may now be willing to negotiate in earnest. If no further Iranian attacks occur, Trump seems inclined to avoid further escalation, hoping for productive negotiations. This scenario mirrors a previous situation in 2020 when the U.S. chose not to escalate after an Iranian missile attack on military bases in Iraq. </p>

          <p>Oil futures experienced significant losses after President Trump announced that the U.S. received early notice of Iran's retaliatory missile strikes against a U.S. base in Qatar. This announcement fueled optimism that neither country intends to further escalate the conflict in the Middle East. West Texas Intermediate crude fell nearly 9% to around $67 per barrel, while Brent crude also dropped nearly 9% to almost $70 per barrel. The decline followed an initial surge in oil prices after the U.S.'s weekend strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, but the market quickly reversed course after Iran's retaliatory move.

          <p>An RAF flight has evacuated 63 British nationals and their dependents from Israel due to ongoing conflict with Iran. The flight transported vulnerable Britons and their families to Cyprus, from where they will be taken to the UK. A British national was injured in Israel during an Iranian missile attack.
