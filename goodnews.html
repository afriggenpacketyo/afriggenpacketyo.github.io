          <p>This guide provides a comprehensive, hole-by-hole breakdown of the Bethpage Black golf course, the host of the 2025 Ryder Cup. It details the yardage, par, and strategic challenges of each of the 18 holes, from the nerve-wracking first tee to the deceptively sloping final green. The analysis highlights key features such as elevated greens, deep bunkers, and long, arduous par-fours that define the course's notorious difficulty. The article offers insights into how professional players might approach each hole, noting where birdies are possible and where pars represent a significant achievement.</p>

          <p>Following his £18.1 million transfer to Manchester United, 23-year-old goalkeeper Senne Lammens is yet to make his debut for the club. Despite impressing in training with his calm presence and strong fundamentals, head coach Ruben Amorim has so far opted for the more experienced Altay Bayindir. The article explores the timing of Lammens' introduction, noting the lack of "soft landing" opportunities in lesser competitions following the team's EFL Cup elimination. While data suggests Lammens could be a significant upgrade over Bayindir, the club faces a strategic decision on when to field the young Belgian in a high-pressure Premier League environment.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's Ryan Gravenberch, once struggling after a move to Bayern Munich, has transformed into one of Europe's elite midfielders under manager Arne Slot. Initially utilized as a holding midfielder, Gravenberch has been given more attacking freedom this season, resulting in a significant increase in his offensive contributions, including goals and chances created. The article credits his resurgence to the trust placed in him by Slot, who adapted his role after a planned signing for another player fell through. Experts and former players now laud him as Liverpool's most important player, highlighting his unique ability to carry the ball and control the midfield.</p>

The company is advancing its experimental weight-loss injection, CT-388, into a final-stage Phase III trial, a critical step toward regulatory approval. Roche's CEO, Teresa Graham, expressed confidence in the company's strategy, which includes a pipeline of treatments acquired through recent biotech purchases and partnerships, such as the closely watched Petrelintide drug. The company is targeting a 2030 launch for its suite of obesity treatments in the increasingly competitive market.</p>

          <p>State-backed entities in China, known as the "national team," held approximately $553.1 billion in domestic stocks as of the end of June, reinforcing a recent bull run. This holding surpasses the total investment from foreign investors and accounts for 4.8% of the market's free-float capitalization. The significant state intervention is seen as a successful effort to ensure financial stability and promote the stock market as a viable alternative for household wealth, especially amid a downturn in the property sector. Analysts suggest this state support is likely to persist, potentially driving stocks even higher as it aligns with top leaders' policy goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has announced its intention to speed up the global rollout of its homegrown BeiDou navigation system, a rival to the U.S.-owned GPS. At a recent summit, Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang stated that after 31 years of development, the system is entering a new phase of global expansion with improved performance. BeiDou, which already holds over 70% of the domestic market share in China, powers a wide range of consumer products from smartphones to shared mobility services. The government is now focused on enlarging its "circle of international friends" and establishing BeiDou as a critical piece of infrastructure for users worldwide.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers demonstrated resilience in a 5-4 extra-innings victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks, reducing their magic number to clinch the division to one. A key storyline was the unconventional but successful use of starting pitchers Roki Sasaki and Clayton Kershaw as relievers to support a struggling bullpen. Sasaki, in his first appearance since May, threw a scoreless seventh inning with high velocity, while Kershaw pitched a clean ninth to send the game to extras. The win, secured by a Tommy Edman RBI single in the 11th, highlighted the team's need for creative solutions to overcome its persistent late-inning pitching problems.</p>

The ruling is a victory for 20 states that had sued, arguing the policy illegally held critical emergency preparedness funds hostage to the administration's immigration agenda. The judge found the policy to be "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," noting the irreparable harm states would suffer from the loss of disaster funds. The decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's broader effort to penalize so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit cooperation with ICE.</p>

The court's decision halts the execution of the birds while it decides whether to hear the owners' full appeal.

While Nvidia provides an equity investment to start, the majority of the funds will flow back to Nvidia as lease payments for the hardware used in new AI data centers.

          <p>Some cranberry farmers in Massachusetts are opting to convert their unproductive bogs back into natural wetlands through a state-sponsored ecological restoration program. This trend is driven by economic headwinds, including falling cranberry prices due to global competition and rising operational costs. The program pays farmers to undertake the restoration, which helps filter water, store carbon, and provide storm resilience, while allowing the farmers to retain ownership of the land. Over the last 15 years, the state has restored more than 500 acres, providing an alternative for aging farmers and preserving land that was originally wetlands before being converted for agriculture.</p>
