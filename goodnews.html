          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), citing concerns that her detention could stifle free speech among non-citizens. Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, was detained after writing an essay critical of Israel in a student newspaper. The judge emphasized that there was no evidence to suggest Ozturk posed a threat to American foreign policy interests, and that her detention could deter non-citizens from exercising their First Amendment rights. Ozturk testified about experiencing asthma attacks in detention due to poor conditions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco appears poised to temporarily block the Trump administration's sweeping overhaul of the federal government. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston indicated that the President must seek Congressional approval for significant government restructuring. The lawsuit, filed by labor unions, nonprofits, and local governments, argues that the overhaul violates the Constitution. The plaintiffs are seeking a temporary restraining order to halt mass layoffs and program closures, arguing that agencies are acting under the President's executive order without independent analysis or reasoned decision-making.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Individuals can collect Social Security benefits while receiving annuity payments, providing a stronger financial foundation for retirement. Social Security benefits do not have restrictions that would prevent receiving income from an annuity. However, claiming Social Security before full retirement age results in a smaller monthly check, while annuity income begins based on contract terms. Social Security benefits may become taxable depending on total income, including annuity payments, so retirees should consult with a retirement income specialist to structure their annuity and Social Security timing effectively.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 15:47:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity levels high, a HELOC can be a valuable financing source, but paying it back is critical. Homeowners should consider taking advantage of the interest-only payment period by paying more than just interest, monitoring the interest rate climate for opportunities to make larger payments, and using the HELOC for select home repairs and renovations to potentially benefit from tax deductions. Understanding potential early payment penalties is also essential. A personalized repayment strategy, possibly with the help of a lending expert, will be most effective for each borrower's budget.</p>

The company has partnered with Mercedes-Benz, which has successfully installed Factorial's battery in a car and made the wheels move. Solid-state batteries offer the potential for faster charging, longer ranges, and increased safety, but challenges remain in mass production. Factorial's pilot factory in South Korea faced "production hell," but the company has made progress and is now focused on perfecting the manufacturing process.</p>

Gold ETFs allow investment in gold at smaller amounts, though lacking physical tangibility. Fractional gold coins provide affordable physical metal, but require careful management.

          <p>Indiana Governor Mike Braun signed a bill that would strip charity hospitals of their non-profit status if they continue to charge high prices. The legislation, prompted by a Guardian investigation into high hospital prices, requires the state to establish a price benchmark for non-profit hospitals, which must then bring their prices below that average by 2029. Supporters say the law will reduce healthcare costs for businesses and patients. The Indiana Hospital Association expressed concern about the potential loss of non-profit status and rising cost pressures.</p>
