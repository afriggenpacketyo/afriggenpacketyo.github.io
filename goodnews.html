          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has continued his public commentary on competitor Palantir, stating he is "so inspired" by the data analytics firm's high market valuation. However, he also reiterated his critique of their pricing, calling Palantir's enterprise software the "most expensive" he has ever encountered and humorously suggesting he might not be charging enough. This exchange follows recent remarks where Benioff highlighted Salesforce's ability to offer a competitive product at a lower cost. The rivalry underscores the different growth trajectories and market perceptions of the two major software companies.</p>

          <p>Citing a slowdown in North American demand for battery-electric trucks, Stellantis has officially canceled the development of its all-electric Ram 1500 pickup. The company, which had already delayed the truck's launch, will now pivot its focus to an extended-range electric model that includes a gasoline engine as a generator. This vehicle, previously known as the "Ramcharger," will be rebranded as the "Ram 1500 REV" and is expected to launch next year. The decision reflects a broader strategic reassessment within the automotive industry as consumer adoption of EVs faces challenges.</p>

          <p>The state of Massachusetts has filed a lawsuit against the predictions market platform Kalshi, accusing the company of offering illegal sports gambling without a proper license. Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell stated that Kalshi is operating under the guise of "events contracts" while effectively functioning as a sportsbook. The lawsuit seeks to prevent Kalshi from offering sports-related contracts in the state while the case is pending. Kalshi has previously argued that its regulation by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission should preempt state-level oversight, setting up a legal clash over jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>The European Union plans to accelerate its review of the 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine vehicles, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The decision comes in response to significant pressure from European automakers, who argue the target is "no longer feasible" due to numerous challenges. Carmakers cite high manufacturing costs, dependency on Asia for batteries, insufficient charging infrastructure, and intense competition from Chinese electric vehicles. They are calling for a more flexible approach, including allowing for low-emission technologies and hybrid cars beyond the 2035 deadline.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates fall to their lowest levels in nearly a year, prospective homebuyers should keep several key strategies in mind to capitalize on the opportunity. This article advises that timing is crucial, as lenders often adjust rates in anticipation of Federal Reserve actions, meaning the best window may occur before an official rate cut. It also emphasizes the importance of a high credit score to secure the most favorable terms and the wisdom of prioritizing the right home over waiting for the perfect rate, as refinancing is always an option later. Finally, securing a mortgage pre-approval remains essential to demonstrate seriousness to sellers. (not investment advice)</p>
