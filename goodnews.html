          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 10:44:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A relationship expert suggests that couples who feel like they are constantly arguing should start a "relationship bank account." This involves making "deposits" through actions that prioritize the other person's happiness, creating a sense of security and trust. A positive balance in this account helps couples handle conflicts more effectively, while a negative balance can lead to escalated fights. By identifying what makes each partner feel loved and appreciated, couples can intentionally make deposits and improve their overall relationship dynamic, leading to less frequent and less intense arguments. The key is to ensure that deposits outweigh withdrawals, fostering a healthier and more enjoyable partnership.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer has stated that the government will not provide a blank check for the Sizewell C nuclear project, despite committing ¬£14.2 billion to the development. He emphasized the project's potential to create 10,000 jobs over the next decade and enhance the country's energy security. The investment aims to kickstart the construction of a new nuclear plant, but the project faces opposition due to its potential cost and environmental impact. The prime minister said the plant would "bring down bills for millions of people across the country".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has defended his government's revised policy on winter fuel payments, arguing that an improved economy has made it possible to extend the payment to more pensioners. Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less will receive the payment this winter. The Labour government had previously withdrawn the payments from all but the poorest pensioners to address the UK's financial challenges. Starmer attributed the policy shift to better-than-expected growth figures, falling interest rates, and new trade deals.</p>

Trump had announced Sajet's firing, citing her support for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.
