          <h2>Federal Reserve Weighs Impact of Trump's Tariffs on Economy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 10:20:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is carefully assessing the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on economic growth and inflation. A strong labor market has allowed the Fed to maintain stable interest rates, but the uncertainty caused by tariffs is raising concerns among businesses and consumers. Officials are debating whether the expected rise in consumer prices will be temporary or lead to sustained inflation, and they are prepared to act if their goals for a healthy labor market and stable prices come into conflict. The latest jobs report offered some reassurance, but traders have reduced their expectations for interest rate cuts this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prince Harry has lost his legal challenge to reinstate his automatic right to state-funded police protection when visiting the United Kingdom. A judge ruled that the government's decision to assess his security needs on a case-by-case basis was reasonable. Harry's lawyers argued that he faces significant security risks, but the court found that his sense of grievance did not justify overturning the government's decision. The ruling means Harry will continue to receive police protection only when deemed necessary by the relevant authorities.</p>

          <p>The Army is reportedly planning a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C., potentially coinciding with President Trump's birthday. The proposed parade would involve thousands of troops, vehicles, helicopters, and bands, as well as civilian participants. Planning documents outline concerns about logistical challenges, security requirements, and potential damage to roads. While the Army is enthusiastic about celebrating its 250th anniversary, the White House has not yet formally approved the parade, and high costs remain a significant consideration.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 10:09:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron plans to reduce the pace of its share buybacks due to declining crude oil prices, which have impacted the company's first-quarter profit. U.S. crude prices have fallen due to concerns that President Trump's tariffs will reduce demand, while OPEC+ plans to increase supply. Despite the slowdown in buybacks, Chevron is maintaining its overall guidance for shareholder returns. Analysts suggest the company's decision reflects a cautious outlook on the macroeconomic environment, anticipating further deterioration in oil markets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, starring Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, offers a surprisingly enjoyable experience amidst the franchise's recent struggles. The film centers on a team of morally gray antiheroes tasked with filling the void left by the Avengers. Directed by Jake Schreier, the movie embraces the anonymity of its ensemble cast and delivers a fun action movie about found family among mercenaries. Pugh's strong performance anchors the film, while the story remains relatively disconnected from the wider Marvel universe, making it a refreshing and engaging entry.</p>

This development is likely to spark further debate on immigration enforcement and the government's portrayal of threats along the border.

          <p>Exxon Mobil's first-quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street forecasts, although they declined compared to the previous year due to falling oil prices. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting measures, helped offset the impact of lower prices. CEO Darren Woods described the market as "choppy" and noted the uncertainty created by President Trump's tariffs. Exxon's global production business saw a significant increase in earnings, while its refining business experienced a decline due to lower margins.</p>
