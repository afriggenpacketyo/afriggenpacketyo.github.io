          <h2>Study Reveals Mummification Practices in Southern China Predate Ancient Egypt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 05:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new archaeological study suggests that large-scale mummification was practiced in southern China and Southeast Asia as early as 12,000 years ago. Researchers examining pre-Neolithic burials found evidence that many bodies were smoke-dried and arranged in specific postures. This timeline places these mortuary practices thousands of years before the earliest known mummification attempts in ancient Egypt and Chile, offering new insights into the rituals of the region's ancient hunter-gatherer societies.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the history of the "zarf," an ornate holder for small, hot coffee cups, which was a symbol of luxury and ritual during the Ottoman Empire. Often crafted from precious metals and adorned with jewels, zarfs were a functional piece of art used in the traditional Turkish coffee ceremony, which itself is recognized by UNESCO for its cultural significance. While the term is sometimes anachronistically applied to modern cardboard coffee sleeves, purists argue the zarf represents a rich cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>While German basketball is experiencing a golden era with recent international championships, the sport's domestic development faces a new challenge from the Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rules in U.S. college sports. The policies, which allow student-athletes to earn significant money, are luring top young German talent to American universities, creating a talent drain from the domestic Bundesliga. German league officials are now grappling with how to adapt and seek compensation for developing these players.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a "forgotten" royal castle at Finlaggan on the Scottish isle of Islay, dating back to the 12th and 13th centuries. The fortress, which included a fortified stone tower, great hall, and chapel, is believed to have been a power base for kings who ruled western Scotland before the rise of the MacDonald clan chiefs. These chiefs, known as the Lords of the Isles, later built their own palace on the site, turning it into the administrative center of their vast island kingdom.</p>
