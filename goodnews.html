          <p>Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa stated the company's immediate priority is to stabilize the struggling Japanese automaker amidst declining sales, the transition to electric vehicles, and intense global competition, especially from Chinese rivals. Espinosa believes the current plan is robust enough to address these challenges, including the impact of potential tariffs. The company plans to cut 11,000 jobs and close seven plants to streamline operations, following failed merger talks with Honda earlier in the year which would have potentially created the world's third largest automaker. Espinosa assumed leadership in April and faces a significant task to reverse Nissan's current trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

The Florida Panthers' brash and unapologetic attitude further fuels the sense of a proxy war, making an Oilers win all the more satisfying for many Canadians.

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is proposing the largest increase in defense spending since the Cold War, citing the need for the U.K. to be prepared for potential conflict in Europe. The 2025 Strategic Defence Review emphasizes "war-fighting readiness" and aims to create a "battle-ready, armor-clad nation" in response to the threat posed by Russia. This move aligns with similar shifts in defense posture among other NATO members like Poland and Germany. Uncertainty about the U.S.'s commitment to European defense under a potential Trump administration is also influencing the U.K.'s decision.</p>

Analysts expect more rate cuts later in the year but disagree on the timing, with some suggesting July and others pointing to September and December. The ECB will also publish its latest staff projections for inflation and economic growth, and is unlikely to give hints about how low rates could go. (not investment advice)</p>

The report highlights that Chinese exports will be "curbed by the newly imposed tariffs," disproportionately affecting private companies.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce ¬£15 billion in funding for transport projects across England, focusing on tram, train, and bus improvements in mayoral authorities. Greater Manchester and the West Midlands will receive significant investments for tram network extensions, while West Yorkshire will begin building a mass transit program. Six other metro mayors will also receive funding for various transport upgrades. The investment marks a shift away from the Treasury's stringent Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the southeast.</p>

          <p>Tesla's electric vehicle sales in Australia rebounded in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by record sales of the Model Y. While Tesla faces declining sales in the U.S. and Europe, Australian sales jumped to 3,897 vehicles, primarily due to the revamped Model Y compact SUV. Despite the May rebound, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down year-to-date compared to the same period last year, however, Tesla was able to regain a lead against BYD in vehicle sales in Australia. Tesla's global sales have been impacted by increased competition and reputational damage related to CEO Elon Musk's activities.</p>
