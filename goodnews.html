          <p>A research team from Xian Technological University in China has employed DeepSeek's AI model to create automated military simulation scenarios, significantly reducing the time required for commanders to plan battle strategies. Led by Fu Yanfang, the team's AI system can generate 10,000 scenarios in just 48 seconds, a task that previously took commanders 48 hours. Fu emphasized that large language models like DeepSeek's can "deconstruct and reconstruct complex battlefield situations" through extensive data training, marking a transformative shift in war design and decision-making processes. This article highlights the increasing integration of AI in military applications and its potential to reshape future warfare strategies.</p>

          <p>Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen is stepping down as CEO of Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company behind Wegovy, after eight years at the helm, with the company citing increasing competition and disappointing trial results as factors. Novo Nordisk's stock price has fallen significantly over the past year, prompting the board to initiate a search for a successor to ensure a smooth transition. Former CEO Lars Rebien S√∏rensen will join the board as an observer during this period. The company recently reported lower-than-expected first-quarter sales for Wegovy due to heightened competition in the obesity drug market, leading to a trimmed full-year sales growth forecast.</p>

          <p>Tennessee Representative Andy Ogles is urging House committees to investigate Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell, accusing him of obstructing ICE operations and aiding illegal immigrants, following comments critical of ICE after the agency arrested nearly 200 undocumented individuals. Ogles points to an executive order signed by O'Connell aimed at tracking interactions with federal immigration authorities, which Ogles views as a political weapon rather than a transparency initiative. This action follows similar scrutiny of other Democratic officials accused of impeding ICE, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested for running through the gates of an ICE facility. The Trump administration has frequently clashed with Democratic city officials over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Mike Novogratz detailed the arduous, nearly four-year process and over $25 million spent to list his crypto firm, Galaxy Digital, on the Nasdaq, describing the experience as "unfair, infuriating" and "un-American". He said the process, which should have taken 45 to 90 days, stretched to 1,320 days and involved nine rounds of comments with the SEC. Novogratz noted that auditing costs were significantly higher for Galaxy due to regulatory scrutiny, but he expects these fees to decrease now that the company is listed. Despite the challenges, Novogratz believes the ordeal strengthened Galaxy, which primarily funded its operations through investment gains and trading.</p>

          <p>Producing vehicles entirely from U.S.-sourced parts is exceedingly complicated and costly, according to industry experts and executives, who note that while tariffs have spurred some localization of supply chains, achieving 100% domestic content is not feasible. Ford CEO Jim Farley stated that sourcing 15% to 20% of vehicle parts in the U.S. is currently difficult or impossible, including semiconductors and labor-intensive wiring harnesses. Experts estimate that material costs alone would add thousands of dollars to a vehicle's price, potentially reducing demand. While tax breaks or consumer incentives could ease the burden, establishing new plants and mines for materials like steel and aluminum would take a decade or more.</p>

Strategies to secure good rates include exploring online banks and considering short-term CDs, with some banks offering rates between 4.40% and 4.15% APY for various terms. Experts recommend laddering CDs to take advantage of high short-term rates while also saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

Comey stated he was unaware of the seashells' potential meaning and opposes violence, later removing the post. The term 86 is a slang term far more often frequently used to mean getting rid of or throwing something out, though some interpreted the message as a call to assassinate Trump.</p>

Skeptics argue that today's AI excels at predicting the next word or pixel but lacks the human brain's ability to handle chaos, innovate, and exhibit empathy.

          <p>President Trump has signed an agreement allowing the United Arab Emirates to build the largest artificial intelligence campus outside the U.S., granting the UAE access to advanced AI chips.

Concerns about losing U.S. dominance in AI and the potential for the tech to be used by China previously limited the UAE's access to chips. The former FBI director James Comey is being investigated after posting a photo of seashells on Instagram that was interpreted as a threat to Trump.</p>
