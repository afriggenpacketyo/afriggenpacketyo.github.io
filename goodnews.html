          <p>The declining Chinese city of Hegang, located in the country's rust-belt region, is investing 1.2 billion yuan to construct a new airport, scheduled to open in 2027. This move is a strategic gamble to revive its struggling economy, which has been hit by industrial decline and a shrinking population, by improving connectivity and boosting trade with Russia. The Luobei Airport is expected to handle 450,000 passengers and 1,600 tonnes of cargo annually. Experts view this as a common strategy for smaller Chinese cities seeking economic breakthroughs through infrastructure development.</p>

          <p>Despite facing years of stringent U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has transformed into a formidable leader across China's entire artificial intelligence landscape. The company has diversified from telecommunications into AI chips, data centers, and large language models, positioning itself as a key competitor to American firms like Nvidia. U.S. sanctions inadvertently bolstered Huawei's status as a national champion, accelerating its development of a comprehensive AI hardware and software stack. The company is now leveraging its advanced technology, like the Ascend AI chips, in various industrial applications globally.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the U.S. to face drug and arms trafficking charges. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape and is linked to Ecuador's surge in violent crime and cocaine trafficking. His extradition follows a referendum in which Ecuadoreans approved the measure, marking a significant step in President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on organized crime. Fito is expected to plead not guilty in a U.S. federal court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing body of anecdotal evidence and early clinical research suggests that GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic and Zepbound, could be a breakthrough treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS, a common hormonal disorder linked to insulin resistance, have reported significant improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, weight gain, and hair loss after using these medications. While the drugs are not yet approved for PCOS, experts believe their ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss indirectly addresses the condition's root causes. However, larger trials and overcoming insurance hurdles remain significant challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to concerns about looming trade tariffs, market analyst Jim Cramer presents ten reasons why the stock market remains robust. He argues that strong corporate earnings, significant consumer and business tax relief from the "big beautiful bill," and massive infrastructure spending on data centers and the energy grid are creating powerful economic tailwinds. Additional positive factors include increased bank lending capacity, a renaissance in the U.S. energy sector, and a renewed M&A environment. Cramer suggests these elements will fuel economic growth and outweigh the potential negative impacts of trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent clashes of the 1980s miners' strike. The incident on June 18, 1984, involved violent confrontations between thousands of police officers and striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what she called "discredited evidence." Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for years, expressed cautious elation at the news.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's victory at The Open has cemented his position as the most dominant force in men's golf, drawing frequent comparisons to Tiger Woods in his prime. This win marks his fourth major title, and his machine-like consistency and ability to close out tournaments have become his trademark. Peers and commentators note his "Tiger-like" dominance, even as Scheffler himself remains humble about the comparison. His success is attributed to a combination of his unflappable mental game and a significant improvement in his putting after adopting a new technique.</p>
