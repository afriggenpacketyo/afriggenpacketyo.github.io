          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump who participated in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing the pardon she received from him. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes that accepting the pardon would legitimize what she sees as a false narrative surrounding the events of that day. She has enlisted the help of her Republican senator to formally reject the pardon and is critical of others who have embraced their pardons. Hemphill's stance contrasts with many other January 6th defendants who actively sought and celebrated their pardons. </p>

          <p>Australia, despite having a relatively small population, has produced a surprising number of successful actors, directors, and crew members in Hollywood. Institutions like the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) have played a crucial role in cultivating this talent, instilling a 'can-do' attitude and a strong work ethic. Many Australian actors are known for their ability to mask their accents and their down-to-earth personalities, contributing to their success in the industry. The remoteness of Australia allows actors to develop their skills without the constant scrutiny of Hollywood, fostering a unique creative environment. </p>

          <p>Germany's new Chancellor Friedrich Merz called President Xi Jinping of China to propose a deal regarding the war in Ukraine. Merz urged Beijing to support joint US-European efforts for a ceasefire, framing it as a matter of German national security. This signals a shift from a values-based approach to a strategic, realpolitik approach in German foreign policy. The message was that Germany would engage China, but only on Europe‚Äôs moral terms. </p>

          <p>Former President Bill Clinton has defended Joe Biden's cognitive health, dismissing claims of decline as unfounded. In an interview, Clinton stated that he found Biden to be 'on top of his briefs' and in 'good shape,' even after long talks. Clinton attributed the concerns about Biden's health to political motivations. The former president added that he didn't read a recent book alleging cognitive decline in Biden because he believes it is being used to blame Biden for Trump's reelection. </p>
