          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert known for his work on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, has pleaded guilty to eight counts under the Terrorism Act 2000. Ojiri failed to disclose a series of high-value art sales to an individual suspected of financing Hezbollah, a proscribed group. This marks the first prosecution of its kind under the legislation, which requires individuals to notify the police if they suspect a business associate of involvement in financing a proscribed group. The alleged offenses occurred between October 2020 and December 2021, highlighting the importance of reporting suspicious financial activities to combat terrorism financing.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a tariff deal reducing or removing tariffs on some goods traded between the countries, including cars, steel, and aluminum. Car tariffs are cut to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars, while steel and aluminum tariffs are scrapped, but quotas will be imposed. Pharmaceuticals are still under negotiation, and the UK's digital services tax remains a sticking point. While celebrated as a positive step, industry leaders express caution about the quota's potential to limit exports and the complexities of supply chain conditions.</p>

          <p>Shoji Nishida, a lawmaker from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, has apologized for and retracted controversial remarks concerning exhibits at the Himeyuri Peace Museum in Okinawa. Nishida had suggested that the museum's portrayal of wartime history implied Japanese soldiers caused the deaths of the Himeyuri student corps during the Battle of Okinawa. His comments sparked criticism from Okinawans and fellow lawmakers, leading to his apology and retraction. The Himeyuri student corps' fate is a tragic part of the Battle of Okinawa, where over 200,000 people died, including many female students and teachers.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the White House's exploration of policies to boost America's birth rate, including a baby bonus, and argues for more comprehensive support for mothers. While baby bonuses have had mixed results in other countries, policies like paid parental leave and expanded public child care consistently incentivize births and improve maternal health. The author suggests a renewed expansion of the child tax credit would be a simpler first step. Investing in mothers from pregnancy through childbirth and across the years of raising children is what will make a real difference.</p>
