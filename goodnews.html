          <p>Stock for video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) increased by 15% following reports of a potential deal to take the company private for approximately $50 billion. The deal, which could be announced soon, reportedly involves investors such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Silver Lake. If completed, it would represent the largest leveraged buyout in history, surpassing the 2007 deal for TXU Energy. EA is known for major gaming franchises like The Sims, Madden NFL, and the FC soccer series, and its stock has seen a 32% rise year-to-date with these recent gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a recent television appearance, actress Valerie Bertinelli, 65, shared that she has never been asked out on a traditional first date. She explained that her relationships, including her first marriage to the late musician Eddie Van Halen, began without the formality of a typical date. Bertinelli recounted meeting Van Halen backstage at a concert, after which they were "together ever since" and married eight months later. She also spoke about the emotional abuse she endured in her second marriage to Tom Vitale, from whom she split in 2022, and her journey of healing from that experience.</p>

The late-night show returned to the air on its ABC stations Friday night. Following a six-day suspension by Disney's ABC, Sinclair and Nexstar, which together represent about a quarter of the network's affiliates, had continued to block the program. Sinclair stated its decision was based on ensuring programming is accurate and engaging for the widest possible audience while honoring network obligations.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Suggest Early October as an Opportune Time to Open a Certificate of Deposit</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve having recently cut interest rates, savers are facing diminishing returns, but opening a Certificate of Deposit (CD) in early October still presents advantages. Locking in a fixed rate now allows interest to begin compounding immediately, maximizing returns before rates potentially fall further. Experts predict a high probability of another Fed rate cut at the end of October, which could prompt banks to lower their CD rates in anticipation. Acting proactively in the first half of the month could help savers secure a more attractive rate before they decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia's recent announcement of a $100 billion investment in OpenAI underscores the chipmaker's growing influence as a key capital provider in the artificial intelligence sector. This deal follows several other multi-billion dollar investments in companies like Intel and various AI startups, expanding Nvidia's portfolio of nonmarketable equity securities to $3.8 billion. The company leverages its dominant position and highly sought-after AI chips to gain equity and strategic insight into the AI ecosystem. While Nvidia becomes a "preferred" supplier in many deals, it does not require the companies it invests in to exclusively use its technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum have been readmitted to the UK's Labour Party after a year-long suspension. They were among seven left-wing MPs who had the whip withdrawn after voting against the government to scrap the two-child benefit cap, a policy Labour's leadership had not committed to abolishing. This move signals a potential softening of the party's stance on the controversial welfare policy, which is facing increasing pressure for repeal from within Labour ranks. The reinstatement comes ahead of the party's annual conference, where the issue is expected to be a key topic.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card delinquencies rising, understanding the timeline for late payments is crucial for consumers to mitigate financial damage. While a payment is technically late the day after its due date, most issuers offer an unofficial grace period of a few days before charging a fee. The first major consequence occurs after 30 days, when the late payment is typically reported to credit bureaus, damaging one's credit score. At 60 days, issuers may impose a high penalty APR, and after 90 days, more aggressive collection efforts can begin, potentially leading to account closure and severe credit damage.

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced it will allow Boeing to resume issuing its own airworthiness certificates for some new 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, a sign of returning regulatory confidence. This authority was revoked for the MAX in 2019 following two fatal crashes and for the 787 in 2022 due to production flaws. Under the new plan, the FAA and Boeing will issue the safety certificates on alternating weeks, allowing FAA inspectors to focus more on the production process itself. The decision comes as Boeing works to stabilize its manufacturing and recover from recent safety crises, including a midair door panel blowout in early 2024.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has slightly decreased. For a $150,000 loan, current average rates would result in a monthly payment of approximately $1,847 for a 10-year term or $1,452 for a 15-year term. This represents a modest saving of about $16 per month compared to rates from earlier in the year. While the immediate savings are not dramatic, the potential for further rate cuts in the coming months could make tapping into home equity an increasingly attractive option for homeowners.

These fossils, discovered in 1891 by Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois on the island of Java when it was a Dutch colony, are among the first known remains of Homo erectus. The decision follows a recommendation from a government committee, which concluded the fossils were likely removed against the will of the local population and are of spiritual and economic importance to Indonesia.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "rule of thirds" is a retirement income strategy designed to provide both security and flexibility for retirees concerned about outliving their savings. The rule suggests converting one-third of one's retirement portfolio into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the savings can then be invested for growth or kept liquid for unexpected costs, balancing a steady, pension-like income stream with the potential for market gains. This approach aims to reduce stress during market volatility and may allow for higher overall withdrawal rates. (not investment advice)</p>
