          <h2>First Malaria Treatment Specifically for Infants Receives Approval</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new malaria treatment developed by Novartis, specifically formulated for babies and very young children weighing under 4.5kg, has been approved for use. This breakthrough addresses a critical treatment gap, as infants were previously given modified doses of drugs for older children, posing a risk of overdose. The drug, Coartem Baby, is expected to be rolled out in African nations within weeks, where malaria disproportionately affects children under five. The development, a collaboration with the non-profit Medicines for Malaria Venture, is being hailed as a major public health advancement.</p>

          <p>Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman has been discharged from the intensive care unit and moved to a rehabilitation facility over three weeks after being shot multiple times in his home. His wife, Yvette Hoffman, was also severely injured in the attack but was released from the hospital in June. The shooting is believed to be connected to the fatal attack on State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband on the same night. The alleged perpetrator, Vance Boelter, is in custody facing multiple federal and state charges, including murder and attempted murder.</p>

          <h2>TSA Begins Phasing Out 'Shoes-Off' Policy at US Airports</h2>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its long-standing policy requiring passengers in general security lines to remove their shoes at many U.S. airports. An internal memo indicated the change would be rolled out nationwide, allowing travelers to keep their footwear on unless they trigger a security alarm. This marks a significant shift from the rule implemented in 2006, five years after Richard Reid attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his shoes on an American Airlines flight. The change aims to speed up the security screening process for all travelers.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that a single injection of a gene therapy can reverse a form of congenital deafness within weeks. In a clinical trial, the therapy delivered a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, leading to significant hearing improvement in all 10 participants, who suffered from a genetic hearing impairment. The effects were particularly pronounced in children, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly full hearing and the ability to hold conversations. Researchers are hopeful this safe and well-tolerated method can be adapted to treat other common genetic causes of deafness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore is emerging as an increasingly attractive destination for Chinese students seeking overseas education, as the United States loses some of its appeal. Industry insiders suggest that growing safety concerns and cultural adjustment difficulties in the U.S. are prompting more Chinese nationals to consider Singapore's top universities. Students are drawn to Singapore's multicultural environment, high-quality education, and relative economic and diplomatic openness. While the U.S. has historically been the top choice, this shift could lead to a notable increase in applications to Singaporean institutions from China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is advancing a permanent ordinance to curb "renovictions," where landlords evict tenants under the guise of substantial remodels to charge higher rents. The new amendment will prevent landlords from using renovations as a "just cause" for eviction unless they have a formal order from a government agency citing code violations. The city is also developing rules that would require landlords to provide and pay for comparable temporary housing for displaced tenants during legitimate, necessary remodels. This follows a temporary measure enacted earlier this year to protect renters from such displacement tactics.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost its economy and tourism sector, China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa. This policy has led to a noticeable increase in foreign visitors, with travel companies reporting a significant rise in bookings from eligible regions. The move is designed to make travel to China less of a hassle, reversing the slow recovery of international tourism since the end of COVID-19 restrictions. The policy notably includes most of Europe and parts of Asia and Latin America.</p>

          <p>Caltech has announced it will terminate its partnership with the e-learning company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit that alleged the firm misrepresented a cybersecurity boot camp. The lawsuit, filed by a former student, claimed the program was marketed with the prestigious Caltech name despite having minimal connection to the university's faculty or oversight. As part of a settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn agreed to changes ensuring more transparency, and Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition to hundreds of students. The university will also establish a new faculty committee to oversee similar external education programs.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to lay off tens of thousands of employees, stating that a large-scale reduction-in-force is no longer necessary. The agency is on track to reduce its staff by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a hiring freeze, which it claims has eliminated the need for the previously considered cuts. The initial plan, aimed at returning staffing to 2019 levels, would have cut over 80,000 jobs. Critics argue the staff reduction is due to a toxic work environment and will inevitably harm services for veterans.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion follow-on order for 36 AH-64E Apache Guardian attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly driven by the demonstrated vulnerability of helicopters to modern air defenses and drones, as seen in the war in Ukraine, as well as a significant increase in the aircraft's cost. A member of South Korea's National Assembly stated that the country must invest in future warfare capabilities like drones and smart systems rather than expensive legacy platforms. The move reflects a growing global reevaluation of the attack helicopter's role on the modern battlefield.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not pursue legal action against the thousands of people who participated in the city's Pride parade, despite the event being officially banned by the government. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was fueled by Budapest's mayor declaring it an official municipal event, theoretically exempting it from the ban. The decision comes as a relief to participants who faced potential fines, though the mayor and organizers still face possible prison time for organizing a prohibited gathering under Hungary's controversial anti-LGBTQ+ laws.</p>
