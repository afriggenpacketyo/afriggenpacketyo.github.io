          <h2>Trump Suggests Potential Tariff Reduction on Chinese Goods Ahead of Trade Discussions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 08:36:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs on China to 80% from the existing 145% before the U.S. and Beijing engage in trade discussions in Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to lead the U.S. delegation in these talks, which aim to foster stability in trade relations. This potential reduction signals a shift in Trump's approach, who previously resisted lowering tariffs to initiate negotiations with China. The move comes amid concerns about declining goods shipments from China to the U.S., raising fears of potential price hikes and shortages.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he nominated Dr. Casey Means for U.S. Surgeon General based on the recommendation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., admitting he does not personally know her. Means, known for her "Make America Healthy Again" advocacy, replaced Trump's initial nominee, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, who will reportedly take on a senior policy role working with Kennedy. Means has gained recognition as a wellness influencer and co-authored a book on chronic diseases. The reasons for Nesheiwat's nomination being withdrawn remain unclear.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the volatility of the stock market in response to President Trump's trade policies, particularly his UK trade deal announcement. The author argues that trying to time the market based on these events is a flawed approach. The S&P 500's rapid recovery after an initial post-election surge and subsequent dip highlights the difficulty of making successful portfolio moves based on trade news. The article emphasizes that consistent investment strategies, rather than reactive trading, are more likely to yield positive results.</p>
