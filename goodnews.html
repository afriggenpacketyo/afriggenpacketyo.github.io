Institutional investors are returning to the stock market, and local investors are shifting from property to IPOs, leveraging financial tools to increase their chances of winning share lotteries. Mark Yue, a fintech worker, has participated in multiple IPOs using margin financing, selling shares on the first day of trading for an average 10% return.

          <p>SpaceX launched a commercial crew to the International Space Station (ISS), led by Peggy Whitson, America's most experienced astronaut, marking Axiom Space's fourth non-government mission. The crew includes first-time fliers from India, Poland, and Hungary, traveling in a new SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. The mission aims to conduct scientific research, technology demonstrations, and educational events while in orbit. This flight was initially delayed due to an oxygen leak and concerns about air leaks in a Russian compartment on the ISS, but it proceeded after the resolution of these issues, marking a significant step in commercial spaceflight and international collaboration.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Commission approved a new policy allowing the LAPD to deploy drones as first responders on routine emergency calls. This decision expands the use of drones beyond dangerous situations and aims to provide officers with real-time information about potential threats. A pilot program is set to launch in four police divisions, with the department reporting back on its progress within six months. While officials assure the public that the policy will not be used unconstitutionally, critics remain skeptical and fear disproportionate deployment in communities of color.</p>

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London will display a newly discovered dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, which lived approximately 150 million years ago. Initially misclassified as a Nanosaurus, scientists now recognize it as a distinct animal that roamed alongside larger dinosaurs like the Stegosaurus. The Enigmacursor, about the size of a labrador, features unique leg bones and a small head, suggesting it was a fast runner. This discovery helps scientists understand the diversity of dinosaurs during the Late Jurassic period, filling gaps in knowledge about the evolution of larger dinosaur species.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer reports that Wall Street's concerns about Chinese startup DeepSeek surpassing leading AI companies have diminished, leading to a resurgence in AI stocks. He notes that the data center renaissance, benefiting companies like Nvidia and AMD, is back in focus. Investors had previously panicked over DeepSeek's AI model, which appeared as advanced as competitors but required less money and energy to function. Cramer suggests that the recovery of AI stocks demonstrates that fears about DeepSeek's dominance were short-lived and that the market's initial reaction was an overreaction.

          <p>The article discusses how voters and politicians now treat scandal as just another factor in a cost-benefit analysis, rather than a simple disqualifier. Andrew Cuomo's comeback illustrates this shift, benefiting from scandal fatigue and polarized politics. Voters may be more willing to support a flawed candidate if they believe that candidate is more electable or if they find the rival's worldview unacceptable. The author argues that scandals can still hurt a flawed politician, but voters may not hold their leaders to a higher moral standard.</p>

          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer dismissed all active gang injunctions, affecting 317 people, citing a 2022 Assembly Bill that narrowed the legal definition of gang activity. The decision follows pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued that the injunctions were racially biased. These injunctions, some in effect since 2006, restricted suspected gang members from wearing certain clothes or associating with others in designated areas. The move reflects a broader trend in California away from gang injunctions, with other jurisdictions ceasing enforcement due to legal challenges and declining gang violence.</p>
