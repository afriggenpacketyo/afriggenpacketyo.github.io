          <p>Actress Candace Cameron Bure discusses her new devotional, "100 Days of Joy and Strength," explaining how her Christian faith provides support during challenging moments. She shares that God's presence is constant, even in times of failure, which she believes builds courage and stamina. The book aims to offer readers a brief, daily connection with God through personal stories, Bible verses, and prayers, reminding them that they are not alone and can draw strength from their faith. Bure also reflects on how slowing down and listening for divine guidance has become a crucial part of her daily life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its proposed welfare reform bill after facing a substantial rebellion from over 120 of its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and stated the government is now in a "better position" to pass the legislation. The changes include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and abandoning a freeze on the health-related component of universal credit. Rebel MPs have indicated they will now likely support the bill, averting a major defeat for the prime minister.</p>

          <p>England international and Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin has announced his departure from the club after nine years. The 28-year-old, whose contract expires on Monday, confirmed the "incredibly difficult decision" in a social media post.

He expressed his gratitude to the managers, coaches, and teammates who supported him during his time at Everton, which he described as his home since he was 19.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted to advance the "One Big Beautiful Bill" late Saturday night after intense negotiations secured the support of four conservative holdouts. Senators Ron Johnson, Rick Scott, Mike Lee, and Cynthia Lummis flipped their votes after receiving promises for a future amendment vote on Medicaid changes and further deficit reduction talks. The procedural vote was a key victory for Republican leadership and President Trump, who celebrated the outcome on social media. However, final passage is not guaranteed, as some senators who voted to proceed have not committed to supporting the final version of the roughly 1,000-page bill.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst market uncertainties, some top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending dividend-paying stocks as a strategy to enhance returns. Three companies highlighted are McDonald's (MCD), EPR Properties (EPR), and Halliburton (HAL). Analysts see potential in McDonald's due to its brand power and defensive qualities, while EPR Properties, a real estate investment trust, is seen as poised for growth due to an improved cost of capital. Oilfield services company Halliburton is favored for its strong international market presence and opportunities for idiosyncratic growth, which could support strong free cash flow.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this commentary, author and activist V (formerly Eve Ensler) reflects on the challenge of resisting despair in a political climate she describes as authoritarian and suffocating. She argues that survival depends on holding onto dualities: feeling pain but being moved to action, and acknowledging harsh realities without succumbing to hopelessness. V emphasizes that collective actions like marches are vital for building community and resolve, and that true resistance lies in caring for one another and believing the impossible is possible. She concludes that protecting one's humanity is a powerful form of resistance that authoritarians cannot take away.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after its initial public offering on June 29, 2010, Tesla's stock has grown nearly 300-fold, transforming a $10,000 investment into almost $3 million. The company has evolved from a niche sportscar maker into a global automotive giant, though its journey has been marked by extreme volatility. CEO Elon Musk is now shifting the company's focus away from mass-market cars and towards solving autonomous driving and developing humanoid robots. Despite recent sluggish sales and concerns over Musk's political activities, the company's history demonstrates a pattern of dramatic swings and long-term growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One hundred years after a major earthquake devastated downtown Santa Barbara, experts say the event still holds important lessons for seismic preparedness in California. The 1925 quake exposed the deadly vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, a problem that took decades for many cities to address with mandatory retrofit laws. The event also spurred Santa Barbara to adopt a cohesive Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style that defines the city today. However, lessons about retrofitting other vulnerable structures, like soft-story apartment buildings, have not been universally applied, leaving many areas susceptible to the next "Big One."</p>
