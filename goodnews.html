          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has stated he will leave the club if forced to manage an excessively large squad. Guardiola expressed dissatisfaction with leaving several senior players out of the recent match against Bournemouth. He emphasized his desire to work with a smaller, more cohesive group, stating it is "impossible for my soul" to leave players consistently on the sidelines. Guardiola's stance follows a January spending spree after key injuries and suggests potential summer exits to reduce the squad size.</p>

Epic Games updated the game to take payments directly, leading to a legal battle. A recent court ruling favored Epic, allowing apps to link out for payments without Apple's commission. Fortnite had to pass Apple's App Review process to return. The ruling has prompted other app makers to add links to purchase content directly.</p>
