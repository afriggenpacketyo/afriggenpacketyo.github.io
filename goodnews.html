        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail company to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in UK rail policy. The first nationalized service departed from Woking to Surbiton, integrating SWR into Great British Railways (GBR), which will oversee railway infrastructure. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander emphasized service improvements and infrastructure reinvestment but refrained from promising lower fares. Unions have voiced concerns about outsourcing, while the Conservatives are urging Labour to fulfill its promises, as the initial service was a rail replacement bus, mirroring the first privatized service in 1996.</p>

The first book, "Noodle Loses Dad," tells the story of orphaned wolf cubs taken in by a family of monkeys, reflecting Sarah's own journey through loss and finding a new home.

          <p>Despite securing key trade deals with the U.S., India, and the European Union, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing record low approval ratings. A recent YouGov poll showed that 69% of voters have an unfavorable view of Starmer, with a significant drop in support among Labour voters. While the government touts its trade achievements, cost-of-living pressures and tax increases are concerning voters and businesses. Some analysts suggest Starmer's lack of charisma and perceived anti-growth measures are contributing to his unpopularity, despite positive assessments of his foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's high-end property market continues to thrive despite a national downturn, with wealthy buyers investing in luxury homes as value-preserving assets. The One Central Park development sold out all 64 units, generating 4 billion yuan in sales. The project's year-to-date sales have exceeded 10.8 billion yuan, making it the first residential project in China to surpass 10 billion yuan in 2025. The sale triggered a points-based allocation system to curb speculative buying, highlighting the sustained strength of luxury home sales in the city.</p>

          <p>Despite the world largely moving on from the COVID-19 pandemic, Japanese hospitals continue to enforce strict visitation restrictions, causing distress for families wanting to see loved ones, especially those terminally ill. Doctors and social workers are calling for the abolition or curbing of these restrictions, citing them as a violation of human rights. While the health ministry recommends considering visitation opportunities, specific policies are left to individual hospitals, leading to inconsistencies and concerns about patient well-being.</p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park's Tioga Road, a popular scenic section of Highway 120, will reopen on Memorial Day after being closed since November due to snow and ice. The reopening is about two weeks earlier than last year, and the park service is bracing for a busy season. Visitors planning to enter Yosemite during peak hours will need a reservation and should expect wait times. The park may face staffing shortages due to federal budget cuts.</p>

          <h2>Work Stress Can Transfer to Dogs, Study Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 22:10:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may pass anxiety to their pets. The research found that dogs of owners with higher job stress showed more stress-related behaviors, even when accounting for other stressors in the home. This "crossover" effect is driven by owners who mentally take work home, and dogs' sensitivity to their owners' moods contributes to this phenomenon. Maintaining consistent routines and avoiding work-related ruminations can help protect the well-being of dogs.</p>
