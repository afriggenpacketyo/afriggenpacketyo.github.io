          <h2>Opinion: The 'China Shock' May Have Benefited America</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece challenges the widely held belief that China's rise has negatively impacted the American job market, particularly in manufacturing. The article questions the "China shock" narrative, which claims that millions of American jobs were lost due to cheap Chinese goods. It references research by economists like David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson, whose work has been influential in shaping the debate around the impact of trade with China. The author suggests that the benefits of affordable goods may outweigh the alleged job losses.</p>

          <p>Analysts are raising their price target for CrowdStrike to $500 per share, following what they consider a shortsighted sell-off after the company's recent earnings report. Despite mixed guidance, CrowdStrike reported strong revenue growth and better-than-expected profitability, with CEO George Kurtz highlighting the accelerating adoption of the Falcon Flex subscription model. The demand for cybersecurity solutions is expected to continue growing as AI advances and cyber threats become more sophisticated. Cybersecurity is considered a critical expense for corporations, making CrowdStrike a must-have investment for the digital age. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With women's football gaining global prominence, including a larger representation at the upcoming Summer Olympics, Japan is looking to emulate the success seen in Europe. European clubs are drawing large crowds and generating significant revenue from women's games, contrasting with Japan's WE League, which is still developing. The WE League is working to acquire sponsors and stabilize its financial base, with collaborations between the J-League and the JFA aiming to boost attendance.

          <p>In Texas, Republican factions united to pass most, but not all, of their conservative priorities during this year's legislative session. This outcome illustrates the limitations of right-wing governance, even in a state known for its conservative leanings. The article suggests that despite a unified front on many issues, certain priorities faced resistance or failed to gain enough support for passage. This highlights the complexities and nuances within the Republican party itself.</p>
