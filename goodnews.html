          <p>Los Angeles is encountering significant hurdles as it prepares to host the 2028 Summer Olympics, including recovering from recent fires, a projected budget deficit, and potential federal funding cuts. Mayor Karen Bass and organizing committee chairman Casey Wasserman remain confident that the Games will benefit the city. Concerns include the fires diverting attention from the Olympics, potential funding cuts from the Trump administration, and worker shortages due to immigration policies. Bass draws parallels to the successful 1984 Olympics, which occurred during a recession, emphasizing the city's ability to overcome challenges. Optimism score is based on the author's neutral reflection assuming relative aforementioned seriousness.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 22:48:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As immigration enforcement intensifies in the United States, the Latino community with permanent residency is increasingly seeking naturalization. This trend is seen as both a means of protection against deportation and an opportunity to promote civic participation in upcoming congressional elections. USCIS reported over 7.9 million people naturalized in the last decade, with numbers rising further in 2025 following increased ICE activity under the Trump administration. Academics note that this surge in naturalization also presents an opportunity for increased electoral participation and a potential counterbalance to President Trump's policies.

          <p>The Indiana Fever experienced their worst loss of the season in their first game without Caitlin Clark, who is sidelined with a quad injury. The Washington Mystics defeated the Fever 83-77, highlighting Clark's importance to the team. The Fever's offense struggled, scoring their lowest point total of the season, while the Mystics dominated much of the game. Clark is expected to miss at least two weeks, leaving the Fever to adjust their strategy in her absence.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending legal protections for hundreds of thousands of people who entered the U.S. through Biden-era programs. The order applies to Ukrainians, Afghans, military members, and their relatives, requiring the government to restart processing applications for migrants renewing their status. Judge Indira Talwani stated that terminating these programs would be unlawful and cause widespread disruption. The decision is a victory for civil and immigrant rights groups, who argued against stripping legal status from those already granted it.

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% increase in data center sales. The company's stock rose in extended trading following the announcement, with CEO Jensen Huang noting strong global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure. However, Nvidia's guidance would have been higher if not for export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. Despite this, the company continues to grow aggressively, fueled by demand for its artificial intelligence chips used in applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT (not investment advice).</p>

CEO Marc Benioff highlighted the company's plan to acquire Informatica for $8 billion, its priciest acquisition since the Slack deal. The company introduced the AgentExchange marketplace for AI agents and is finding gains from internal use of its Agentforce agent, which helped reassign 500 customer support workers and save $50 million (not investment advice).</p>
