          <p>Daniel Levy has ended his nearly 25-year tenure as the executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, a move reportedly initiated by the club's ownership. During his leadership, Levy oversaw significant infrastructure developments, including a new £1 billion stadium, but faced persistent criticism from fans over a lack of on-field success, with the club securing only two major trophies. His departure marks a significant shift in the club's leadership, with Peter Charrington appointed as the new non-executive chairman.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's call for a new global order centered on "true multilateralism" is resonating with developing nations, particularly in the Muslim world. As U.S. global influence is perceived to be waning, Beijing's vision appeals to countries frustrated with Western-led institutions like the IMF and World Bank. The piece suggests that many states in the Global South are seeking to diversify their political and economic alliances, viewing China as an alternative partner that promises a more inclusive international framework.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates have seen a gradual but steady decline throughout 2025, offering some relief to potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance. For example, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped by more than half a percentage point since the beginning of the year. While rates remain higher than their historic lows from a few years ago, the downward trend is encouraging, with experts suggesting further small reductions are possible depending on future Federal Reserve policy and Treasury yields.

          <p>Broadcom reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, largely driven by a significant 63% increase in revenue from its artificial intelligence-related products, which reached $5.2 billion. The company, which develops custom AI accelerators and networking components for major cloud companies, also provided a strong revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter. This performance reflects the high demand for AI infrastructure and has contributed to a substantial rise in Broadcom's stock value over the past year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a visit to Ecuador, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the United States will designate the gangs Los Lobos and Los Choneros as foreign terrorist organizations. This designation allows Washington to impose sanctions, freeze assets, and increase intelligence sharing to combat the groups' influence, which has contributed to a surge in violence and cocaine trafficking. The U.S. also pledged over $19 million in security and technology assistance to support Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on organized crime.</p>

          <p>The New Orleans Saints' official social media account publicly pushed back against comments made by ESPN analyst Ryan Clark, who claimed that legendary quarterback Drew Brees was not a "generational talent." Clark grouped Brees with Tom Brady and Peyton Manning as great but not generational players, a statement that prompted the Saints to post screenshots of NFL career passing statistics. The images highlighted that Brady, Brees, and Manning are the top three all-time leaders in both passing yards and touchdowns.</p>

          <p>This analysis of Daniel Levy's tenure as Tottenham Hotspur's chairman portrays him as a deeply polarizing figure whose legacy is one of stark contrasts. He is credited with transforming the club's infrastructure, most notably by building a state-of-the-art stadium and training facility, making Spurs a highly profitable entity. However, this business acumen is often overshadowed by a perceived lack of on-field success, marked by frequent managerial changes and a sparse trophy cabinet, which made him a frequent target of fan protests.</p>

          <p>The "$1,000 a month rule" is a financial guideline designed to help individuals calculate how much savings they need to generate a specific monthly income in retirement. Based on the 4% withdrawal rule, it suggests that for every $1,000 of desired monthly income, a person needs to have saved between $240,000 and $300,000. This formula helps transform abstract savings goals into concrete targets, making it easier for people to plan and assess whether their retirement preparations are on track.

The impressive catch, which occurred on a well-known fishing ground called Cashes Ledge, could potentially be a world record for his age group.</p>
