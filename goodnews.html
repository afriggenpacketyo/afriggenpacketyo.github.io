          <p>Shares of Tesla experienced a significant increase after CEO Elon Musk disclosed the purchase of approximately 2.57 million shares, valued at around $1 billion. This marks Musk's first open-market stock acquisition since February 2020, a move widely interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle company's future. The purchase comes as Tesla prepares to ask shareholders to approve a new, potentially massive, compensation package for Musk. Prior to this transaction, Musk owned about 13% of the company's stock.

The agreements include plans for U.S. and U.K. companies to construct up to 12 new modular reactors and develop data centers powered by this technology. This partnership, dubbed the "Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy," is expected to create thousands of jobs and unlock billions in private investment. The initiative highlights both countries' commitment to using nuclear energy to meet rising power demands, particularly for artificial intelligence, while pursuing low-carbon energy solutions.</p>

          <p>China's top internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, has issued new draft regulations requiring network operators to report "particularly serious" cybersecurity incidents to authorities within one hour. These measures, set to take effect on November 1, establish a four-tier classification system for the severity of incidents. A "particularly serious" incident is defined as one affecting high-level government portals or key national news websites for extended periods. This new rule signifies Beijing's increasing focus on tightening control over its domestic internet and bolstering its national cybersecurity infrastructure against potential threats.</p>

          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has dropped all charges against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, who were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act. The prosecutor informed the court that the evidence gathered did not meet the threshold for a trial, leading to the decision to offer no evidence. Both men, who had consistently denied the allegations, were formally found not guilty. The case had drawn significant attention, highlighting concerns about Chinese espionage targeting UK officials, a claim that Beijing has dismissed as "malicious slander."</p>

          <p>Global shares traded without a clear direction as financial markets anticipated the U.S. Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting, with widespread expectations of an interest rate cut. While European markets like France's CAC 40 saw gains, Asian markets were mixed, with concerns lingering over China's slowing economy and the impact of U.S. tariffs. Analysts noted that China's retail sales and other key indicators for August fell short of forecasts, suggesting a potential need for further economic stimulus. The market's current state reflects a cautious optimism, heavily dependent on the Federal Reserve's actions to bolster economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta acted arbitrarily and violated the freedom of expression of adult content actress Esperanza Gomez by closing her Instagram account. The court found that Meta applied its policies on nudity inconsistently, noting other similar accounts remained active, and ordered the company to review and clarify its terms of use for challenging content moderation decisions. Gomez, who has over 5 million followers, argued the account closure affected her ability to work. This ruling adds to a growing trend of South American courts holding social media platforms accountable for their content and moderation policies.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee is initiating a weeklong voter registration drive, targeting battleground districts across the country. This effort is a direct response to recent data showing a significant decline in registered Democratic voters and a corresponding increase in Republican registrations between 2020 and 2024. The "National Voter Registration Week of Action" will include events on college campuses and at public venues like farmers' markets. The initiative signals a strategic shift for the party, which is now taking a more direct role in registration efforts to counter unfavorable trends ahead of future elections.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Steve Cohen have reintroduced a bill to ban employers from using credit checks to vet job applicants. The proposed legislation would amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act, making it illegal for companies to require or request an applicant's credit history. Proponents argue that denying employment based on financial history is unfair, makes little sense, and disproportionately harms people of color and women. With nearly half of employers utilizing credit reports in hiring, the bill aims to remove a significant barrier to employment for many Americans, especially those with medical debt or past periods of unemployment.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new ordinance requiring landlords to ensure their rental units can maintain an indoor temperature of 82 degrees or below. The deadline for compliance is 2027 or 2032, depending on the number of units a landlord owns, giving renters a path to relief from increasingly dangerous extreme heat waves. In the interim, the ordinance allows tenants to install their own cooling solutions, like window AC units, without fear of eviction. The measure also encourages passive cooling strategies and zone cooling as cost-effective ways to improve habitability and reduce strain on the power grid.</p>

He explained that while there is an increase in leisure travel to the host city, it is often more than offset by a significant shutdown in lucrative business travel during the event. Kirby also commented on the broader economic outlook, noting that travel demand has surged since Labor Day, suggesting the economy is in better shape than many believe.

The success of these retro screenings indicates a strong audience appetite for nostalgia and the communal experience of seeing beloved films on the big screen.
