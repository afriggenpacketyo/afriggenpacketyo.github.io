          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing parents to use public funds for private school tuition, homeschooling, or virtual learning. The program will provide families with $10,000 per year, with up to $30,000 for children with disabilities, and will initially cover 90,000 students. Republicans have advocated for this program for years, emphasizing parental empowerment and alternatives to underperforming public schools. Critics, mainly Democrats and rural Republicans, argue it will drain resources from public education and benefit wealthy families, with the Texas Democratic Party chairman calling it beneficial only for the richest people in the state. </p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has banned Malta's 'golden passport' program, the last of its kind in the EU, which offered citizenship to foreign investors. The court ruled that such schemes undermine EU solidarity by making nationality a mere commercial transaction. Malta's Prime Minister defended the program, saying it had raised millions for charitable causes, but the government will rework the system to comply with the ruling. While 'golden passports' are now ruled out, 'golden visas,' offering residence permits for investment, remain available in many EU countries, raising concerns about security and money laundering risks.</p>

          <p>Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP), led by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, secured a landslide victory in the general election, with 87 out of 97 parliamentary seats. The PAP increased its vote share to 65.57%, improving from 61.2% in 2020, and voters gave Prime Minister Lawrence Wong the clear mandate he was seeking. This election was Wong's first as prime minister, and was dominated by cost of living issues, jobs and economic growth, according to local media outlet CNA. Wong, who is also finance minister, took over from Lee Hsien Loong in May 2024. Early Sunday morning, the U.S. State Department congratulated Wong on the PAP's victory, saying it looks forward to working closely with the new government to strengthen economic growth and defense ties.</p>

Starbucks' market share has declined significantly, falling to 14% in 2024 from 34% in 2019, while new entrants and business models gain traction.
