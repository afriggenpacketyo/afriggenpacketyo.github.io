        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reversed the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, reinstating Pete Rose, "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, and 15 other players. Rose, banned for betting on baseball, and Jackson, implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, are now eligible for Hall of Fame consideration. The decision comes after Rose's death and is based on the view that the deterrent effect of a lifetime ban ends upon death. However, Rose's past issues, including allegations of statutory sexual assault, could still affect his Hall of Fame chances.</p>
