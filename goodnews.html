          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index reached a new record high, driven by real estate and technology sectors, while other Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed after the U.S. Federal Reserve's expected rate cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the 25-basis-point reduction as "risk management," with indications of two more cuts this year. South Korea's Kospi rose, but Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain steady policy rates, with HSBC forecasting a potential hike later in the year, as regional economies digest the global monetary policy shifts.

Despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterizing the cut as "risk management" rather than a signal for a prolonged easing cycle, European banking stocks and pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk saw gains. The Bank of England is also anticipated to keep its interest rates on hold. This article highlights the immediate positive reaction in European markets to the Fed's latest monetary policy adjustment.

          <p>Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei announced new AI computing systems, including the "Atlas 950 SuperCluster" and a more advanced Atlas 960 version, powered by its in-house Ascend chips. This move intensifies competition with Nvidia, as China seeks self-reliance in advanced semiconductors due to US export restrictions. Huawei claims its new supernodes will offer the world's most powerful computing capabilities for several years, with plans to deploy over 500,000 chips in the Atlas 950 SuperCluster. The announcement aligns with China's increasing emphasis on domestic chip technologies, despite potential exaggerations of capabilities.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, analysts anticipate China's central bank will implement only moderate easing measures this year, despite increased room for looser monetary policy. The Fed's 0.25 percentage point reduction led to a strengthening of the offshore yuan overnight. Economists, like Standard Chartered's Ding Shuang, predict a smaller rate cut from the People's Bank of China in the fourth quarter, which is expected to narrow the interest rate gap and ease capital outflow pressures on the yuan.
