        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool has agreed to a deal to sign England center-back Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace, pending final clearance from the London club. The transfer, which follows Liverpool's record-breaking summer spending spree, aims to solidify a defense that has appeared vulnerable early in the season. While a fee has been agreed upon and Guehi is set to complete a medical, Crystal Palace is reportedly hesitant to finalize the transfer until they can secure a replacement. Guehi's arrival would be another major signing for Liverpool, pushing their total summer expenditure to a Premier League record of over £450 million.</p>

Shane Lowry, Viktor Hovland, and Jon Rahm are among those selected to join automatic qualifiers like Rory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood for the upcoming match at Bethpage. Donald emphasized that despite the team's continuity, they will not simply 'rinse and repeat' their previous strategy, acknowledging the different challenge of playing on American soil. He urged his players to embrace the expectedly raucous New York crowd and adapt to the unique pressures of an away match.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has penned a satirical short story to criticize a new policy in Alberta that requires school libraries to remove books with 'explicit sexual content.' The move comes after her iconic novel, 'The Handmaid's Tale,' was among over 200 books removed by the Edmonton Public School Board. Atwood's new story ironically depicts perfectly chaste characters to highlight the absurdity of the ban, which she has also condemned on social media. The controversy reflects a growing trend of book challenges, similar to those seen in the United States, targeting classic literature alongside contemporary works.</p>

          <p>European stock markets saw gains, led by a significant rise in the defense sector after the United Kingdom announced a £10 billion warship export deal with Norway. The agreement for British-made Type 26 frigates, to be built by BAE Systems, is the UK's largest ever by value and boosted shares of BAE and other defense contractors. The health-care sector also performed well, with Novo Nordisk shares increasing after trial data suggested its drug Wegovy is more effective at reducing heart disease risk than rival medications. These positive corporate developments helped lift market sentiment at the start of the month.</p>

Conservative opponents have accused Rayner of hypocrisy and potential tax avoidance, alleging she may have improperly designated the property as her main residence to reduce her stamp duty tax liability. Starmer defended Rayner, highlighting her journey from a humble background as a 'great story of British success' and dismissing the criticism as a 'big mistake.' A spokesperson for Rayner has stated that she paid all relevant taxes on the property 'entirely properly.'</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Human Influence on Animal Sizes Diverged in the Middle Ages</h2>

          <p>A new study by French scientists reveals a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domestic animals starting in the Middle Ages. Researchers analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones found that while both groups previously followed similar size cycles, a shift occurred around 1000 AD. Wild species like foxes and deer began to shrink due to habitat loss and intensified hunting. In parallel, domesticated animals such as chickens, sheep, and cattle grew larger as humans implemented more systematic selective breeding and controlled management, highlighting the increasing and lasting impact of human activity on the natural world.</p>

          <p>Algerian Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif is challenging a mandate from the global boxing federation that requires her to undergo gender testing to compete. The decision from World Boxing followed controversy during the 2024 Paris Olympics, where Khelif won a gold medal. She has filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), seeking to be declared eligible for the upcoming World Boxing Championships without submitting to the test. Khelif was one of two female boxers at the Paris Games who sparked a debate over gender eligibility in the sport, an issue that continues to be contentious in international athletics.</p>

In addition to economic data, several major tech companies are set to release earnings, including AI chipmaker Broadcom and software giant Salesforce. These reports will provide further insight into the health of the artificial intelligence sector and the broader enterprise software market following Nvidia's recent strong performance.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a significant meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in China, reinforcing their countries' strong ties. The discussion occurred just days after the U.S. imposed steep tariffs on India, partly in response to New Delhi's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. This move has pushed India to strengthen its relationships with Russia and China as a countermeasure to what it perceives as U.S. economic unilateralism. The leaders discussed deepening bilateral trade and cooperation, showcasing India's commitment to its strategic autonomy in foreign policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, the publicly-owned railway operator in Scotland, has scrapped its more expensive peak-time fares in a move that could influence rail pricing across the United Kingdom. The decision reflects changes in travel patterns since the pandemic, with less concentrated commuter rushes providing more capacity on trains. While Scottish passengers will see significantly cheaper tickets, such as a Glasgow-Edinburgh return fare being halved, experts are divided on whether a similar move in England would be feasible. Concerns remain about potential overcrowding on already busy routes and whether overall ticket prices might need to rise to compensate for lost revenue.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, 'The Haydn Expedition,' showcases the unique democratic structure of The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen (DKB), one of the world's leading orchestras. Founded by music students in 1980, the DKB operates on a grassroots model where all 41 musicians have a say in artistic and operational decisions, from choosing conductors to selecting repertoire. This collaborative approach, combined with financial independence, fosters a deep sense of ownership and motivation among its members. The film highlights how this democratic spirit contributes to their acclaimed interpretations of classical music, particularly the works of Joseph Haydn.</p>

          <p>Germany is actively pursuing deeper economic ties with India as a strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific, particularly as global trade becomes more volatile due to U.S. tariffs and geopolitical shifts. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is visiting India to explore cooperation in trade, technology, and defense. While bilateral trade reached a record $33 billion in 2024, it is still dwarfed by Germany's trade with China. Both nations are pushing to finalize an EU-India free trade agreement, though challenges remain, as they aim to build a more resilient economic partnership in a fragmented global landscape.</p>
