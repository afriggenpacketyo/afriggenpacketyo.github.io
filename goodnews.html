        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage interest rates falling to an 11-month low, many homeowners who purchased property in recent years are considering refinancing their loans. Experts suggest evaluating whether current rates, now in the low 6% range, offer enough savings to justify the action, especially for those with rates near the 8% highs of 2023. Key considerations include the risk of waiting for even lower rates, the upfront closing costs, and the owner's long-term plans for the home. A careful analysis is needed to determine if the potential monthly savings outweigh the costs and risks involved. (not investment advice)</p>

As the UN's main deliberative body, it operates on a "one state, one vote" principle, discussing a broad agenda including security, economic, and environmental issues. This year's session occurs amidst major global conflicts like the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, with a new focus on AI governance.

          <p>The stock market saw modest gains, led by the technology sector, as the 10-year Treasury yield continued to decline following last week's weak jobs report. The lower yields are seen as supportive for tech stocks, with AI chipmakers like Broadcom and Nvidia trading higher. In company-specific news, BlackRock is set to manage $80 billion in client assets from Citigroup, a move analysts estimate could add 25 cents to its earnings per share. Meanwhile, a partnership between Meta Platforms and Anduril Industries was awarded a U.S. Army contract to develop augmented reality combat goggles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run, a major half marathon in the UK, have issued a humorous apology after the finisher medals mistakenly featured an image of the wrong city. The medals, intended to show an aerial view of Newcastle and the River Tyne, instead depicted the rival city of Sunderland and the River Wear. Approximately 60,000 participants received the erroneous medals. In a statement, the Great Run Company admitted the mistake, calling it the "most unique" medal in the event's history and a future collector's item.</p>

          <p>A program at Johns Hopkins University's School of Nursing is providing free doula services to expectant mothers in the Baltimore area, aiming to offer a more supportive birth experience. Nursing students who complete a specialized course are matched with mothers to provide emotional, physical, and informational support during labor and birth. The program, now in its 27th year, acts as a bridge between the patient and medical staff, advocating for the mother's needs. This initiative aligns with a new Maryland law requiring hospitals to allow certified doulas to be present during childbirth.</p>

          <p>A business-led campaign to repeal a new ordinance setting a $30 per hour minimum wage for Los Angeles hotel and airport workers has failed to gather enough valid signatures to place the issue on the ballot. The law, which mandates phased wage increases culminating in $30/hour by 2028, was put on hold pending the signature verification. With the referendum failing, the wage increases can now move forward, marking a significant victory for labor unions like Unite Here Local 11.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and interest rates at multi-decade highs, many consumers are struggling with their balances. This article outlines three ways to get personalized help instead of relying on generic advice. These include consulting with a credit counseling agency for a comprehensive financial plan, working with a debt relief company to negotiate lower balances directly with creditors, and proactively contacting credit card issuers to inquire about hardship programs. Each approach offers a tailored strategy to address an individual's specific financial circumstances and create a viable path out of debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is now offering a substantial rebate of $7 per square foot to businesses, schools, and public institutions that replace nonfunctional lawns with water-efficient landscapes. This incentive, more than double the previous rate, aims to accelerate water conservation ahead of a new state law that will prohibit using potable water on such turf starting in 2027. To qualify, the new landscapes must include drought-tolerant plants and features for retaining stormwater. The goal is to beautify properties while saving water and improving biodiversity.</p>

          <p>England's recent comfortable but uninspiring victory over Andorra highlights a long-running trend for the national football team: dominant but dull qualifying campaigns followed by struggles in major tournaments. Having lost only four World Cup qualifiers in 30 years, England's path to tournaments is often a formality against outmatched opponents, leading to a lack of jeopardy and excitement. Commentators and former players note that these routine wins offer little insight into the team's true capabilities against elite competition. The predictable nature of these matches raises questions about their value for both players and fans.</p>

          <p>Two independent reports commissioned by the disaster-relief charity FireAid have found no evidence of misused funds following scrutiny from politicians and some residents. The charity, which raised nearly $100 million after Southern California wildfires, was questioned over its grant distribution methods. An independent review by law firm Latham & Watkins affirmed that FireAid acted according to its mission and had strong accountability measures. The reports detail how funds were distributed to vetted local non-profit organizations to provide swift aid, rather than direct payments to individuals, consistent with the charity's stated purpose.</p>
