          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, UK, is teaching primary school children about sun safety to help reduce future cases of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer. The initiative educates children as young as five on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, with plans for a nationwide rollout by 2026. Experts emphasize that childhood sunburn significantly increases melanoma risk, and with diagnoses projected to rise, preventative education is seen as a crucial public health measure.</p>

          <p>Two five-year-old European brown bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in southwest England. The bears were discovered in a staff food storage area, where they had consumed a week's supply of honey and other snacks. Park visitors were moved to a secure building as a precaution, but the bears were not considered a public threat and eventually returned to their enclosure on their own, with the incident being attributed to an operational error.</p>
