          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk, considered a bellwether for global trade, announced a 70% increase in first-quarter operating profit, exceeding analyst expectations. The company maintained its full-year guidance, but revised global container market volume growth due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. Maersk anticipates continued disruption in the Red Sea throughout the year, a factor impacting shipping routes and costs. The shipping industry is navigating a complex tariff landscape initiated by the U.S., which includes import duties on products from China, prompting retaliatory tariffs from Beijing.</p>

The UK, which has a trade deficit with the U.S., was spared the higher "reciprocal" tariffs but still faces a baseline levy.
