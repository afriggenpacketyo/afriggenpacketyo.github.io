          <p>Inflation in the eurozone increased slightly to 2% in June, aligning perfectly with the European Central Bank's target, according to preliminary data from Eurostat. This figure, which was anticipated by economists, follows a May reading of 1.9% and has fueled expectations for an interest rate cut in the third quarter. While core inflation remained steady at 2.3%, the closely watched services inflation metric saw a minor increase to 3.3%. The data reinforces the belief that the ECB's cycle of interventions to curb high inflation has largely concluded. (not investment advice)</p>

Democrats view the Texas seat as a key opportunity to expand their map, though they have not won a statewide race there since 1994.

          <p>The European Central Bank's chief economist, Philip Lane, has stated that the recent cycle of monetary policy actions aimed at controlling inflation is now "done." He explained that the primary goal of bringing inflation down from its peak of 10% to the current 2% target has been achieved. While the major price shocks of 2021-2022 are considered resolved, Lane cautioned that the ECB must remain vigilant and data-dependent to address any new shocks or cyclical movements. This sentiment was echoed by other central bank officials, suggesting any future rate moves would likely be downward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State and national lawmakers are seeking to address a significant gap in medical training concerning menopause, which affects half the population. In California, a bill is advancing that would require doctors to complete coursework on menopause to renew their licenses, reflecting a national trend with 13 states introducing similar legislation. This legislative push is a response to widespread patient complaints of unresponsive doctors and inconsistent care for symptoms like hot flashes and cognitive issues. A 2023 study revealed that less than a third of OB-GYN residency programs offer dedicated menopause training, prompting calls for reform.</p>

          <p>A new report from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission reveals a shift in American voting habits, with fewer ballots cast by mail in the 2024 election compared to the 2020 pandemic peak. Mail-in ballots constituted 30.3% of the turnout, down from 43% in 2020, though still higher than pre-pandemic levels. Conversely, early in-person voting has become more popular, with all states now offering some form of it for the first time. Experts attribute the decline in mail voting to the rollback of pandemic-era expansions and political rhetoric that has discredited the method.</p>

The study, published in a peer-reviewed journal, offers a standardized framework for global carbon accounting, which has previously lacked such a high-precision methodology. This satellite remote sensing technology showed significant potential for detecting anomalous emission events by analyzing historical data.

          <p>On the eve of the Communist Party's 104th anniversary, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for stricter regulation of power and increased public and media oversight to fight corruption. He stressed the need to improve institutional mechanisms to make the exercise of power clear, transparent, and traceable. Xi urged party members to remember that all power is granted by the people and to address systemic shortcomings that allow for its abuse. This focus on accountability is part of a broader campaign to curb excesses by party officials, which Beijing views as critical to its legitimacy.</p>
