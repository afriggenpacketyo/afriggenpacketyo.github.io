          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a decrease in its second-quarter revenues, attributing the drop to lower prices for crude oil and chemical products. The company's adjusted net income was $24.5 billion, slightly above analyst forecasts. Despite the current price depression influenced by uncertain global demand and U.S. tariffs, CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism, anticipating a significant rise in oil demand in the latter half of 2025. The company has also adjusted its dividend policy for 2025 following a first-quarter profit decline. (not investment advice)</p>

Key advice includes planning transfers in blocks of fixtures, balancing premium players, and quickly rectifying mistakes.

          <p>Following a narrow series loss to India, analysis of England's cricket team suggests its success is critically dependent on captain Ben Stokes. The article highlights that without Stokes, the team appears vulnerable and lacks balance. As England prepares for the upcoming Ashes series in Australia, a country where they have not won a Test in over a decade, Stokes's fitness and performance are seen as paramount. The challenge is immense, given the inexperience of many English players on Australian soil and the strength of Australia's bowling attack.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has announced a new plan to support its domestic cattle industry in response to falling beef prices and strong competition from imports. The policy aims to increase local beef production and consumption by implementing a quality-grading system for domestic products. Officials noted that there is significant room for growth in consumption of high-quality proteins among Chinese residents. Wholesale beef prices have rebounded slightly from an eight-year low in March but remain significantly lower than in previous years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a federal court order, U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to stop deportations under President Trump's asylum ban. An appeals court panel on Friday partially limited the ban, ruling that it could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. This directive instructs Customs and Border Protection officials to cease deportations linked to the ban and instead process migrants under existing U.S. immigration law. The move comes amid numerous legal challenges to the Trump administration's restrictive immigration policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order creating a federal task force to oversee preparations for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The White House stated that the task force will coordinate security, transportation, and visa processing for the global event. The move was praised by the LA28 organizing committee, which thanked the Trump administration for its leadership and support. This follows a similar task force chaired by Trump for the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a deal worth approximately $6.5 billion. The agreement marks the largest-ever defense industry deal between the two nations and Japan's first major warship export since before World War II. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described the stealthy, next-generation vessel as the best choice for Australia's capability needs. This purchase is part of Australia's significant military restructuring aimed at enhancing its naval fleet and long-range strike capabilities in response to China's regional military expansion.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by 45 California counties over improper disposal of hazardous waste. The lawsuit alleged that UPS facilities disposed of corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials in regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. Prosecutors noted that UPS was cooperative during the investigation and has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs. The settlement includes civil penalties, cost reimbursement, and funding for environmental projects.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is currently mating season for tarantulas in California, a period when the typically reclusive male spiders emerge from their burrows in search of a mate. This seasonal behavior, lasting from August to December, makes sightings more common in areas like Joshua Tree National Park and the Santa Monica Mountains. Experts note that while their appearance may be intimidating, native tarantulas are shy, slow-moving, and pose no serious threat to humans unless provoked. Their bites are not deadly, and their primary defense is flicking irritant hairs from their bodies.</p>

          <p>Stephen J. Cloobeck, a wealthy businessman and first-time political candidate, is spending $1.4 million on a television advertising campaign for his California gubernatorial run. The ad buy covers every major California market as well as national political hubs like Washington, D.C. This early and significant spending is seen as a move to boost his name recognition in a wide-open race following former Vice President Kamala Harris's decision not to run. Cloobeck, a long-time Democratic donor, is positioning himself as a "conservative Democrat" who will fight for all Californians.</p>

          <p>The remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, have been discovered in a cave near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The discovery was made by a team of archaeologists and cave explorers surveying the area. The project also uncovered evidence of the cave system being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. These findings provide new insights into how prehistoric people lived, farmed, and used the landscape in the region thousands of years ago.</p>

          <p>More than £100 million in prizes from the UK's government-backed Premium Bonds savings program are currently unclaimed, including 11 prizes worth £100,000 each. Critics argue that the operator, National Savings and Investments (NS&I), needs to reform its tracing process, which can be difficult for people who were gifted bonds or only have old paper records. NS&I states that the unclaimed amount represents a very small fraction of the total prizes awarded since 1957 and that it provides multiple ways for people to check for and trace winnings.</p>
