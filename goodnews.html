          <p>An exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is revisiting the complex legacy of the Plattenbau, the prefabricated concrete housing blocks that defined much of East Germany's urban landscape. These buildings were initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to post-war housing shortages but later became symbols of social decay and extremism following German reunification. The exhibition, "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau," explores this divisive architectural heritage through artworks that reflect collective memories and the painful transformations of the era. Curators aim to foster a nuanced discussion about belonging and community, moving beyond simple nostalgia for the former East Germany.</p>

          <p>A new book titled "Chinese Encounters with America" profiles twelve Chinese individuals whose lives were shaped by their experiences in the United States, highlighting a past era of cooperation and optimism between the two nations. The book features stories of academics, diplomats, and artists who fostered cultural and scientific exchanges, reminding readers of the shared interests that have since been overshadowed by intense competition and distrust. The co-editors argue that these personal journeys demonstrate the significant benefits of mutual understanding. They express concern that both countries have lost sight of the common ground that once defined their relationship.</p>

          <h2>California Legislature Passes Bill Allowing Preferential College Admission for Slavery Descendants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill that would permit state colleges and universities to offer preferential admission to applicants who can prove they are descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. before 1900. The legislation, part of a broader package addressing the legacy of slavery, is carefully worded to focus on lineage rather than race, in an attempt to comply with the state's ban on affirmative action. Proponents argue it addresses a legacy of exclusion in education, while critics contend it is a proxy for race-based preferences and may face legal challenges. The bill now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature.</p>

          <h2>Growing Number of Turkish Youth Learning German for Education and Career Opportunities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 05:49:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German language is experiencing a surge in popularity in Turkey, second only to English, as a growing number of young people see it as a gateway to better futures. Driven by a difficult economic situation and limited career prospects at home, Turkish students are increasingly enrolling in German courses to study at German universities or enter the job market there. This high demand has led to a shortage of German language teachers in Turkey. Education experts note a significant shift, with graduates from elite Turkish high schools now choosing Germany for higher education at nearly the same rate as local universities.</p>

          <p>A strong earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 struck early Saturday in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake's epicenter was located about 112 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a relatively shallow depth. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially issued a threat advisory but later canceled it, while Japan's meteorological agency noted the possibility of only slight sea level changes. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries resulting from the powerful seismic event in the sparsely populated region.</p>

          <p>As teenagers increasingly use generative AI tools like ChatGPT for everything from homework to mental health support, experts are urging parents to engage in open conversations about the technology's benefits and risks. Parents are advised to start discussions early, explore the tools alongside their children, and teach them to critically evaluate AI-generated information. While AI can be a helpful learning aid, research indicates significant dangers, as chatbots can provide unsafe responses to queries about self-harm or mental health crises. The guidance emphasizes setting reasonable household rules and prioritizing real-world interactions to ensure a balanced approach to this evolving technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Colombia's highest court has ruled that Meta violated the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court found that the company removed the account without clear justification and applied its nudity policies inconsistently, as other similar accounts remained active. Meta had argued Gómez violated its rules, but the court stated that social media posts are constitutionally protected and can only be limited in a proportionate manner. The ruling orders Meta to adjust its terms of use to provide clearer mechanisms for users to challenge moderation decisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boxing analysts are offering split predictions for the highly anticipated fight between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford. Crawford, considered one of the best pound-for-pound boxers, is moving up two weight classes, raising questions about whether his technical skill and speed can overcome Álvarez's size and power advantage. Those favoring Crawford believe his adaptability and precise counter-punching will expose a potentially declining Canelo. Conversely, supporters of Álvarez argue that he remains the undisputed champion at 168 lbs and that his strength and experience at the weight will ultimately be too much for the smaller challenger to handle.</p>

          <p>In a new initiative aimed at addressing both declining birth rates and the need for scientific talent, Shanghai has introduced a subsidy program for female researchers returning to work after childbirth. The pilot program, starting with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will provide a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (about $7,000) to 20 new mothers. To qualify, applicants must be under 40, hold a doctorate, and have given birth in the last two years. While the initial scope is limited, some female scientists view it as a positive step in supporting women's careers in STEM fields.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series has seen exceptionally strong pre-order demand in China, with initial sales volumes surpassing records set by last year's models. E-commerce platform JD.com reported that sales in the first minute exceeded the entire first-day volume for the iPhone 16 series. The high demand caused technical difficulties on Apple's official website, with customers reporting slow payment processing. In major cities like Shanghai, all available slots for in-person pickup on the launch date were booked within minutes, and new orders now face wait times extending into mid-October.</p>
