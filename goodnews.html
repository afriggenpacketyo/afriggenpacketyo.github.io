          <p>Agatha Christie has been 'reanimated' using AI to teach an online writing course for BBC Maestro, raising ethical questions about using deceased figures in this way. While Christie's family estate approved the project and stipulated that only her words be used, some experts argue that it still constitutes a 'deepfake' since Christie herself cannot consent. The course utilizes academic research and a 'digital prosthetic' to create an avatar, not to invent her views. The article explores the balance between honoring an artist's legacy and the potential for misrepresentation in the age of AI.</p>
