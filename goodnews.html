          <p>As the 80th anniversary of the end of the Sino-Japanese war approaches, this article examines China's evolving position in the global order it helped establish. Despite suffering an estimated 35 million casualties as a key Allied power in World War II, China is now often portrayed as a revisionist power challenging the international system. The piece suggests that China's historical sacrifices underpin its current determination to be seen as a guarantor of post-war norms. It questions the Western narrative that frames China's growing influence as an inherent threat to the global security architecture established after the conflict.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, forecasting continued strong sales growth driven by demand for its artificial intelligence hardware. Despite the positive results and a projection of over 50% revenue growth for the next quarter, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading. The dip was attributed to data center revenue falling slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The report confirms the central role of Nvidia's technology in the global AI infrastructure boom, with the company expecting trillions in spending by the end of the decade.

          <p>Amid rising vehicle prices and interest rates, a recent analysis highlights five costly errors consumers should avoid when buying a car. These include purchasing a vehicle outside one's financial means, relying solely on dealership financing without securing a preapproved loan, and trading in a car with negative equity. The report also advises working with a dealership's internet sales team for better pricing and considering certified pre-owned vehicles to avoid the steep depreciation of a new car. With a record number of buyers committing to monthly payments over $1,000, these strategies are crucial for long-term financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, savers are advised to take strategic steps now to maximize returns from certificates of deposit (CDs). Key recommendations include shopping online for the highest available rates, as online banks typically offer better returns than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions.

          <p>For homeowners seeking financing, September may be an opportune time to consider a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), according to financial experts. HELOCs currently offer some of the lowest borrowing rates available, cheaper than personal loans and credit cards, and their interest may be tax-deductible. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, the variable rates on HELOCs could become even more favorable for borrowers. Additionally, rising home equity levels across the country mean that homeowners have a larger pool of funds to draw from for major expenses or investments. (not investment advice)</p>
