          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has publicly declined an invitation from President Donald Trump to serve on the newly reestablished Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. Barkley stated that due to his busy schedule, he and his family decided it was in his best interest not to accept the position. The announcement came after Trump had already named Barkley as a member during a news conference. The council, which includes other athletes like Bryson DeChambeau and Harrison Butker, aims to reintroduce the Presidential Fitness Test and promote physical fitness among American youth.</p>

After nearly three decades covering the auto sector, he will now focus on a wider theme of "physical/embodied AI," which includes autonomous vehicles, humanoid robots, and space technology. This move reflects a broader industry shift towards artificial intelligence applications beyond just electric vehicles.

          <p>AI software company Palantir reported strong second-quarter earnings, surpassing Wall Street estimates and achieving over $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time. The company's revenue grew 48% year-over-year, driven by significant increases in both its U.S. government and commercial sectors. CEO Alex Karp highlighted the radical acceleration of the business, attributing it to years of investment and the recent surge in AI interest. In response to the strong performance, Palantir has raised its full-year revenue and operating income guidance, causing its stock to rally over 5% in response to the news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Eagle Outfitters' stock surged over 23% after President Donald Trump posted on social media, praising the retailer's new ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. Trump called the campaign the "hottest ad out there" and encouraged his followers to support it. The campaign, with the slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," had previously faced some criticism for its perceived double entendre and overly sexualized nature. The incident underscores the significant and unpredictable impact that political figures and cultural discourse can have on a company's market performance and brand visibility in a polarized environment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the choice between fixed and variable annuities for retirement planning in the current economic environment of elevated interest rates and market volatility. Fixed annuities are presented as a safer option, offering guaranteed returns that can lock in current high rates before potential future cuts by the Federal Reserve. Conversely, variable annuities offer the potential for higher, market-linked growth, which may better protect against long-term inflation for those with a higher risk tolerance. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals, proximity to retirement, and comfort with market exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After more than a decade of mystery, scientists have identified the cause of the sea star wasting disease that has killed billions of marine animals along the West Coast since 2013. A study published in Nature Ecology & Evolution pinpoints a specific bacterium, Vibrio pectinocida, as the culprit. The discovery is a major breakthrough for marine conservation, particularly for the sunflower sea star, whose population plummeted by over 90%. The loss of this keystone predator led to an explosion in sea urchin populations, which in turn destroyed vital kelp forests, creating "urchin barrens" and destabilizing the entire ecosystem.</p>

          <h2>UK Appoints New Chair to Make Honours System More Inclusive</h2>

          <p>The UK government has appointed business leader Moni Mannings to chair a new "diversity and outreach committee" aimed at making the country's honours system more inclusive. The move follows analysis showing that higher awards, like knighthoods, disproportionately go to individuals from London and the southeast of England, with few recipients from working-class backgrounds. The new committee will advise the government and encourage a wider range of nominations from under-represented regions and communities. The goal is to ensure the system recognizes excellence from all walks of life and that awards are based on merit, regardless of background.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 14:56:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's board has awarded CEO Elon Musk a new interim compensation package of 96 million shares, worth approximately $29 billion. This "interim award" is intended as a good-faith payment while his original $56 billion pay package from 2018 remains nullified by a Delaware court. The new shares will vest over two years, provided Musk remains in a key executive role. The award will be forfeited if the 2018 package is ultimately reinstated on appeal. The move comes as Musk has pushed for greater voting control of the company to pursue his AI and robotics ambitions. (not investment advice)</p>

She led the agency from 1992 to 1996 and was the first of its leaders to be publicly identified, a move that ushered in a new era of transparency for the secretive organization. During her tenure, she oversaw MI5 taking the lead on countering Irish republican terrorism in Great Britain and the agency's move to its Thames House headquarters. After retiring, she became a successful novelist and was widely seen as the inspiration for Dame Judi Dench's character "M" in the James Bond films.</p>
