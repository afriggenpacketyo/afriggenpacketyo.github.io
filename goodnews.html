        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the recent ceasefire agreement in Kashmir, brokered with significant US involvement, experts express doubts about its long-term sustainability due to deep-seated distrust between India and Pakistan. The article highlights that while the ceasefire ended the worst military confrontation in 25 years, enduring peace requires addressing underlying issues like terrorism and water security. Analysts suggest the US leveraged IMF conditionalities to hasten the end of hostilities, with both sides using the escalation to test each other's resolve. While the ceasefire is expected to hold in the short term due to international pressure and the recognition of the costs of escalation, various challenges, including the Indus Waters Treaty and economic constraints, will keep relations strained, ultimately impacting the fragile peace in the region.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration rules, requiring spouses and adult dependents of foreign workers to pass an English language test, while care homes will be restricted from recruiting staff from abroad. The article notes that the Labour Party is also emphasizing the need for immigrants to earn the right to stay, reflecting a broader effort to address public concerns and counter challenges from parties like Reform UK. The Conservatives criticize the proposals as insufficient, particularly regarding the absence of a cap on migration numbers. Additionally, the government plans to tighten legislation related to asylum claims under the European Convention on Human Rights, signaling a comprehensive approach to migration control.</p>

          <p>A measure in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" aimed at limiting federal payments to abortion providers is facing opposition from moderate House Republicans. The provision, which seeks to make large groups providing abortion services ineligible for federal Medicaid funds, is raising concerns among GOP lawmakers representing districts that Trump lost in 2024. Critics argue that the Hyde Amendment already prevents federal dollars from funding abortion services and that the new measure could spark unnecessary conflict. Moderate Republicans have reportedly communicated their potential opposition to House GOP leaders, highlighting the risk of dissent within the party.</p>

          <p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad argues that President Trump's unilateral tariffs will negatively impact Americans more than targeted countries. Mahathir suggests that the tariffs will increase the cost of living in the US, as American products struggle to compete with cheaper alternatives from other nations. He anticipates that items like Apple iPhones produced in China and India will become more expensive, ultimately harming American consumers. Mahathir also believes ASEAN can mitigate the impact of tariff hikes through intergroup trade and business with countries other than the United States.</p>

          <p>Japan's universal health care system, praised for its affordability and support for a long-lived population, faces increasing strain due to a shrinking workforce and aging population. The system's future is now entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections, including the upcoming House of Councillors contest. Analysts warn that turning the health insurance system into a political issue could undermine its stability and erode public trust. The government is seeking to secure funds for child-rearing steps, with savings expected to come from the medical system, sparking immediate backlash and prompting a freeze on envisioned hikes.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to a Japanese temple, resolving a dispute that had contributed to bilateral friction. The statue of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima, was handed over to representatives of the Japanese temple. The return follows a South Korean Supreme Court ruling in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership. The statue is expected to be stored at a museum after a ceremony at the temple.</p>
