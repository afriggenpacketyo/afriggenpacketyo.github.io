          <p>Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk reported positive late-stage trial results for its oral obesity treatment, a pill version of its popular Wegovy injection. The trial showed patients achieved an average weight reduction of 16.6% after 64 weeks, with a safety profile comparable to the injectable form. The company stated this offers patients a significant alternative, especially for those with an aversion to needles, and an FDA decision on the new drug is expected in the fourth quarter. The results position Novo Nordisk strongly in the competitive market for oral weight-loss drugs, particularly against rival Eli Lilly's Orforglipron.</p>

Other key selections include Hannah Botterman returning at prop and Zoe Harrison being preferred at fly-half for her game management skills. The match is anticipated to be England's toughest challenge yet in the tournament, despite their 16-game winning streak against the French side.</p>

          <p>A federal judge's ruling in the government's antitrust case against Google has attempted to address the company's monopoly in internet search without stifling its ability to compete in the emerging field of artificial intelligence. The penalties bar Google from making exclusive deals to be the default search engine but stop short of forcing a divestment of its Chrome browser. While Google must share some search data, critics worry the remedies are insufficient, as the company's vast data advantage from search could still allow it to dominate the AI landscape. The case highlights the difficulty of applying century-old antitrust laws to rapidly evolving technology.</p>

Now 69 and in remission after an operation in 2024, Borg described the diagnosis as psychologically difficult and a fight he must continue to live with, requiring tests every six months. The 11-time Grand Slam champion, known for his 'Fire and Ice' rivalry with John McEnroe, stated he now takes life "day by day." He also reflected on his historic career and noted that he and McEnroe are now very good friends.</p>

          <p>An exclusive dinner experience with Tan Su Shan, the CEO of DBS Group, was auctioned for S$18,900 ($14,790) at a Sotheby's charity event, more than doubling its pre-sale estimate. The winning bidder will receive a private six-person dinner hosted by Tan, who became the first female CEO of Southeast Asia's largest bank earlier this year. The auction was part of the National Gallery Singapore's 10th anniversary gala, which raised over S$2.8 million to support the museum's mission of making art accessible to all communities. Such high-value experiences are a common feature in elite charity fundraising events.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced £150 billion in new investment pledges from U.S. companies, a development timed to coincide with President Donald Trump's state visit. The investments, which are expected to create over 7,600 jobs, include major commitments from firms like Blackstone, Microsoft, and Google for projects ranging from data centers to defense innovation. The announcement aims to showcase Britain's economic strength and deepen ties with the U.S. However, it comes as some domestic businesses slow investment and major pharmaceutical companies halt UK plans, citing an increasingly challenging business environment.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK involves a mix of royal pageantry and high-level political meetings. After being hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle for a formal welcome and state banquet, the president is scheduled to hold talks with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at his country estate, Chequers. The unprecedented second state visit, typically not offered to a president in their second term, was initiated by an invitation from the King to further UK-US interests, particularly regarding a potential trade deal. Protests have also taken place in London during the visit.</p>

          <h2>Financial Strategist Predicts Significant Bitcoin Price Increase by Year's End</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 04:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wall Street strategist Tom Lee of Fundstrat has predicted that Bitcoin could surge to a price of $200,000 by the end of the year. The primary catalyst for this bullish forecast is the anticipation of multiple interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, as cryptocurrencies are historically sensitive to changes in monetary policy. Lee suggests that as the Fed begins its easing program, money will flow rapidly into riskier assets like Bitcoin. However, online prediction markets are more conservative, giving a higher probability to Bitcoin reaching $125,000 or $150,000 rather than the $200,000 target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered his best performance of the season, throwing seven scoreless innings and striking out a season-high 12 batters in a 5-0 victory against the Philadelphia Phillies. In a key moment in the seventh inning with two runners on, manager Dave Roberts showed faith in Snell, leaving him in the game to get the final out. The strong start provided a much-needed reprieve for the team's struggling bullpen, which successfully closed out the game. The win was further secured by a Freddie Freeman home run and Shohei Ohtani's 51st homer of the season.</p>
