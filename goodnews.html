          <p>The United States and China have agreed to mutually lower extra tariffs on each other's imports by 115 percentage points and suspend additional 24 percent duties for 90 days, according to a joint statement. The substantial tariff cuts are set to take effect by Wednesday, following ministerial talks in Geneva aimed at easing trade tensions. Washington and Beijing also agreed to establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism to discuss issues of mutual concern. The United States will retain an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports, while China will retain at least a 10 percent retaliatory tariff on all American goods.</p>

          <p>Democrats are facing internal conflict over the party's aging leadership, with many progressives pushing for senior lawmakers to retire and make way for younger voices. Several Senate Democrats have announced plans to leave after next year, prompting both appreciation and relief within the party. The Democrats‚Äô age problem hasn‚Äôt been limited to Biden. Some argue that President Biden's decision not to step aside sooner set the stage for the party's current struggles. The party's reliance on seniority has also created challenges for nonwhite Democrats, who have historically needed longevity to accrue power.</p>

          <p>Dow futures climbed on Monday as the Trump administration and China jointly announced a pause in reciprocal tariffs for 90 days. Stocks had taken a beating following President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day," his announcement of wide-reaching tariffs that wiped out trillions of dollars from the stock market, losses not seen since COVID. Markets had been staging a recovery even before Monday's news, as Trump continued his retreat from the tariffs. The S & P has recovered all its losses from "Liberation Day," but the Dow remains about half a percentage point lower.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to deport millions, a regulatory change has made it easier for temporary workers to obtain U.S. permanent residence, particularly in the horse-racing industry. The new rule clarifies that workers on temporary visas are eligible to apply for green cards without risking their visa status. This rule, which could take the Trump administration years to undo, leaves open one pathway to immigration for tens of thousands of workers. Employers also benefit from the certainty of keeping prized employees amid uncertainty about future H-2B visa caps.</p>

The rule is designed to ensure travelers know about these fees upfront, but some are skeptical due to potential lack of enforcement from the Trump administration.

The other study found that chimps combine calls to create new meanings, similar to how humans combine words.</p>
