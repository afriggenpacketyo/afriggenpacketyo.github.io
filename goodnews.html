          <p>In response to devastating floods in Central Texas that resulted in over 130 fatalities, CBS Texas and Chef Tim Love are organizing the "Loud for Love" benefit concert. The event aims to raise funds for the Salvation Army's flood relief efforts through ticket sales, a live telethon, and an online silent auction. Held at Tannahill's Tavern & Music Hall, the concert will feature performances by country artists like Amanda Shires and Coffey Anderson. The initiative reflects a strong community effort to provide aid and support to those affected by the recent natural disaster.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across the region, including parts of New York City and Connecticut. The event occurred on Saturday night and is the second quake to strike the state in less than two weeks, following a series of smaller tremors in mid-July. Officials reported no immediate structural damage but advised residents to remain aware of potential aftershocks. While New Jersey is not a major seismic zone, it sits on the Ramapo Fault line, which causes several small, usually unfelt, quakes annually, with occasional stronger events like the 4.8 magnitude quake in April 2024.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a new $50 billion fund to support rural hospitals will be available in early September. This fund was established to counteract the impact of Medicaid cuts included in recent legislation signed by President Trump. The financial aid is intended to help rural facilities with workforce development, system right-sizing, and the adoption of new technologies like telehealth. The initiative comes as part of a broader healthcare law that also introduces stricter Medicaid work requirements, which the CBO estimates could cause 10 million people to lose coverage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0 by manufacturing runs through strategic plays rather than relying on power hitting. Key moments included an aggressive send by the third base coach for a run, a double-steal by Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts to set up an RBI, and a sacrifice fly from Betts. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, contributing significantly to the victory. The win concludes a nine-game road trip with a winning record for the Dodgers, providing a much-needed boost despite ongoing concerns about their slumping lineup.</p>

          <p>A number of former Justice Department attorneys are running for elected office, motivated by what they describe as the politicization and dismantling of the agency under President Trump. These candidates, who lack traditional political backgrounds, are leveraging their experience as career prosecutors to campaign on platforms of anti-corruption and restoring the rule of law. Figures like Ryan Crosswell in Pennsylvania, Erika Evans in Seattle, and Hetal Doshi in Colorado resigned from the DOJ in protest of recent changes. They are now seeking various state and federal positions to continue their public service outside the executive branch's direct influence.</p>

          <h2>UK Regulator Proposes Compensation Scheme for Car Finance Mis-Selling</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with estimated payouts to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful, extremely high commissions could be deemed unfair. The FCA will consult on a payout scheme that could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, covering agreements dating back to 2007. The regulator advises affected consumers to complain directly to their loan providers to avoid fees from claims management companies.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano in Russia's far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume over 3.7 miles into the sky. The eruption followed a massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake in the region and was accompanied by a 7.0-magnitude tremor, briefly prompting a local tsunami warning. According to Russian scientific authorities, this is the first historically confirmed eruption of the volcano in 600 years, though other sources date the last event to 475 years ago. Officials stated the ash plume spread over the Pacific Ocean without affecting populated areas.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has announced it will update an exhibit at the National Museum of American History to include information about President Trump's two impeachments. The decision follows a report that a temporary placard referencing the events had been removed from the "American Presidency" exhibit in July. The Smithsonian stated the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for appearance and presentation, not because of any external pressure. The museum affirmed its responsibility to present accurate and complete histories and plans to update the impeachment section in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>The final Test match between England and India is set for a thrilling conclusion on its last day, with the outcome hanging in the balance. Chasing a record 374 runs, England reached 339-6 before rain and bad light stopped play. Centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root had put England in a commanding position, but a late comeback from India's bowlers, who took three quick wickets, turned the match into a nail-biter. With England needing just 35 more runs and India requiring four wickets, the final day at The Oval will decide the series.</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are increasingly adding spicy menu items and sauces in an effort to attract younger diners, particularly from Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Brands like Chipotle, Cava, and Taco Bell have recently launched limited-time offers featuring bold, hot flavors, which are proving to be a low-cost, high-return strategy to re-engage consumers amid slower spending. This trend is heavily fueled by social media, where spicy food challenges and taste-test videos generate significant buzz. The preference for adventurous and globally-inspired spicy flavors among younger, diverse generations is driving this culinary shift across the fast-casual industry.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix with a controlled and defensive drive, successfully holding off a late charge from his teammate and title rival, Oscar Piastri. After falling to fifth on the opening lap, Norris switched to a bold one-stop tire strategy that ultimately paid off. Piastri, on fresher tires, closed the gap in the final laps but was unable to make a pass on the notoriously difficult-to-overtake track. The win reduces Norris's deficit in the championship to nine points as Formula 1 heads into its summer break.</p>
