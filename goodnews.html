          <h2>XPrize Founder Diamandis Optimistic About AI and Biotech Despite Geopolitical Challenges</h2>

          <p>Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize Foundation, expressed optimism about the future of AI and biotech, emphasizing the universal nature of science despite geopolitical tensions between the US and China. He highlighted that scientific breakthroughs in one country benefit humanity as a whole, contrasting this with the current political climate where the US has reduced scientific funding. Diamandis voiced concerns about the impact of these cuts on the pace of scientific discoveries, noting that his role involves helping people see the world in a positive light despite inherent fears and scarcity mindsets. His work through XPrize competitions aims to incentivize solutions to global challenges, as seen with the private space flight industry. The XPrize founder believes in the power of human innovation to overcome obstacles.</p>

          <h2>Universities Face Course Cuts Amid Funding Challenges, Collaboration Urged</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-01 20:58:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A government review is underway in England to address long-term higher education funding, prompting concerns about potential subject "cold spots" due to university course cuts. Universities UK suggests greater collaboration between institutions could help mitigate costs and maintain course availability, though legal concerns hinder such cooperation. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recognizes the financial strain on universities and supports collaboration where possible, particularly in sharing back-office functions or discussing mergers. University budgets have been impacted by a drop in international students and rising inflation, leading to course cutbacks across various institutions, and the government is encouraging universities to increase opportunities for students and contribute to economic growth. The review aims to restore universities as engines of opportunity and growth.</p>

          <p>The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives offers a look into the lives of Mormon women managing scandals, marital breakdowns, and business ventures, far removed from traditional public perception. The TV series follows a group of Mormon women, most of whom rose to fame on TikTok, as they navigate evolving dynamics within their tight-knit community, and the women speak openly about the money they make from reality TV and brand deals. Cast members Jessi Ngatikaura and Whitney Leavitt discuss the impact of having their lives watched and commented on by millions, emphasizing the importance of aftercare provided by the production, and there was some backlash to the reality TV show from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Despite the drama and filming demands, the women praise the production for its duty of care standards.</p>
