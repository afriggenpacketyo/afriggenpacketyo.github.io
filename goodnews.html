          <p>PayPal's second-quarter financial results surpassed Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, with sales increasing by 5% year-over-year. However, the company's stock declined as growth in transaction margin dollars, a critical profitability indicator, slowed to 7% from 8% in the previous quarter. Despite this, total payment volume exceeded projections, and the company raised its full-year earnings per share forecast. CEO Alex Chriss's strategy continues to focus on monetizing key assets like Venmo, which saw its payment volume grow at the highest rate in three years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, with net sales rising 2%. However, the consumer goods giant issued a cautious outlook for fiscal year 2026, forecasting a potential $1 billion negative impact from President Trump's tariffs. The company plans to offset some of these costs through productivity and sourcing changes but will also implement mid-single-digit price increases on about a quarter of its products. The news comes a day after P&G announced that COO Shailesh Jejurikar will succeed Jon Moeller as CEO in January. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Union Pacific has made an $85 billion offer to acquire Norfolk Southern, a move that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the United States. The deal, which values Norfolk Southern at approximately $320 per share, aims to streamline shipping logistics across the country by combining Union Pacific's western network with Norfolk Southern's eastern routes. The proposed merger will face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators, who have set a high bar for such deals due to concerns about reduced competition. If approved, the merger could pressure the remaining major U.S. railroads to pursue similar consolidations to remain competitive.</p>

          <p>This article explores the significant divergence between the United States and Canada regarding the role of religion in public and political life. While President Trump frequently invokes religious themes, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and other leaders maintain a more secular public persona, reflecting a broader societal difference. Church attendance is much lower in Canada, and evangelical Christians hold less political influence compared to the U.S. This contrast is partly rooted in history, with the U.S. fostering a competitive religious marketplace while Canada experienced a dramatic decline in the Catholic Church's power, particularly in Quebec, leading to a more secularized society.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 75-year-old man, is recovering after a successful double-lung transplant, a procedure he underwent after a terminal disease was discovered by chance during a routine X-ray. Kennedy was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and fatal lung disease with no known cause, and was given less than a year to live. Initially resistant, he was approved for the transplant at Cleveland Clinic and received the new lungs after a month-long hospital wait. Now recovering with 98% lung capacity, Kennedy is training a new therapy dog named Encore to celebrate his second chance at life.</p>

          <p>Contrary to widespread pessimism, this article argues that the institution of marriage in the U.S. is showing signs of a comeback after decades of decline. Data indicates that the divorce rate has fallen by nearly 40% since its peak in the 1980s, and the share of children living in two-parent married families has started to increase. The author suggests marriage is adapting, with husbands taking on more domestic responsibilities. Despite critiques from both the left and right, the article posits that stable marriage is becoming a norm again, conferring benefits of happiness, financial security, and stability to couples and children.</p>

The restoration showcases the luxurious but flawed design, including its signature rectangular windows and opulent cabin.
