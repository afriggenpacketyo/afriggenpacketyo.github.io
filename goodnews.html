          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made his third trip to China in a year, signaling a potential thaw in Sino-US economic relations. During his visit as a guest of honor at a major supply chain expo, Huang announced that Washington had approved the export of a less powerful, made-for-China AI chip, the H20. His visit coincided with an agreement between the US and China on a trade negotiation framework, leading to increased participation from American firms at the expo. Despite the optimistic tone, underlying fears about the long-term stability of the trade relationship and technology restrictions persist.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Debunks Claim That Sunscreen Increases Skin Cancer Risk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 08:54:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fact-checking article from DW refutes viral social media claims that sunscreen use increases the risk of skin cancer, labeling the assertion as false. Health officials and scientific studies confirm there is no evidence to support this link; in fact, sunscreen is crucial for filtering the UV radiation that causes melanomas. The article explains that the rising incidence of skin cancer is likely due to factors like increased awareness, better diagnostics, and more time spent outdoors. It clarifies that a chart circulating online, allegedly from a Connecticut registry, was misrepresented and did not originate from the public health department.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a stake in the payments processing company Global Payments, which has seen its stock price decline significantly since 2021. The move follows investor skepticism over Global Payments' recent, complex acquisition of Worldpay and divestiture of its TSYS business, a deal that contradicted prior management commitments. The article suggests Elliott's involvement could restore investor confidence by pushing for a reconstituted board to enhance accountability, oversee the integration of Worldpay, and potentially halt further large-scale M&A activity in the short term.

          <h2>Dave Ramsey Advises Caution on Tariffs, Calling Threats 'Saber Rattling'</h2>

          <p>Personal finance personality Dave Ramsey has advised a Canadian business owner not to panic over President Trump's threats of new tariffs on Canadian goods. During his podcast, Ramsey described the tariff situation as "a lot of saber rattling, a lot of grenade throwing, but actual net result is zero," and urged the entrepreneur to stick to his long-term business plan rather than making hasty decisions. The discussion arose as a Canadian log cabin kit company, seeing rapid growth in U.S. sales, considered fast-tracking a U.S. factory to avoid potential tariffs. Ramsey warned that rushing could be more costly than paying a temporary tariff. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A summer camp for individuals with disabilities has reopened just weeks after devastating floods, thanks to a massive cleanup effort by hundreds of volunteers. Camp Camp, located 30 miles downstream from another camp where 27 people died, was covered in debris. A real estate agent's social media plea for help brought in a flood of volunteers with chainsaws, excavators, and supplies to clear the 55-acre property. The rapid rehabilitation of the camp, described as a vital space for its attendees, stands as a testament to community resilience in the face of one of Texas's worst natural disasters.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old woman who believed she had a pulled muscle discovered she had late-stage metastatic malignant melanoma that had spread to her lungs and brain. Jennifer Frederick, who was in excellent physical shape, initially dismissed a lump in her groin, which is an unusual presentation for melanoma as it typically starts with a skin mole. After diagnosis, she underwent an aggressive treatment combining gamma knife radiation and immunotherapy, which caused severe side effects but has shown major improvement in her condition. Her doctors are optimistic about her long-term survival, calling her a "Stage IV miracle."</p>

          <p>Over the past 25 years, China has significantly deepened its ties with African nations through the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), leading to what it calls "leapfrog development." Since FOCAC's inception in 2000, trade has surged nearly 30-fold and Chinese investment has grown 100-fold. This economic partnership has been paralleled by increased security cooperation, with China now training approximately 2,000 African military officers annually and becoming a leading arms supplier to the continent. This strategic engagement has allowed Beijing to expand its influence, often edging out traditional powers like the US, Russia, and France.</p>

          <p>The United States has taken a significant step toward regulating digital currencies after President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing rules for stablecoins. This marks a major policy shift, as the bill, passed with bipartisan support, mandates that stablecoin issuers maintain proper reserves and implement anti-money laundering measures. While supporters hail it as a move to cement American leadership in financial technology, critics worry the rules are too weak and heavily influenced by industry lobbying. Another bill, the CLARITY Act, which would give more regulatory power to a smaller agency, now heads to the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>
