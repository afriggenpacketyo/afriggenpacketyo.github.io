          <p>England spinner Tom Hartley is set to return to international cricket in the one-day series against the West Indies, balancing his cricket career with managing his family's garden center. Hartley's routine involves early mornings watering plants and supervising staff at the sixth-generation family business located outside Liverpool. He finds that working at the garden center helps relieve pressure and provides a sense of stability outside of cricket, allowing him to approach the sport with less stress. Hartley's father, a former European Championship gold medalist, supports him in managing the business, which Tom is eventually expected to take over.</p>

          <p>Twenty companies in Japan have applied to purchase a combined 110,000 tons of government-stockpiled rice, following the farm minister's announcement to provide rice directly to the market to combat rising prices. This amount represents over 30% of the 300,000 tons planned for release through direct sales contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system. The move comes as supermarket rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, despite government efforts to lower them by releasing reserve rice. The government aims to finalize contracts and begin deliveries soon, with plans to revise eligibility criteria to include smaller supermarkets and rice shops. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be passed on through generations without DNA changes. Rice plants subjected to cold stress exhibited an adaptive tolerance to low temperatures that was inherited across five generations, driven by DNA methylation changes. This research revives the rivalry between Darwin and Lamarck, whose theory suggested organisms could pass on learned survival traits. The team's findings position Lamarckism as a significant, albeit partial, force in evolutionary processes, urging a reconciliation of epigenetics with core evolutionary principles.</p>

The article also addresses the ongoing issue of overtaking difficulty at Monaco, questioning whether artificial gimmicks can fix a problem rooted in the track's design.

          <p>Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu has extended an invitation to students affected by the U.S.'s attempted ban on international student enrollment at Harvard University. Lee stated that Hong Kong would welcome students facing "discriminatory and unfair treatment" in the U.S. to continue their studies in the city. He also indicated that he would consider further increasing the quota for non-local applicants if necessary, highlighting Hong Kong's open-door policy for students facing educational disruptions elsewhere.</p>

          <p>The ultra-rich are increasingly storing their gold in Singapore due to growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, with a significant rise in orders to store gold and silver in vaults. Singapore is viewed as a safe jurisdiction with political and economic stability, attracting high-net-worth clients seeking to protect their assets. The trend is driven by concerns over tariffs, global changes, and potential geopolitical instabilities, with most new orders coming from outside Singapore. The shift also reflects a preference for physical gold bars over paper assets to mitigate counterparty and geopolitical risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh became the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard, completing a 60-mile trek to raise awareness about shark conservation. Pugh swam for multiple hours a day in cold water, aiming to change public perceptions of sharks and encourage their protection as the film "Jaws" approaches its 50th anniversary. He described the swim as one of his most difficult, facing challenging weather conditions and the presence of sharks. Pugh, a UN Patron of the Oceans, hopes to influence policymakers to protect sharks, emphasizing their importance in the ocean ecosystem.</p>

          <h2>Tripadvisor Finds Increase in Fake Reviews on Website</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 01:26:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were fake, more than double the number detected in 2022. The increase is attributed to more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews and improvements in Tripadvisor's detection system. The company uses a three-pronged approach involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews. Most fake reviews fall into the categories of boosting and member fraud, with paid reviews being a smaller but more pernicious category, often originating in Asia.</p>
