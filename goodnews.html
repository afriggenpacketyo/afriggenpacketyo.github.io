          <p>The U.S. government has granted refugee status to 54 Afrikaners, white descendants of Dutch colonizers in South Africa, who are scheduled to arrive in the U.S. This move follows an executive order signed by President Trump prioritizing humanitarian relief for Afrikaners facing racial discrimination. The decision has sparked controversy, with some criticizing the prioritization of a privileged group while vulnerable individuals from other regions are denied asylum. The South African government has refuted claims of discrimination against Afrikaners, adding to the complexity of the situation. The refugees will be resettled in various states across the country and will be eligible for U.S. citizenship and government benefits.</p>

          <p>A woman used an A.I.-generated likeness of her deceased brother, Christopher Pelkey, during the sentencing of Gabriel Horcasitas, who was convicted of manslaughter in Pelkey's death. The video, which included a disclaimer about its A.I. origin, presented a message of forgiveness from the victim, which the judge praised. This unprecedented use of A.I. in a legal proceeding has sparked debate, with critics raising concerns about manipulation and deception, while others argue it's a tool to tell the victim's story. Legal experts note that Arizona provides broader latitude for victim statements, though the defense lawyer suggested that the court‚Äôs reliance on the A.I. video could be grounds for appeal.</p>

          <p>President Trump's selection of Dr. Casey Means, a wellness specialist, as his next surgeon general has provoked a debate over whether someone who is not a practicing physician should serve as the nation‚Äôs top doctor. Dr. Means, a close ally of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., trained as a surgeon but left her residency to practice ‚Äúfunctional medicine.‚Äù Critics, including Laura Loomer, have questioned her qualifications and lack of an active medical license, while supporters like Kennedy and Dr. Means's brother, Calley Means, defend her ability to inspire Americans to rethink the healthcare system. The American Medical Association and the American Public Health Association have remained silent on the appointment.</p>

          <p>A Southern California Edison transmission tower, being dismantled as part of an investigation into the Eaton fire's cause, was damaged when its top portion contacted power lines during helicopter removal. The incident occurred near the Gould substation in La Ca√±ada Flintridge, but no injuries were reported. The official cause of the Eaton fire remains under investigation, with induction being a leading theory. The tower was scheduled for testing to find clues about the fire's origin, as part of an agreement between SCE, county investigators, and law firms involved in lawsuits against the utility giant.</p>

          <p>The new trade agreement between the US and UK has been described as a "breakthrough" by the White House, but analysts suggest the substantive benefits will be limited. While the UK has won concessions on car and steel exports, the 10% import tax announced last month on most UK goods will remain intact. The US will expand opportunities for sales of American beef, ethanol, and other agricultural products in the UK. Some analysts believe the deal is more of a political victory for Trump than a significant economic shift, with limited impact on trade relations. Republicans have praised the agreement as a step towards eliminating barriers to American products in foreign markets.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are advocating for a revision of World War II history to shift the starting point from Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland to Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria. They argue that the current "Western-centric" narrative diminishes China's role in the war. This proposal was discussed at a second world war history seminar in Beijing, where academics emphasized the need to recognize China's frontline efforts against fascism. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII, and President Xi Jinping will attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain to increase market access for American farm exports. In return, the U.S. will allow Britain to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. market with a 10% tariff and remove additional tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum. The deal expands market access for American farm products, such as beef and bioethanol, and reduces nontariff barriers. This agreement is one of 17 that the Trump administration has been trying to strike with major trading partners, and it may provide hints for other countries on where the Trump administration stands on its tariff approach.</p>

          <p>President Trump has asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax hike on rich Americans in the fiscal package, proposing a new top income bracket for people making over $2.5 million per year, taxed at 39.6 percent. This would partially reverse the 2017 tax cuts, which reduced the top rate to 37 percent. The move is intended to offset the cost of continuing the 2017 tax cuts and protect Medicaid from spending cuts.

Both bands were at the epicenter of the last great indie boom, a scene that kicked off in 2002 when The Libertines jolted British guitar music out of its post-Britpop slump. The Kooks' debut album sold 1.5 million copies in 2006, while Hard-Fi's Stars of CCTV was nominated for the Mercury Prize. Both bands attribute their revival to a circular nature to music, where teenagers start going back to listen to the music their parents grew up with.</p>

          <p>Zara, owned by Inditex, is one of the most successful stories in High Street fashion, relying on 1,800 suppliers across the world. It relies on 1,800 suppliers across the world, but nearly all the clothes are brought to Spain where the company is based, to be dispatched to stores in 97 countries. As Zara marks 50 years since the opening of its first store, a rare glimpse into how the secretive brand operates is revealed. The company is navigating fast-changing markets, with growing competition from ultra-cheap online players Shein and Temu, as well as uncertainty surrounding US tariffs.</p>

          <p>The first samples of Moon rock brought back to Earth in nearly 50 years have arrived in the UK - on loan from China. Professor Mahesh Anand is the only scientist in the UK to have been loaned this extremely rare material, which he describes as "more precious than gold dust". After grinding and zapping the dust with lasers, Prof Anand's team hope to answer fundamental questions about how the Moon formed and about the early years of planet Earth. This is the first successful lunar sampling since a Soviet mission in 1976 and catapulted China into a leading position in the new space race.</p>

          <h2>A.I. Tool Estimates Biological Age From Facial Photos</h2>

          <p>Scientists have developed an A.I. tool that they say can help assess a patient‚Äôs health ‚Äî and potentially guide their medical care. The tool, FaceAge, estimates the biological ages of adults with cancer by analyzing photos of their faces. Study participants with younger estimates tended to fare better after treatment than those deemed older by A.I. The findings suggest that people‚Äôs biological age estimates are closely linked to their physical health, which could reflect their ability to survive certain treatments.</p>
