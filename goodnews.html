          <p>Labubu dolls, created by Chinese toy maker Pop Mart, have become a global sensation, embraced by celebrities like Rihanna and Kim Kardashian. The elf-like creatures, designed by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung, have fueled Pop Mart's growth, with shares soaring on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The dolls' popularity has spread from China to Southeast Asia and beyond, with Chinese customs officials seizing over 70,000 fake dolls due to high demand. Some observers see Labubu's success as a sign of China's growing cultural influence, demonstrating Chinese creativity and culture in a way that resonates globally.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden criticized "ongoing efforts to erase history" during a Juneteenth Celebration Service in Galveston, Texas, appearing to take a shot at President Trump. Biden recounted his role in making Juneteenth a federal holiday and chided efforts to remove history from textbooks and classrooms. He also referenced efforts during his administration to rename military bases named after Confederate military officers. Several speakers recognized Biden during the service, praising his role in making Juneteenth a national holiday.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump Administration cannot withhold transportation grant funding from states refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. The judge granted a preliminary injunction, stating that large-scale irreparable harm would occur without it. The ruling comes ahead of a grant application deadline, where the Department of Transportation imposed conditions requiring adherence to an Immigration Enforcement Condition. The judge agreed with the states, finding no plausible connection between cooperating with ICE enforcement and the congressionally approved purposes of the Department of Transportation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged, following monetary easing measures last month, as a trade deal with the U.S. eases some growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%. Trade-war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade while suspending prohibitive tariffs. Chinese authorities are likely to exercise limited urgency in rolling out additional fiscal stimulus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China and its Central Asian partners voiced shared security concerns and showed a united front at a high-level summit in Kazakhstan. The close ties between Beijing and the five Central Asian countries have sparked questions about whether Russia's regional dominance is waning as it remains preoccupied with the Ukraine war. While the Kremlin dismisses these concerns, diplomatic observers note that Moscow has limited capacity to counterbalance China's growing influence. Beijing is avoiding challenging Russia as Central Asia's key security guarantor and dominant power.</p>
