          <p>Aircraft manufacturer Joby Aviation is partnering with defense giant L3Harris to create a next-generation military craft capable of both piloted and autonomous flight. The collaboration will integrate Joby's hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology with L3Harris's expertise in military systems. The companies aim to develop a smaller, cheaper, and more adaptable alternative to traditional military aircraft like the Apache helicopter. Testing is expected to begin this fall, with a focus on applications such as surveillance, reconnaissance, and logistics in contested environments, followed by operational demonstrations in 2026.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times argues that the "Happy Gilmore" film series, including the new sequel, offers more than just comedy, conveying a traditional conservative message about the importance of family. The author notes that in both films, Adam Sandler's character, Happy, is motivated not by personal gain but by an altruistic desire to help his family, first his grandmother and now his daughter. This focus on selfless obligation to older and younger generations, the author contends, reflects a core conservative value that a life well-lived is one that prioritizes family interests above all else.</p>

          <p>Labubu, a small, fluffy monster-like doll created by Pop Mart, has become a global phenomenon, fueled by social media unboxings and celebrity endorsements. The dolls, which have pointed ears and serrated teeth, are sold in "blind boxes," adding a thrill of mystery for collectors. Their popularity has turned them into a form of "social currency," with new editions selling out in minutes and resale prices climbing. Despite recent price increases and reports of fights breaking out in stores, the craze shows no signs of slowing down, as avid fans continue to seek out the coveted collectibles.</p>

          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission has announced it will issue another 100 billion yuan ($13.8 billion) in consumer vouchers to stimulate household spending and support economic growth. This will be the fourth batch of subsidies this year, bringing the total to the annual target of 300 billion yuan. The funds are part of a broader trade-in program for cars and home appliances, which has already generated over 1.7 trillion yuan in sales this year. The move underscores Beijing's focus on consumption as a key driver of the economy, as national retail sales grew 5% in the first half of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Trunk Tools, a startup using generative AI to improve efficiency in the construction industry, has secured $40 million in a Series B funding round. The platform addresses the sector's lack of digitization by processing millions of unstructured documents like blueprints and schedules to pinpoint project risks and clarify instructions for workers. Founder Sarah Buchner, a former construction contractor, aims to reduce the costly errors, delays, and environmental waste that contribute to nearly $1 trillion in lost productivity annually. The technology helps restructure outdated documentation, preventing conflicting orders and improving overall workflow on job sites.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay for the L.A. Affairs column, a writer describes her journey into the city's queer, polyamorous community after moving back to the West Coast. Fresh from a monogamous breakup, she connects with a partnered woman on a dating app who, along with her wife, welcomes her into their world. The author recounts her first few dates, which involved group outings, queer raves, and candid conversations about non-monogamy. Through this experience, she finds the honest, expansive, and joyful community she had been seeking, allowing her to finally feel like her most authentic self in a city where she once felt she had to perform.</p>

          <p>A review of Stephen Starring Grant's memoir, "Mailman: My Wild Ride Delivering the Mail in Appalachia," explores the book's themes of public service, manual labor, and cultural identity. After being laid off from a corporate job, Grant spends a year as a rural mail carrier in Virginia, reconnecting with his Appalachian roots. The book serves as both a personal quest for authenticity and an ethnography of the U.S. Postal Service, celebrating its remarkable efficiency while lamenting its decline as a valued public institution. The reviewer praises Grant's empathetic portrayal of his co-workers and the community, avoiding common stereotypes of the region.</p>

          <p>Founded in 1903, Detroit's Pewabic Pottery has survived over a century of the city's economic booms and busts by staying true to the Arts and Crafts movement's focus on handcrafted quality over mass production. The studio is renowned for its unique, iridescent glazes and architectural tiles, which can be found in museums and buildings across the country. While the world industrialized around it, Pewabic continued to use its original equipment and hand-pressing techniques.

          <h2>Exxon Mobil Beats Earnings Estimates as Record Production Offsets Lower Oil Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 07:34:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil's second-quarter earnings beat Wall Street expectations, even as net income fell 23% to $7.1 billion compared to the previous year. The company's strong performance was driven by record production levels, particularly in the Permian Basin and Guyana, which helped mitigate the impact of lower global oil prices. Exxon achieved its highest second-quarter output in over 25 years, pumping 4.6 million barrels per day. The company also continued its focus on cost-cutting and shareholder returns, paying out $9.2 billion through dividends and share buybacks during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Richard Masters, the chief executive of the Premier League, has stated that the league will not be reducing its size from 20 to 18 clubs. The statement comes amid growing tensions with FIFA over an increasingly congested international football calendar, which has raised concerns about player burnout. Masters argued that the league should not be forced into such a decision to accommodate the expansion of global and European competitions. He criticized FIFA for a lack of proper dialogue with stakeholders regarding the expanded Club World Cup and the 48-team World Cup, which he says are straining domestic schedules.</p>
