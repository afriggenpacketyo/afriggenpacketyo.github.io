          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 17:30:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing new properties. The reforms also aim to streamline the process for opening new businesses in disused shops and encourage more outdoor dining and live performances. While the government hopes this will revitalize struggling town centers, the opposition argues that other economic policies have been more damaging to the hospitality industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a visit to the Maldives aimed at reinforcing diplomatic and economic relations with the island nation. The visit comes after a period of tension, as Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu had previously pursued a pro-China policy and secured the withdrawal of Indian military personnel. During the visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The diplomatic engagement is seen as a strategic effort by India to counteract China's increasing influence in the geopolitically important Indian Ocean region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, according to director Gurinder Chadha. The 2002 movie, which starred Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, is celebrated for inspiring a generation of female football players. Chadha stated that the current success of women's football, exemplified by England's Lionesses, makes it a fitting time to revisit the characters. She is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and the FIFA Women's World Cup, hoping to reunite the original cast.</p>

          <p>The stock price for clothing brand American Eagle has seen a significant increase following the launch of a new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The article suggests that the campaign's success stems from its traditional approach of using a popular and attractive star to sell products, a tactic that has become less common in modern advertising. It posits that many brands have shifted towards messaging-focused ads, sometimes to their financial detriment. The positive market reaction to the Sweeney campaign is presented as evidence that investors and consumers may be ready for a return to more product-focused marketing. (not investment advice)</p>
