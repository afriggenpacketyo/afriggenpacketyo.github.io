        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, expanding restrictions that prevent the Trump administration from denying federal funding to Los Angeles and 30 other 'sanctuary' cities and counties. The ruling states that the administration's threat to withhold all federal funding due to these jurisdictions' policies on immigration enforcement is likely unconstitutional and violates the separation of powers. The White House, however, expressed confidence in winning on appeal, asserting that sanctuary policies interfere with federal immigration enforcement and compromise public safety. This article details an ongoing legal battle over federal funding and local immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Ron Howard's new film 'Eden' is reviewed as a 'sticky, sweaty hoot,' dramatizing the true story of disillusioned Europeans who sought to establish a handmade utopia on a remote Galapagos island in the 1930s, only to see it devolve into petty power struggles and murder. Starring Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby, and Sydney Sweeney, the article praises the film's effective casting and brisk pacing, likening the experience to an expensive reality show about survivalists. The review suggests that while not deeply philosophical, the movie offers entertaining melodrama about human nature under extreme isolation. This article provides an assessment of a new cinematic release.</p>

          <p>The ongoing Ukraine war is significantly reshaping geopolitics in former Soviet states, most notably evidenced by a US-mediated peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia, signaling a decline in Russia's regional influence. While Russia officially welcomed the agreement, some analysts view it as a 'terrible humiliation' for Moscow. Azerbaijan is actively forging new alliances with Turkey and Central Asian countries, leveraging its financial independence and military cooperation. The article suggests that Russia's preoccupation with the conflict in Ukraine has created a 'window of opportunity' for these nations to assert greater independence and diversify their foreign policy.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signal of potential interest rate cuts ignited a significant rally on Wall Street on Friday, particularly boosting cyclical and economically sensitive non-tech stocks such as DuPont and Home Depot. This positive market reaction followed a topsy-turvy week, with investors welcoming the prospect of lower borrowing costs. While some major tech stocks saw only modest gains, their trajectory is more closely linked to the ongoing artificial intelligence boom rather than interest rate fluctuations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average achieved a new all-time high, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also posted rallies, though they did not surpass last week's milestones. Consumer discretionary stocks notably led the S&P 500, reflecting the expectation that reduced rates will increase disposable income for consumers, stimulating spending across the economy.
