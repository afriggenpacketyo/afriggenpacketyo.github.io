          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a ¬£122.7 million fine, the largest ever issued by Ofwat, for violations related to sewage operations and shareholder payouts. The penalty includes ¬£104.5 million for sewage-related breaches and an additional ¬£18.2 million for undeserved dividends, marking the first time Ofwat has fined a water company for this reason. Thames Water, serving a quarter of the UK's population, faces criticism for sewage discharges and a ¬£20 billion debt, but recently secured a ¬£3 billion emergency loan to avoid collapse. The regulator emphasized that the fines will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers, as Thames Water continues to grapple with performance issues and financial instability.</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine is visiting Berlin for his third meeting in as many weeks with Germany's new Chancellor Friedrich Merz, underscoring Merz's focus on the war in Ukraine. This visit highlights Merz's efforts to reestablish German leadership among European allies, especially as U.S. support for NATO weakens. Discussions are expected to center on continued military assistance, particularly the Taurus missile system, as Ukraine seeks to bolster its defense capabilities. Merz's proactive engagement contrasts with the previous chancellor's cooler relationship with Zelenskyy, signaling a strengthened commitment from Germany to support Ukraine amid ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan recommends decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use. The London Drugs Commission's report, led by Lord Falconer, suggests removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA). Khan supports the findings, arguing that current rules "cannot be justified," while critics like David Raynes warn it could wrongly signal that cannabis is less harmful. The report also proposes improved public health services, enhanced cannabis education, and fair access to medical cannabis, with a reassessment of broader legalization in five years.</p>

          <p>Chinese customs authorities are intercepting individuals suspected of smuggling Pop Mart toys, including Labubu and Molly dolls, as prices increase due to the Beijing-based retailer's global expansion. Customs agents have seized undeclared toys from travelers allegedly intending to resell them for profit. Pop Mart, which has expanded to over 500 stores in more than 30 countries, sees lower prices for its sought-after toys overseas due to currency fluctuations and local discounts. This has led to travelers buying the toys abroad and bringing them back into China, creating a lucrative smuggling market.</p>

          <p>Tesco's introduction of AI-powered cameras at self-checkouts, designed to reduce shoplifting by detecting unscanned items, has sparked both mockery and concern among shoppers. The system shows a live-action replay when an item isn't scanned properly, leading to comparisons with the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) in football. While some customers joked about the technology, others expressed privacy concerns and vowed to avoid self-checkouts. This move comes as shoplifting rates in the UK have reached record highs, costing retailers billions of pounds annually, prompting other supermarkets like Sainsbury's to implement similar AI recognition systems.</p>

Federal prosecutors alleged the fire was caused by inadequately maintained trees contacting power lines.
