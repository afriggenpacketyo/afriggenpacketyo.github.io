          <p>Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner criticized Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government as he stepped down as chairman of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). Lindner stated that voters wanted less state intervention and more freedom, but the new government is delivering more state control and debt. He warned that the government's fiscal policy could have negative economic consequences. Lindner was previously fired as finance minister, leading the FDP to withdraw from the coalition and triggering an early election. Christian D√ºrr has been chosen to replace Lindner as FDP chairman.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is preparing for a potential influx of mainland Chinese companies that may face delisting from US stock exchanges. Amid rising tensions between the US and China, the possibility of Chinese stocks being delisted from American exchanges is seen as an opportunity for Hong Kong's markets. Deloitte China has submitted proposals to the Chief Executive‚Äôs Policy Unit, outlining strategies to bolster Hong Kong's financial preparedness, including simplifying listing procedures and securing funding for these companies. The move aims to capitalize on the growing concerns about financial decoupling between the two economic giants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese defence scientists are working on transforming traditional rocket artillery into a system capable of striking aerial targets. A research team at the National University of Defence Technology has developed the Tianxing-1, a small rocket featuring wings and adjustable tail fins for extended range and maneuverability. Launched from ground-based platforms, the rocket transitions into a glide phase to engage targets. While similar to hypersonic glide missiles, the Tianxing-1 operates at a slower pace, making it potentially less effective against high-speed aircraft or drones.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for much of the Chicago area as a fast-moving wall of dust blanketed the city and suburbs. The National Weather Service confirmed it was only the second time in its history that it issued a dust storm warning. Winds of 60 to 70 mph over dry farmlands caused the dust storm, significantly reducing visibility on major interstates. Showers and thunderstorms mixed with the dust storm, leading to reports of "mud rain." The storms also caused ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports.</p>
