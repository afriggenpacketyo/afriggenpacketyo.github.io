          <p>A Cessna 208B aircraft carrying 15 people for a skydiving trip crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey. The pilot reported engine trouble before attempting to return to the airport and crashing in a wooded area. Miraculously, there were no fatalities, though injuries ranged from minor to severe, with some individuals covered in jet fuel. An investigation revealed that the same plane was involved in a 2023 incident where it sustained substantial damage during a landing, which the NTSB attributed to the pilot's inadequate landing flare.</p>

          <p>Following Clayton Kershaw's historic 3,000th career strikeout, this opinion article argues that his sustained excellence and longevity establish him as the greatest pitcher in the history of the Los Angeles Dodgers, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. While Koufax had a period of unparalleled dominance, his career was much shorter. The author contends that Kershaw's 18 seasons of elite performance, leading to more wins and strikeouts, outweigh his postseason struggles, which occurred over a much larger sample size of games. Kershaw's enduring presence and professionalism are cited as foundational to the team's modern golden age.</p>

          <p>With the House of Representatives operating on a razor-thin Republican majority, the possibility of a tie vote on major legislation has become more relevant. According to House rules, if a vote on a question results in a tie, the measure is considered lost and fails to pass. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. This procedural reality was highlighted in a 2024 vote on impeaching a cabinet secretary and is a critical factor in the current struggle to pass President Trump's spending bill.</p>

The research found that for women under 55 with a uterus, combination therapy using estrogen plus progestin (a synthetic hormone) increases the risk. Conversely, for women without a uterus who can take estrogen alone, the therapy was found to reduce breast cancer risk. This research refines previous findings and underscores the importance of personalized medical advice, as hormone therapy remains a highly effective treatment for many menopausal symptoms.</p>
