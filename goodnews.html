          <p>Bill Gates has announced plans to donate virtually all his wealth to the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years, with the intention of closing its doors permanently by 2045. This commitment would require the foundation to maintain a high level of annual spending, potentially doubling its current rate of $9 billion per year. Gates emphasized the importance of timeliness in philanthropy, aiming to address current global health challenges more rapidly. He criticized the reduction of government funding for global aid and contrasted his approach with that of Elon Musk, who has reduced aid contributions.</p>
