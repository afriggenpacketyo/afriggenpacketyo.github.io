          <p>The Senate has moved forward with the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to regulate stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The bill mandates that stablecoin issuers maintain reserves and prioritize repayment to coin holders in case of bankruptcy, while also adhering to anti-money laundering rules. Supporters claim the act will protect consumers and foster innovation, but critics, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, argue that it's a weak regulatory framework that fails to address conflicts of interest, particularly those exemplified by Trump's cryptocurrency ventures. The bill includes a provision prohibiting members of Congress from issuing stablecoins during their public service. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla will launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The service will initially start with about 10 Model Y vehicles equipped with FSD Unsupervised, and will be geofenced to limit their driving areas. Tesla employees will remotely monitor the fleet, with Musk promising no human safety drivers will be present in the vehicles. This move puts Tesla in direct competition with Alphabet's Waymo, which already operates commercial, driverless ride-hailing services in several U.S. markets.</p>

          <p>The Phoenix Suns and Mercury have refuted allegations in a recent lawsuit claiming that CEO Josh Bartelstein had an affair with WNBA player Sophie Cunningham. The accusation surfaced in a lawsuit from a former employee, Gene Traylor, who alleged that Bartelstein was confronted about the rumor. The Suns responded with a statement calling the allegations "entirely false and morally reprehensible," accusing the attorney representing Traylor of inserting salacious lies to coerce a settlement. The Suns also called Taylor's allegations against the franchise delusional and categorically false.</p>

          <p>Despite gold's recent price surge, safe investment strategies remain crucial. Investors should limit gold holdings to a maximum of 10% of their portfolio, avoid riskier investment types like gold mining stocks, and monitor the economic climate for selling opportunities. Traditional advice of limiting gold investment is still applicable, even with all of the changes in the gold market. Monitoring the economic climate is critical to ensure that gold maintains its ability as a hedge against inflation and a reliable diversification tool. (not investment advice)</p>
