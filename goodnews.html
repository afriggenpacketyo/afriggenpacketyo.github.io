          <p>Gold prices have experienced significant growth over the past five years, driven by factors such as inflation and economic uncertainty. As of June 10, 2025, the price of gold per ounce is $3,343.44, representing a nearly 93% increase since June 2020. Despite this surge, experts believe gold remains a worthwhile investment due to its potential for further price increases and its role as a portfolio diversifier. Alternative investment options, such as fractional gold, are available for those concerned about the high current price. (not investment advice)</p>

The issue centers on John Textor, who owns a stake in both Crystal Palace and Lyon, both of whom have qualified for the competition. UEFA regulations prevent an individual from holding a majority stake in two clubs participating in the same European tournament. If Palace is deemed ineligible, Forest could potentially benefit by moving up to the Europa League.</p>
