          <p>Amazon has significantly expanded its same-day grocery delivery service, now offering fresh items like produce, meat, and dairy in over 1,000 U.S. cities and towns. The company plans to extend this service to 2,300 locations by the end of the year, aiming to enhance convenience for its customers. This move allows shoppers to order perishable groceries alongside other Amazon products like electronics and household goods in a single cart for rapid delivery. The service is free for Prime members on orders over $25, positioning Amazon to compete more aggressively with rivals like Instacart and Walmart+.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Amazon's announcement of its expanded same-day fresh grocery delivery, market analyst Jim Cramer commented on the competitive implications for other retailers. While the news caused shares of grocery chains like Kroger and Albertsons to fall, Cramer argued that Costco should not be significantly impacted as its business model is based on in-person volume and price, not delivery. He also noted that Nvidia's stock saw a minor dip, partly influenced by the poor earnings report from CoreWeave, a major renter of its chips. Cramer emphasized the incredible value proposition of the Amazon Prime membership with this new grocery feature. (not investment advice)</p>

While the team has not officially disclosed the injury, his agent confirmed the incident and stated Harris is expected to be fully ready for the upcoming NFL season. However, head coach Jim Harbaugh noted there is a chance the running back may not be available for the season opener. Harris, a former first-round pick, signed a one-year contract with the Chargers in the offseason.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the case against Bryan Patrick Miller, known as the "Zombie Hunter," who was convicted of murdering two women in Phoenix in the early 1990s. The case went cold for over two decades until investigators utilized genetic genealogy in 2014, which pointed them toward the Miller surname. After identifying Bryan Miller as a person of interest due to a prior assault charge, police conducted surveillance and obtained his DNA through an undercover sting at a restaurant. Miller was found guilty and sentenced to death, though he maintains his innocence from death row.</p>

          <p>An undercover operation at a Phoenix Chili's restaurant was pivotal in capturing the notorious "canal killer" decades after his crimes. In 2015, a cold case detective met with suspect Bryan Patrick Miller under the guise of a job offer to surreptitiously collect his DNA from a water glass. At the time, the detective was skeptical that the mild-mannered Miller, a local character known as the "Zombie Hunter," could be the brutal murderer. However, eleven days later, the DNA from the glass was confirmed as a match to evidence from the 1990s crime scenes, leading to Miller's immediate arrest.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining elevated, financial experts are highlighting the potential benefits of investing in annuities for a stable retirement income. The ideal investment amount depends on individual factors like age, risk tolerance, and existing income sources, with suggestions typically ranging from 20% to 50% of a portfolio. Analysts suggest that now may be an opportune time to lock in higher payouts before potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. Annuities offer tax-deferred growth and can protect against outliving savings, providing a secure income floor for essential expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has referred himself to the Environment Agency for an "administrative oversight" after fishing without a proper license. The incident occurred while he was hosting U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the Chevening House government estate. In England, anglers over 13 must have a rod license, with fines for non-compliance reaching up to £2,500. A Foreign Office spokesperson confirmed that as soon as the error was realized, Lammy purchased the necessary licenses and notified the agency to rectify the mistake.</p>

          <p>Traffic to major pornography websites in the United Kingdom has significantly decreased since the implementation of new age verification rules under the Online Safety Act. Data from analytics firm Similarweb shows that top sites like Pornhub and XVideos saw traffic drop by 47% in the weeks after the checks were introduced on July 25. The new law requires sites to implement stricter measures to prevent minors from accessing explicit content. While traffic to major regulated sites has fallen, some data suggests that visits to smaller, less-regulated sites may have increased, raising concerns about user migration.</p>

          <p>As of mid-August 2025, the price of gold is approximately $3,353 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant change. The value of this precious metal is influenced by a variety of factors, including fundamental supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation rates. Gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset during times of geopolitical uncertainty or economic turmoil, which can drive its price up. Additionally, movements in currency values, particularly the U.S. dollar, and the interest rate policies of central banks play a significant role in its market fluctuations.

          <p>The Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET), a critical tool for predicting and preventing global food crises, is coming back online after its operations were frozen by the Trump administration in January. For decades, the U.S.-funded system has provided vital data to aid organizations and governments, helping to avert disasters like the potential 2016 famine in Ethiopia. Humanitarian experts have expressed relief at its return but remain cautious, questioning if the revived system will have the same rigor and if governments will act on its warnings amid cuts to humanitarian aid. The shutdown created a dangerous information gap for decision-makers.</p>

          <p>Bodhana Sivanandan, a 10-year-old from Harrow, London, has become the youngest person ever to be awarded the title of Woman International Master by the International Chess Federation. She secured the title after defeating a 60-year-old grandmaster at the 2025 British Chess Championship. Bodhana, who first took up the game during the COVID-19 pandemic at age five, has rapidly ascended the ranks of the chess world. Her family has no history of chess proficiency, making her prodigious talent even more remarkable as she now aims for the ultimate title of grandmaster.</p>

          <p>Alcohol consumption among U.S. adults has fallen to its lowest level on record, according to a new Gallup survey. The poll found that only 54% of Americans report drinking alcohol, and for the first time, a majority (53%) view even moderate drinking as harmful to one's health. This marks a significant shift in public perception, up from 45% last year. The decline in drinking does not appear to be offset by a rise in cannabis use, suggesting a broader trend toward abstention possibly driven by growing health warnings and economic pressures.</p>

          <p>Since the ousting of Syrian President Bashar Assad in December 2024, approximately 1,337 Syrians residing in Germany have voluntarily returned to their home country. The German government, which hosts over a million Syrian refugees, suspended most new asylum application processing and has encouraged voluntary returns by allowing short-term visits without loss of protected status. This policy aims to let Syrians assess the situation on the ground for themselves. Meanwhile, Germany's interior minister is also working on plans to begin deportations, starting with convicted criminals, amid ongoing security concerns in Syria.</p>

The order prohibits ICE from holding detainees unless it provides basic necessities like sleeping mats, hygiene products, access to medication, and in-person legal visits. The ruling came after a lawsuit from the ACLU and other advocates exposed what they called "inhumane" conditions, including video of detainees sleeping on bare floors. The judge also imposed limits on the number of people who can be held at the site, which the government claims is only for short-term processing.</p>
