          <h2>Ed Miliband Defends Revised Winter Fuel Payment Policy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 08:46:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband defended Chancellor Rachel Reeves' decision to initially cut winter fuel payments for pensioners and the subsequent partial reversal. Miliband stated that the initial cuts were necessary to stabilize the economy and that the improved financial situation allowed for the expansion of eligibility to more pensioners. The revised policy will provide payments to nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less, costing around ¬£1.25 billion. Critics argue the government has already spent savings from the initial cuts, and extending the payment wouldn't be the most effective way to reduce poverty. The government claims that the change would "not lead to permanent additional borrowing" due to an improving economy. Optimism that the government is listening to its constituents is tempered by the fact that the original cuts were made in the first place. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>TalkTV host David Bull has been named the new chairman of Reform UK, succeeding Zia Yusuf, who resigned after a disagreement over calls for a burka ban. Bull, a long-time ally of Nigel Farage, will focus on providing leadership to activists rather than administrative tasks. Yusuf will transition to leading the party's "Doge team," aimed at cutting wasteful spending in Reform-controlled councils. The appointment reflects a shift towards a more media-savvy leadership style, as the party navigates internal divisions and seeks to expand its influence.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maine ruled that a 43-year-old migrant, Eyidi Ambila, cannot be deported to the Democratic Republic of Congo while his immigration appeals are ongoing. Ambila, who arrived in the U.S. at age 7, argues that his full immigration case has not been heard. The judge cited "many unanswered questions" about the case and the likelihood of deportation in the near future. The ACLU of Maine contends that Ambila has no current connection to the Congo and would be vulnerable to detainment, torture, and death if deported.</p>
