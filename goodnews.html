          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) has released its annual allergy report, identifying the most challenging US cities for seasonal allergy sufferers. Wichita, Kansas, tops the list for the third consecutive year, due to high tree and grass pollen counts. The report also factors in over-the-counter allergy medicine use and allergist availability. Experts recommend starting medications early, washing clothes after outdoor exposure, and staying indoors during peak pollen times to manage allergy symptoms, noting that symptoms can mimic those of colds and viruses.</p>

          <p>While overall electric vehicle (EV) exports from China to the UK have decreased, plug-in hybrid vehicle exports are experiencing a significant surge. In March, hybrid EV exports to the UK increased dramatically, highlighting a growing preference for these vehicles among British consumers. The UK remains a key export destination for Chinese EVs, benefiting from lower import tariffs compared to the European Union. This trend reflects a shift in consumer choices towards more affordable hybrid options amidst rising costs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that imminent progress is being made in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. This comes after Putin announced a unilateral three-day ceasefire covering Russia's Victory Day celebrations, which Ukraine stated was repeatedly violated. Zelenskyy instead offered a full 30-day ceasefire and indicated that he and other European leaders agreed that "a complete and unconditional ceasefire" should begin soon. Putin responded by offering direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, leading Zelenskyy to call Putin's offer "a positive sign.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, encourages mothers to stop striving for perfection and cut themselves some slack. She argues that being flawed is a crucial part of motherhood, teaching children to accept their own imperfections. Ross notes that the field of psychiatry has historically blamed mothers for their children's problems, but it's time to acknowledge the immense credit mothers deserve. The article emphasizes that mothers are constantly bombarded with messages that they're not doing enough, leading to unnecessary guilt and self-doubt.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish PhD student at Tufts University, has been released from a Louisiana immigration detention center and has returned to Boston. Ozturk was held for over six weeks after being arrested by immigration officers near the university, following her co-authorship of an op-ed criticizing Tufts' response to the war in Gaza. Her lawyers argue that her arrest and detention were unlawful, designed to punish her for exercising her First Amendment rights. A judge ordered her release with no travel restrictions, citing that she was not a flight risk or a danger to the community.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has praised the first day of high-level trade talks between American and Chinese officials in Switzerland, describing a "total reset" in US-China trade relations. He stated the talks were "very good" and that change had been "negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner." The meetings aim to de-escalate the trade war, which has seen the US impose tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports and China retaliate with levies of 125% on some US goods. Despite the positive remarks, Washington maintains it will not lower tariffs unilaterally, requiring concessions from China.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now comprising 59% of its energy initiatives on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China's energy sector investment and construction activity in Africa totaled $66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. The surge in renewable energy investments aligns with China's global shift away from fossil fuels and is driven by Africa's growing energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
