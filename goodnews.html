          <p>Urawa Reds, representing Japan at the Club World Cup due to their Asian Champions League win, were defeated 3-1 by Argentina's River Plate. Despite strong support in Seattle, Urawa conceded all goals through headers, with River Plate taking an early lead. Urawa briefly rallied, with captain Marius Hoibraten scoring a disallowed goal due to offside, and Yusuke Matsuo converting a penalty. However, defensive lapses cost them as River Plate secured the victory, leaving Urawa facing a tough road ahead with Inter Milan next on the schedule. The match was decided by small details, but Urawa showed promise in dominating parts of the game.</p>

          <p>The Group of Seven (G7) leaders launched an action plan to mitigate risks in critical mineral supply chains, largely stemming from over-reliance on China. The strategy aims to bolster economic security by enhancing cooperation among G7 nations and like-minded countries, countering nonmarket practices. Areas of cooperation include monitoring mineral shortages, responding to market disruptions, and diversifying mining and recycling efforts. The G7 will also develop a roadmap for standards-based critical mineral markets and increase investments in responsible mining projects, though emphasizing the importance of stable relations with China while urging them to avoid market distortions.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's policy of only allowing two gender options, male and female, on U.S. passports. The ruling extends a previous order and suspends the policy for all Americans, stating it discriminates on the basis of sex and is rooted in prejudice. The judge argued that transgender and nonbinary individuals would face psychological distress, harassment, and discrimination if forced to travel with passports that conflict with their gender identity. The Trump administration's order, titled "Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism," directed agencies to recognize only two sexes.</p>

The trials will include refinancing schemes using credit-based relending for foreign trade enterprises, cross-border trade refinancing with rediscount support, and an expanded green finance programme.
