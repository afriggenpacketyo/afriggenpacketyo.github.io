          <p>Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor and former mathematics professor, won the presidential election in Romania, defeating George Simion, a nationalist aligned with President Trump. Simion initially claimed victory and called for protests, echoing Trump's "stop the steal" efforts. Dan's victory is expected to ease concerns about Romania potentially aligning with countries opposing aid to Ukraine. Dan's win represents a middle ground for voters amidst polarized political camps, as he campaigned on a platform of a democratic, stable, and respected Romania within Europe, contrasting Simion's nationalist agenda.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to author Ian O'Connor, Aaron Rodgers may be poised to join the Pittsburgh Steelers, viewing it as an opportunity to redeem his reputation after an "embarrassing" stint with the New York Jets. O'Connor suggests Rodgers has verbally committed to the Steelers, contingent on resolving personal issues by the end of May, so he can fully participate in mandatory minicamp. While O'Connor doesn't foresee a Super Bowl win for the Steelers with Rodgers, he believes an 11-6 record and a playoff victory are realistic possibilities. Rodgers' potential move to Pittsburgh represents a chance to revitalize his career and contribute to a competitive team.</p>

To protect themselves, recipients should not scan QR codes, avoid returning the item, check financial accounts for unauthorized activity, and report the package to authorities.</p>

          <p>Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, appeared to win the first round of Poland's presidential election, a vote crucial as the government seeks to reverse hard-right policies. Trzaskowski, from Prime Minister Donald Tusk's Civic Platform, secured 30.8 percent of the vote but faces a runoff against Karol Nowrocki, backed by the Law and Justice party, who garnered 29.1 percent. The election is viewed as a test of Tusk's ability to undo the legacy of the Law and Justice party and restore judicial independence, media pluralism, and civil debate.</p>
