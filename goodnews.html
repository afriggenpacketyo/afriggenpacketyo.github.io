          <p>TeleMessage, a messaging app used by former National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, has temporarily suspended its services following a reported hack. Smarsh, the parent company of TeleMessage, is investigating the potential security incident and has engaged an external cybersecurity firm to assist. The hack reportedly compromised messages sent through TeleMessage's versions of Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat. However, the article states that the hacker did not obtain messages from Waltz or his contacts, and the suspension is a precautionary measure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major Hollywood studios such as Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery briefly declined after President Donald Trump proposed a 100% tariff on movies made overseas. Trump cited tax incentives offered by foreign countries as a national security threat. Wedbush's Alicia Reese estimates that a significant portion of Netflix's content is produced internationally, and the tariffs could impact relationships with other countries, as Hollywood relies on international box office sales. Questions remain about the implementation of the tariffs and their impact on TV shows and already completed projects.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 financial guidance, citing an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs. The Detroit automaker expects to offset $1 billion of those costs through remediation actions as well as volume and pricing expectations for a total impact of $1.5 billion in 2025. Ford cited "near-term risks, especially the potential for industrywide supply chain disruption impacting production" and the potential for future or increased tariffs in the U.S. Ford's traditional "Blue" operations reported an only 3% decline in revenue but a nearly 90% plummet in EBIT results to $96 million during the first quarter.</p>
