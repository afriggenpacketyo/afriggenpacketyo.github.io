        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two major European clinical trials have found that a specific blend of cannabis oil was more effective than a placebo for treating low back pain and offered better relief with fewer side effects compared to opioids. The German-funded studies showed that patients using the cannabis tincture experienced significant pain reduction and improved sleep. While these findings are considered groundbreaking, the specific product, VER-01, is not yet approved in the U.S. and would require further trials. The research adds substantial evidence to the debate on medical cannabis as a viable alternative for chronic pain management, a common reason patients seek it.</p>

          <p>Steel manufacturer Cleveland-Cliffs announced it is investigating the commercial viability of mining rare earths at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota, causing its shares to surge by 17%. CEO Lourenco Goncalves stated that geological surveys indicate the presence of these critical minerals, which are essential for manufacturing magnets used in electric vehicles, weapons, and electronics. This potential expansion aligns with the U.S. government's strategy to reduce dependency on China, which currently dominates the global rare earth supply chain. The move positions Cleveland-Cliffs as a potential key player in establishing American mineral independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite facing significant challenges including geopolitical tensions, tariffs, and inflation, the U.S. automotive industry has proven more resilient than many analysts initially predicted for 2025. While automakers like Ford, GM, and Tesla are expected to report lower earnings, overall industry sales and production have held up better than anticipated. The sector is navigating a complex balancing act, with tariff costs being partially offset by deregulation and corporate tax benefits. However, persistent headwinds such as slowing consumer demand, uncertainty from the government shutdown, and stress in subprime auto lending create a cautiously optimistic outlook for the industry's future.

          <p>In his daily market analysis, Jim Cramer expressed optimism about Boeing's financial prospects after the company received official approval to increase its 737 MAX production rate, a move expected to boost cash flow. He also identified Starbucks as a strong buying opportunity, citing confidence in CEO Brian Niccol's turnaround plan and the significant, previously underestimated value of its China business. Cramer's commentary reflects a generally positive market sentiment at the start of the week, influenced by the 10-year Treasury yield holding at 4%. His insights suggest potential growth for both the aerospace giant and the coffee chain in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party is formulating its next five-year plan, facing a critical choice between stimulating domestic consumption and investing heavily in high-tech industries to achieve technological sovereignty. Amid geopolitical competition with the U.S., particularly concerning access to advanced semiconductors, Beijing appears to be prioritizing industrial policy and manufacturing. Analysts believe this focus on building "hard power" will continue, even as the economy struggles with gloomy consumer sentiment and a sputtering real estate sector. While some measures to boost household income are expected, significant resources will likely be directed toward science and technology to reduce dependence on foreign supply chains.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period begins, beneficiaries are advised to carefully review their options, with the ongoing government shutdown potentially causing delays in accessing information. While core services like the Medicare Plan Finder portal remain operational, experts suggest waiting to finalize 2026 coverage decisions until the government reopens to ensure access to full support. Beneficiaries should compare traditional Medicare with private Medicare Advantage plans, weighing factors like provider networks, supplemental benefits, and out-of-pocket costs. It is crucial to check prescription drug coverage, as plans and costs can change significantly year-over-year, making shopping around a financially prudent step.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry has approved the over-the-counter sale of an emergency contraceptive pill, a landmark decision for reproductive health in the country. The "morning-after" pill, Norlevo, will be available at pharmacies without a doctor's prescription, although it will initially require the purchaser to take it in the presence of a pharmacist. This move, which follows a successful trial sale, aligns Japan with over 90 other countries where such medication is already accessible. Activists have long campaigned for this change, arguing that the prescription requirement created significant barriers for women, particularly young people and victims of sexual assault, seeking timely access to emergency contraception.</p>

He warned, however, that if an agreement is not reached, the Trump administration might consider "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. The shutdown stems from a disagreement over Democratic demands to include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits in any stopgap spending bill. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) generally lose their value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, depreciating by an average of 13% more over a five-year period. This rapid depreciation is attributed to several factors, including historically generous government and manufacturer incentives that lower the benchmark for used prices. The fast pace of technological advancement, particularly in battery range, also makes older models less desirable to value-oriented used car buyers. However, as more affordable, mainstream EV models enter the market and the technology stabilizes, this trend of accelerated depreciation could begin to change. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the process and difficulty of getting approved for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which offers to eliminate most unsecured debts. The primary obstacle is the "means test," which compares a filer's household income to their state's median income. Those with incomes below the median typically qualify easily, while those above must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income after expenses. Approval can also be denied for recent prior bankruptcy filings, failure to complete required credit counseling, or signs of fraud, such as hiding assets or making luxury purchases just before filing. For most people with modest incomes, the process is straightforward.</p>

The election result is also interpreted as a rejection of Turkey's increasing political and religious influence, with Erhurman campaigning to preserve the community's secular identity.

They also offer a source of income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is advantageous in the current rate-cutting cycle.
