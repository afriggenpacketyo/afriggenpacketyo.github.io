        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report from career site Indeed indicates that generative AI could "radically transform" about 26% of jobs, particularly affecting white-collar roles in technology and finance that rely on cognitive reasoning. While some companies have already announced AI-related workforce reductions, economists note that widespread disruption has not yet occurred and many effects remain speculative. The debate continues whether AI will primarily automate jobs, making workers obsolete, or augment them, increasing productivity. For now, most industries are adopting a hybrid model where human oversight remains essential.</p>

          <p>A new trend among Gen Z, known as "locking in," involves periods of intense focus on personal goals, often related to health, finance, or self-improvement. Originating from sports and gaming culture, the trend has become a social media phenomenon, seen as a reaction against the constant distractions of digital life and the economic anxieties facing the generation. While some critics view it as a performative act of productivity, others see it as a coping mechanism for navigating a world with diminished economic security and the psychological effects of the pandemic.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Joe Root has downplayed criticism from Australian commentators regarding his failure to score a century in Test matches in Australia. Root, who averages a respectable 35.68 in the country, insists that the upcoming Ashes series is about the team's success, not his personal milestones. He stated that in five years, people will remember the series scoreline, not what pundits said. Traveling without the burden of captaincy for the first time on an Australian tour, Root expressed excitement about England's different approach, particularly its formidable fast-bowling attack, which he believes gives the team its best chance to win in years.</p>

A senior Hamas official stated the group has shown "positivity" and submitted a list of prisoners for a potential exchange, while Israeli media reports "cautious optimism."

          <p>Lei Jun, the founder and CEO of Xiaomi, announced on social media that the initial sales for the company's new 17-series smartphones have "exceeded expectations." Launched last month, the new flagship line is positioned to compete directly with Apple's iPhone 17 and offerings from Huawei in the premium market segment. Another company executive apologized for stock shortages due to high demand, noting that over one million units were sold in the first week. The positive sales figures reflect Xiaomi's growing confidence in its strategy to capture a larger share of the high-end smartphone market.</p>

          <p>In a series of op-eds published by the Communist Party's official newspaper, China's economy has been described as an "unsinkable economic aircraft carrier" capable of withstanding any external pressures or internal challenges. The articles, released ahead of a key political meeting, emphasize the stability and predictability of China's long-term planning compared to what it calls the shifting and self-isolating policies of some Western nations. This messaging aims to project an image of strength and resilience as the country transitions toward an economy driven more by innovation, consumption, and sustainable development.

          <h2>Autistic Contributor Argues Against Viewing Neurodivergence as a Defect to Be Eliminated</h2>

          <p>In a personal essay, a mathematics professor diagnosed with autism in their 30s reflects on a life of feeling different and the eventual clarity the diagnosis provided. The author argues that autism is not a tragedy and pushes back against conversations that frame it as a problem to be solved, drawing parallels to the historical eugenics movement and the suppression of deaf culture. They contend that autistic traits like persistence and attention to detail are strengths, particularly in fields like science and mathematics, citing historical figures like Isaac Newton. The article champions the value of neurodiversity, asserting that difference is not a defect.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article from NPR's Planet Money team explains the crucial role that preorders play in the publishing industry while promoting their own new book. Preorders are a key metric for booksellers when deciding on promotion, such as prominent store placement and website visibility, as they signal strong potential customer interest. Furthermore, all preorders are counted as first-day sales, which significantly increases a book's chance of debuting on a bestseller list and creating a snowball effect of further sales. This insight reveals how early consumer support can be instrumental in determining a new book's market trajectory and ultimate success.</p>

          <p>Wharton professor and AI expert Ethan Mollick advised human resources leaders at a CNBC summit to be wary of predictions about AI's impact on the job market, bluntly stating that "no one knows anything." He emphasized that even top AI research labs are uncertain about the technology's ultimate use cases and effects on employment. Mollick suggested that instead of relying on predictions, leaders should encourage widespread, hands-on experimentation with AI tools like ChatGPT to discover their practical applications organically. He warned that simply automating tasks without imagination would be a mistake, and urged leaders to use the technology themselves to understand its potential.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry has been jointly awarded to Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson, and Omar M. Yaghi for their pioneering work on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These are molecular constructions with large, porous structures that allow gases and other chemicals to flow through them. The Nobel committee highlighted the enormous potential of MOFs for a wide range of applications, including harvesting water from desert air, capturing carbon dioxide, and storing toxic gases. The laureates' research, which began in the late 1980s, has opened up new possibilities for creating custom-made materials with novel functions.</p>

In a separate development, the German government has confirmed it will not agree to a controversial EU plan for "chat controls," which would scan private messages for illegal content before encryption. Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig stated that such arbitrary surveillance should be "taboo in a democracy," aligning Germany with privacy advocates and data protection experts who oppose the measure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law, Assembly Bill 628, that will mandate landlords to include a working refrigerator and stove in their rental properties. Authored by Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, the bill reclassifies these appliances from "amenities" to necessities required for a unit to be considered habitable. The law, which applies to new leases starting January 1, 2026, aims to ease the financial burden on tenants, who often face significant upfront costs when moving. This change brings these essential appliances in line with other required standards like heating and running water.</p>
