          <h2>Global Markets Brace for Potential 'China Shock' Amid Overcapacity Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 01:46:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global economy is bracing for a potential 'China shock' as overcapacity in Chinese manufacturing leads to deflationary pressures worldwide. Chinese producers are offering steep discounts to destock inventories due to weak domestic demand and intense competition. This influx of low-cost goods could provide some relief to inflation-hit economies by lowering consumer costs. However, concerns are rising among Asian economies about being overwhelmed by cheap Chinese imports, prompting discussions about trade barriers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's central bank exceeded market forecasts by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower-than-expected growth as reasons for the cut. While the RBI held its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, it revised its inflation outlook downward to 3.7%. The central bank also shifted its monetary policy stance to neutral, signaling limited room for further rate cuts to support growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report by PwC challenges common myths about artificial intelligence, finding that AI actually makes workers more valuable. The report analyzes job ads and financial reports, revealing that jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations. Productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries best positioned to adopt AI since 2022. The report suggests AI enriches jobs by freeing employees from tedious tasks, enabling them to focus on complex skills and decision-making, and that AI is creating new jobs.</p>

The International Maritime Organisation's push for net-zero emissions in the shipping industry is driving investments in decarbonization technologies, leading to new ship orders. MSC acknowledges the US effort to revive shipbuilding but emphasizes the current competence and capability of Chinese shipyards.</p>
