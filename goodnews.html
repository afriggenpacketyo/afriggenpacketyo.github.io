          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about shark conservation. Pugh aimed to challenge negative perceptions of sharks popularized by the movie "Jaws," which was filmed in the area. Over 12 days, Pugh swam in frigid waters, enduring harsh weather conditions, to highlight the unsustainable rate at which sharks are killed globally. Accompanied by safety personnel and a shark deterrent device, Pugh emphasized the importance of protecting these apex predators for a healthy ocean ecosystem.</p>

Rangel's career was marked by both significant achievements and an ethics censure in 2010, though he continued to serve in the House until his retirement in 2017.</p>

          <p>A 62-year-old woman was surprised to receive a Social Security spousal benefit of only $1,000, rather than the expected half of her husband's $3,200 monthly benefit. The discrepancy arose because spousal benefits are calculated based on the primary insurance amount (PIA) at full retirement age, not the increased benefit from delayed retirement credits. Her husband's decision to wait until age 70 to claim benefits increased his payout, but spousal benefits are calculated using his PIA at age 66, and her benefit was further reduced due to claiming early.</p>
