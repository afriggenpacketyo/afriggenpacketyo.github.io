          <p>A 20-story residential building in the Bronx's Mott Haven neighborhood experienced a partial collapse after a suspected boiler room explosion. The blast, which occurred as the heating system was being activated, tore away a corner of the high-rise, sending debris onto the street below. Miraculously, no injuries or fatalities were reported among the building's approximately 3,500 residents. Officials have evacuated 38 apartments as a precaution while engineers assess the building's structural integrity, though residents have raised concerns about pre-existing issues like mold and leaks. The incident is under investigation, with city records showing active violations for unsafe facades at the building.</p>

          <p>Despite gold prices reaching record highs, consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China are adapting their purchasing habits, particularly for traditional wedding jewelry. The price of gold has surged over 48% this year, following a significant increase in the previous year, pushing the cost of items like dragon and phoenix bracelets to new levels. Retailers like Chow Tai Fook have observed that consumers are gradually accepting the higher prices, driven by cultural obligations and the necessity of purchasing for upcoming ceremonies. This trend indicates a resilient demand for gold in the region, even in the face of unprecedented market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role in “Breaking Bad,” will not face criminal charges following an altercation where he was accused of intentionally spraying three women with water. The Los Angeles city attorney’s office declined to file charges but did not provide a specific reason for the decision. The incident occurred last month when the women parked very close to Cruz's vehicle while he was washing it in front of his home. According to his agent, Cruz had asked them to move to avoid getting wet, and any spraying was incidental as he turned to ask them to stop recording him.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean chip manufacturers Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix saw significant gains after announcing a partnership with OpenAI for its Stargate initiative. SK Hynix stock surged over 9% to a 25-year high, while Samsung shares rose over 4%. The collaboration aims to increase the supply of advanced memory chips, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which are crucial for powering next-generation AI models and data centers. This move solidifies the chipmakers' central role in the AI supply chain, particularly as SK Hynix is a key supplier to Nvidia and Samsung works to certify its own HBM chips.

          <h2>Maxwell House Coffee Ad Campaign Taps into Housing Affordability Crisis</h2>

          <p>Maxwell House has launched a new marketing campaign that humorously acknowledges the ongoing housing affordability crisis by rebranding itself as “Maxwell Apartment Coffee.” The 133-year-old company's tongue-in-cheek ads ask, “Maxwell House? In this economy?” while promoting its coffee as an affordable luxury for a generation of renters. This campaign reflects the reality that the median age of first-time homebuyers in the U.S. has reached a record high of 38, with a historically low share of homes being affordable for typical households. The creative marketing aims to connect with a younger demographic facing significant economic pressures.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed against the band Nirvana by Spencer Elden, the man who appeared as a naked baby on the cover of the 1991 album "Nevermind." Judge Fernando Olguin ruled that no reasonable jury would consider the iconic image to be child pornography, comparing it to a "family photo of a nude child bathing." This is the second time the case has been thrown out, after an earlier dismissal on statute of limitations grounds was reversed by an appeals court. Elden had sued the surviving band members and others, alleging sexual exploitation and ongoing personal harm from the photograph.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has become the first person in history to achieve a net worth exceeding $500 billion, driven by the rising stock value of Tesla and increased valuations of his other companies, SpaceX and xAI. This milestone reinforces his position as the world's wealthiest individual, significantly ahead of competitors like Oracle's Larry Ellison. Musk's fortune is closely linked to his stake in Tesla, which has seen its share price climb over 20% this year amid investor confidence in his renewed focus on the company. The Tesla board has also proposed a potential pay package that could further increase his wealth if ambitious targets are met. (not investment advice)</p>

The talks involve plans for Chery to utilize Renault's existing factories in Colombia and Argentina to produce vehicles. Under the proposed arrangement, Chery would provide capital and product design, with most cars being rebadged as Renaults and a smaller portion sold under the Chery brand. The potential deal, which began under Renault's former CEO, would allow Chery to expand its presence in the region while leveraging Renault's established network.

The investigation has been handed over to L.A. city park rangers.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from cutting or diverting $34 million in anti-terrorism funding designated for New York's transportation system. The ruling came after New York sued the Department of Homeland Security, arguing the funds were being improperly withheld to punish the state for not cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan stated that New York is likely to prove its case, citing the city's history as a target for terrorism since the 9/11 attacks. The decision provides a temporary reprieve for the city's security programs, which officials warned would be compromised by the proposed cuts.</p>

          <p>A nutritional expert clarifies common myths about cooking oils, emphasizing that no single oil is perfect for all purposes. Contrary to some claims, common vegetable and sunflower oils are healthy choices for cooking, as they are low in saturated fats and high in essential polyunsaturated fats. Modern margarines are also a healthy option, as harmful trans fats have been largely eliminated from their production. For frying, the oil's smoke point is crucial; while extra virgin olive oil is best for dressings, basic olive oil can be used for shallow frying, and oils like sunflower or vegetable are better for high-temperature deep frying.</p>
