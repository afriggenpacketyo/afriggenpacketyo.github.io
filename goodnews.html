          <p>Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty triumphed over Journalism in the 157th Belmont Stakes, held at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park. The race mirrored the Kentucky Derby, with Sovereignty, Journalism, and Baeza finishing in the same order. Sovereignty's victory marks him as the first horse to win the Derby, skip the Preakness, and then win the Belmont, a feat not seen since Thunder Gulch in 1995. Jockey Junior Alvarado, despite a recent fine, guided Sovereignty to victory in the 1 1/4-mile race, which was shortened due to the venue change, making it the same length as the Derby.</p>

          <p>The Belmont Stakes hosted a rematch of the top three finishers from the Kentucky Derby, with Sovereignty ultimately winning over Journalism and Baeza. Sovereignty skipped the Preakness Stakes to focus on the Belmont, a decision that proved successful as the horse secured two of the three Triple Crown races. Journalism, who won the Preakness, was the only horse to run in all three legs of the Triple Crown this year, placing second in the Belmont. The Belmont was held at Saratoga Race Course, shortening the race to 1 1/4 miles instead of the usual 1 1/2 miles, while the event is expected to return to Belmont Park next year after renovations.</p>

These parents recognize that learning and empowerment can happen anywhere, not just in formal educational settings, and they foster a genuine love for knowledge through travel and other experiences. Ultimately, they motivate their children with love and support, rather than being overly critical or coaching.</p>

          <p>UK doctors are trialing "poo pills" containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors to combat dangerous superbug infections. The stool samples are packed with beneficial bacteria that can potentially flush out antibiotic-resistant superbugs from the gut. This approach aims to tackle infections that resist antibiotics, which cause millions of deaths annually. The trial showed promising signals that poo pills could help tackle superbugs, with donor bacteria competing with the superbugs and potentially eliminating them or reducing them to a manageable level.</p>
