          <p>The United States and China have confirmed the details of a new trade framework aimed at easing technology restrictions and permitting the export of rare earth materials. According to China's Ministry of Commerce, Beijing will review export applications while the U.S. will lift some restrictive measures. This agreement builds on the "Geneva consensus" and a recent high-level meeting in London, stabilizing a previously tense economic relationship. However, analysts advise caution, noting that specifics on which restrictions will be lifted remain limited. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has altered its proposed welfare reform bill after facing a significant rebellion from within the Labour Party. The initial plan aimed to save ¬£5 billion annually by tightening the criteria for Personal Independence Payment (Pip), a benefit for individuals with long-term health conditions. Following backlash from about 120 Labour MPs, the stricter rules will now only apply to new claimants. Starmer stated the revised package strikes "the right balance," though some MPs still intend to vote against the proposals.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes opened at record highs, driven by investor optimism over a potential U.S.-China trade deal and expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. This marks a significant turnaround from market lows in April, which were caused by concerns over tariff policies. Despite the rally, some analysts warn of complacency regarding trade deals and point to new data showing a slight increase in core inflation. The market's performance reflects a delicate balance between positive economic signs and potential future volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are divided on whether buying whole life insurance for children is a sound financial strategy for parents. Proponents argue it locks in low premiums and guarantees future insurability, which is beneficial if a child develops a medical condition later in life. However, critics point out that the statistical need for it is very low and the cash value component often yields poor returns compared to other investment vehicles. Alternatives like 529 college savings plans or brokerage accounts may offer better growth and flexibility for a child's financial future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed imposing international trade restrictions on all 19 species of eel under the CITES treaty, which regulates endangered species. The proposal, which would require export permits for eels, faces strong opposition from Japan, a major consumer. Japan argues its local eel populations are recovering and that such regulations could inadvertently increase poaching by driving up prices. The EU contends that eel populations have declined sharply and need protection, setting up a contentious vote at the upcoming CITES conference.</p>

At top rates between 4.00% and 4.15% APY, savers can expect to earn between $1,248 and $1,297 in guaranteed interest over the 36-month term. This article highlights the appeal of locking in these high rates, as they may not be available for much longer if the Federal Reserve proceeds with anticipated rate cuts.

The club's rationale is based on the discipline of taking profits after a successful turnaround, even as they remain positive about CEO Bob Iger's ongoing strategy.

          <p>A team of Chinese researchers has identified a "genetic switch" that could potentially allow mammals to regenerate damaged tissue, a capacity typically seen in animals like salamanders. The study, published in the journal *Science*, found that a mouse's inability to regenerate ear tissue was due to a failure to produce enough retinoic acid, a key compound derived from vitamin A. By reactivating a dormant gene responsible for this process, the scientists were able to trigger regeneration in the mouse. This discovery could have significant implications for advancing regenerative medicine in humans.</p>
