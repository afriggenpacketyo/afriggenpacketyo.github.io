          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court prolonged an injunction that temporarily prevents the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act. The court sent the case back to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to determine the time afforded to detainees to contest their removals. The majority stated that the government did not provide sufficient time or information for migrants to challenge their cases. The justices did not rule on the lawfulness of the removals under the Alien Enemies Act, but Justices Alito and Thomas dissented.</p>

          <p>Conservatives on the House Budget Committee blocked a megabill intended to advance President Trump's domestic agenda, citing concerns that the legislation would increase the deficit. The bill aimed to make Trump‚Äôs 2017 tax cuts permanent and eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. Conservatives are demanding deeper cuts to federal spending, including earlier implementation of work requirements for Medicaid recipients and the immediate elimination of clean energy tax credits.

          <p>A controversy arose after former F.B.I. Director James Comey posted an Instagram photo with shells spelling "86 47," leading to accusations from Trump administration officials that it was a call for the president's assassination. While the term "86" originated as diner slang for being out of something, it has evolved to mean eliminate or kill in some contexts. Lexicologists argue that without specific context, it's preposterous to assume Comey was suggesting violence. The incident highlights the slippery nature of slang and the ongoing tension between Trump and Comey.</p>

          <p>The fastest-growing city in the U.S. last year was Princeton, a Dallas suburb, with its population jumping by nearly a third. The number of residents in Princeton increased from about 28,000 to 37,000 from 2023 to 2024. The growth has come so quickly that the city has struggled to build roads and infrastructure fast enough as it transforms from a farming community.</p>
