          <p>In Wilmington, Los Angeles, 31 construction workers were successfully rescued after being trapped in a tunnel collapse at a sanitation project worksite. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed its Urban Search and Rescue teams for the complex operation. The workers, who were trapped miles from the tunnel's access point, managed to climb over a large pile of debris to safety. Fortunately, none of the rescued individuals sustained any visible injuries in the incident, marking a positive outcome to a dangerous situation.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the qualities to become a safe-haven currency, challenging the traditional dominance of the U.S. dollar. The argument is based on China's institutional credibility, low inflation, and large foreign reserves, which provide considerable advantages. The article suggests the yuan has already shown stability and resilience during recent global stress events, such as the war in Ukraine and shocks from U.S. tariffs. This perspective contributes to the ongoing debate about the internationalization of China's currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The market for weight-loss drugs in China is rapidly expanding, projected to be worth around $150 billion as numerous domestic producers compete for market share. This growth mirrors trends in the West, driven by the approval of new, more effective medications and rising obesity rates. Innovent Biologics became the first Chinese firm to receive approval to market such a drug in the country. The article explains the dynamics of this nascent but fast-growing pharmaceutical sector, fueled by both medical needs and lifestyle trends.</p>

          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a prime example of successful housing policy, with some calling it a "renters' utopia" due to its extensive social housing stock. This sector, comprising 43% of the city's housing units, serves not only low-income residents but also the middle class, keeping rent levels significantly below the private market. Originating in the 1920s, the system's stability and resistance to privatization offer valuable lessons for other cities grappling with housing crises. However, the article notes that challenges remain regarding the complexity and accessibility of the allocation system for newcomers.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology have created the world's lightest insect brain controller, a device weighing just 74 milligrams. When strapped to a bee's back, the controller uses three needles to send electronic pulses to its brain, effectively creating illusions that command its flight. In tests, the cyborg bees obeyed commands to turn, advance, and retreat with 90% accuracy. This technological breakthrough opens new possibilities for controlling insects for various applications, representing a significant advance in micro-robotics and bio-interfacing.</p>

          <p>In a landmark case, a North Korean defector named Choi Min-kyung is filing civil and criminal charges against leader Kim Jong Un and other officials for abuses she suffered. After being forcibly repatriated to North Korea in 2008, she endured sexual abuse and torture before escaping again in 2012. This is the first time a North Korean-born defector has taken direct legal action against the regime in a South Korean court. A human rights group assisting her hopes this step will serve as a cornerstone for restoring dignity and holding the Kim dynasty accountable.</p>

          <p>A large section of the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, which was illegally felled in September 2023, has been installed as a permanent memorial at a nearby visitor center in Northumberland. The act of vandalism sparked global outrage, and the new display is intended to provide a place for public reflection. The installation, created by artist Charlie Whinney, allows people to see and touch the trunk, which is surrounded by benches inscribed with public messages of sorrow and hope. This marks a positive step forward from a mindless act of destruction.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is implementing new measures to combat persistent youth unemployment by offering a one-off subsidy to companies that hire unemployed individuals aged 16 to 24. Employers who sign formal contracts and make social insurance contributions can receive up to 1,500 yuan per new hire. This policy is part of a broader effort to stabilize the labor market and support household incomes amid sluggish economic growth and intense domestic competition. The initiative will be funded through the country's unemployment insurance reserves and will last until the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Shares of WK Kellogg, the North American cereal maker, soared over 56% in extended trading following reports that it is in advanced takeover talks with Italian confectionery giant Ferrero. The deal, potentially worth around $3 billion, could be announced as soon as this week and would give the owner of Ferrero Rocher a dominant position in the U.S. breakfast cereal market. This potential acquisition comes as traditional convenience food companies face challenges from shifting consumer preferences towards healthier options and rising operational costs.

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to keep its policy interest rate unchanged at 2.5%, as it evaluates the effectiveness of recent measures aimed at cooling down Seoul's rapidly rising housing market. Housing prices in the capital spiked over 19% in June, prompting authorities to introduce new mortgage lending restrictions to curb expanding household debt. While the economy has shown signs of slowing, the central bank is prioritizing financial stability over growth concerns for now. Analysts expect rate cuts later in the year once the housing market measures take effect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A flock of 13 brown pelicans has been successfully released back into the wild after being treated for poisoning from a severe toxic algal bloom in Southern California. The bloom, the deadliest in the region in nearly a decade, sickened hundreds of seabirds and marine mammals with domoic acid. The recovered pelicans were cared for at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach. Their release, witnessed by community members, serves as a powerful and positive reminder of the importance of wildlife rehabilitation efforts in the face of environmental threats.</p>

In contrast, a ferocious and unexpected inundation in Texas killed at least 119 people, catching officials by surprise. The article analyzes how prior experience and awareness of weather risks can dramatically influence a community's response and resilience in the face of natural disasters.</p>

The Pentagon confirmed it is sending additional arms to ensure Ukraine can defend itself while the U.S. works toward a lasting peace.
