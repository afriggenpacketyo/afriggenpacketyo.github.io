          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking 39.1% surge in third-quarter profit, significantly surpassing market expectations. This growth is largely attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company's high-performance computing division, which includes AI applications, accounted for 57% of its revenue. In response to this strong performance and continued demand, TSMC has raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will cease purchasing oil from Russia, though no specific timeline was provided. The move is part of Washington's effort to isolate Moscow financially over its war in Ukraine and pressure China to take similar action. India's external affairs ministry responded by stating its import decisions are guided by consumer interests and energy security. India has been a major buyer of Russian crude, and this development marks a significant point of discussion in US-India relations.</p>

Vincent was particularly effective in the first quarter, where he scored 18 points, including five consecutive three-pointers. Despite his strong individual effort, the Lakers ultimately lost the game 121-94. The team was playing without several key starters, providing an opportunity for other players to showcase their skills ahead of the regular season.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old hillwalker from Edinburgh, Ian Currie, has shared his story of survival after being lost for eight days in a remote area of the Scottish Highlands. Attempting a strenuous 30-mile trek, he was overcome by severe weather, becoming lost with a soaked tent and a non-functional phone. Exhausted and suffering from exposure, he was eventually found by a local estate owner after a search had been initiated. The experienced walker described the ordeal as a "nightmare" but expressed immense gratitude for his rescue and survival.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the yuan's daily midpoint reference rate against the U.S. dollar to its highest level in a year. This move is largely seen as a response to growing market expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will implement further interest rate cuts. A stronger fixing by the central bank can influence currency trading and reflects Beijing's current stance on its economic relationship with the U.S. amid ongoing trade discussions and global financial shifts.

          <p>A new report from World Weather Attribution and Climate Central finds that the 2015 Paris Agreement has successfully steered the world away from the most catastrophic warming scenarios. Meeting current pledges could prevent an additional 57 deadly hot days per year compared to a world without the accord. However, the analysis warns that the world is still on track for at least 2.6°C of warming, which is dangerously above the 1.5°C target, emphasizing the urgent need for more ambitious emissions cuts to protect vulnerable populations and ecosystems.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a dinner for dozens of corporate leaders from companies like Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Google to raise funds for a new $200 million ballroom at the White House. The administration states the 90,000-square-foot addition to the East Wing will be financed entirely through private donations rather than taxpayer money. The project is one of several renovations Trump has initiated since returning to office, aiming to enhance the White House's capacity for hosting large official functions such as state dinners.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani took the unusual step of taking batting practice on the field during a workout day, signaling his urgency to break out of a significant postseason slump. Since the start of the playoffs, the two-way player is just two-for-25 with 12 strikeouts. While manager Dave Roberts has acknowledged Ohtani's struggles, Ohtani himself downplayed the idea that his return to pitching this season has directly caused his difficulties at the plate, stating he is focused on improving the quality of his at-bats.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from proceeding with the termination of more than 4,000 federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by two major unions representing federal employees. The judge cited President Trump's own statements suggesting the layoffs were politically motivated to target specific agencies, calling the firings during a shutdown "unprecedented" and likely contrary to law. A hearing for a more permanent injunction is scheduled for later this month.</p>
