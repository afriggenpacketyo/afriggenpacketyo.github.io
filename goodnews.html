          <p>President Trump announced he would replace interim U.S. attorney Ed Martin, a controversial pick for the District of Columbia, with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. Martin, a "Stop the Steal" activist, faced opposition in the Senate due to his views on the January 6th Capitol riot. Pirro, a staunch Trump supporter and former district attorney, has been chosen to fill the role on an interim basis. Trump expressed disappointment about Martin's lack of support, but stated that Pirro is incredibly well qualified for the position and is considered one of the top District Attorneys in the History of the State of New York.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. attorney for Washington after withdrawing the nomination of Ed Martin. Pirro, a former district attorney for Westchester County, New York, is a staunch supporter of Trump, who previously pardoned her ex-husband. Her appointment follows criticism of Martin's support for Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants, leading to his likely rejection by the Senate. Pirro's appointment provides Trump with a trusted ally in a crucial prosecutor's office within the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Federal judges ruled that Alabama intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents when it drew congressional lines, violating the Voting Rights Act. The state must continue using a court-ordered map that led to the election of the state's second Black congressman. The judges criticized Alabama's "deliberate decision to ignore" their order to draw a second district where Black voters had an opportunity to elect their preferred candidates. The ruling came after a February trial over the state map and the state is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>Chris Mason analyzes the new trade deal between the UK and America, noting that while ministers are projecting it positively, some critics accuse them of overclaiming. The deal primarily mitigates recent tariff increases rather than representing a deep free trade agreement. The agreement offers better trading conditions for some than were available a few days ago, but not necessarily better than six months ago. The deal doesn't dilute the UK's Digital Services Tax and doesn't involve questions about the NHS or food standards.</p>

          <p>The increasing attention on federal judges as individuals is a worrying trend, shifting the focus from a government of laws to one of personalities. The legal scholar Michael Luttig notes that the public typically doesn't know the names of lower federal court judges, but figures like James Boasberg have become well-known. While scrutiny of public officials is important, the focus on judges as personalities risks delegitimizing the court system and allowing for attacks on the judiciary.</p>
