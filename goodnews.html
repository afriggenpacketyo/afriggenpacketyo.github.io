          <p>Emma Raducanu revealed that her emotional reaction to winning her first-round match at Eastbourne was due to receiving "some really bad news" prior to the game, which affected her mental presence during the first set. Despite trailing against Ann Li, Raducanu managed to regain control and secure the victory with the support of her coach and Billie Jean King Cup team-mate Fran Jones, who knew about her situation. Raducanu expressed gratitude to the crowd for their support and acknowledged the tough, up-and-down nature of the match, before adding that she found another gear to push through. Raducanu is set to face Maya Joint in the next round as she continues her Wimbledon preparations.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson argues that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, asserting that it infringes on the president's powers under Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution. Johnson stated that President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear targets was within his constitutional authority. Johnson also addressed a pending resolution to bar U.S. military action in Iran, indicating it is unlikely to pass the House. The resolution, introduced by Representatives Massie and Khanna, is considered a "moot point" given the Iran-Israel ceasefire, according to Johnson.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beginner gold investors should consider several key decisions before July, including whether to wait for a price drop, how much to invest, and their portfolio needs. Gold is seen more as an income protector than an income producer, holding steady value during economic turmoil. With the potential for gold prices to surge, investors need a strategic approach, carefully monitoring the market for opportunities. Determining the appropriate investment amount, often around 10% of the portfolio, depends on individual goals and portfolio volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump managed the Iran-Israel conflict with a unique approach, using social media to provide real-time commentary that was at times bellicose and at times conciliatory. He announced the U.S. raid on Iranian nuclear sites, suggested regime change in Iran, and demanded lower oil prices via Truth Social. After a ceasefire was announced, Trump warned both countries to respect the agreement, and even after violations, he continued to push for peace. Experts predict challenges to any lasting ceasefire, citing Trump's impulsiveness, but also note a desire for de-escalation among Gulf states.</p>
