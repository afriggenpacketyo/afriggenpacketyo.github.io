          <p>The US Open has evolved from a traditional tennis tournament into a major cultural and commercial spectacle, mirroring festivals like Coachella. This transformation is characterized by high-priced luxury items, a heavy presence of celebrities and social media influencers, and a focus on creating a branded, aspirational experience. The event's economy now heavily relies on the attention generated by these elements, with organizers actively curating celebrity appearances to maximize social media engagement. This shift has created a festival-like atmosphere where being seen is as important as watching the sport.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers in the UK have the opportunity to witness a total lunar eclipse, which will cause the full Moon to take on a reddish hue known as a "Blood Moon." The spectacle occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. Visibility in the UK will begin at moonrise, with eastern parts of the country getting the best and longest view. Unlike a solar eclipse, this event is safe to view directly without special eye protection.</p>

          <p>Charles Robinson, the 24-year-old founder of the water filtration company Water2, has seen his business grow from a university research project to a brand expecting to be in 1% of UK homes by year's end. After dropping out of a philosophy degree, Robinson developed a self-installable water filter and found success through authentic social media marketing. The company gained a significant boost when adventurer Bear Grylls, initially a customer, became a co-owner and investor, helping to raise the brand's profile significantly.</p>

Now 66, Cassidy has spent the last few decades as a successful television writer and producer. He revealed that he had to take guitar lessons to relearn his own hit songs, such as his chart-topping cover "Da Doo Ron Ron," as he had not performed them in so long.

The win continues USC's strong start to the season, though the defense showed some vulnerabilities by allowing several big plays.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists from the US and China has developed an innovative method for launching millimeter-scale robots using the force generated by collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, is triggered by using a laser to rapidly heat a light-absorbing material, which boils surrounding water droplets. The subsequent collapse of the resulting vapor bubbles releases a powerful burst of energy capable of propelling the tiny jumpers high into the air. This technique offers a new mechanism for controlling movement in micro-robotics.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat classroom distractions, school districts across the United States are implementing a system using locked magnetic pouches to enforce cellphone bans. Students are required to place their phones inside a Yondr pouch, which they carry with them but can only be unlocked at designated magnetic stations at the beginning and end of the school day. The measure has been met with mixed reactions from students, with some welcoming the change while others attempt to circumvent the system. The pouches aim to create a culture change and improve student engagement.</p>
