          <p>Hummingbird feeders can be harmful or even deadly to hummingbirds if they are not cleaned regularly. Dirty feeders can harbor harmful microbes, leading to infections in the birds, such as candida, which causes tongue swelling and starvation. Wildlife rehabbers frequently rescue hummingbirds suffering from feeder-related infections. To maintain a healthy feeder, it is crucial to use the correct sugar-water recipe and clean the feeder every one to three days, depending on the weather. </p>

Japan's ruling parties agreed to include cash handouts for households hit by rising prices in their platforms for this summer's House of Councillors election. Toyota Motor Corp. and Daimler Truck Holding AG said they concluded an agreement to merge their Japanese truck subsidiaries under a new holding company, aiming to boost competitiveness and better respond to challenges posed by energy transition and technological innovation.
