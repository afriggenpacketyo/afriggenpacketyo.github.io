          <p>United Airlines has released a new full-year earnings forecast, with its CEO expressing confidence in a strong finish to 2025 due to stabilizing travel demand. While the airline's second-quarter revenue of $15.24 billion slightly missed expectations, its adjusted earnings per share beat analyst estimates. The company noted that domestic revenue per seat mile fell, reflecting weaker pricing power that has affected the industry. United now projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for 2025, narrowing its previous guidance which had accounted for a potential recessionary environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency markets rallied following a procedural vote in the U.S. House that revived the possibility of passing key crypto-related legislation this week. Bitcoin and ether saw significant gains, along with stocks of companies like Coinbase and Circle, after previously dipping when the bills were stalled. President Trump indicated that several Republican lawmakers had reversed their opposition, fueling investor optimism for the passage of the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act and the broader CLARITY Act. Analysts suggest that passing these bills would reduce market uncertainty and provide a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Morgan Stanley reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, largely due to a significant increase in trading revenues. The bank posted earnings of $2.13 per share on revenue of $16.79 billion, exceeding analysts' expectations. Net income rose 15% year-over-year to $3.54 billion, with the institutional securities division showing notable strength from higher client activity, especially in equity trading. The wealth management segment also performed well, contributing to what CEO Ted Pick described as another strong quarter demonstrating consistent performance across different market environments.

          <p>Shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies, a company focusing on an ether treasury strategy, surged after billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel disclosed a 9% stake through his firm, Founders Fund. The news prompted a rally in other crypto-related stocks, including SharpLink Gaming and Bit Digital, which have similar strategies. Bitmine, chaired by market strategist Tom Lee, aims to become a major holder of ether, similar to MicroStrategy's role with bitcoin. This interest is part of a broader momentum in the Ethereum ecosystem, driven by progress on stablecoin legislation and new tokenized asset offerings in Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's women's cricket team defeated England by four wickets in the first one-day international, successfully chasing a target of 259 with 10 balls remaining. All-rounder Deepti Sharma anchored the run chase with a crucial unbeaten 62, supported by Amanjot Kaur who saw the team to victory. For England, Sophia Dunkley's 83 and Alice Davidson-Richards' 53 helped recover the innings after a poor start, but their total proved insufficient. England's sloppy fielding and a failure to review a key decision against Sharma contributed to their defeat in the first match of the three-game series.</p>

          <p>Reality television personality Jax Taylor has announced he will not return for the third season of the Bravo series “The Valley.” Taylor stated his departure is necessary to focus on his sobriety, mental health, and coparenting his son, Cruz. The show's second season heavily featured the breakdown of his marriage to Brittany Cartwright and his struggles with addiction, including time spent in a mental health facility. Cartwright filed for divorce in August 2024, and Taylor has since agreed to give her full custody of their son, with his final appearance set for the upcoming reunion episodes.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ), located at the Peace Palace in The Hague, serves as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Composed of 15 judges from different nations, the court adjudicates legal disputes between states, distinct from the International Criminal Court which tries individuals. Its jurisdiction applies when states consent to it, either through a blanket declaration or on a case-by-case basis, or when a dispute falls under a specific UN convention like the Genocide Convention. While its rulings are legally binding, the ICJ lacks an enforcement mechanism, depending on the cooperation of the involved parties.</p>
