        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global companies are increasingly looking to India as a manufacturing alternative to China due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and supply chain vulnerabilities. Companies like Apple and Google are expanding their production in India, with Foxconn committing $1.5 billion to expand its iPhone facility and Google planning to assemble Pixel smartphones there. This shift is part of a broader realignment across sectors, including electric vehicles and aerospace, driven by geopolitics, economics, and strategy. While India faces challenges such as logistical bottlenecks and regulatory red tape, its large labor force and government incentives make it an appealing choice for companies looking to diversify.

          <p>President Trump initially rescinded Republican Senator Rand Paul's invitation to the annual White House congressional picnic due to Paul's opposition to the GOP-backed budget bill, but later reversed course. Paul criticized the White House's action as "incredibly petty," stating that he believed he was the only senator to be uninvited. Trump then announced on Truth Social that Paul and his family were welcome to attend, humorously noting it would give him more time to secure Paul's vote on the bill. This incident highlights the ongoing tensions between the White House and some Republican lawmakers over fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>Uranium mining is experiencing a resurgence in the United States due to increased demand for nuclear power, driven by power-hungry AI models and a global push for cleaner energy. The U.S. imports over 95% of its uranium, but the Biden administration has banned Russian uranium imports and unlocked $2.7 billion to expand domestic enrichment capacity. Despite this support, experts say the U.S. will continue to depend on other countries for uranium, as domestic reserves are limited.
