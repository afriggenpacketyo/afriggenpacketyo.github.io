          <p>The Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners has unanimously voted to ceremonially rename a four-mile stretch of Southern Boulevard as 'President Donald J. Trump Boulevard.' This roadway runs from Palm Beach International Airport to the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort. In a social media post, Trump expressed his gratitude for the 'wonderful honor.' The name change is ceremonial, meaning postal addresses and emergency response systems will not be altered, and the new signs are expected to be installed later this year.</p>

          <p>Writer and director Lena Dunham discusses her new Netflix series, 'Too Much,' which is loosely inspired by her own experiences moving to London. The show, starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, deconstructs the romanticized American fantasy of England by contrasting it with the city's reality. Produced by the company behind iconic British rom-coms like 'Notting Hill,' the series features an extensive list of celebrity cameos, including Stephen Fry, Emily Ratajkowski, and Jennifer Saunders, who Dunham credits as a major comedic inspiration.</p>

          <p>China has completed a massive 1,856-kilometer (1,153-mile) green belt aimed at controlling the expansion of three major deserts in Inner Mongolia: the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh. The project involved creating straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, followed by the planting of drought-resistant vegetation like sacsaoul trees. This large-scale ecological initiative is part of China's broader efforts to combat desertification and build a more robust environmental barrier against sandstorms, which frequently affect northern China.</p>

          <p>AI server maker Super Micro is planning to significantly ramp up its investment in Europe, including expanding its manufacturing capabilities in the region to meet surging demand for AI hardware. CEO Charles Liang stated that demand is growing rapidly and the company has a plan in place to build out its European operations beyond its current facilities in the Netherlands. This move aligns with a broader push for Europe to increase its computing capacity, as the global demand for AI servers, often powered by Nvidia chips, continues to grow.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' rookie phenom Jacob Misiorowski delivered a stunning performance, striking out 12 batters over six innings to lead his team to a 3-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Despite giving up a leadoff home run to Shohei Ohtani, the 23-year-old right-hander quickly settled in, baffling the Dodgers' lineup with a fastball that consistently topped 100 mph. The loss marked the fifth consecutive defeat for the Dodgers, who were unable to generate offense against the impressive rookie, with even veteran Clayton Kershaw praising Misiorowski's 'unbelievable' stuff.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that as the United States scales back its international development efforts under an 'America first' policy, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to step into the void. The recent dismantling of USAID as an independent agency is contrasted with China's launch of the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong. The author suggests that with the global center of gravity shifting east, Hong Kong's cosmopolitan status within China allows it to become a new hub for providing global public goods and fostering international cooperation, particularly with the Global South.</p>
