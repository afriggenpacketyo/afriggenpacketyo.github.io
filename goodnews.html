        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in childcare and household chores could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong found that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, threatening its economic stability. The study highlights traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare on women, clashing with rapid economic changes and further pushing China's overall fertility rate to an estimated 1.1 children per woman.</p>
