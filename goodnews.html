        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated a 6-3 Supreme Court decision that limits the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against his administration's policies. The ruling came in a case related to his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, though the justices did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself. Instead, the court's conservative majority focused on reining in the ability of a single federal judge to block a president's policy across the entire country, which Trump lauded as a "monumental win."</p>

          <p>This article posits that the Supreme Court's recent ruling on nationwide injunctions is more complex than a simple victory for the executive branch. While the decision in the birthright citizenship case restricts the use of such broad orders, it does not eliminate them entirely. The opinion suggests that injunctions may still be issued when necessary to provide "complete relief" to plaintiffs, potentially allowing for a nationwide block in this very case and setting a standard that could also benefit future administrations by limiting the power of single judges.</p>
