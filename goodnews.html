          <p>Two United Airlines aircraft were involved in a minor ground collision at San Francisco International Airport. The incident occurred when one plane, being pushed back from its gate, made contact with the tail of another parked United aircraft. Fortunately, no injuries were reported among passengers or crew on either plane involved in the low-speed impact. All affected passengers were subsequently re-accommodated on different flights to reach their final destinations, and the FAA has initiated an investigation into the cause of the collision.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is set to return to the UK High Street five years after closing its physical stores, through a new partnership with department store John Lewis. Starting in February 2026, Topshop and its menswear counterpart Topman will be available in select John Lewis locations nationwide. The brand, which was acquired by online retailer Asos after its parent company collapsed, is aiming for a major comeback. This move is seen as mutually beneficial, potentially attracting a new generation of shoppers to John Lewis while giving Topshop a significant physical retail presence once again.</p>

          <p>According to an analysis by Morgan Stanley, China's major property developers are expected to see a business recovery in the second half of the year after a difficult first half. The report predicts that the pace of decline in sales and profitability will slow, with a potential for sales to pick up in the fourth quarter. This optimistic outlook is based on developers' positive guidance for margin recovery and a large stock of available homes in higher-tier cities. The forecast suggests the sector may be starting to emerge from a slump that has persisted for nearly five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold climbed to a new record high, with the spot price exceeding $3,546 per ounce. The surge is attributed to investors seeking a safe-haven asset amid global economic uncertainty and the prospect of U.S. interest rate cuts. The rally also coincides with an announcement from the World Gold Council about its plans to launch a digital form of the precious metal. This initiative aims to revolutionize London's physical gold market by creating a standardized digital layer for trading and using bullion as collateral, potentially increasing its appeal to asset managers.

          <p>For the first time, minimum salaries are being introduced for players in the top two tiers of professional women's football in England, the Women's Super League (WSL) and WSL 2. The new requirement, described as a "full-time wage," is part of a broader effort by the league's new governing body, WSL Football, to professionalize the game. The salary thresholds will be based on factors like age, league, and experience, developed in consultation with the players' union. This move is seen as a crucial step in ensuring players can focus on football full-time, reflecting the rapid growth of the women's game.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to a prevalent narrative that women are happier without spouses or children, a new nationally representative survey indicates that married mothers are the happiest demographic among women aged 25 to 55. The study found 19% of married mothers described themselves as "very happy," compared to lower percentages for married women without children, unmarried mothers, and unmarried childless women. Researchers suggest that while motherhood presents challenges, it also provides a profound sense of meaning and purpose that contributes significantly to overall life satisfaction. Marriage was also linked to lower rates of loneliness and more frequent physical affection.</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests Fees on Plastic Bags May Be More Effective Than Outright Bans</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study examining plastic bag policies across the United States has found that imposing a fee or tax on plastic bags may be more effective at reducing overall litter than simply banning them. Researchers analyzed data from thousands of shoreline cleanups and found that while full bans did reduce the number of plastic bags, policies that included a fee led to a more significant decrease. The study suggests this is because bans can lead to consumers substituting plastic with other single-use items. The findings also indicated that these policies can lead to a notable reduction in animal entanglements.</p>

          <p>After decades of dangerous conditions and temporary fixes, the California Department of Transportation has proposed a permanent solution for Last Chance Grade, a treacherous three-mile section of Highway 101. The plan involves constructing a 6,000-foot tunnel, which would cost an estimated $2.1 billion, to bypass the coastal cliffs that are plagued by active landslides. This stretch of highway is a critical lifeline for the local economy and residents of Del Norte County, as its frequent closures create significant hardship. Officials are now seeking funding for the massive infrastructure project, which could begin by 2030.</p>
