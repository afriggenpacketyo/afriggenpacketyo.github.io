          <p>Cava, a Mediterranean restaurant chain, announced strong fiscal quarter sales, surpassing expectations with a 10.8% increase in same-store sales, driven by higher traffic and premium item purchases. This performance contrasts with other fast-casual chains like Chipotle and Sweetgreen, which have reported declines in transactions and same-store sales, indicating a shift in consumer dining habits. Cava's CFO noted that diners are trading up from fast food and down from casual dining, benefiting the chain. Despite the positive results, Cava maintained its conservative same-store sales forecast of a 6% to 8% increase for the fiscal year, causing its stock to dip slightly in extended trading.

        </div>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill to make the $2,000 child tax credit permanent and increase it to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028. However, the plan faces criticism for not addressing the needs of the 17 million children currently excluded from the credit and for requiring both parents to have Social Security numbers, potentially impacting 4.5 million children. The current child tax credit provides up to $2,000 per child under 17, with a portion being refundable for low-income families, and phases out for higher-income earners. Middle-income families are expected to benefit most from the proposed changes.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to undocumented migrants, focusing on whether a single district court judge can block a policy nationwide. The justices explored the history of universal injunctions and their practical implications, with concerns raised about potential chaos if citizenship laws vary by state. Some justices questioned the legality of Trump's order, with Justice Sotomayor arguing it violates multiple Supreme Court precedents, while others considered whether eliminating nationwide injunctions could delay resolution of unlawful executive actions.</p>

Rubio indicated that the administration would initially issue temporary waivers on some sanctions, allowing American dollars to flow into the country and enabling neighboring countries to fund reconstruction. The move is seen as a significant victory for Syria's new authorities, though Congress must also act to permanently repeal remaining sanctions.</p>
