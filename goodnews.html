        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PepsiCo reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely due to strong performance in its international markets. This growth helped to counterbalance a continued decline in sales volume within North America for both its food and beverage segments. The company is now focusing on cost-cutting measures and innovation to improve its domestic performance, particularly for brands like Frito-Lay and Quaker. PepsiCo reaffirmed its full-year financial outlook, anticipating stable earnings and modest organic revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines announced a fourth-quarter profit forecast that exceeded analyst expectations, attributing the positive outlook to rising airfares and sustained demand for luxury travel. The airline's third-quarter results also beat estimates, with revenue from premium cabins increasing by 9% while main cabin revenue saw a slight decline. CEO Ed Bastian noted that the company has not observed any negative impacts from a potential government shutdown and is well-positioned for continued growth. The strong performance suggests a recovery in travel demand and effective capacity management by the carrier. (not investment advice)</p>

The club stated the investment is intended to strengthen its financial position and provide resources to pursue long-term sporting success. This move is described as part of the Lewis family's ongoing commitment to the club's future, with sources indicating that more funding could be available as needed. The investment comes after a period of hierarchical changes at the club, including the departure of former chairman Daniel Levy.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen successfully overcame two no-confidence votes in the European Parliament. The challenges were initiated by the hard-right Patriots for Europe faction and the far-left alliance The Left, but neither came close to securing the two-thirds majority required for her removal. While her position is secure, the votes highlight the increasing fragmentation within the parliament and the difficulty her commission faces in building stable majorities to pass legislation. Von der Leyen received support from just over half of the 720-seat parliament in both votes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has initiated a review of what it calls "outdated" licensing laws, which could lead to extended opening hours for pubs and bars in England and Wales. The proposal aims to support the hospitality sector by cutting red tape, making it easier for venues to serve food outdoors and host live music. While industry groups have welcomed the potential for reduced costs and increased flexibility, critics warn that relaxing alcohol regulations could lead to a rise in antisocial behavior. The review is part of a broader government effort to boost local economies and support community hubs.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit initiated by plaintiffs including Mormon Women for Ethical Government (MWEG) has compelled Utah's legislature to redraw its four congressional districts. The non-partisan group argued that the previous map, drawn by the Republican supermajority, constituted an illegal partisan gerrymander by splitting Salt Lake County. The court-ordered redistricting comes as President Trump encourages Republican states to redraw maps to their advantage. MWEG, which includes members from across the political spectrum, states its actions are guided by faith and a principled commitment to a fair democratic process.</p>

          <p>Moisture from Hurricane Priscilla, currently moving up the coast of Mexico, is expected to bring rain and thunderstorms to Southern California from Thursday to Saturday. The National Weather Service predicts the region's mountains, foothills, and deserts are most likely to see significant rainfall, with some areas potentially receiving 1 to 2 inches. While the rainfall is not expected to be as severe as that from a recent tropical storm, the weather pattern will make conditions across the Southland cloudy and muggier. The most hazardous weather, including potential flash flooding, is forecast further east in Arizona, Utah, and Colorado.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of its release, a look back at No Doubt's diamond-certified album "Tragic Kingdom" reveals it was nearly never made. The Anaheim band faced numerous setbacks, including a lack of support from their original label, Interscope Records, which was unenthusiastic about their new material and considered dropping them. The album's creation was marked by strife, such as co-founder Eric Stefani quitting halfway through production due to creative differences. The record was ultimately saved when it was picked up by subsidiary Trauma Records, which championed "Just a Girl" as the lead single, launching the band into global stardom.</p>

          <p>"Family Meal," a new immersive theater production in Los Angeles, combines a six-course fine-dining menu with the chaotic drama of a dysfunctional restaurant family. The show casts the audience as guests at a retirement party for an acclaimed chef, which devolves into a "culinary pissing match" between his children who are vying for control of the restaurant. The experience, a collaboration between the Speakeasy Society and chef Ben Baron, aims to capture the high-energy, behind-the-scenes tension of kitchen culture popularized by shows like "The Bear." Guests are pulled into the narrative, interacting with characters and witnessing family secrets unfold between courses.</p>

          <p>The new film "If I Had Legs I'd Kick You," written and directed by Mary Bronstein, is reviewed as an intense and claustrophobic psychodrama. The movie centers on a mother in crisis, played by Rose Byrne in what is described as a "vivid, impassioned performance." The film uses extreme close-ups and oppressive sound design to immerse the audience in the protagonist's anxiety as she deals with a mysteriously ill daughter, a collapsed ceiling, and an absent husband. While the experience is purposefully exhausting and unpleasant, Byrne's portrayal of a woman on the verge of erasure is praised as magnificent and unforgettable.</p>
