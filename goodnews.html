          <h2>New Research Reveals How Dietary Fiber Protects Against Sugar Damage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 16:06:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking study from UC Irvine has revealed the intricate mechanism by which dietary fiber protects the body from the detrimental effects of sugar. Researchers discovered that inulin, a naturally occurring fiber found in vegetables like onions, garlic, and artichokes, actively reshapes gut bacteria in the small intestine. These modified microbes then efficiently metabolize fructose before it can reach the liver, effectively preventing fat buildup and related damage. Published in Nature Metabolism, these findings offer a new level of protection against metabolic harm and suggest potential strategies for reversing fatty liver disease. This article highlights a significant scientific breakthrough with promising implications for public health.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams secured a decisive 17-3 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, propelled by Matthew Stafford's touchdown pass and a strong rushing score from Kyren Williams. A potent Rams defense, notably led by Jared Verse and safety Quentin Lake, proved instrumental in stifling the Lamar Jackson-less Ravens' offense. Despite facing early challenges, including untimely penalties and a brief ankle injury scare for star receiver Puka Nacua, the Rams surged ahead with two quick touchdowns in the second half.
