          <h2>New Parenting Style Emphasizes Emotional Safety for Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting framework, "emotionally safe parenting," prioritizes attunement to a child's emotional needs and creating a secure environment for them to express their feelings. This approach focuses on building emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without dismissing them, respond without shaming, and view misbehavior as a signal for support. Key practices include doing inner work to understand personal triggers, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame by reconnecting after conflicts. By focusing on emotional attunement and inner healing, parents can create an environment where their child feels safe expressing their authentic self.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open after dealing with the recent repossession of his truck due to missed payments. Paul explained that he had changed banks and forgot to update the automatic payments for his Ford F-150, resulting in three missed payments and the repossession of his vehicle. He discovered the truck was gone when his trainer asked him to check security camera footage, revealing a tow truck taking it away. Paul was able to get the truck back and found humor in the situation, even posting footage of the repossession with a Celine Dion soundtrack.</p>

          <p>Julie Moore, an Army spouse, is remembered for her efforts to change military protocol for casualty notifications, ensuring families receive personal support rather than impersonal telegrams.

Her efforts transformed the Army's approach, providing comfort and assistance to grieving families. The legacy of Julie and her husband, Hal, is honored at Ft. Moore, formerly Ft. Benning, marking the first time an American military base has been named for a civilian. Service members now see the delivery of casualty notifications as a sacred mission.</p>
