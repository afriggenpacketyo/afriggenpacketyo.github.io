          <h2>New Analyses Cast Doubt on Claims of Life Signs on Exoplanet K2-18b</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three independent analyses have refuted earlier claims of potential life signs on the exoplanet K2-18b, located over 120 light-years from Earth. The initial claim suggested the presence of dimethyl sulfide, a molecule only produced by life on Earth, in the planet's atmosphere. However, the new analyses found no compelling evidence of this molecule, attributing the earlier findings to faint noise in the data. Astronomers are now focusing on gathering more data using the James Webb Space Telescope to gain clearer insights into exoplanet atmospheres.</p>

          <p>Tesla will launch its "robotaxis" on the streets of Austin, Texas, by the end of June, according to CEO Elon Musk. While this announcement may spark interest in investing in autonomous vehicles, financial experts advise a deliberate approach. Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner, suggests considering thematic exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to gain exposure to the technology, but also advises investors to examine what each fund holds before buying. Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi, advises to look under the hood and see if what the fund holds is right for you. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An international study led by the University of Edinburgh has presented evidence that the COVID-19 virus did not originate in Wuhan, China. The study analyzed 167 bat coronavirus genomes and traced the virus's origins to bat populations in northern Laos and southwest China's Yunnan province. These findings challenge the Trump administration's claim that a Chinese lab leak was the "real source" of the pandemic. The study shows that the original Sars-CoV-1 was circulating in western China just a year or two before Sars emerged in the southern province of Guangdong in late 2002.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that clownfish are shrinking in response to severe heat waves in the ocean. Scientists measured clownfish off the coast of Papua New Guinea and found that most of the fish got shorter during a heat wave in 2023. The researchers found that being small seems to help clownfish when it‚Äôs hot, and the fish that shrank had a much higher chance of surviving. This is a sign that the fish may be adapting to the rapidly changing ocean temperatures.</p>

The film serves as an argument for thinking differently about Deafness, and disability, in general.
