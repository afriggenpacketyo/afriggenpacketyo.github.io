          <p>China's efforts to strengthen ties with Niger's military government, which took power in 2023, are facing challenges despite Beijing's policy of non-interference. China provided a substantial financial lifeline to Niger in the form of an oil-backed loan. However, relations have been strained due to disputes over salary disparities and contract terminations affecting Chinese oil executives and companies, leading to the expulsion of some executives. Observers suggest that these disputes highlight the limits of China's non-interference policy, which, while intended to avoid entanglement in domestic affairs, can incur economic costs as some nations experience a rise in nationalism. The article also mentions that China's policy entails regime strengthening since Beijing tends to invest heavily in the economic priorities of the regimes or ruling parties in question. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan lags behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership roles. The report acknowledges that current efforts remain insufficient, referencing Japan's low ranking in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index. Despite setting a goal in 2003 to raise the share of women in leadership positions to about 30 percent by 2020, the target was delayed due to slow progress. The government plans to intensify efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring women have more opportunities to participate in decision-making across various fields. </p>

          <p>Driven by US tariffs, Chinese exports to Southeast Asian industrial centers have increased significantly in the first five months of the year. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have risen by double-digit percentages, satisfying growing consumer markets and feeding offshore factory investments. Analysts suggest that Chinese manufacturers are increasingly shipping goods to Southeast Asia to circumvent US tariffs and re-export finished products. This trend indicates a diversification of exports and a growing economic relationship between China and Southeast Asian countries. </p>

The move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, down from approximately 910,000 tons before the government began releasing stocks in March and April.

          <p>The United Nations Population Fund reports an 'unprecedented decline' in world fertility rates, warning that many people are unable to have the number of children they desire. The prohibitive cost of parenthood and the lack of a suitable partner are cited as primary reasons. A UNFPA survey of 14,000 people in 14 countries revealed that one in five have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. Financial limitations, lack of time, and infertility were identified as significant barriers to having children. </p>

          <p>Drug deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a massive reduction in fatal overdose risk among Gen Z. Ages 20 to 29 lowered the risk by 47%, cutting it right in half, with the latest available records showing fentanyl and other drugs killed more than 31,000 people under the age of 35 in 2021, but by last year, that number had plummeted to roughly 16,690 fatal overdoses. Researchers attribute this shift to factors including wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl being sold, and less risky drug use among teens and young adults. Despite this positive trend, experts caution that sustaining progress may be difficult, and there is uncertainty surrounding potential funding cuts for addiction services. </p>
