          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 15:00:11 EDT</div>

          <p>The executive director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies (Merics), a prominent German think tank, recently completed a visit to Beijing after being sanctioned by China four years ago. Mikko Huotari's trip, made at the invitation of a Chinese think tank, suggests a possible easing of travel restrictions imposed on the organization. European leaders have consistently urged Beijing to lift these sanctions, which have prevented Merics researchers from traveling to China. The visit is being viewed as a positive step toward re-establishing engagement and dialogue between European and Chinese researchers and policy experts.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 15:00:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at MIT have created a groundbreaking bionic knee system that anchors directly to an amputee's femur, offering more natural and intuitive movement. The technology, called e-OPRA, integrates with reconnected muscle pairs, allowing the robotic limb to respond to the user's intended movements in real-time. This direct bone and muscle connection bypasses the discomfort and instability of traditional socket-based prosthetics. Trial participants demonstrated improved mobility, such as climbing stairs and kicking a ball with ease, and reported feeling that the prosthesis was a true part of their body, enhancing their sense of control and wholeness.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of finalizing a £63.5 million deal to acquire striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting. Negotiations over the transfer's finer points, particularly add-on payments, have slightly delayed the announcement. The 27-year-old Swedish international has already agreed to personal terms and a five-year contract with the London-based club. Gyokeres has been a prolific goal-scorer in Portugal, and his signing is seen as a key move by manager Mikel Arteta to bolster Arsenal's attacking options for the upcoming season after a drawn-out search for an elite center-forward.</p>

          <p>While interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs) have declined from their peak a year ago, they still offer significant returns for savers seeking a predictable investment. A comparison shows that a $20,000 CD opened in 2024 with higher rates would have earned considerably more than one opened today, with the difference amounting to over $1,000 for a 3-year term. However, current rates remain exponentially higher than those from the early 2020s, making CDs an attractive option for risk-averse savers. The article suggests that with potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, now may be an opportune time to lock in these still-favorable fixed rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The report found that 27% of workers have a second income stream, down from 36% in 2024, a shift attributed to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation. This suggests that fewer people feel the need to supplement their primary income to cover basic living expenses.
