          <p>The Dalai Lama has officially announced that the 600-year-old institution will continue after his death, ending speculation about its future. In a video message, he stated that his office will follow tradition to find and recognize his reincarnation, explicitly warning that no outside authority, particularly China, has the right to interfere in the process. This declaration comes as he celebrates his 90th birthday and is seen as a direct message to Beijing, which is expected to name its own successor. The Tibetan community-in-exile supports the continuation, viewing the institution as a vital symbol of their identity and struggle.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that Alabama prosecutors violated the constitutional rights of Michael Sockwell, a Black man sentenced to death in 1990, by systematically excluding Black individuals from his jury. The 2-1 decision noted a pattern of discriminatory intent, as prosecutors rejected 80% of eligible Black jurors. Sockwell, convicted of killing a former sheriff, is now eligible for a retrial. His case also involves a judge overriding a jury's 7-5 recommendation for a life sentence, a practice Alabama no longer permits, and claims of a coerced confession.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a decisive 6-1 victory against the Chicago White Sox, propelled by a strong performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto and an early offensive surge. Yamamoto pitched seven innings, allowing only one run and striking out eight, lowering his ERA to 2.51. The Dodgers' offense ignited in the first inning with a four-run rally, and the scoring was later bolstered by Andy Pages' two run-scoring hits and a solo home run from Shohei Ohtani, his 30th of the season. The game highlighted the significant performance gap between the top-tier Dodgers and the struggling White Sox.</p>

The fierce competition, which has drawn criticism from the Chinese government for being non-productive, is also pressuring international players like Tesla.

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly considering a significant strategic change for the company's contract manufacturing business. The potential shift would involve de-emphasizing the marketing of its "18A" chipmaking process to external customers, a technology that was a cornerstone of the previous CEO's plan. Instead, resources would be focused on the next-generation "14A" process, where Intel believes it can better compete with rival TSMC. This move, aimed at attracting major clients like Apple and Nvidia, reflects an effort to revive the struggling chipmaker but could result in a substantial financial write-off.</p>

The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. 3M, the company that developed and manufactured the chemicals, has agreed to an $850 million settlement for cleanup and will stop producing PFAS by year's end.</p>
