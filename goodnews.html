          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has formally endorsed Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, praising his commitment to making the city affordable and safe despite past policy disagreements. In an opinion piece, Hochul highlighted Mamdani's shared dedication to confronting President Trump's "extreme agenda" and unifying the Democratic party. This endorsement from a moderate governor is particularly significant for Mamdani, a democratic socialist, who has recently distanced himself from some past positions, including apologizing for calling the NYPD "racist." Other prominent New York Democrats, however, have yet to endorse a candidate in the competitive race.</p>
