          <h2>England to Implement Nationwide Network of Family Support Hubs</h2>

          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million plan to establish "Best Start" family hubs in every local authority in England by April 2026. These hubs aim to provide a wide range of services, from parenting support and midwifery to debt advice and youth clubs, supporting an additional 500,000 children in disadvantaged areas. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson described the initiative as a "lifeline" for families, though the Conservative opposition has questioned the novelty of the plan, suggesting it rebrands existing services. Charities like Save The Children have welcomed the move, highlighting the effectiveness of integrated support services.</p>

          <p>After nearly two decades, the cold case of Jennifer Kesse, who vanished from her Orlando condo in 2006, is now considered active again by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). This development comes after new DNA evidence was obtained and persons of interest were narrowed down, partly due to the efforts of Kesse's father, Drew Kesse. The family had previously sued the city for case files and assembled their own team of investigators. The renewed focus offers a glimmer of hope for a breakthrough in the long-stalled investigation into the 24-year-old's disappearance.</p>

          <p>Whitewater rafting enthusiasts and local businesses on California's Kern River are protesting Southern California Edison's hydropower operations, which they argue divert too much water and ruin recreational opportunities. Activists recently staged a 16-mile portage, carrying a raft on foot beside a dewatered section of the river to raise awareness. They are demanding that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission impose new flow requirements as part of the renewal process for the power plant's license. Edison maintains it is balancing clean energy generation with community interests, but boaters argue that increased river flows would boost the local economy and preserve a vital natural resource.</p>

          <p>The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Hollywood share a surprisingly deep and reciprocal relationship, with each industry drawing talent and inspiration from the other. The agency actively recruits individuals with creative skills, from makeup artists to storytellers, and collaborates with filmmakers to shape its public image and inspire new recruits. Historically, this partnership has had operational applications, such as the "Argo" mission, which utilized a fake film production cover to rescue diplomats from Iran. This ongoing exchange highlights how spycraft and stagecraft have become intertwined, with creative problem-solving being highly valued in modern intelligence work.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China have created a new data sorting system that is significantly faster and more energy-efficient, potentially overcoming a major bottleneck in AI and high-performance computing. The system utilizes memristors, an electronic component with memory capabilities, to perform "sort-in-memory" operations. This approach avoids the data transfer limitations of traditional Von Neumann architecture, where processing and memory are separate. The team's prototype has successfully demonstrated its efficiency in tasks like route finding and neural network inference, marking a notable advancement in hardware design.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy has shown remarkable success in reversing a form of congenital deafness, with a single injection improving hearing in participants within weeks. The clinical trial, detailed in *Nature Medicine*, focused on individuals with hearing loss caused by a mutation in the OTOF gene. The therapy delivers a functional copy of the gene to the inner ear, restoring the transmission of sound signals to the brain. All 10 participants, including children and adults, showed significant hearing improvement, with one seven-year-old girl regaining nearly full hearing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have discovered that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping "brain criticality," the crucial balance between excitement and inhibition in neural activity. This balance is strongly linked to the brain's information processing capabilities and overall cognitive function. The study, published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, establishes brain criticality as a biological phenotype with a genetic foundation. This finding opens new avenues for understanding brain function and the potential genetic roots of neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>
