          <p>Octopus Energy has apologized to Peter Holden, a 67-year-old man from Hartlebury, Worcestershire, for relentlessly pursuing him for nearly four years over someone else's gas bill exceeding ¬£6,000. Despite Holden repeatedly informing the firm of the error, he continued to receive monthly energy bills and was chased by debt collectors. The issue stemmed from an industry data error that assigned the same serial number to Holden's meter and another unconnected account. Octopus Energy's commercial director personally apologized to Holden and committed to providing additional staff training to prevent similar mistakes in the future, assuring him that his credit score was unaffected.</p>

          <p>Japan has commenced sales of government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to reduce soaring prices to approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This action follows criticism of the government's prior ineffectiveness in curbing escalating rice prices, which have been outpacing wage growth. The government intends to release around 300,000 tons of rice via contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi emphasized the urgency and speed required to alleviate public concerns, establishing a special response team to address the high rice price issues.

          <p>Businesses are utilizing a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule" to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions. By using the initial sales price from the factory to the vendor, importers can strip out the cost associated with the middleman's profit, leading to potential cost savings. While the first sale rule has been around since 1988, it has gained renewed attention amid recent tariff regimes.</p>

The research, published in Cell Metabolism, explains how hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain.
