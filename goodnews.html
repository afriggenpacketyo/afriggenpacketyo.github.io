          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has defended the controversial original cover art for her album "Man's Best Friend," telling critics they "need to get out more." The image, which shows her kneeling while a man pulls her hair, sparked backlash for allegedly objectifying women. Carpenter explained that the artwork represents being "in on your lack of control" and that her fans understand its intended meaning. This follows previous criticism of her more mature and sexualized performances, which she views as a natural part of her artistic evolution. In response to the controversy, she released an alternative, "approved by God" album cover.</p>

Despite a strong earnings report, Nvidia's stock fell, dragging the broader market down due to its significant market capitalization. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the PCE price index, showed core inflation at 2.9%, matching estimates but remaining above the Fed's target. Despite this, markets still anticipate an interest rate cut at the upcoming September meeting, following recent comments from Chairman Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta has announced temporary changes to its AI chatbot policies for teenagers in response to a Senate probe and concerns about inappropriate conversations. The company is training its AI to avoid generating responses on sensitive topics like self-harm and to prevent potentially romantic interactions, instead directing teens to expert resources. The move follows a Reuters report that internal documents permitted chatbots to have "romantic" conversations with minors, and a Common Sense Media assessment that deemed Meta AI unsafe for anyone under 18. These "interim changes" are part of a broader effort to strengthen safety protections for young users.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the next round of COVID-19 vaccines but has changed its guidance on eligibility. Previously available to nearly everyone six months and older, the updated shots are now limited to individuals at higher risk for serious complications from the virus. This includes people aged 65 and older and those with other underlying health problems that make them more vulnerable. This policy shift marks a significant change from the broad accessibility that characterized earlier phases of the vaccine rollout, raising new questions for the public about access and protection.</p>

          <p>The political landscape for the 2026 Senate midterm elections is starting to take shape, with Democrats facing a challenging map in their effort to gain a majority. Republicans are defending 24 seats compared to the Democrats' 13, but many GOP incumbents are in states that President Trump won comfortably in 2024. Key battlegrounds are emerging in states like North Carolina, Georgia, and Michigan, where retirements and competitive primaries are creating potential openings. Democrats will need to defend their seats in competitive states while flipping four Republican-held seats to secure control of the chamber.</p>

          <p>Shares of the buy now, pay later company Affirm surged 10% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that significantly surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company posted earnings of 20 cents per share on revenue of $876 million, a 33% increase from the previous year, and shifted from a net loss to a net income of $69.2 million. CEO Max Levchin attributed the strong performance to increased consumer transaction frequency and growth in both merchant partnerships and customer numbers. The positive results and upbeat guidance for the upcoming fiscal year helped alleviate concerns about increased competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly accepted a bid from Spanish club Real Betis for Brazilian winger Antony, who is now expected to travel to Spain for a medical examination. The 25-year-old had a successful loan spell with Betis last season, helping the team secure a European competition spot. Antony was one of several players training separately from the main squad, indicating he was not in the club's future plans. The permanent move marks the end of a disappointing tenure at Manchester United for the player, who was the club's second-most expensive signing ever at £81.3 million.</p>

The ring was discovered this summer by David Orlowski, an electrician using a metal detector at Cedar Beach. After finding the palladium ring, which was engraved with Al DiStefano's name and graduation year of 1969, Orlowski decided to find its owner rather than sell it. Through an online search and a class Facebook page, he was able to connect with DiStefano and mail the long-lost keepsake back to him.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have uncovered new fossils of Spicomellus, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, revealing it was a "punk rocker" of a dinosaur with long bony spikes fused directly onto its ribs. This feature, never before seen in any other vertebrate, makes it one of the strangest dinosaurs ever found. The 165-million-year-old herbivore, discovered in Morocco, also had a bony collar and a tail weapon. The discovery challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs, as this early species possessed far more bizarre and elaborate armor than its later, more well-known relatives like Ankylosaurus.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, has won a decisive reelection victory four years after he says White officials locked him out of town hall and refused to let him serve. The election, the town's first in decades, was held under a federal settlement following a lawsuit by Black residents who challenged the town's "hand-me-down" system of governance. In 2020, Braxton ran unopposed but was prevented from taking office. His victory this week, with 66 votes to his opponent's 26, is being hailed as a major step in restoring democratic representation in the majority-Black town.</p>

His current "Bigger & Weirder" tour features elaborate costume changes, video screens, and an expanded band, allowing him to perform his classic parodies like "Eat It" and "Amish Paradise" with a bigger, more layered sound.</p>
