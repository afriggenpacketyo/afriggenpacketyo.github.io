        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli of California has initiated "Operation Guardian Angel," a task force comprising ICE, HSI, DEA, FBI, ATF, and Border Patrol agents, to identify and charge arrested undocumented immigrants with felony illegal re-entry. This program aims to counteract sanctuary policies that hinder ICE's ability to detain and deport criminal undocumented immigrants. Essayli intends to issue up to 50 warrants a week in his jurisdiction, which includes Los Angeles, making California a "testing ground" for other sanctuary jurisdictions. He emphasized that local authorities must comply with federal warrants, and felony re-entry prosecution, which was largely not pursued during the Biden administration, is now a priority. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that Russia and Ukraine will "immediately start negotiations toward a ceasefire" following a two-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump characterized the call as "excellent" and suggested a possible trade deal with Russia if it ends the war in Ukraine. He also indicated that Ukraine could be "a great beneficiary on trade." Vice President JD Vance reportedly spoke with Trump prior to the call, emphasizing the potential economic benefits for Russia in thawing relations with the world. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful and represented a "gross usurpation of power." The judge found that the administration's takeover, which involved DOGE officials assisted by law enforcement, violated the statute establishing USIP and exceeded presidential authorities. The ruling declares the removal of USIP's president, replacement by DOGE officials, termination of staff, and transfer of property to the General Services Administration as null and void. The administration is likely to appeal the ruling. </p>

          <p>Greggs is trialing a new policy of moving self-serve food and drinks behind the counter in select stores to reduce shoplifting. The measure is being tested in areas with high levels of antisocial behavior, including Whitechapel, Peckham, and Ilford. This decision comes as shoplifting offenses recorded by the police rose by 20% in 2024. While the change is not expected to be implemented across all 2,600 Greggs bakeries, it may be rolled out to sites with high levels of theft, and the company emphasizes that the safety of colleagues and customers is a top priority. </p>

          <p>North Carolina Governor Josh Stein has urged state lawmakers to allocate an additional $891 million for western North Carolina's recovery from Hurricane Helene, rather than relying on uncertain federal assistance. The funds would address critical needs such as revitalizing local economies, repairing infrastructure, and providing housing assistance. This request comes as the General Assembly prepares to finalize its state budget this summer. The state Senate has already approved its budget proposal, and the House is expected to release its plan this week. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that the islands of Mbanie, Conga, and Cocoteros off the coast of Gabon legally belong to Equatorial Guinea, settling a decades-long dispute. The islands, located in potentially oil and gas-rich waters, have been controlled by Gabon since 1972. The ICJ rejected Gabon's claim based on a 1974 treaty, instead ordering Gabon to acknowledge a treaty signed in Paris in 1900 that handed the islands to Spain, with sovereignty passing to Equatorial Guinea upon its independence. Gabonese troops will have to leave their base on Mbanie. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is phasing out its E-3 AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) aircraft, which have been in use since the 1970s, due to their aging Boeing 707 airframes and increasing maintenance costs. Fourteen AWACS have been sent to the Boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, with only 16 remaining in service. The AWACS, known for its large rotating radar dish, coordinates air battles and detects enemy aircraft and missiles. The Air Force plans to replace them with Boeing E-7s, which are based on the 737 airframe and use a more advanced multirole electronically scanned array. </p>
