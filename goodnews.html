          <p>Leaders from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), including India's Narendra Modi and Russia's Vladimir Putin, have gathered in China for a major summit hosted by President Xi Jinping. The meeting occurs amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly between the member states and the United States over trade and security issues. The discussions aim to strengthen regional cooperation and present the 10-member bloc, which includes China, Russia, and India, as a significant alternative to Western-led international forums. This summit marks Modi's first visit to China in seven years, signaling a potential reset in relations.</p>

          <p>Manchester United clinched a dramatic 3-2 win against Burnley thanks to a stoppage-time penalty, providing a moment of relief for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the victory was overshadowed by persistent goalkeeping errors that have plagued the team early in the season. Following mistakes in previous matches, goalkeeper Altay Bayindir made another critical error that led to a Burnley goal. Amorim acknowledged the pressure on his goalkeepers and the entire squad, stating that everyone at the club needs to improve as they struggle with consistency.</p>

          <p>In an innovative experiment, biologists are using drones to protect cattle from gray wolves by blasting loud sounds like AC/DC music and Scarlett Johansson movie clips. This non-lethal hazing technique is being tested near the California-Oregon border to interrupt wolf hunts and reduce conflicts with ranchers as wolf populations recover. The method relies on the predators' fear of novel and loud human sounds, and preliminary results have shown success in scaring the wolves away. While the technology is currently expensive, it represents a creative approach to promoting human-wildlife coexistence.</p>

          <p>With both India and China facing the economic strain of high U.S. tariffs, the leaders of the two nations are using the SCO summit as an opportunity to reset their challenging relationship. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China, his first in seven years, signals a potential shift towards greater economic cooperation to counteract pressure from Washington. Historically, the India-China relationship has been defined by border disputes and mutual mistrust, but shared economic challenges may be fostering a pragmatic, if uncomfortable, alliance that could reshape global trade flows.</p>

          <p>Recent polling in Taiwan shows the main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), has seen its favorability rating rise to 36.3 percent, surpassing that of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). This shift comes as discontent with the DPP has increased significantly. Despite the apparent political opportunity, the KMT is reportedly experiencing internal anxiety over its future leadership, as current chairman Eric Chu is set to step down in October. The succession question is creating uncertainty within the party as it seeks to capitalize on its improved standing.</p>

          <h2>Non-Alcoholic Beer Surges in Popularity in Germany as Overall Lager Sales Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 20:59:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall beer consumption in Germany has fallen to its lowest level in over 30 years, sales of non-alcoholic beer have more than doubled since 2013. This trend reflects a shift in consumer habits, with many younger Germans becoming more health-conscious. German breweries are adapting to this change by marketing alcohol-free varieties as healthy lifestyle products and alternatives to energy drinks at sporting events. Despite the surge in popularity of non-alcoholic options, traditional full-strength beer remains a deeply ingrained part of German culture.</p>
