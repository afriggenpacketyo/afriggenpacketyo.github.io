          <h2>Labour Renationalizes South Western Railway, Marking a Milestone</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 06:41:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under Labour, with the inaugural nationalized service departing from Woking to Surbiton. While the government hails this as a "new dawn for rail," they stopped short of promising fare reductions, instead emphasizing service improvements and infrastructure investment. Unions have voiced concerns regarding the potential outsourcing of security and cleaning staff, and the Conservatives are urging Labour to fulfill its promises. SWR's operations will now be managed by the Department for Transport (DfT) Operator and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval. </p>

          <p>This article addresses questions about inherited Roth IRAs, the impact of the SECURE Act, and strategies for those behind on retirement savings. It clarifies that spouses inheriting an IRA from an original owner can treat it as their own, but this may not apply to "doubly inherited" IRAs. The article also suggests delaying Social Security, finding an employer with a 401(k), and consulting a financial planner for personalized retirement advice. It cautions against reverse mortgages in certain situations and recommends home equity loans or lines of credit as potential alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens expect rice prices to decrease under the leadership of the new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, following the dismissal of his predecessor due to controversial remarks about gifted rice. While 44.7% believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, a target lower than pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, 45% find Ishiba's rollback target appropriate. The survey also indicates that 42.2% think the removal of the former farm minister, Taku Eto, should have occurred sooner. The approval rating for Ishiba's Cabinet has slightly increased, but the disapproval rating remains high. (not investment advice)</p>
