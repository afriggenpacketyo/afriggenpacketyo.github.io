          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, marking the first train company to return to public ownership under the Labour government's plan to integrate it into Great British Railways (GBR). The government is focusing on improving services and reinvesting profits into infrastructure, while unions are concerned about outsourcing. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander assured passengers they would get "great value for money" but did not promise lower fares. The nationalization is considered a "watershed moment" as SWR becomes the responsibility of the Department for Transport Operator and will be integrated into GBR, which will officially exist after a parliamentary vote in the autumn.</p>

          <p>A bear sighting on a golf course in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan, led to the cancellation of the final round of the Twinfields Ladies tournament on the women's second-tier Step Up Tour due to safety concerns.

          <p>Rachel Feintzeig discusses her obsession with zombie fiction, particularly the HBO series "The Last of Us," as a means of escaping real-world anxieties. She finds that contemplating a fictional apocalypse provides a distraction from current societal issues, offering a temporary reprieve from the stresses of everyday life. Feintzeig recalls how horror movies helped her cope with a miscarriage, providing a sense of perspective by focusing on someone else's problems. She acknowledges the escapism, admitting that while others work to address real-world issues, she chooses to immerse herself in the zombie genre.</p>

Surveys reveal that a significant percentage of young people feel worse after spending time on social media and desire restrictions on app access.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani is expected to return to the mound after the All-Star break, according to manager Dave Roberts. Ohtani is scheduled to face batters for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery in September 2023, but Roberts indicated that the natural progression of building a starter up to five or six innings makes a pre-All-Star return unlikely. Ohtani has been throwing all his pitches in practice, including a slider, and the Dodgers prioritized his hitting during spring training while slowing down his pitching rehab.</p>

Researchers found that owners with higher job stress and rumination habits had dogs exhibiting more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. The study highlights the phenomenon of "crossover," where stress spills over from one person to others in the home, including pets. Dogs are particularly sensitive to their owners‚Äô moods, and changes in care routines due to work stress can also contribute to their anxiety.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is increasing the annual salaries of chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions to over 6 million yen, up from the current average of 4 to 4.5 million yen, to attract and retain talent. The new scheme, starting in January, aims to improve working conditions amidst growing competition for skilled chefs due to the increasing popularity of Japanese cuisine worldwide. Additionally, chefs will have the option for government-covered rented accommodation and funds to bring their spouses to their work locations, enhancing their career paths and promoting Japanese food proactively.</p>
