          <p>Sunday's newspaper headlines focus on the government's new immigration plans, with the Daily Mail reporting that migrants committing crimes will be deported and the Sunday Express highlighting efforts to prevent migrants' lawyers from abusing the system. Other headlines include Danny Dyer's revelations about his prescription drug use during his time on EastEnders, speculation about the cast of the next series of Strictly Come Dancing, and a story about a retired policeman cautioned for a 'thought crime'.

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, was released from federal custody after a judge raised concerns that her detention could chill free speech. Ozturk, whose student visa was canceled amid a crackdown on international students, had written an opinion piece critical of the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands. Judge William K. Sessions III stated that the government had not presented sufficient evidence to support its accusations that Ozturk was engaged ‚Äúin activities in support of Hamas,‚Äù beyond the co-authored opinion essay. Supporters celebrated her release, emphasizing her character and scholarly achievements.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. and China made "great progress" in trade talks held in Switzerland, suggesting a "total reset" was negotiated. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng met for over 10 hours to discuss tariffs that have destabilized global markets. While initial discussions focused on de-escalation, not a comprehensive trade deal, Trump indicated a willingness to lower tariffs on China. The talks aim to scale back tariffs that have disrupted trade and increased the U.S. trade deficit with China, but analysts remain skeptical about the possibility of substantial results from the Geneva meeting.</p>

          <p>Nearly 50 years after the murder of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, police have charged Willie Eugene Sims, 69, with her death. Ralston was found strangled in her car in 1977, and the case went cold after initial investigations failed to produce credible leads. The break came when the F.B.I. upgraded its fingerprint search algorithm, leading to a match with Sims' thumbprint found on a cigarette carton at the crime scene. Investigators also matched Sims' DNA to evidence found on Ralston's fingernails and the clothing used in the sexual assault.</p>

          <p>As negotiations ramp up for President Donald Trump's tax agenda, there are key issues to watch, according to policy experts. The House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees taxes, released a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill on Friday evening. However, the bill could change significantly before the final vote. The full committee will debate and advance this legislation on Tuesday. With control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, Republican lawmakers can pass Trump's package without Democratic support via a process known as "reconciliation," which bypasses the Senate filibuster with a simple majority vote.</p>
