          <p>Brazil's Prosecutor-General has formally requested the Supreme Federal Court to find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting to orchestrate a coup following his 2022 election loss. The 517-page filing accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an "armed criminal association" to violently overthrow the democratic order. This follows the January 8, 2023, storming of government buildings by his supporters, which occurred after Bolsonaro spread unfounded voter fraud claims. If convicted, the former president could face up to 40 years in prison for the charges.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the "Genius Act," bipartisan legislation that aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Proponents argue that regulation would provide consumer protection and enable stablecoins to be used for faster, lower-cost payments, essentially creating "digital dollars." The bill is part of a broader Republican-led effort to support the cryptocurrency industry. If passed, it would allow banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins under clear legal guidelines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved a $14 million settlement for Alexander Torres, who was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent over two decades in prison. Torres was found factually innocent in 2022 after a review initiated by the California Innocence Project and the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit. His original conviction was based on shaky witness testimony, and investigators ignored his alibi and evidence that would have made the crime unlikely. The settlement resolves his federal lawsuit, which alleged that sheriff's detectives failed to disclose exculpatory evidence.</p>

          <h2>Independent Review Recommends Renaming Physician Associates to "Assistants" to Avoid Patient Confusion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:02:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their job titles changed to "assistants." The recommendation aims to reduce patient confusion and clarify the distinction between these roles and fully qualified doctors. The review, commissioned after concerns over patient safety and role clarity, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges. It follows cases where patients, including one who later died, were treated by PAs under the mistaken belief they were doctors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of House lawmakers, led by Republican Maria Elvira Salazar and Democrat Veronica Escobar, has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act. The bill aims to reform the U.S. immigration system by creating a "Dignity Program," which would offer a seven-year pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for at least five years and meet certain criteria. The legislation also includes provisions for increased border security, asylum reform, and a fund for training American workers. The reintroduction comes amid heightened scrutiny of the Trump administration's mass deportation program.</p>

          <p>The historic Palm House at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for a five-year, £50 million renovation project. Opened in 1848, the Victorian glasshouse's ironwork has been damaged by the hot, humid conditions required for its tropical rainforest collection. The ambitious project involves moving 1,300 plants, replacing 16,000 panes of glass, and upgrading the heating system to achieve net-zero emissions. One of the most challenging tasks will be relocating a 250-year-old, one-tonne cycad plant that is older than the building itself.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advertisement for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims, including that the product can "help you feel calm" and reduce stress. The watchdog found that the ad, which promoted ingredients like magnesium and L-theanine, implied benefits that are not permitted on the official register for food and supplement marketing. The ASA ruled that the language used could mislead consumers into believing the drink could treat anxiety. The company has been ordered not to run the ad again in its current form.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. has secured a trade deal with Indonesia, reducing a threatened 32% tariff on Indonesian goods to 19%. In exchange, Trump stated that Indonesia has agreed to provide "full access" for American firms by lowering its own trade tariffs on U.S. products. As part of the agreement, Indonesia will reportedly purchase $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. This pact is the latest development following the administration's recent flurry of tariff threats aimed at numerous trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nearly 46 years after his execution, South Korea has begun a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the intelligence chief who assassinated President Park Chung-hee in 1979. The original military trial convicted Kim of insurrection, but his family argues he acted to prevent further bloodshed under Park's authoritarian rule and should be seen as a patriot, not a traitor. The Seoul High Court agreed to the retrial, citing evidence that Kim was tortured into a confession. The case re-examines a pivotal moment in the nation's history and the complex legacies of both the assassin and the dictator he killed.</p>
