        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the changing beauty standards for women in America, noting a shift from prioritizing thinness to embracing strength. It references three new books that examine this phenomenon: Casey Johnston‚Äôs memoir on weightlifting, Amy Larocca‚Äôs exploration of the wellness imperative, and Bonnie Tsui‚Äôs analysis of the cultural symbolism of muscles. The article highlights how the ideal woman has transformed from simply being skinny to being "well," relentlessly optimizing her health through various wellness practices. Despite this shift, the pressure to optimize remains, with women now focusing on achieving a muscular physique while still facing anxieties about body image. The author argues that while strength training can be empowering, it doesn't necessarily break the hold of societal pressures to optimize one's body. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down orders from the Trump administration that led to the cancellation of National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants related to diversity, gender identity, and vaccine hesitancy. Judge William Young of the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts ruled that the directives were arbitrary and unlawful. The ruling came in response to lawsuits filed by public health groups and Democratic state attorneys general.

          <p>Dame Louise Casey has advocated for a national inquiry into grooming gangs to serve as a "national reset" on the issue. This follows her report on group-based child sexual assault in England and Wales, prompting Sir Keir Starmer to announce the inquiry. Casey urged those giving evidence to be open to scrutiny and change, suggesting the inquiry could be completed within three years. She also addressed concerns about the ethnicity of perpetrators, emphasizing the need to "keep calm" and accurately interrogate data. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has committed to following the report's recommendations, including charging adults who engage in penetrative sex with a child under 16 with sexual assault. </p>

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Development Bank, proposed by China in 2010, is gaining momentum due to rising geopolitical tensions and Russia's strategic shift to Asia. China's Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang emphasized the bank proposal, along with initiatives for local currency settlement and digital finance, during a meeting with SCO finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Beijing.
