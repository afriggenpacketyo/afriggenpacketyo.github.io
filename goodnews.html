          <p>China's government has unveiled a new plan to support its cattle industry and promote consumption of high-quality domestic beef in response to falling prices and competition from imports. The policy, announced by the nation's top economic planner, includes implementing a quality-grading system to enhance the appeal of local products. Officials noted that Chinese diets are often deficient in high-quality proteins, suggesting significant room for consumption growth. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to strengthen key agricultural sectors and boost domestic farm produce. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. border agents have been directed to cease deportations under President Trump's asylum ban, following a federal appeals court order that partially limited the policy. The directive, reported by CBS News, instructs Customs and Border Protection officials to process migrants under existing U.S. immigration law instead. This development comes after a court panel ruled that the asylum ban could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. The original ban, which declared illegal immigration a national emergency, was challenged by the ACLU for violating U.S. and international law.</p>

This move follows a similar task force chaired by Trump for the 2026 World Cup, and federal funding has already been allocated for security and planning for both events.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a deal worth approximately $6.5 billion. The agreement marks the largest defense-industry partnership ever between the two nations and is Japan's first major warship export since before World War II. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described the stealthy, next-generation vessel as the best capability for Australia's needs. This purchase is part of Australia's broader military restructuring aimed at enhancing its long-range strike capabilities in response to China's military expansion in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>It is currently peak mating season for tarantulas in Southern California, leading to a higher likelihood of spotting the large, fuzzy spiders. From August to December, male tarantulas leave their burrows in search of mates, often traveling long distances. While their appearance can be alarming to those with arachnophobia, experts note that native U.S. tarantulas are generally harmless to humans and reluctant to bite unless provoked. Their bodies are covered in irritant hairs, which they can rub off as a defense mechanism, so it is best to observe them from a distance.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has declined an invitation to serve on President Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley, who was among a list of prominent sports figures invited, cited his busy schedule as the reason for his decision. The council is part of a broader initiative that also includes the reestablishment of the Presidential Fitness Test for American children. Barkley, who has previously golfed with both President Trump and former President Barack Obama, stated he respects the office but felt it was in his best interest not to accept.</p>

          <p>The remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, have been discovered by archaeologists in a cave near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The find was part of a broader survey of local caves and sinkholes, which also uncovered evidence of the area being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. The project, a partnership between researchers and local cavers, is shedding new light on how prehistoric communities lived and farmed in the region. These discoveries underscore the historical significance of the area's ancient common land traditions.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Trump endorsed the company's controversial ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a social media post, Trump praised the ad as the "HOTTEST" out there and commended Sweeney, whom he described as a registered Republican. The campaign had faced backlash from some critics who accused its wordplay on "genes" and "jeans" of aligning with white nationalist messaging. The president's endorsement, however, fueled a meme-driven rally for the retailer, which has been facing significant financial challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that a rise in colorectal cancer screenings among adults aged 45 to 49 is leading to more diagnoses at an earlier, more treatable stage. This follows recent recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45. One study showed screenings in this age group increased by 62% from 2019 to 2023, while another noted a significant jump in early-stage cancer incidence. While researchers find the trend promising, they caution that screening rates in this demographic remain suboptimal and inequitable across different groups.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has attributed the stock market's recent rebound to the strong earnings reports from the "Magnificent Seven" technology companies, including Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. After a dip caused by a weak labor report, the major indexes surged on Monday, a resilience Cramer credits to the financial strength and diverse revenue streams of these tech giants. He noted that despite some mixed reactions and poor performance in certain segments like Tesla's vehicle business, the overall success and cash-rich status of these companies make them a dominant force in the market.

The updated regulations require more character references for shotgun applications and mandate police to consult with partners to check for domestic abuse history. Ambler, who has campaigned for these changes since the 2020 tragedy, believes the government is finally listening and strengthening policies to prevent similar events. The changes are a direct response to several recent mass shootings involving legally owned weapons.</p>

This rhetoric aligns with a growing sentiment in Silicon Valley that favors nontraditional career paths over formal education. Palantir has actively recruited talent away from college through initiatives like its Meritocracy Fellowship, which launched this year.</p>

The advice for the NHS emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process and that patients need a plan for maintaining their new weight through healthy eating, exercise, and behavioral support.
