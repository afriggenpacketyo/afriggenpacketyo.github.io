          <p>White House Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed strong confidence that courts will support President Trump's tariff agenda, despite a recent federal court setback. Hassett stated that the administration expects its "Plan A" to succeed, referring to the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enact tariffs. He argued that the tariffs are necessary to address the national emergency posed by fentanyl deaths. An appeals court temporarily stayed a lower court's decision that had blocked the tariffs, shifting the burden of proof to the government to demonstrate "irreparable harm" if the injunction remains in place (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Investors are increasingly favoring the shorter end of the fixed-income market, as evidenced by ETF flows and interest in ultrashort Treasury opportunities. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL) have attracted significant investor capital this year. Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has also increased its ownership of T-bills, now holding 5% of all short-term Treasuries.
