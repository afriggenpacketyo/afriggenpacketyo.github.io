          <p>Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and primary manufacturer of Apple's iPhones, reported a substantial 27% surge in its second-quarter operating profit, significantly surpassing market forecasts. This robust financial performance is primarily attributed to the booming demand within its artificial intelligence server business, which now accounts for 41% of its total revenue, notably surpassing smart consumer electronics for the first time. The company projects continued strong growth in its AI server segment for the current quarter, with an expected increase of over 170% year-over-year. Foxconn is strategically diversifying into new high-growth areas such as electric vehicles and semiconductor manufacturing, although it remains cautious about the potential impact of evolving global political and economic conditions, including U.S. tariffs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of State has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and its alias, the Majeed Brigade, as foreign terrorist organizations. This significant action, taken by the Trump administration, is seen by analysts as potentially fostering greater counterterrorism cooperation between China and the U.S. The designation directly addresses Beijing's long-standing concerns over fatal terrorist attacks in the region, which have frequently targeted Chinese nationals and interests. Experts suggest this move creates a crucial opportunity for the two global powers to collaborate more effectively on counterterrorism efforts, particularly through Pakistan, signaling a potential positive side effect for international security dynamics despite broader geopolitical tensions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BTecs are practical vocational qualifications in the UK, assessed through exams, coursework, and projects, serving as alternatives or complements to GCSEs (Level 2) and A-levels (Level 3). Graded from Pass to Starred Distinction, they provide pathways to university or direct employment, with health and social care being popular subjects. While previous government plans aimed to withdraw funding for many BTecs to make way for T-levels, the current Labour government has paused and reviewed these changes. This ensures continued funding for 157 key courses in vital sectors like agriculture, engineering, and health and social care until at least July 2026 or 2027, offering crucial stability and continued access to vocational pathways for hundreds of thousands of students.</p>

This article explains how grade boundaries are determined annually by exam boards and provides guidance on the appeals process for students who believe their grades are incorrect. For those who do not meet university offers, the Ucas clearing process is detailed as a pathway to find available courses, opening on July 5 and closing on October 20. Additionally, students have options for resitting exams in May or June 2026, or considering apprenticeships and direct employment, offering various routes for their post-school journey.</p>

          <h2>UK Economic Growth Exceeds Forecasts with 0.3% Expansion in Second Quarter</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter, according to preliminary estimates from the Office for National Statistics. This growth, primarily driven by the services sector and an increase in construction, surpassed Reuters' forecast of 0.1% and followed a 0.7% expansion in the first quarter. Despite an initial contraction in April, revised data and strong June performance contributed to the positive outcome. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves welcomed the figures, economists caution that this pace of growth may not be sustained due to global economic weakness and ongoing tax rise speculation, despite recent interest rate cuts by the Bank of England.

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has dismissed a 30 million won (approximately $21,600) copyright claim against SmartStudy, now known as The Pinkfong Company, the creators of the globally viral children's song "Baby Shark." US composer Jonathan Wright, also known as Johnny Only, alleged that the 2015 hit copied a song he released in 2011. However, the court upheld earlier decisions, ruling that Wright's rendition was not original enough to qualify for copyright protection. Both songs are based on a traditional melody that has been popular at children's summer camps in the United States for many years, which the court confirmed is considered to be in the public domain, thus settling a notable legal dispute.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney expressed his "real disappointment" and called NFL legend Tom Brady's comments "very unfair" after Brady, a part-owner of Birmingham City, publicly questioned Rooney's work ethic during his 83-day tenure as the club's head coach. Rooney, who was sacked by Birmingham in January 2024, clarified that Brady's single visit to the training ground occurred on a lighter pre-game day, leading to a misunderstanding of football's unique demands for player rest compared to the NFL's three-month season. He emphasized that Brady's portrayal was inaccurate. Despite the personal criticism, Rooney acknowledged that Birmingham City now appears to be on the right track under new management, having invested significantly and achieved a record points score in League One.</p>

          <p>A growing trend, dubbed "bleisure" travel, sees over half of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, bringing loved ones—including partners, children, friends, and even pets—along on work trips. This practice allows professionals to reclaim family time, mitigate loneliness, and significantly reduce personal travel expenses by leveraging company-covered travel costs. While many employees don't openly broadcast these plans due to concerns about professionalism, companies often quietly permit it as long as work objectives are met and expenses are clearly separated. This blend of business and leisure, valued at $315 billion in 2022, is projected to reach $731 billion globally by 2032.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of Americans who report drinking alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, a significant dip that coincides with growing public awareness and concern that even moderate consumption is unhealthy. Experts attribute this shift to an evolving scientific consensus, which now suggests any amount of alcohol can have negative health effects, including increased risks of cancer, depression, and anxiety. Younger generations, particularly those aged 18-34, appear to be more receptive to this health messaging, showing lower rates of drinking and a greater belief that moderate consumption is harmful. This trend is also supported by the rising popularity of alcohol-free alternatives and a societal shift towards making sobriety more socially acceptable, indicating a potential long-term change in American drinking habits.</p>
