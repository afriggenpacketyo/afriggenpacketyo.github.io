          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of weakening, with a decrease in the number of workers on payrolls during the first quarter of the year. Job vacancies have also declined, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Wage growth has slowed, but pay is still rising faster than the rate of inflation. Regular earnings, excluding bonuses, grew at an annual pace of 5.6% in the first three months of the year.</p>

The agreement to temporarily halt tariffs has led UBS, Morgan Stanley, and ANZ Bank to increase their GDP growth expectations for China in 2025. The trade war de-escalation is expected to result in a smaller shock to China's economy and potentially lead to front-loaded shipments and production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States will reduce the low-value "de minimis" tariff on shipments from China, a White House executive order said, furthering the trade truce between the two nations. The levies will be reduced to 54% from 120%, with a flat fee of $100 to remain, starting from May 14. This move comes after Beijing and Washington agreed to unwind most tariffs imposed on each other's goods since early April. The Geneva agreement slashed tariffs for both countries by 115 percentage points, to 10% and 30%, respectively, for at least 90 days.</p>
