          <p>A unique preparatory high school, the first of its kind in a major U.S. city, has opened in Queens, New York, with a curriculum focused on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The school aims to increase student exposure to HBCUs, which are predominantly located in the southern United States. Students at the HBCU Early College Prep will be able to earn up to 64 college credits for an associate's degree from Delaware State University (DSU) and are guaranteed admission there. The initiative, supported by Mayor Eric Adams, seeks to create a new educational pathway and build on the legacy of HBCUs in fostering academic excellence.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 18:47:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy has published her first memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," which delves into the raw and turbulent relationship with her late mother, Mary Roy. The book portrays Mary Roy as a formidable and contradictory figure—a feminist icon, educator, and crusader who was also a source of both shelter and storm for her daughter. Rather than a hagiography, the memoir is a candid exploration of a complex mother-daughter bond, which Roy describes as a "respectful relationship between two nuclear powers." The narrative chronicles her challenging upbringing and how these experiences shaped her as a writer.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump hosted a meeting at the White House with top technology executives, including the CEOs of Google and IBM, to launch a task force on integrating artificial intelligence into K-12 education. The event, part of the "Presidential AI Challenge," focused on promoting AI literacy among American students, with Trump stating that "the robots are here." The initiative has drawn criticism from some tech-industry watchdogs, who argue it overlooks the potential harms of AI on youth mental health. As part of the push, numerous tech companies have pledged to support AI education through free training and expanded access to AI tools.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explained that the decision to trade star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers was a strategic financial move based on "mathematics." Parsons recently signed a record-breaking four-year, $186 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Jones stated that the substantial draft capital received in the trade allows the team to allocate salary cap space to multiple high-quality players instead of concentrating it on one individual. He emphasized that the trade allows for greater roster depth and flexibility, mitigating the risk of a single player's potential injury.</p>

          <p>Since returning to the White House, First Lady Melania Trump has adopted a more focused and influential role, concentrating on issues related to children and technology. While maintaining a more private profile than many of her predecessors, she has been instrumental in initiatives like the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Her recent work on an AI education task force, which brought together top tech executives, exemplifies her business-oriented approach to her platform. Analysts note that she is selectively engaging on topics of personal interest to contribute to legislative efforts.</p>

          <h2>Key Questions for Homeowners Considering a Home Equity Loan This September</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 18:02:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity levels at record highs and interest rates relatively low, homeowners may be considering tapping into their property's value. However, the article advises a strategic approach, especially with a potential Federal Reserve rate cut on the horizon this month. Homeowners should first accurately assess how much equity they can actually borrow, as lenders have limits, and determine if their financial needs are urgent enough to justify borrowing at current rates. It is also important to weigh the benefits of securing a loan now against the possibility of lower rates in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland defeated Luxembourg 3-1 in a World Cup qualifying match, a result manager Michael O'Neill attributed to a stern half-time talk. After Jamie Reid scored an early goal, Northern Ireland's performance dipped, allowing Luxembourg to equalize before the break. O'Neill said he "had to get into them" during the interval, and the team responded immediately, with Shea Charles scoring just 25 seconds into the second half. A red card for a Luxembourg player further aided Northern Ireland's cause, and Justin Devenny sealed the victory with a third goal, giving the team a crucial win in their campaign.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates in September, savers are encouraged to make strategic moves to lock in high returns on certificates of deposit (CDs). The article suggests that individuals with significant funds should act promptly, as banks often adjust their rates in anticipation of Fed decisions. Recommendations include assessing whether to deposit more money to maximize earnings in the current high-rate environment and shopping directly with online banks, which typically offer higher rates. The key advice is not to wait, as the window of opportunity for current CD rates may close soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Chinese President Xi Jinping's call for a new global order centered on the Global South is gaining traction, particularly in the Muslim world. As U.S. global primacy wanes, Beijing's vision of "true multilateralism" appeals to developing nations frustrated with Western-led institutions like the IMF and World Bank. States in the Middle East are increasingly diversifying their economic and political alliances, looking eastward for financing and leverage. The author contends that this shift represents a significant recalibration of global politics, offering both opportunities and risks for nations historically aligned with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous driving unit, Waymo, announced it will begin testing its driverless robotaxis at San Jose Mineta International Airport this fall. This marks the company's first airport testing site in California, with plans to offer paid rides to the public later in the year. The service will allow passengers to be picked up from the airport's ground transportation centers and travel to destinations within Waymo's San Francisco Bay service area. This expansion follows the successful launch of a similar service at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, which has become a popular destination for Waymo riders.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Gradual Decline in Mortgage Rates Throughout 2025 with Potential for Further Drops</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have been on a slow but steady downward trend in 2025, providing some relief for potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance. For example, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen from over 7% in January to 6.50% in early September. While rates are not as low as they were at the start of the decade, the consistent decline is an encouraging sign for the housing market. Further drops are possible, contingent on the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decisions and the performance of the 10-year Treasury yield. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An internal National Football League report for the 2024 season, obtained by CNBC, reveals a wide disparity in ticket revenue among its 32 teams. The San Francisco 49ers topped the league with $176.5 million in net ticket receipts, significantly higher than the league average. At the other end of the spectrum, the Tennessee Titans ranked last with $81.2 million. The report also details how teams contribute 34% of their ticket revenue to a shared pool, known as the visiting team's share, which is then largely redistributed equally to all teams to promote financial parity.</p>
