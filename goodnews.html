          <p>SpaceX successfully launched the Ax-4 mission, a privately-funded flight to the International Space Station (ISS), carrying retired astronaut Peggy Whitson and three rookie crewmates from India, Poland, and Hungary. The mission, which experienced delays due to weather and technical issues, marks Axiom Space's fourth commercial flight to the ISS. Whitson, a veteran of three NASA flights, will oversee scientific research and technology demonstrations during the two-week mission, while also engaging in educational outreach. The mission aims to provide access to space for countries that may not normally have it, highlighting the growing commercialization of space travel. The launch was smooth and the crew is expected to dock with the ISS after a 28-hour rendezvous. Optimism is present as the mission is a collaboration between multiple countries. </p>

          <p>Chinese military analysts have been closely observing the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian facilities, focusing on the use of the GBU-57 bunker-buster bombs. While acknowledging the effectiveness of the B-2 bomber's delivery and the bomb's performance, they also highlight the limitations against deeply buried targets like Fordow. China, known for its extensive underground bunker systems, is developing its own bunker-busting weapons, particularly for potential targets within Taiwan. The analysts' assessment provides insight into China's strategic thinking regarding its own military capabilities. </p>

          <p>A growing number of Labour MPs are opposing the government's planned welfare reforms, which aim to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments. Despite appeals from ministers, over 130 MPs, including 122 from Labour, have signed an amendment to block the changes. While Labour leader Keir Starmer intends to proceed with the reforms, the widespread opposition reflects concerns about the impact on vulnerable individuals. Some cabinet members are fearful that the mood on this issue might bleed into a broader problem for the Labour leadership. </p>

          <h2>Rare Flooding Brings Life and Tourism to Australian Outback</h2>

          <p>A rare flooding event has transformed Australia‚Äôs arid outback, creating a new inland sea that is attracting both animals and tourists. The flooding of Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre, an ephemeral lake, is occurring for only the fourth time in 160 years. The event is bringing an influx of waterbirds, mammals, and native flora, creating a boom-and-bust cycle in the desert ecosystem. The influx of visitors has led to growing pains, including a ban on walking on the lake bed to protect the fragile surface. </p>

          <p>Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi urged the European Union to increase its role in global affairs amid rising tensions with the United States. Renzi noted that the U.S. President has been critical of Europe and that trade disputes persist between the two entities. He emphasized the need for Europe to assert itself in the face of these challenges. Renzi's comments come as the EU struggles to have a significant presence in global conversations, including those related to the Middle East and the Ukraine-Russia conflict. </p>

          <h2>China-Led Study Proposes Global Green-Energy Network</h2>

          <p>A China-led study suggests that a global solar-wind energy network could meet the world‚Äôs energy demands in 2050 at a lower cost than independent regional systems. The study proposes a network that draws on regions with abundant renewable energy potential to provide energy across continents. Researchers acknowledge that establishing such a system would require navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises. The study suggests that successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency and be resilient against conflict and climate extremes. </p>
