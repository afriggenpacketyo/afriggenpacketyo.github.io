          <p>Delta Air Lines has issued a fourth-quarter profit forecast that exceeds Wall Street expectations, citing robust demand for luxury travel and increasing airfares. The airline also reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed estimates, with premium cabin revenue growing by 9% while main cabin revenue slightly declined. CEO Ed Bastian stated that the company is well-positioned for continued growth and has not seen any negative impacts from a potential government shutdown. The positive outlook suggests a recovery in travel demand and improved capacity management within the airline industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen successfully overcame two no-confidence votes in the European Parliament. The challenges were initiated by the hard-right Patriots for Europe and the far-left alliance The Left, but neither managed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority for her removal. While the outcome reaffirms her position, the relatively narrow margins of support highlight the increasing difficulty for the European Commission to command a stable majority for passing legislation. This reflects a more fractured European Parliament with growing populist factions on both ends of the political spectrum.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has initiated a review of what it calls "outdated" licensing laws, which could lead to extended opening hours for pubs and bars in England and Wales. The proposed reforms aim to support the hospitality sector by cutting red tape, making it easier for venues to serve food outdoors and host live music. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer framed the review as a way to boost local economies, critics have raised concerns that relaxing alcohol regulations could lead to an increase in antisocial behavior. The review will gather evidence on recommendations from a government taskforce, including simplifying rules for outdoor trading and temporary events.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, negotiated in Egypt, appears imminent, with the Israeli government expected to ratify the deal soon. The first phase of the plan reportedly includes the release of all remaining hostages from Gaza in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces. Despite the approaching ceasefire, intense Israeli attacks continued across Gaza, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting additional casualties. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has expressed support for the deal, emphasizing that sovereignty over Gaza belongs to the state of Palestine.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to strong growth in its international markets. This performance helped offset another quarter of declining sales volume in North America for both its food and beverage divisions. The company's net sales rose 2.6% to $23.94 billion, although worldwide volume for its products fell by 1%. Despite the challenges in its home market, where it has been investing to boost brands like Doritos and Gatorade, PepsiCo reiterated its full-year financial outlook, expecting stable earnings and low single-digit revenue growth.

          <p>Inter Miami is set to play its final MLS regular season game at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale before moving to a new, purpose-built arena in Miami next season. The temporary stadium, built on the site of the derelict Lockhart Stadium, became an intimate and unlikely venue for global superstar Lionel Messi's dazzling MLS debut. While fans have grown fond of the stadium's close-to-the-pitch feel, the move to the 25,000-capacity Miami Freedom Park represents the club's long-term vision. The transition raises questions about accessibility for fans from surrounding counties who formed the club's early support base.</p>

          <p>Mormon Women for Ethical Government (MWEG), a cross-partisan group, is among the plaintiffs in a successful lawsuit that has forced Utah's legislature to redraw its congressional district maps. The group, formed in 2017 to counter what it saw as dehumanizing political behavior, argued that the previous map was an unfair partisan gerrymander that nullified a voter-backed initiative for an independent commission. Members of MWEG view their advocacy for a fair democratic process as an extension of their faith. The court-ordered redistricting is occurring amid a national push by former President Trump for Republican-led states to redraw maps to their party's advantage.</p>

          <p>The film "If I Had Legs I'd Kick You," directed by Mary Bronstein, is described as an intense and anxiety-inducing psychodrama that immerses the audience in the crisis of its protagonist, Linda. Rose Byrne delivers a magnificent and vivid performance as a mother on the verge of collapse due to the overwhelming pressures of caring for her ill daughter with little support. The movie employs extreme close-ups and oppressive sound design to create a claustrophobic atmosphere, drawing comparisons to the Safdie brothers' work. While the experience is purposefully exhausting and unpleasant, Byrne's powerful portrayal makes the character's struggle deeply compelling and unforgettable.</p>

          <p>John Fabian Witt's book, "The Radical Fund," details the history of the American Fund for Public Service, established in 1922 by Charles Garland, an heir who ethically refused his $1 million inheritance. The fund was designed to be spent quickly on unpopular and progressive causes, supporting organizations like the NAACP and ACLU, and financing anti-lynching campaigns and labor movements. This article reviews how the book meticulously documents the fund's significant impact on American civil rights and legal history over two decades with a relatively modest endowment. The story serves as a historical parallel to today's issues of wealth inequality and the power of targeted philanthropy.</p>
