          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker renowned for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," which challenged the notion of widespread French resistance during the Nazi occupation, has died at 97. His film sparked controversy by interviewing ordinary citizens of Clermont-Ferrand, revealing collaboration and indifference towards Jewish persecution. Despite initial bans, the film gained critical acclaim and influenced historical accounts of wartime France. Ophuls continued directing documentaries, including the Oscar-winning "H√¥tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," and explored his own life in "Ain‚Äôt Misbehavin'."</p>

          <p>Food scanner apps are becoming popular for rating the healthfulness of packaged foods, but nutrition experts advise using them with skepticism. While these apps can help consumers make healthier choices, different apps may provide different scores for the same product, and some may overemphasize single ingredients over overall nutrient content. Experts recommend looking for apps that assess food on overall nutrient content and are transparent about their data sources. The article emphasizes that apps alone won't solve dietary problems and that a balanced approach to nutrition is key.</p>

          <p>A new executive order from the White House aims to address the high number of homeless veterans in Los Angeles by transforming the West LA VA campus into a National Center for Warrior Independence. The order directs the VA secretary to create a plan to house 6,000 veterans on the campus by 2028, but some question the specifics and funding of the plan. While advocates embrace the news, concerns remain about the lack of consultation with local VA officials and the potential for the campus to become a ghetto. Despite the skepticism, there is hope that the order could lead to more services and long-term housing for veterans in need.</p>

The ESA aims to correct the "cosmic mistake" of the waltz's absence from NASA's Voyager Golden Record in 1977.

          <p>Japan has begun allowing Taiwanese individuals marrying Japanese citizens to list Taiwan as their place of origin in the family registry system, instead of China. The Justice Ministry's revision aligns the family register with Japan's residence registry for foreign residents. Taiwan has welcomed the move as a protection of the rights and interests of Taiwanese in Japan, while China has criticized it, asserting that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. The Japanese ministry decided on the change partly to avoid any confusion associated with marriage or divorce between Japanese and foreigners.</p>
