        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, dramatically reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings for the Chicago area. The article describes how the dust storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was fueled by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dry soil from parched farmlands. The phenomenon, termed a haboob, caused near-zero visibility on major highways, creating hazardous driving conditions, and significantly impacted Chicago, reducing visibility to a quarter-mile at Midway Airport. This event marks only the second time the Weather Service office in Romeoville has issued a dust storm warning, highlighting the unusual nature of the event for the city, with comparisons drawn to the Dust Bowl era.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who fled to eastern Congo following the 1994 genocide, were repatriated after Rwandan-backed rebels seized parts of the region. The article reports that most of the refugees were women and children, who crossed the border in buses provided by Rwandan authorities and escorted by the UNHCR and Save the Children. The repatriation is part of a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and the UNHCR, with plans to repatriate 2,000 people. This marks a significant step for those who have spent decades in exile, some of whom were born in Congo and have never seen Rwanda.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military is working to recruit more women as it faces an urgent need for soldiers in the ongoing war with Russia, but sexism remains a significant obstacle. The article focuses on Lieutenant Kateryna, Ukraine's only female combat pilot, who describes the challenges she faces in a male-dominated environment. Despite the military's efforts to promote gender equality, deeply rooted stereotypes persist, leading to marginalization and underutilization of women in the armed forces. Kateryna's story highlights the need for cultural change within the military to fully integrate and support female soldiers.</p>
