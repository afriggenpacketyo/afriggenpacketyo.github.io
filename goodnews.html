          <h2>Tariffs Impact Chinese Restaurants: American Chicken Feet Replaced with Alternatives</h2>

          <p>Due to rising prices caused by tariffs, Geng Xiaoyun, a restaurant owner in Beijing, has had to remove American chicken feet from the menu, a once-popular delicacy. The tariffs have increased the price of American chicken feet by 30% since March, making them unaffordable for his restaurant. While Geng has found alternative sources in Brazil and Russia, he believes they do not match the quality of the American product. Geng hopes that the situation will improve and that he can once again serve American chicken feet, contingent on changes in the global political landscape. This situation illustrates the real-world effects of international trade policies on local businesses and consumers.</p>

Lee's eligibility for the presidency was in doubt after he was charged with breaching election laws, but a final ruling on the case had been postponed until after the election. Goldman Sachs notes that both Lee and his rival share similarities in their goals, including economic growth, stable financial markets and improving housing affordability. (not investment advice)</p>
