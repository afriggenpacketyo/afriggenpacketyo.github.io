          <p>Due to Scotland's impending landfill ban on biodegradable municipal waste, experts predict that up to 100 truckloads of waste will be transported daily to England.  The ban, delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, aims to reduce methane emissions from landfills.  However, insufficient incineration capacity in Scotland necessitates this temporary export, raising concerns about increased transportation emissions and logistical challenges.  The long-term strategy focuses on increased recycling rates.</p>
