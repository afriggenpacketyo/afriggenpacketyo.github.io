          <p>Health experts are issuing a warning about the rising cases of measles in Europe and other regions, urging families traveling abroad to ensure they are up to date with their vaccinations. Measles infections in Europe have reached a 25-year high, with surges also reported in countries like Pakistan and Nigeria. The UK Health Security Agency reports an ongoing outbreak in England, with the majority of cases affecting unvaccinated children aged 10 years and under, and London accounting for nearly half of all cases. The UKHSA emphasizes that vaccination is essential to prevent the spread of this highly contagious disease, which can lead to serious complications. The tone of the article is cautious, yet emphasizes the importance of vaccination to mitigate risk.</p>

          <h2>German Chancellor's Visit Overshadowed by Trump-Musk Spat, Seen as a Win for Germany</h2>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's recent meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump was largely overshadowed by the public spat between Trump and Elon Musk. Despite the distraction, the meeting is considered a success for Merz, who is relatively new to his chancellorship. Merz's agenda included strengthening U.S.-German relations, addressing tariffs, and securing U.S. support for Ukraine, and he seemingly addressed most of these points with Trump. Merz also gifted Trump his grandfather's birth certificate, highlighting the family's connection to Germany, and emphasized Germany's commitment to increased defense spending, which are all positive notes in the discussion.</p>

          <p>The Belmont Stakes is set to feature a rematch of the top three finishers from the Kentucky Derby: Sovereignty, Journalism, and Baeza. Sovereignty, who won the Derby, skipped the Preakness to prepare for the Belmont, while Journalism won the Preakness after finishing second in the Derby. The Belmont will be held at Saratoga Race Course due to ongoing redevelopment at Belmont Park, and the race distance has been shortened to 1 1/4 miles. Journalism is the morning-line favorite, with Sovereignty also expected to be a strong contender, as the race is a key event in horse racing's Triple Crown.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a rebound in premarket trading following a substantial $152 billion decline triggered by escalating tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The stock's initial drop was fueled by verbal exchanges between Musk and Trump, which stemmed from Musk's criticism of Trump's proposed tax bill. Analysts suggested that a potential truce between the two figures could provide relief for Tesla shares, and the premarket gains reflect some investor optimism. However, the situation remains fluid as the White House has indicated that Trump is not interested in a call with Musk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia's central bank has lowered interest rates for the first time since September 2022, decreasing them by 100 basis points to 20%.

The inflation rate in April was 6.2%, down from 8.2% in the first quarter of 2025. The central bank stated that monetary policy would remain tight for a long period to return inflation to its 4% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beijing's police authority plans to liquidate cryptocurrencies confiscated in criminal cases through licensed exchanges in Hong Kong, potentially aiding the city's efforts to become a virtual asset hub. The Beijing Public Security Bureau has partnered with the China Beijing Equity Exchange (CBEX) to offload seized cryptoassets through regulated platforms in Hong Kong. Proceeds will be converted into yuan and deposited in designated accounts. This marks the first time a mainland agency has detailed a process for disposing of confiscated cryptoassets through Hong Kong's virtual asset regime. (not investment advice)</p>
