          <p>The Japanese government has started releasing stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers, making it available to consumers at reduced prices. Major retailers like Ito-Yokado and Iris Ohyama have begun selling the rice for 2,160 yen ($15) per 5-kilogram bag, leading to high demand and quick sell-outs in some locations. This initiative aims to alleviate the impact of soaring rice prices on households, with 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 harvests being offered through these contracts. Consumers have expressed relief at the cheaper prices, though some have been disappointed by limited availability.</p>
