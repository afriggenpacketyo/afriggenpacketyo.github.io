          <p>Former First Lady Melania Trump announced that an "open channel of communication" with Russian President Vladimir Putin has resulted in the reunification of eight Ukrainian children with their families. The development followed a "peace letter" she sent concerning the child victims of the war, which she said received a written response from Putin. This initiative is part of her broader BE BEST campaign, which focuses on the well-being of children, though it comes against the backdrop of an estimated 19,500 Ukrainian children who have been forcibly displaced to Russia since the conflict began.</p>

          <p>World football's governing body, FIFA, has initiated a review of its regulations concerning domestic league games being staged in foreign countries and is seeking legal advice on a potential ban. This move comes after UEFA approved plans for Spanish and Italian league matches to be played in the United States and Australia, respectively, citing the existing FIFA framework. FIFA aims to create more robust and clear-cut rules to govern such international matches, addressing concerns that a global free-for-all could pose a significant risk to the sport's structure.</p>

The document encourages the use of AI for improving government efficiency, such as in public consultations, infrastructure monitoring, and drafting documents. However, it mandates that all AI systems undergo a complete safety evaluation before deployment and that government employees receive training on the technology's safe and ethical use, reflecting a cautious approach to integrating AI into state functions.</p>

These investments are designed to fill critical manufacturing gaps in Africa, which currently imports about 70 percent of its essential medicines despite bearing a quarter of the world's disease burden.</p>

          <p>Prominent British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah has spoken publicly for the first time since his release from an Egyptian prison, where he was held for over a decade. He described the "sensory overwhelm" of freedom and the process of recovering from his ordeal, which included a near-fatal hunger strike. His release followed a long campaign by his family and the British government, but it remains uncertain if Egyptian authorities will permit him to travel to the UK to reunite with his son.</p>

          <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has formally rejected a proposal from the Trump administration that would have granted it preferential access to federal funding in exchange for adhering to a set of conservative policies. In a letter, MIT's president stated that the agreement would "restrict freedom of expression" and was fundamentally inconsistent with the university's core values of academic independence and merit-based science. The proposed "Compact for Academic Excellence" included terms such as capping foreign student admissions and using force to prevent campus protests.</p>
