        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dan Richards, in a New York Times guest essay, contrasts the resurgence of sleeper trains in Europe with the decline of long-distance rail travel in the United States. Europe's revitalized night train network competes with short-haul flights, driven by environmental concerns and EU infrastructure plans. Meanwhile, the U.S. faces slashed funding for public infrastructure and a preference for cars and air travel, leading to congestion and environmental damage. The article advocates for investment in rail networks and subway systems as a way to improve transportation and quality of life in America.</p>

          <p>Poles are voting in a presidential election amidst heightened security concerns due to the war in Ukraine and worries about U.S. commitment to European security. The leading candidates are Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, a liberal, and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian. A second round is expected, as no candidate is likely to secure over 50% of the vote. The election is also a test for far-right forces, with authorities reporting attempts at foreign interference during the campaign.</p>

          <p>A bloody, bare footprint found at a 1993 Minneapolis murder scene of Jeanie Childs has led to the conviction of Jerry Westrom decades later. Investigators matched the footprint, along with DNA evidence, to Westrom, who denied knowing the victim. Despite the presence of other DNA at the scene, the footprint was crucial in securing the conviction. The article details the investigation, the victim's background, and the forensic analysis that ultimately brought the killer to justice.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This model grants Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Projects like Nairobi's mega-highway and Zambia's Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are adopting PPP models. Chinese financiers would contribute 40% of the funds needed to build a railway in Kenya, and Chinese contractors would have exclusive rights to construct and operate the railway for a minimum of 25 years after completion to recoup their investment through toll fees.</p>
