          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its COVID-19 vaccine guidance, stating that children with no underlying health conditions "may receive" the vaccine, replacing a broad recommendation for all children. This change follows an announcement that the agency would stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The CDC now recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children and most adults. While the agency removed the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy, guidance remains on the CDC's website stating that pregnant women are recommended to get vaccinated due to their higher risk of severe disease.</p>

          <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold will join Real Madrid on June 1 after Liverpool accepted a fee to release the defender early from his contract. The agreed-upon fee is reportedly 10 million euros, paid upfront by Real Madrid, though some sources suggest a lower amount. This move allows the England right-back to participate in the Club World Cup with Real Madrid. Alexander-Arnold has agreed to a six-year deal with a 1 billion euro buy-out clause, and Liverpool has already signed Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen as his replacement.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve indicating that interest rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, experts suggest consumers take action to manage their finances. Recommendations include paying down credit card debt, as average credit card APRs remain high, and considering balance transfer credit cards or personal loans. Locking in high-yield savings rates on online savings accounts and money market accounts is also advised before rates potentially decrease. Improving one's credit score can lead to lower interest rates on loans, but national average credit scores have recently declined. (not investment advice)</p>

Factors include financial burdens, career priorities, climate change concerns, and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The piece also suggests that a redefinition of "harm" and higher parenting standards contribute to this trend, with adult children expecting more from their parents, including career support and accountability for their mental health. This cultural shift has made the decision of whether to become a parent more fraught for millennials.</p>
