          <p>Dodgers star Mookie Betts will miss games against the Yankees after fracturing his toe while walking to the bathroom in the dark. Betts, who has been having a relatively down year, banged his toe into a wall, leading to the injury. Manager Dave Roberts expects Betts to be day-to-day and not require placement on the injured list. This incident follows a similar injury to teammate Freddie Freeman, who missed games after slipping in the shower, highlighting the unpredictable nature of injuries in sports.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington, prompting authorities to warn the public to avoid the area. The incident occurred early Friday morning, causing the closure of Weidkamp Road. Beekeepers are working to re-hive the bees and recover the queen, aiming to save as many as possible.

          <p>Faith Salie explores the pervasive use of corporate buzzwords and their impact on workplace communication. She argues that jargon often impedes trust and can make employees, especially Gen Zers, feel insecure. The piece suggests that buzzwords are frequently used to distract from the primary goal of making money and encourages people to use plain language instead. By comparing corporate language to poetry, Salie humorously advocates for clear and authentic communication in professional settings.</p>
