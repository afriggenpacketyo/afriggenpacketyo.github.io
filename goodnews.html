          <p>Germany is reflecting on the 10th anniversary of Angela Merkel's "Wir schaffen das" (we can do it) statement, assessing the impact of the 2015 refugee influx on the country. While many refugees have integrated into the workforce, unemployment rates among migrants remain high, leading to debates about immigration policy. Meanwhile, German authorities are searching for far-right activist Marla-Svenja Liebich, who failed to begin an 18-month prison sentence for incitement. The article also touches on the controversy surrounding Liebich's legal gender change and its implications for Germany's Self-Determination Act, highlighting the complex challenges facing the nation. The country is grappling with migration, extremism, and legal reforms simultaneously.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Biologists are employing drones equipped with loudspeakers to deter wolves from preying on cattle near the California-Oregon border. The drones broadcast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," movie clips, and human voices to scare away the predators, marking a creative approach to non-lethal wildlife management. This method aims to mitigate conflicts between ranchers and the growing wolf population, which has led to increased livestock losses. While environmental advocates are optimistic about the potential of drones, concerns remain about their cost-effectiveness and the possibility of wolves becoming habituated to the technology, prompting ongoing research and adaptation. The article details the innovative strategies being tested to promote coexistence between humans and wildlife.</p>
