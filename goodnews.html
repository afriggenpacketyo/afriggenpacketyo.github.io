          <p>The Princess of Wales has withdrawn from her planned attendance at Royal Ascot as she continues her gradual return to public life following her cancer diagnosis last year. Royal sources indicate that Catherine is working to find the right balance as she resumes public engagements. The Princess was reportedly disappointed to miss the event, where she was scheduled to participate in the carriage procession alongside her husband, the Prince of Wales, and King Charles and Queen Camilla. Despite her absence, other members of the royal family, including the King, Queen, Prince William, Prince Edward, and Princess Anne, attended the event, with Catherine's mother also present. It is a time of healing and the focus is on health. </p>

          <p>Amazon's autonomous vehicle startup, Zoox, has opened a new manufacturing facility in Hayward, California, to ramp up production of its robotaxis. The facility is currently producing one robotaxi per day, with plans to accelerate production to a capacity of 10,000 robotaxis per year, or roughly three per hour. Zoox aims to deploy a commercial ride-hailing service in the U.S., and more robotaxis are needed to fulfill this mission. The company has been testing its robotaxis on public roads since 2023 and expects to operate between 500 and 1,000 robotaxis in small-to-medium sized cities. </p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News argues that President Trump's base trusts him to play a strong hand in dealing with Iran, particularly regarding its nuclear program. The author contends that threats from some MAGA influencers that direct action against Iran would divide Trump's base are unfounded. They point to Trump's past actions, such as the killing of Iranian General Qasim Soliemani, as evidence that he is willing to take decisive action. The author suggests that Trump's base prioritizes stopping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and trusts his judgment in achieving that goal. </p>

The movement will also seek to re-energize the youth climate protest movement and push candidates to support ordinary people over corporate interests in the 2026 midterm elections.

          <h2>Jeremy Allen White Portrays Bruce Springsteen in 'Deliver Me From Nowhere' Biopic</h2>

          <p>The trailer for the new biopic *Deliver Me From Nowhere* offers a first look at Jeremy Allen White's portrayal of Bruce Springsteen during the recording of his album *Nebraska*. The film follows Springsteen as he records his sixth album, a stark and stripped-down Nebraska, testing the patience of a record label who want a follow-up to his 1980 pop hit Hungry Heart. White studied archive videos to capture Springsteen's characteristic New Jersey rasp and athletic stage moves, with Springsteen praising White's performance as a terrific actor who sings very well. Fan reaction to the trailer has been cautiously optimistic. </p>

          <h2>Why Are Straight Men Bad at Gossiping?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 10:16:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores why straight men are stereotypically considered bad at gossiping, arguing that it stems from a combination of cultural factors, social conditioning, and the stigma surrounding gossip. It highlights research suggesting that men and women gossip at similar rates, but women tend to engage in more neutral gossip. The author contends that men's reticence to openly partake in gossip is linked to a fear of being perceived as "messy" or stirring the pot. The article further suggests that improving men's gossiping skills could potentially help address the male loneliness epidemic by fostering closer connections and intimacy. </p>
