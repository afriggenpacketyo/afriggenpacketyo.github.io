          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees who were slated to be laid off following a reduction in force announced on March 11. The preliminary injunction was issued in response to a lawsuit filed by 21 states after President Trump signed an executive order aimed at dismantling the Education Department. The judge emphasized the necessity of the department's ability to fulfill its obligations and adhere to congressional mandates. This ruling provides a temporary reprieve for the affected employees and underscores the legal challenges faced by the administration's efforts to reshape the agency.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has ordered its last batch of "blanks" for pennies, signaling an end to penny production due to rising manufacturing costs. The move is expected to save taxpayers $85 million annually, as the cost to mint a penny now exceeds its face value. The U.S. Mint anticipates savings of $56 million in material costs alone. The phase-out will lead businesses to round prices to the nearest nickel, with the last of the new pennies entering circulation early next year. With over 114 billion pennies already in circulation, a gradual shift is planned to avoid triggering a rush to redeem the coins.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats have introduced legislation to transfer control of the U.S. Marshals Service from the executive branch to the federal judiciary, aiming to shield the agency from political interference. This move is prompted by concerns that the Marshals, responsible for protecting judges, could be compromised by the White House or Justice Department due to criticisms of judges ruling against the Trump administration. The bill seeks to establish a special board, including the Chief Justice of the United States, to oversee the Marshals, mirroring the structure of the U.S. Capitol Police. The proposal follows increasing threats against judges, including a fatal shooting targeting the son of a U.S. District Judge, underscoring the urgency of ensuring judicial security.</p>

          <p>The House passed a tax bill that includes a $40,000 cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), phasing out over $500,000. The provision, enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, would go into effect in 2025. The SALT cap and income phaseout would increase annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. However, the proposal could face pushback in the Senate. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially lowering the benefit of the higher SALT cap.</p>
