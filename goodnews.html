          <p>AB Hernandez, a 16-year-old transgender athlete in California, won two track events over the weekend, tying for first place in both the high jump and triple jump. This occurred amidst widespread political attacks from right-wing figures and the Trump administration, who threatened to withhold federal funding from California for allowing trans athletes to compete in girls‚Äô sports. The California Interscholastic Federation recently changed its rules to award the same place and medal to the athlete finishing behind a transgender athlete in a girls‚Äô event. Hernandez's participation has drawn national attention, with the Justice Department investigating the federation and school district for potential sex-discrimination law violations.</p>

Roth acknowledged criticisms of higher education, such as a lack of intellectual diversity, but argued that improvements should come through convincing faculty and students, not through conforming to the ideology of those in power.
