          <p>Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the primary commuter rail system in the San Francisco Bay Area, shut down all trains for several hours on Friday morning due to a computer networking problem, disrupting the commute for over 170,000 passengers. The issue, related to powering the train control system, affected all 50 stations, causing major delays even after service resumed. This outage comes as BART struggles to regain ridership following the Covid-19 pandemic, with passenger traffic remaining significantly below pre-pandemic levels due to remote work trends.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to bring the first group of white South Africans, classified as refugees, to the United States, citing racial persecution in South Africa. Government officials will be present at Washington Dulles International Airport to mark their arrival, with 54 Afrikaners expected on a charter flight from Johannesburg. This move contrasts sharply with the suspension of most other refugee admissions, and the South African government disputes the U.S. claim that Afrikaners qualify for refugee status, calling the resettlement politically motivated and questioning South Africa‚Äôs democracy.</p>

          <p>The Army will implement new fitness standards on June 1, featuring the same requirements for both men and women in combat roles. The updated test includes deadlifts, hand-release push-ups, planks, a two-mile run, and the sprint-drag-carry, designed to assess strength, speed, endurance, and core stability. Fitness experts recommend the test as a comprehensive gauge of overall fitness, balancing various physical capabilities. The minimum passing scores, such as deadlifting 150 pounds and holding a plank for 1 minute 20 seconds, provide good targets for anyone seeking to improve their physical condition.</p>

This statement followed reports citing multiple sources claiming Hudson had been barred from the football building, with the university criticized for not fulfilling Freedom of Information Act requests related to her involvement.

          <p>Despite widespread nostalgia for factory jobs, bringing them back to the U.S. is challenging due to automation and trade policies. While 80% of Americans believe the country would be better off with more manufacturing jobs, these positions now offer lower salaries compared to other sectors, and automation reduces the need for human labor. President Trump's proposed tariffs are unlikely to significantly increase manufacturing employment, and immigration policies could exacerbate labor shortages. The article suggests focusing on improving the quality of jobs in other sectors, such as Amazon warehouse work, to provide similar benefits and stability.</p>

          <h2>Apartment Renter Behavior Shifts, Impacting Landlords</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apartment renters are renewing their leases at unusually high rates, leading to a "striking" low turnover in large urban markets. This trend is attributed to factors such as an unaffordable for-sale market, limited rental supply, economic uncertainty, moving costs, and a preference for suburban apartments. As a result, landlords are benefiting from better pricing on renewals and improved cash flow due to reduced turnover costs. Real estate analysts favor multifamily REITs like Essex Property Trust and Equity Residential, while expressing caution about the Sunbelt market.</p>

          <h2>Trump's UK Trade Deal Signals Tariffs Are Here to Stay</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 11:51:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and UK have reached a trade deal that sends a clear message that tariffs are here to stay under President Trump. Despite Britain's "special relationship" with the U.S., the agreement includes a 10% baseline tariff on most goods imported from the U.K., and it allows the U.K. to export 100,000 vehicles each year at a 10% rate, with any additional vehicles facing 25% duties. This signals that tariffs of at least 10% are the best deal other countries can expect, as indicated by Trump himself.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport lost radar and communication with aircraft in another 90-second outage, prompting renewed calls for modernization of the air traffic control system. The outage occurred before dawn, impacting the Philadelphia facility responsible for guiding planes in and out of Newark's airspace.
