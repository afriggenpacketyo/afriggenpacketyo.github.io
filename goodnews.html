          <p>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has announced that the remains of Army Air Forces 1st Lt. Charles W. McCook, 23, of Georgetown, Texas, have been identified 82 years after his death during World War II. McCook was the armor-gunner on a B-25C "Mitchell" that crashed during a bombing raid over Meiktila, Burma, on August 3, 1943. Before the crash, McCook's actions allowed two other soldiers to parachute from the craft before it crashed, and one of the survivors credited McCook with saving his life. McCook will be buried in his hometown in August 2025, with a rosette placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing.</p>

          <p>The average 401(k) savings rate, encompassing both employee and company contributions, reached a new record high of 14.3% in the first quarter of 2025, according to Fidelity's analysis. This milestone brings the savings rate closer to Fidelity's recommended 15% savings target for retirement. Increased employee deferrals, largely driven by auto-escalation features, contributed to this growth. Financial experts emphasize the importance of saving enough to secure one's desired lifestyle in retirement and maximizing employer matching contributions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a massive planet orbiting a small red dwarf star, a pairing that challenges existing theories of planet formation. The planet, named TOI-6894b, has a radius slightly larger than Saturn but only half its mass, orbiting its star in just over three days. This discovery raises questions about how such a small star could host a giant planet, as current theories suggest low-mass stars lack the necessary gas and dust for planet formation. The planet is also unusually cold, offering potential opportunities for atmospheric observations.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging continued surveillance of norovirus outbreaks due to the emergence of a new strain, GII.17, which caused an unusually early start to last year's norovirus season. The new strain displaced the previously dominant GII.4, raising concerns about whether norovirus season could arrive early again. Several other countries also experienced unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus infections after GII.17 surged to dominance.
