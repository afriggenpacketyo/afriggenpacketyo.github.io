          <p>Rio Takeda, a 22-year-old Japanese golfer, secured a share of the lead at the U.S. Women's Open with a 4-under 68 in the first round. Takeda's impressive performance included six birdies, positioning her in a six-way tie with other international players. Fellow Japanese golfers Chisato Iwai, Nasa Hataoka, and Yui Kawamoto are closely trailing, adding to Japan's strong presence in the tournament. Defending champion Yuka Saso had a slower start, aiming for her third U.S. Open title in five years. The leaderboard is tightly packed, setting the stage for competitive rounds ahead, with many players within striking distance of the lead. Optimism is high among Japanese fans as Takeda and her compatriots aim for victory on the challenging Erin Hills course.

          <p>A Harris's hawk, notorious for dive-bombing residents in Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has been given a permanent home by a local falconer. The hawk, dubbed "Bomber Harris," had attacked around 50 people, leading to injuries and disrupted postal services. Falconer Wayne Housden captured and trained the bird, observing that its aggressive behavior was likely due to hormonal or territorial reasons. Housden invested in building an aviary for the hawk and plans to feature it at the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival, and he intends to eventually let it fly freely, hoping it will return. The falconer believes the hawk was a captive-bred bird that had been lost by its owner, and he is committed to providing it with a stable and caring environment.</p>

          <p>This article explores seven interesting facts about Elon Musk, from his early days as a child video game creator to his role as an inspiration for Iron Man. At age 12, Musk created the video game Blastar, and later co-founded Zip2, which sold for $300 million. He also launched a perfume called Burnt Hair and was the original founder of X.com, which later became PayPal. Moreover, Musk's persona influenced Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark, and while he didn't start Tesla, he propelled it to global success. Musk's ambition to create an "everything app" is now being realized through X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Dallas, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee after overcoming a moment of overconfidence during the competition. Zaki, who was the runner-up last year, initially misspoke the word "commelina" but recovered to correctly spell the winning word, "eclaircissement." Despite the near flub, Zaki's joyful and enthusiastic approach to spelling ultimately led him to victory in the bee's 100th anniversary.

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the vital role of UK saltmarshes as carbon sinks, locking away greenhouse gases in layers of mud. The charity is advocating for these tidal habitats to be included in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. Saltmarshes, which have seen significant losses due to agriculture, are now recognized as crucial in the fight against climate change. Researchers have installed monitoring stations on restored saltmarshes to measure carbon dioxide absorption, demonstrating their importance in climate mitigation alongside trees.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has initiated its first deliberations in 28 years on legislation that would allow married couples to choose different surnames. Despite growing public support, the passage of these bills during the current Diet session appears unlikely due to reluctance from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP has concerns that the change could harm family cohesion and traditional values. Opposition parties have submitted separate bills with varying approaches, including allowing couples to choose surnames and determining children's surnames upon marriage. A Kyodo News poll indicated that 71 percent of respondents support the dual family-name system.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly entering into mega drug-licensing deals with multinational companies, driven by cost savings and depressed valuations. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group's potential multibillion-dollar deal is the latest example of this trend, which involves licensing development rights for innovative medicines. Many deals utilize a "newco structure," combining intellectual property licensing with fundraising through a newly established corporate vehicle. This trend is expected to continue, with both the number and value of deals exceeding previous years. The move offers an alternative to raising funds by selling shares amid challenging market conditions.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions brought by the agency. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signals a shift in regulatory approach, especially as the Trump administration aims to be more crypto-friendly.

          <p>The White House acknowledged that there are formatting issues in the federal government report spearheaded by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which decried America's food supply, pesticides and prescription drugs, and that the report will be updated. The report cited hundreds of studies, but some of those studies did not actually exist. The White House stated that they have complete confidence in Kennedy and described the report as a "historic and transformative assessment" to understand the chronic disease epidemic afflicting the nation's children. Minor citation and formatting errors have been corrected.</p>
