          <p>NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has shared a theory that the recent Blue Origin space flight, which featured an all-female crew including Katy Perry and Jeff Bezos's fiancee Lauren Sanchez, was actually filmed using green screen technology. O'Neal cited discrepancies in a video released by Blue Origin, such as the luxurious hair of the crew members not moving in space and the key to the landing module already in the open position. O'Neal jokingly suggested the flight was filmed at Universal Studios, but Blue Origin has not yet responded to a request for comment. The article also mentions that several celebrities attended the event, including Oprah, and that Katy Perry described the experience as "second to being a mom."</p>

          <p>NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) are in last-minute negotiations to avert a rail strike, which could impact over 300,000 commuters. The union is seeking pay raises, claiming they haven't had one in five years, while NJ Transit says their last offer was $49.82 an hour. Gov. Phil Murphy may declare a state of emergency if the strike occurs, and NJ Transit has a contingency plan to accommodate 20% of daily riders, including cross-honoring tickets on other transit systems and adding park-and-ride locations. Commuters express support for the union while hoping for a resolution to avoid a strike.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene epoch, when a land bridge connected the two continents due to lower sea levels. Researchers analyzed fossils, including those of Dalianensis horses from northeastern China, and found genetic evidence of multiple migrations across the Bering land bridge between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago. These Dalianensis horses, which lived 17,000 years ago, were slightly larger than existing wild horses and had mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. The study, published in the journal Science, was conducted by researchers from multiple countries.</p>

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court justices have expressed concerns over President Trump's attempt to limit birthright citizenship through an executive order denying citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents aren't citizens or permanent residents. The plan contradicts the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to ‚Äúall persons born or naturalized in the United States‚Äù. The court is also considering the Justice Department's argument that ‚Äúnationwide injunctions‚Äù issued by federal judges unfairly restrict the president's authority, and may narrow the scope of such injunctions.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly engaging in venue shopping, seeking out federal jurisdictions with judges sympathetic to their political views. Conservatives frequently file lawsuits against the Biden administration in small Texas courts with single judges appointed by Republicans, ensuring favorable initial rulings and appeals to the conservative 5th Circuit. Conversely, during Trump's second term, cases have increasingly landed before judges in Massachusetts, a blue district with a liberal appeals court. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country by issuing a nationwide injunction.</p>

These transformations aim to combat the severe depopulation affecting rural Japan by attracting tourists and boosting local economies.

          <p>Come this fall, only older Americans and those with chronic health problems may be urged to get the COVID-19 shot, with the vaccine's availability being uncertain due to new clinical testing requirements. The Department of Health and Human Services has announced that substantial updates to existing vaccines, including those related to seasonal strain changes, may require additional clinical evaluation. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary wants to see vaccines available for high-risk individuals, along with good science and clinical data. Some experts fear these new federal limits are part of a campaign to undermine all vaccines, raising doubts about their safety and imposing requirements that make it untenable for companies to keep making them.</p>

The campus, backed by Abu Dhabi state firm G42, will be operated by American companies and includes commitments from the UAE to align its national security regulations with the U.S. This move signifies a major shift, enabling the UAE to deepen its technology partnership with the U.S. while maintaining trade ties with China.</p>

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly stated the cost will be shared by the Department of the Army and the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission, with President Trump commemorating the Army's birthday with a parade honoring all who have served.

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria caught senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise. The lack of specifics regarding which measures would be rolled back and at what pace left Treasury scrambling to understand the president's intentions. The announcement came as a relief to Syria's transitional government, which has been lobbying for sanctions relief. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision had been discussed for weeks and that the administration will implement the president's announcement. Some work was underway at Treasury before the announcement for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports. The contraction exceeded economists' expectations, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Uncertainties stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies have negatively impacted Japan's export-dependent economy. The Bank of Japan had previously warned of a likely moderation in the country's economy due to global trade policy effects. Despite these concerns, the central bank is expected to continue raising its policy rate, citing the country's inflation rate surpassing the 2% target.</p>

It reduced its upper estimate for the number of assisted deaths in the first year from 787 to 647.</p>
