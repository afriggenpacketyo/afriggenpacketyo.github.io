        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for an ambitious youth migration agreement with the European Union, aiming to bolster economic growth ahead of the autumn Budget. She has urged the Office for Budget Responsibility to incorporate the potential positive financial impacts of such a scheme into its official forecasts. The proposal, which would allow young people to work in the UK for a limited period, faces criticism from opponents who view it as a partial return to freedom of movement following Brexit. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to improve the UK's public finances without resorting to major tax increases.</p>

          <p>According to internal metrics, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's social media accounts achieved a greater daily reach this summer than the viewership of news networks MSNBC and CNN. The agency's unconventional strategy, which includes memes and traditional patriotic imagery, generated millions of daily impressions across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and X. This approach, part of a recruitment campaign for ICE agents, has seen a dramatic increase in engagement compared to the previous administration. Despite criticism from some media outlets, DHS plans to continue its assertive social media posture.</p>

          <p>State fairs, a cherished American tradition, have evolved significantly since the first one was held in Syracuse, New York, in 1841. Originally established as agricultural competitions for farmers to showcase livestock and crops, fairs now function as large-scale cultural festivals with live music, amusement rides, and a vast array of fried foods. Despite this transformation into pop-up theme parks, the events retain their agricultural core, continuing to celebrate local crafts, produce, and rural heritage. This article traces their history and highlights how they remain a vital part of the U.S. economy and culture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The urban planning philosophy long championed by King Charles is now influencing the UK government's strategy for a new generation of towns in England. His ideas, which prioritize traditional design, walkable communities, and harmony with the local environment, were once considered controversial but are now becoming mainstream. A housing ministry official confirmed that upcoming new towns will feature "gentle density" like terraced housing rather than high-rises, aligning with the King's vision demonstrated in projects like Poundbury. This shift marks a significant validation of his decades-long advocacy for more humane and sustainable architecture.</p>

          <p>As Beijing prepares to host a global summit on women's rights, China's foreign ministry is emphasizing the nation's significant advancements in gender equality and female empowerment. A ministry spokesman stated that China is not just an advocate but an active participant in promoting women's development. The statement comes as President Xi Jinping recently published books containing his speeches on topics including gender equality and traditional family values. However, sources indicate that domestic, non-sponsored NGOs are unlikely to be invited to the upcoming international event, raising questions about the scope of participation.</p>

          <p>A specialist UK Ministry of Defence unit, known as the "war detectives," has successfully identified the remains of two Scottish soldiers killed over a century ago during World War One.

          <p>Saturday's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada represents a clash of two vastly different models for supporting women's sports. England, the world's top-ranked team, benefits from full-time professional contracts and the world's best domestic league, backed by millions in funding from its union. In contrast, second-ranked Canada relies on a squad of semi-professional players, many of whom play in England, and had to crowdfund part of their World Cup preparations. The outcome of the match is seen as a critical test case that could influence future investment in women's rugby globally.</p>
