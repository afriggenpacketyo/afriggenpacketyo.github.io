        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The producer price index, measuring wholesale prices, unexpectedly decreased by 0.1% in August, offering potential relief for the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision. This decline contrasts with expectations of a 0.3% increase and follows a revised 0.7% rise in July, with core PPI also dipping by 0.1%. The drop in service prices, particularly trade services, contributed significantly to the overall decrease in wholesale inflation. Despite inflation remaining above the Fed's 2% target, officials anticipate easing pressures from housing and wages to gradually lower prices. (not investment advice)</p>

While the Office for Students welcomes the move, the University and College Union anticipates potential redundancies. The universities assure minimal disruption for current students, with degrees still awarded under the original names, and plan to reduce senior roles to save costs.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy, plans to cut approximately 9,000 jobs, around 11.5% of its global workforce, to simplify its organization and improve decision-making. This transformation aims to reallocate resources towards growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity treatments, incurring a one-off cost of 8 billion Danish kroner. The move follows CEO Maziar Mike Doustdar's appointment and aims to address increased competition and supply chain issues, while shares rose 4.1% following the announcement. The company is working to defend its leadership in diabetes and obesity treatment and realign its cost base.</p>

A historian's report claims Weleda ordered raw materials from a garden in the Dachau camp and produced a cream used in alleged human experiments. While a 2023 report found no evidence of the cream being tested on prisoners in freezing conditions, Weleda acknowledges the need for further investigation. The company expects results from the new investigation by the Society for Corporate History in early 2027.</p>

          <p>Three 1,200-year-old Viking ships, including the Oseberg, Gokstad, and Tune, are being relocated to a new climate-controlled facility to ensure their preservation for at least another century. The Oseberg is the first to be moved, encased in a protective steel rig and lifted by a crane along a ceiling track. The relocation process is complex, requiring extreme precision to prevent damage to the fragile oak hulls. The ships, discovered in burial sites near Oslo, are significant artifacts of Viking history.</p>

          <p>Mortgage application volume jumped 9.2% last week, reaching the highest level in three years, driven by a sharp decline in interest rates. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased to 6.49%, spurring a 12% increase in refinance applications. Applications for home purchases also rose 7%, reaching the highest level since July, with adjustable-rate mortgages seeing increased interest. Two key inflation reports are expected this week, which will likely influence market movements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire are using decades of songbird territory maps to track changes in the forest ecosystem. Researchers have been mapping songbird territories since 1969, providing insights into habitat quality and forest health. The territory maps have revealed shifts in bird populations, indicating how the aging forest has changed over time. Digitizing these maps has enabled new analyses, revealing that birds divide habitat equally, contributing to stable populations.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli is under scrutiny for his recent performances, with some questioning his place in the team following the arrival of new players. Critics believe Martinelli is overthinking and lacking confidence, impacting his attacking output. While he had a solid season with 10 goals and six assists, it may not be enough for a team competing for the title. A change in Arsenal's style, focusing on control and build-up, may also not suit Martinelli's strengths, but a more direct style could benefit his speed and transitional play.</p>
