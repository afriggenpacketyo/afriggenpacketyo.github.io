          <p>Japan's tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, pressed the U.S. Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, to reconsider the higher import duties imposed by Washington during their recent meeting. Akazawa is in the U.S. for ongoing tariff talks aimed at reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, hoping to pave the way for a leaders' meeting in mid-June. Japan is seeking the elimination of the higher tariffs but is also considering accepting a rate cut, though the U.S. resists a full removal of the duties. The discussions covered trade cooperation, non-tariff barriers, and economic security, as both countries aim to deepen mutual understanding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University accepting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that Harvard would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were enforced. The order responds to Harvard's lawsuit accusing President Trump of a "government vendetta" to stifle free speech. Trump has argued the ban is necessary for national security, alleging Harvard hasn't done enough to combat antisemitism on campus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the growing trend of consumers seeking food products with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). Retailers and brands are responding by offering simpler products, but nutritionists caution against prioritizing ingredient lists over nutritional value. They note that some fortified foods with longer ingredient lists can be beneficial for public health. The piece explores the complexities of food processing and the need for consumers to consider overall nutrition rather than solely focusing on the number of ingredients. </p>

          <p>China has tested core components of quantum-based network in space to withstand the rigors of space travel. The experiment is believed to be the start of efforts to build an integrated space-ground system for ultra-secure communications that do not need encryption keys. A laser module and a phase encoding device were on board a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket that reached 2.5km during a two-minute vertical flight testing its reusability. The test marked a key step in China‚Äôs transition from experimental validation to the construction of a fully integrated space-air-ground quantum secure direct communication network.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles is warning residents about a fake online advertisement offering discounted vehicle registration renewals. The deceptive ad, posing as the DMV on social media, asks for personal information and payment through Cash App. The DMV emphasizes that it never requests personal information or payment through unofficial channels. Residents are advised to renew their vehicle registration directly through the official DMV website, a DMV kiosk, or by making an appointment at a DMV office to avoid the scam.</p>

          <p>Under new regulations to be published this year, the majority of new build homes in England will be required to be fitted with solar panels. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the move was "just common sense," and would save the typical household ¬£500 a year on their energy bills. Developers will be required to add panels unless the buildings fall under certain exemptions such as being covered by shade. The government says it will be published in autumn but there will be a transitional period for developers to adjust to the regulation changes.</p>
