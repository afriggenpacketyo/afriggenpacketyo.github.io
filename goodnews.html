          <p>SK Hynix, a South Korean memory chipmaker, has announced its readiness for mass production of next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM4) chips, positioning itself ahead of competitors like Samsung and Micron. These HBM chips are essential for AI computing, especially in Nvidia's chipsets, with SK Hynix being a major supplier to Nvidia. The HBM4 chips boast doubled bandwidth and a 40% increase in power efficiency compared to the previous generation, making them suitable for Nvidia's upcoming Rubin architecture. This development has led to a surge in SK Hynix's stock, reflecting investor confidence in the company's continued dominance in the HBM market, which is expected to account for a significant portion of its revenue.

          <p>Amazon is intensifying its competition with SpaceX's Starlink in the satellite internet market, securing its first contract to provide in-flight WiFi to JetBlue starting in 2027. Despite having a significantly smaller number of satellites in orbit compared to Starlink, Amazon's Project Kuiper is gaining momentum in a market expected to grow substantially. The satellite internet provision market is heating up, with global operators planning to launch approximately 70,000 LEO satellites between 2025 and 2031, with the mainstream use case for satellite internet technology to be the upcoming 6G communications. The expansion of LEO satellite services is likely to benefit the 2.5 billion people worldwide who lack internet access, along with users in remote and underserved regions. (not investment advice)</p>
