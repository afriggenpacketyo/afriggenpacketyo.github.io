          <p>A review of the live-action remake of "How to Train Your Dragon" finds the new version lacking the charm and magic of the original animated film. While the story of Hiccup and Toothless remains compelling, the remake is criticized for being longer and less visually stunning. The film's message of empathy and questioning assumptions is still relevant, but the transformation from cartoons to human cartoons offers little gain. The reviewer notes that the film's attempt at naturalism results in dark and cluttered visuals, ultimately making the remake inessential and less emotionally resonant.
