          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has named George Tidmarsh, a seasoned biotech executive and Stanford professor, as the new director of its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. This key division oversees the approval of most new prescription and over-the-counter drugs. The appointment comes amidst significant changes at the FDA under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose leadership has caused concern in the scientific community. Tidmarsh's extensive industry background is seen as a potentially stabilizing force, and his past statements suggest a more stringent approach to drug regulation.</p>

          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share by attracting budget-conscious diners amidst industry-wide struggles. The company reported a 3.4% increase in U.S. same-store sales, attributing the growth to its new stuffed crust pizza and value-oriented promotions that resonated with customers across all income levels. CEO Russell Weiner stated that while other restaurants offer deals on less desirable items, Domino's provides value on products consumers actually want. Despite this success, the company's earnings missed expectations due to a charge related to its investment in its China licensee.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 13:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As college costs continue to escalate, many students rely on federal loans, which offer specific borrower protections but also have strict borrowing caps. For dependent undergraduates, the lifetime limit is $31,000, while independent undergraduates can borrow up to $57,500. Graduate and professional students have a higher aggregate limit of $138,500, including any undergraduate loans. Since these amounts may not cover the full cost of attendance, students often need to seek private loans to bridge the financial gap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new company, The Ether Machine, is set to trade on the Nasdaq with the goal of becoming the largest public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Unlike other crypto treasury firms that simply hold assets, this company plans to actively generate returns through staking, a process that contributes to the Ethereum network's security and operations. Co-founder Andrew Keys argues that this makes ether a more productive asset than bitcoin, as staking provides a yield similar to a dividend. The firm's strategy reflects growing institutional interest in ether, especially following new U.S. crypto regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average daily phone use exceeding four hours, smartphone addiction is a growing concern linked to mental health issues like depression and anxiety. Scientific research suggests that overcoming this behavioral addiction requires a multi-faceted approach rather than a single quick fix. Recommended strategies include creating physical distance from the device, such as leaving it out of the bedroom, and reducing its appeal by turning off notifications or setting the screen to black-and-white. For deeper-rooted issues, therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help address the underlying causes of the compulsive behavior.</p>

          <p>Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, has purchased approximately $2 billion in bitcoin and related securities.

CEO Devin Nunes stated the bitcoin treasury will help ensure the company's financial freedom and protect it from potential discrimination by financial institutions. The purchase aligns with President Trump's increasing focus on digital assets, including the recent signing of a major crypto regulation bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent survey found that Americans, on average, believe they would need a net worth of $839,000 to feel financially comfortable. However, some financial experts argue that net worth can be a misleading indicator of financial well-being. They suggest that focusing on cash flow—the movement of money in and out of one's life—provides a more practical and dynamic picture of financial health. Financial comfort is achieved when money management aligns with personal values and goals, rather than hitting an arbitrary numerical target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has recommended that YouTube give greater prominence to content from public service broadcasters (PSBs) like the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4. The watchdog warned that the future of public service media is at risk because young audiences spend significantly more time on YouTube than watching traditional broadcast content. Ofcom's report suggests that PSBs must work with YouTube to ensure their material is easy to find, and it proposes that the government consider legislation to enforce this. The goal is to help tackle a serious threat to the UK's broadcasting ecosystem.</p>
