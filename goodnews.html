Huang described the deal as "imaginative, unique and surprising," especially given AMD's prior excitement about its next-generation products. This partnership, involving OpenAI committing to purchase 6 gigawatts of AMD chips, challenges Nvidia's dominant position in the AI chip market. Nvidia itself recently announced plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, highlighting the intense competition and strategic investments shaping the future of artificial intelligence infrastructure.

          <p>Amazon is set to introduce "pharmacy kiosks" in December, allowing One Medical patients to pick up prescribed medications directly at doctor's offices, bypassing traditional pharmacies. Initially launching in several Los Angeles locations, the self-service machines will carry hundreds of common medications, including antibiotics and inhalers. This initiative aims to remove barriers to treatment by enabling patients to receive medications within minutes of their appointment, after creating an Amazon Pharmacy account and paying via the app. The company plans a broader rollout in 2026, envisioning expanded access to quick medication in various environments.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a lawsuit challenging an Illinois law that permits mailed-in absentee ballots postmarked by election day to be counted up to two weeks later. The case, brought by Republican Representative Mike Bost, contends this practice unconstitutionally extends the election period. Lower courts dismissed Bost's suit for lack of standing, a ruling his appeal disputes by arguing campaign staffing costs past election day constitute a financial injury. The ACLU, while opposing Bost's position on the merits, supports his appeal on the standing issue, emphasizing its importance for civil rights groups.</p>

          <p>For the first time on record, global solar and wind power generation has collectively exceeded coal power, according to an Ember analysis. Solar generation grew by a record 31% and wind by 7.7% in the first half of the year, outpacing the increase in overall electricity demand. This "turning point" suggests the world can transition from fossil fuels despite rising electricity needs, with China and India leading the green energy transition. However, the U.S. and Europe saw increased fossil fuel generation, partly due to the Trump administration's policies and funding cuts to climate projects in blue states.</p>

          <p>Columbia University archaeologist Kristina Douglass received a prestigious $800,000 MacArthur Fellowship for her work on how past human societies adapted to climate variability, focusing on southwest Madagascar. Douglass studies ancient artifacts and animal remains, revealing strategies like diverse social networks, flexible livelihoods, and mobility used by the Malagasy people to cope with environmental changes. Her research challenges assumptions that Indigenous communities degrade environments, advocating for their role as biodiversity stewards. Douglass believes these historical insights, passed through generations via various cultural channels, offer crucial lessons for contemporary climate adaptation and community building, emphasizing joy and celebration as integral to resilience.</p>

          <p>Nabarun Dasgupta, a University of North Carolina researcher, has been awarded a MacArthur "genius" fellowship for his groundbreaking work on America's overdose crisis. Dasgupta was among the first to identify a significant decline in fatal overdoses since 2021, offering a rare hopeful shift. His research extends beyond data analysis to developing harm reduction programs, including a national network for analyzing street drugs and distributing naloxone, credited with saving thousands of lives. Despite political attacks on harm reduction, Dasgupta emphasizes its ethical necessity and effectiveness, viewing it as a problem-solving strategy rooted in the dignity of all lives.</p>

The company aims to mimic traditional tastes and textures while significantly reducing agriculture's environmental impact, as fats contribute 7% of greenhouse gas emissions. While their lab-grown butter is chemically closer to cow butter than vegan alternatives, commercial products are not expected until at least 2029. Savor plans to partner with food brands, facing challenges in affordability and investor confidence in food tech.</p>

Former captain Steven Gerrard described them as "egotistical losers" hindered by club rivalries and a lack of team connection. The article explores various factors cited by players and pundits, including tactical shortcomings under managers like Sven-Goran Eriksson, who struggled to integrate top midfielders. Additionally, issues such as injury problems, psychological pressure from penalty shootouts, and team camp boredom contributed to their underperformance, with many acknowledging that other nations simply had stronger squads.</p>

          <p>A bizarre discovery in the Netherlands saw two century-old hand grenades, dating from 1925, found hidden within a consignment of French onions destined for a factory in Zeeland. Dutch authorities enlisted the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to examine the projectiles. The OPCW confirmed they were consistent with pre-1925 French and German manufactured chemical weapons, though the specific chemical fill could not be identified. The mystery behind their presence remains unsolved. The grenades will be safely destroyed in a specialized facility in Belgium, as the Netherlands lacks the necessary infrastructure for such disposal.</p>
