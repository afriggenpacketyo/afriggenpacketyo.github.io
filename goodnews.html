          <p>William Goodge, a British ultra-endurance athlete, claims to have broken the world record for the fastest run across Australia, completing the 3,800km journey in 35 days. Goodge ran from Cottesloe Beach in Perth to Bondi Beach, averaging about 100km per day, to raise money for cancer charities in memory of his mother. The record is yet to be verified by Guinness World Records, but Goodge says he endured a dust storm, injuries, and hallucinations during the run. Some in the running community have questioned the accuracy of data tracking his speed and heart rate over the course of the run.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's announcement of a $9.1 billion credit line, infrastructure investments, and visa waivers for several Latin American countries underscores China's increasing influence in the region. This move is contrasted with President Trump's policies, such as tariff increases, foreign aid cuts, and immigration restrictions, which are perceived negatively in Latin America. Xi Jinping is positioning China as a more reliable partner for the region, advocating for free trade and multilateralism, while Trump's administration focuses on issues like crime, drugs, and illegal immigration. The article notes that China's approach is seen as a more positive and cooperative strategy compared to Trump's perceived disregard for the region.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has defended farm minister Taku Eto despite criticism over his remarks about receiving plenty of rice from supporters and not needing to buy any, amidst rising rice prices. Eto apologized for the insensitive comments, which were made at a fundraising event, but Ishiba stated that Eto should continue working to address agricultural challenges. Opposition parties have called for Eto's resignation, arguing that he is out of touch with the public's concerns regarding the high cost of the staple food. The controversy comes as the ruling coalition considers measures to mitigate the impact of inflation and higher U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>Japan's animation industry is increasingly adopting AI technology despite concerns among artists about copyright infringement and job losses. Japan's copyright act is more permissive than those in the EU or the US, allowing the use of copyrighted materials to train AI tools without the copyright holder's consent. The anime industry faces a labor shortage due to unattractive working conditions, making AI a potential solution to fill the gap. While some artists worry about losing their jobs, others view AI as a supporting tool that can save time and effort in the production process. Japan has been promoting its unique cultural productions ‚Äî and anime is part of those noteworthy soft power exports.</p>

          <p>Israel has acquired a trove of documents and personal effects belonging to Eli Cohen, a famous Israeli spy who was executed in Syria in 1965. The collection includes 2,500 items, such as photographs, letters, and information about his final moments, retrieved from Syria in a joint operation with an allied foreign government. Cohen's intelligence gathering in Syria in the early 1960s is credited with helping Israel win the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. The announcement comes as Syria attempts to reintegrate into the international community. Israel hopes to eventually recover Cohen's remains for proper burial.</p>

The Red Bull car excels in high-speed corners, while McLaren performs better when rear-tire degradation is a significant factor. Red Bull has introduced upgrades to its car recently, and McLaren has not, which has contributed to the shifting performance. The track layout is also a contributing factor. The article analyzes why Max Verstappen has been winning in what people are calling an 'inferior car'.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is set to initiate offshore "blue carbon" research aimed at capturing carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and storing it in the deep sea. The initiative hopes these plants will play a key role in mitigating climate change, as CO2 is highly soluble in water, and marine vegetation grows by absorbing dissolved CO2. The study will involve the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Eneos Corp., and others, assessing the behavior of seaweed at significant depths and the environmental impact of such projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon, compared with some 34 tons absorbed by coastal plants in fiscal 2023.</p>

His productions, such as "The Stone Flower" and "Ivan the Terrible," redefined Soviet ballet. His departure from the Bolshoi in 1995 led to the first dancers' strike in the theatre's history.</p>

The law strengthens penalties against managers and operators of illicit host clubs, increasing imprisonment terms and fines. This law is intended to protect vulnerable women from exploitation.</p>

          <p>A memorial bust of Jim Morrison, the lead singer of The Doors, that was stolen from his grave in Paris's P√®re-Lachaise cemetery 37 years ago has been recovered. The bust was discovered during an unrelated financial investigation by French police. The statue, carved by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin, was placed at the grave to mark the 10th anniversary of Morrison's death but disappeared in 1988. The recovered statue is missing its mouth and nose, as it was before the theft. It remains unclear if the bust will be returned to the grave.</p>
