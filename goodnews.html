          <p>Tesla has applied for permits to test and deploy its robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, a market currently dominated by Google's Waymo. The move follows a pilot program in Austin, Texas, where the company uses human safety supervisors. Tesla's approach relies heavily on cameras rather than more expensive sensors like lidar, which it claims will make its autonomous vehicles more economically viable. The expansion comes amid regulatory scrutiny following several documented incidents of its robotaxis violating traffic rules in Austin.</p>

          <p>Space manufacturing startup Varda has raised $187 million in a Series C funding round to expand its efforts in producing pharmaceuticals in orbit. The company's mission is based on the premise that the microgravity environment of space allows for the creation of superior drug crystallizations that are difficult to achieve on Earth. Varda has already conducted successful launches and is the first company to process materials outside the International Space Station. The new capital will be used to increase flight frequency and build out its biologics lab for identifying suitable drug molecules.</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts jury has found Karen Read not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe. She was, however, convicted on a lesser charge of driving under the influence. The high-profile retrial concluded after prosecutors argued Read struck O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die, while the defense claimed she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement. The verdict follows a previous trial that ended in a hung jury, concluding a case that drew intense national attention.</p>

Other cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, also saw gains, with crypto-related stocks like Coinbase and Mara Holdings advancing as well.
