          <p>OpenAI has finalized a substantial $6.6 billion secondary share sale, enabling current and former employees to sell stock at a record $500 billion valuation. This significant transaction, the company's second major tender offer in under a year, cements OpenAI's status as the world's most valuable privately held company, now exceeding SpaceX. Despite authorizing more, the actual lower participation is viewed internally as a strong vote of confidence in the company's long-term prospects and sustained investor appetite. This strategic financial maneuver is crucial for retaining top talent and rewarding long-term employees without necessitating an immediate public offering, amidst fierce competition for AI expertise.

          <p>Chinese researchers are actively testing and training robotic dogs within a unique cave system near Jingbo Lake, Heilongjiang province, which strikingly resembles the moon's underground environment. These advanced robotic scouts are being prepared for crucial roles in future lunar exploration, particularly for navigating and surveying sections of lava tubes that are inaccessible to human personnel. This pioneering initiative aims to significantly advance embodied intelligence technologies vital for deep-space exploration, bolstering China's capabilities in uncrewed scientific missions. The article underscores the strategic importance of this research in laying groundwork for potential human lunar bases and expanding our understanding of the cosmos.</p>

          <p>Bridget Phillipson, the UK Education Secretary and a Labour deputy leadership candidate, has publicly stated that the two-child benefit cap has had a "devastating impact," signaling a potential move by the government to lift the controversial policy. Introduced by the Conservatives, this cap prevents households on universal or child tax credit from receiving payments for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. Phillipson, who leads the child poverty task force, stressed the "real urgency" in tackling increasing child poverty rates, arguing that children should not be penalized for factors beyond their control.
