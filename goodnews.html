          <p>In a humorous commentary, Arwa Mahdawi pleads with strangers to stop asking if her wife is her twin sister, especially during Pride month. Despite writing about this issue in the past, the questions have persisted, even after getting married and having a child. Mahdawi speculates whether the increased inquiries are due to aging similarities or the move from New York to Philadelphia, where people are perceived as less filtered. The author jokingly suggests that some heterosexuals should practice self-censorship during Pride month.</p>

          <p>Homeowners are finding ways to save on insurance premiums by upgrading their houses to better withstand disasters like hurricanes and wildfires. States are developing insurance discount programs, modeled after Alabama's FORTIFIED Roof standard, to incentivize homeowners to use stronger building materials. While discounts in states like California are smaller, the overall goal is to reduce the risk of damage from extreme weather events. Experts emphasize the importance of community-wide retrofitting and insurance companies accounting for these improvements in their coverage models.</p>
