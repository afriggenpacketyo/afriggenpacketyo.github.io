          <h2>Supreme Court Halts Trump Administration's Deportation of Venezuelan Migrants Under Alien Enemies Act</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, citing insufficient notice for the deportees to challenge their removals. The court's order vacates a lower court's judgment and remands the case, emphasizing the need for adequate notice while acknowledging national security interests. The ACLU had argued that the migrants, classified as members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, were being deported within 24 hours without a realistic opportunity for judicial relief. The court did not address the legality of using the Alien Enemies Act for these deportations, focusing instead on due process concerns.</p>

          <p>Months after the Los Angeles County fires sent toxic materials into the ocean, public agencies and scientists are assessing the ongoing threat to beachgoers' health. While tests have not found levels of fire-related contamination likely to pose health risks, the ecological damage is unprecedented and exceeds the capacity to accurately measure beach pollution. Existing seawater safety testing is designed for sewage, not fire debris, and lacks clear health guidelines for exposure to heavy metals and chemicals. Health officials are working to translate findings into public recommendations, acknowledging the lack of clear-cut answers and the need for better disaster preparedness.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump launched a series of social media attacks targeting the Supreme Court, fellow Republicans, and celebrities like Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift. He criticized Springsteen for speaking negatively about him abroad, accused the Supreme Court of being "played," and claimed Taylor Swift was "no longer 'HOT'" since he expressed dislike for her. The posts reflect Trump's focus shifting back to domestic issues amid political challenges and personal grievances. These attacks showcase Trump's willingness to lash out at perceived enemies in both politics and culture.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case concerning birthright citizenship and the use of nationwide injunctions, with the Trump administration seeking to end birthright citizenship via executive order. The government struggled to explain how it would implement such a policy, leading to questions about the practicality and constitutionality of the order. The case highlights the debate over the power of a single federal judge to block presidential policies and the potential for a patchwork implementation of laws if nationwide injunctions are limited. The justices considered the balance between executive power and the protection of individual rights.</p>

While other blood tests have been available without FDA approval, this clearance signals a stricter federal oversight of Alzheimer's diagnostics.
