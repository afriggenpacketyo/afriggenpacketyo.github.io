        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite facing significant tariffs due to the closure of a trade loophole, experts believe Temu and Shein are well-positioned to remain competitive in the U.S. e-commerce market. These companies have been preparing for this change by accelerating localization strategies, including onboarding American sellers onto their platforms to avoid tariffs. Temu has already begun offering goods shipped from local warehouses to U.S. shoppers, while Shein is expanding its supply chain to countries like Turkey and Brazil. Experts note that Temu and Shein's ability to offer products at significantly lower prices than competitors, even with increased tariffs, will allow them to maintain a competitive edge.

          <p>In response to President Trump's call for tariffs on movies filmed overseas, California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to support the entertainment industry. This proposal aims to counter the trend of film and television production moving to states and countries with more generous incentives. The industry has been seeking federal assistance in the form of tax credits, with concerns that tariffs would cause more harm than good. The proposal highlights the ongoing debate over how to support domestic film production and address the challenges posed by international competition.</p>
