          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk appeared together in the Oval Office as Musk concludes his role as a "special government employee," according to the CBS News article. Musk, who led the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is returning to the private sector but will continue advising the president. During his tenure, Musk aimed to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget but achieved savings of approximately $160 billion, facing criticism over errors in documenting spending cuts. Musk publicly disagreed with Trump's domestic policy package, citing concerns about its impact on the budget deficit, even as Trump praised his work heading DOGE.</p>

          <p>U.S. airlines are competing for dominance in the international business-class market by offering luxurious amenities such as caviar and high-end headphones, according to the CNBC article. American Airlines is introducing upgraded business-class "suites" with sliding doors, while United Airlines is creating "Polaris Studio" with ottomans and larger screens. These upgrades aim to attract customers willing to pay more for premium travel experiences, as business-class tickets are significantly more expensive than standard coach. Airlines are investing billions in these luxurious cabins, betting that consumers will continue to prioritize travel experiences despite potential economic downturns. The trend reflects a shift towards higher-end services and amenities in the airline industry.</p>

          <p>Costco exceeded earnings and revenue expectations for its fiscal third quarter, reporting an 8% year-over-year sales increase, yet shares fell slightly, according to the CNBC article. The company's leaders noted that tariffs have led to higher costs and supply chain adjustments, forcing them to tweak their supply chain and, in some cases, raise prices. While Costco does not provide an annual outlook, it has been actively seeking ways to reduce tariff costs and maintain competitive prices. The company has absorbed some tariff-related cost differences while increasing prices on discretionary items. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision emphasized that the Constitution assigns Congress the exclusive power to lay and collect taxes and regulate commerce with foreign nations. The ruling imposes a nationwide permanent injunction blocking the IEEPA tariffs, but the administration has appealed the decision.</p>
