          <p>President Trump and President Xi Jinping had a productive 90-minute discussion, leading to an agreement for U.S. and Chinese officials to meet soon to address the ongoing trade war. Trump noted the call resulted in a positive outcome for both countries and that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent the U.S. in these renewed discussions. The leaders did not discuss issues related to Russia, Ukraine, or Iran, but Trump mentioned Xi invited him and his wife to visit China, an invitation he reciprocated. The trade relationship between the two nations, valued at nearly $600 billion in 2024, has been strained due to tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk responded with "Whatever" on X after President Trump claimed Musk's criticism of the proposed tax bill stemmed from the elimination of EV credits and a nixed NASA appointment. Trump stated that Musk was upset about the removal of electric vehicle mandates, which previously provided substantial subsidies. Musk, who had previously supported Trump's 2024 campaign, has recently criticized the bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" due to concerns about increasing federal deficits. Musk urged to keep EV/solar incentive cuts but to ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously revived a lawsuit filed by an Ohio woman who claimed she experienced reverse discrimination after her employer denied her a promotion because she is straight. The court rejected a federal appeals court ruling that required members of a majority group to meet a higher standard in order for their employment discrimination case to proceed. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the "background circumstances" requirement cannot be reconciled with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The ruling makes it easier to pursue reverse discrimination claims in several states.</p>

Owen suggests that if the MSPB is unable to fulfill its prescribed roles due to political interference, federal courts should step in and hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants.

          <p>With gold prices surging in recent months, investors should consider key questions before investing. It's important to assess whether to wait for a potential price drop, though waiting too long carries risks due to gold's general upward trend.

Investors should also determine a safe investment amount, typically up to 10% of their overall portfolio, adjusting for the current elevated price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Wittgenstein's Philosophy and the Pursuit of Happiness</h2>

          <p>The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein believed that language is inherently limited in conveying subtle truths and subjective experiences, suggesting that words are merely a crude model of the world. Misunderstanding, common in human communication, reduces well-being, and Wittgenstein's philosophy implies that we will never fully comprehend the meaning of our lives through language alone. To transcend these limitations, it is recommended to engage in meditative contemplation, focusing on a single concept to inspire insight. This practice encourages seeking understanding rather than precise answers, recognizing that complex experiences often defy verbal expression.</p>
