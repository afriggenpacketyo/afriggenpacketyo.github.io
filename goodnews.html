          <p>This article analyzes the interest-earning potential of placing $50,000 into either a Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account in the current economic climate. It breaks down scenarios for different time frames, showing that while CDs offer fixed, guaranteed returns, high-yield savings accounts can sometimes earn more due to their variable rates. The analysis concludes that savers must weigh the stability of CDs against the potentially higher but more volatile returns of savings accounts, especially with potential interest rate cuts on the horizon.

          <p>A 39-year-old man, Andrew Barber, was successfully rescued after being lost for nine days in the remote wilderness of British Columbia, Canada. He survived by building a makeshift shelter, drinking pond water, and carving "HELP" on a rock, which helped a rescue helicopter locate him. Barber, who had an above-average understanding of wilderness survival, was found severely dehydrated with a leg injury but has since been released from the hospital. Rescuers noted he was lucky to be found and might not have survived another day.</p>

          <p>Based on the latest government inflation data, policy experts are estimating a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security beneficiaries in 2026. This projected increase, which is slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment from 2025, is intended to help benefits keep pace with rising consumer prices. The official COLA is calculated using inflation data from July, August, and September, so the final figure could change, but current trends point toward this moderate increase for retirees and other beneficiaries.

          <p>Paraguayan government ministers are proposing a new law that would encourage the local assembly of electronic and digital goods using imported components, primarily from China. The plan aims to create jobs and diversify the economy by allowing companies to shift from importing fully assembled products to finishing them in Paraguay. Officials see this as an opportunity to become an attractive assembly hub, capitalizing on trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Chinese and Brazilian goods. The debate over this policy is growing as Paraguay also considers its diplomatic ties with Taiwan versus Beijing.</p>

          <h2>Examining the Safety and Risks of Reverse Mortgages for Seniors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 14:23:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether reverse mortgages are a safe financial option for seniors seeking to supplement their retirement income by tapping into their home equity. It explains that while most reverse mortgages are federally regulated and insured, offering protections, they are not without risks. Homeowners must continue to pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and failure to do so can lead to foreclosure. The loan's growing balance also reduces home equity over time, making it a complex decision that requires careful long-term planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has reportedly made an unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome browser. This move comes after the U.S. Department of Justice proposed that Google divest Chrome as a remedy in the antitrust lawsuit the company recently lost. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, has investor backing for the deal, which would give it control of a critical gateway to the internet. Google has not commented on the offer and has previously described the DOJ's divestiture proposal as a "radical interventionist agenda."</p>
