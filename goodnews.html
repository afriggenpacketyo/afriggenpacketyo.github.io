          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 01:22:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. This strong performance was largely driven by a 3% year-over-year revenue increase in its investment banking division, which helped compensate for a dip in corporate operations. The German lender is navigating challenges from lower interest rates but has benefited from increased European defense spending. However, the bank faces uncertainty from potential U.S. tariffs on EU goods, which could impact Germany's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has announced a plan to provide monthly subsidy vouchers to its aging population, a notable instance of direct fiscal support aimed at boosting consumption. The electronic coupons, valued between 500 and 800 yuan, are intended for seniors with disabilities to help cover costs for services like meal assistance and day care. This policy seeks to alleviate the financial burden on families and stimulate the elderly-care service market. The move is part of a broader strategy to strengthen the social safety net in response to the country's rapidly graying population.</p>

          <p>The private credit industry is increasingly targeting the Asia-Pacific region to capitalize on a growing funding gap as traditional bank lending recedes. Assets under management in Asian private credit have surged to over $62 billion, attracting major global firms to expand their presence. The article highlights that countries like India and Southeast Asia are drawing significant capital, with a focus on sectors such as infrastructure, technology, and renewable energy. While the market offers substantial growth potential, investors face risks including currency volatility and diverse regulatory environments across the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for rigging the Libor interest rate quashed after a decade-long legal battle. The ruling by the U.K. Supreme Court has opened the door for seven other traders jailed for similar offenses to appeal their own convictions. The decision raises significant questions about potential compensation for wrongful imprisonment and has intensified calls for a public inquiry. Critics are demanding scrutiny into the roles senior bank managers and the Serious Fraud Office played during the original investigations following the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's decision to block an executive order from the Trump administration that sought to end birthright citizenship. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the proposed policy, which would deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, is unconstitutional. The panel affirmed that the order violates the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause. This ruling keeps a nationwide injunction in place and moves the contentious issue closer to a potential review by the Supreme Court.</p>

Badenoch's comments come as she seeks to reposition the Conservatives, who are trailing both Labour and Reform UK in polls, and recently reshuffled her shadow cabinet to include party "heavy hitters."</p>

          <p>A new major study suggests that walking 7,000 steps a day can significantly reduce the risk of serious health conditions, presenting a more achievable target than the commonly cited 10,000 steps. The research, published in The Lancet, found this level of activity was linked to a lower risk of dementia, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Researchers noted that the 10,000-step benchmark was not based on scientific evidence but originated from a Japanese marketing campaign in the 1960s. The findings could encourage more people to adopt step-tracking as a practical way to monitor and improve their physical health.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers has made a surprising reversal in his stance on playing a defensive position. After previously insisting on being a full-time designated hitter with the Boston Red Sox, Devers made his debut at first base for the Giants and expressed a newfound preference for it. He stated that playing in the field helps keep him active and prevents him from overthinking his performance at the plate. This marks a significant change for the three-time All-Star, who had publicly rebutted the idea of playing a position other than DH earlier in his career.</p>
