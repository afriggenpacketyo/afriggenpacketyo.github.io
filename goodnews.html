          <p>Comedian Jimmy Kimmel is set to return to his late-night show after being suspended by Disney for comments made about the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. The suspension, which followed threats from the FCC chairman to revoke ABC's broadcast license, sparked a nationwide debate on free speech, drawing criticism from First Amendment advocates and support from hundreds of celebrities. While Disney stated the decision to reinstate the show came after "thoughtful conversations," major affiliate groups like Sinclair have announced they will not air the program's return, replacing it with news programming.</p>

          <p>A loss of libido after major life events like childbirth is a common issue affecting both women and men, according to health experts and personal testimonies. Reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth shared her experience of a dipped sex drive after having her son, emphasizing that open communication with her husband was crucial to overcoming the pressure and negative feelings associated with intimacy. Experts note that hormonal shifts, physical healing, and the psychological transition to parenthood can all impact desire. For couples struggling with this change, seeking professional support like counseling or sex therapy is recommended to navigate the emotional challenges.</p>

          <p>Contrary to the common narrative of entrenched NIMBYism, a recent UCLA survey reveals that a majority of Los Angeles County residents support building more housing, even in their own neighborhoods. The 2023 survey found that 64% of respondents support new apartments on streets with primarily single-family homes, and 59% are in favor of more apartments in their local area. This widespread support was consistent across most City Council districts. The article argues that city leaders, including Mayor Karen Bass, should use this data to pursue more aggressive housing policies and stop catering to a vocal minority that does not represent the broader public consensus.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists searching for the lost tomb of Queen Cleopatra have discovered a submerged ancient port near the Taposiris Magna Temple, about 30 miles west of Alexandria, Egypt. The Egyptian-Dominican mission, using advanced sonar technology, mapped a sunken harbor and an underwater extension of a tunnel connecting it to the temple. While many experts believe Cleopatra was buried in Alexandria, lead archaeologist Dr. Kathleen Martinez is convinced her tomb is at Taposiris Magna, a temple dedicated to the goddess Isis, whom Cleopatra identified with. The team is now preparing for the first-ever underwater excavation of the newly discovered harbor.</p>

          <h2>California Passes Bill to Track Water Consumption of Data Centers Amid AI Boom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 06:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill requiring data centers to report their water usage, a move driven by the boom in artificial intelligence and cloud computing. These facilities, which are often located in arid western states, can consume vast amounts of water for cooling their servers. The legislation, now awaiting the governor's signature, would mandate that both new and existing data centers disclose their projected and actual annual water consumption. This aims to help local communities plan for water scarcity and prevent a single industry from placing excessive strain on a vital resource, especially as droughts and high temperatures become more common.</p>

          <p>In a televised interview, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed her relationship with California Governor Gavin Newsom, particularly an anecdote from her new book where he failed to return her call when she sought his presidential campaign support. Harris downplayed any tension, stating Newsom has a "great sense of humor." She also voiced strong support for Proposition 50, a controversial California ballot measure championed by Newsom that would redraw congressional districts to favor Democrats. Harris framed the measure as a necessary tactic to "fight fire with fire" against Republican-led redistricting efforts in other states.</p>

          <p>The iconic Britpop band Pulp has made a triumphant return with "More," their first studio album in 24 years, which debuted at No. 1 in the U.K. Frontman Jarvis Cocker reflects on the band's long journey from obscurity in the 1980s to fame in the '90s and their eventual hiatus after 2001. The new album was recorded in just three weeks, a stark contrast to the lengthy production of their previous efforts, which Cocker attributes to a relaxed environment and the readiness of the material. The band is currently on a North American tour, including two shows at the Hollywood Bowl.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A novel process called phytomining is being developed to extract valuable metals like nickel from the ground using hyperaccumulating plants. These unique species naturally absorb high concentrations of metals from the soil and store them in their leaves and stems. After harvesting and incinerating the plants, the resulting "bio-ore" can be processed to yield pure metals, offering a climate-friendly alternative to conventional mining. While the method is currently being trialed in places like Albania for nickel, its scalability remains a challenge. Experts believe it is unlikely to replace industrial mining but could empower smaller communities to clean contaminated land while generating income.</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has raised its global economic growth forecast for the current year to 3.2%, citing unexpected resilience in the first half of 2025.

However, the organization warns of significant risks ahead, particularly from elevated U.S. tariffs, which have reached their highest effective rate since 1933. The full impact of these trade restrictions has yet to be felt and could dampen investment and trade growth later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>
