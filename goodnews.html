          <h2>Taiwan Reclassifies Chiang Kai-shek Mausoleum as Camp Area</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan's military has reclassified Chiang Kai-shek's mausoleum in Taoyuan as a "camp area," a move seen as further distancing the island from its Kuomintang past. The mausoleum of Chiang's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, was similarly reclassified. This decision reflects updated administrative needs and the 2014 reclassification of Taoyuan as a metropolitan area. The sites will no longer be referred to as mausoleums or spirit-worship facilities, marking a symbolic shift in how Taiwan grapples with its historical legacy.</p>

          <p>A naturalist recounts an evening spent observing an old badger sett, hoping to catch a glimpse of the year's cubs. Despite the lack of rain, which would have brought worms to the surface, the naturalist notes signs of recent activity, including flattened bluebells and piles of bedding airing outside the sett entrances. The article describes the distinct smells of the sett and the sounds of badgers moving underground. Eventually, a sow badger emerges, providing a brief but satisfying moment of connection with the elusive creatures.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced sweeping policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a lower reserve requirement ratio, to bolster economic growth amid trade concerns. The People's Bank of China will cut the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points and lower the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, injecting liquidity into the market. These measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, along with establishing a relending tool for consumption and elderly care. However, some analysts suggest these measures may have limited impact on boosting domestic credit demand.</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to eliminate $1.15 billion in debt and focus on its transition into a telehealth services provider. The company has the support of nearly three-quarters of its debt holders and expects to emerge from bankruptcy within 45 days. WeightWatchers has struggled recently, despite moving into the prescription drug weight loss business with the acquisition of Sequence. The company's latest earnings report showed a decline in revenue, though clinical subscription revenue from weight-loss medications increased.</p>

          <p>Criminals in England and Wales who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings could face an additional two years in prison under a new bill. The Victims and Courts Bill aims to ensure that offenders cannot "opt out" of justice, providing victims' families with a moment of recognition and a form of reparation. The legislation was initiated after several high-profile cases where killers refused to attend sentencing, prompting calls for changes to the law. Justice Minister Alex Davies-Jones thanked the families who campaigned for the changes, emphasizing that "justice isn't optional."</p>

          <p>The fire-ravaged Tahitian Terrace mobile home park in Pacific Palisades is now eligible for federal debris removal, providing hope for residents facing uncertainty about rebuilding. The mobile home park was initially left out of the federally funded program, but Los Angeles County officials successfully requested its inclusion. FEMA cited the unique characteristics of the property and the immediate threats to public health and safety as justification for the use of federal funds. The decision is a significant step towards the potential rebuilding of the community.</p>

          <p>CNBC's The China Connection newsletter highlights a surge in tourism in China, contrasting with a broader consumption slowdown. Domestic tourist trips increased significantly during the May Labor Day holiday, driven by interest in history and culture. The article points to improved transportation infrastructure and a shift towards less popular destinations as contributing factors. While retail sales remain tepid, the services sector, including tourism, is experiencing faster growth, indicating a shift in consumer spending priorities.</p>

          <p>The United States and China will hold trade talks this weekend in Switzerland, signaling a potential de-escalation in trade tensions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the goal is to agree on future discussion topics, rather than reaching a comprehensive trade deal. The article highlights the Trump administration's desire to decouple from China in strategic industries, while maintaining trade relations in other sectors. China's Commerce Ministry expressed a willingness to engage in talks, but reiterated its commitment to defending its interests.</p>
