        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian cricket captain Shubman Gill scored an exceptional 269, placing his team in a commanding position against England in the second Test at Edgbaston. Gill's performance is the highest score by an Indian batter in England and helped India reach a massive total of 587. In response, England's top-order batsmen struggled significantly, collapsing to 77-3 by the end of the day's play. The hosts now face an extremely difficult challenge to avoid defeat and prevent India from leveling the five-match series.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' predictions and demonstrating the labor market's continued resilience despite slower economic growth. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. Job growth was led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the federal workforce saw further reductions. Despite the strong report, economists remain cautious, expecting growth to slow in the second half of the year due to uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade and fiscal policy.

          <p>For the fifth consecutive week, average mortgage rates have fallen, now standing at 6.67% for a 30-year loan, offering a slight reprieve for potential homebuyers. With the Federal Reserve potentially cutting its benchmark rate later this year, rates could continue their downward trend. The article advises prospective buyers to prepare for a potentially more competitive market by checking their credit reports, researching real estate agents, and getting pre-approved for a mortgage. These steps can help buyers position themselves favorably as affordability improves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Review: 'Nobu' Documentary Focuses More on Brand Than Culinary Art</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new documentary titled "Nobu" explores the life and career of celebrated sushi master Nobu Matsuhisa, but the film is critiqued for emphasizing his global brand over his culinary genius. The review notes that the documentary offers a gentle chronological account of Matsuhisa's rise but spends little time analyzing the unique experience of dining at his restaurants. While featuring celebrity investors like Robert De Niro and famous patrons like Cindy Crawford, the film is said to feel more like a commercial for the Nobu enterprise than an intimate portrait of the artist.</p>

          <p>With average credit card interest rates exceeding 21%, many Americans find their debt growing into an unmanageable burden. This article outlines five key warning signs that a do-it-yourself payoff plan may no longer be sufficient. These indicators include failing to pay more than the minimum, having a credit utilization ratio over 50%, and using credit cards for essential living expenses. When these signs appear, it may be time to consider professional help, such as credit counseling or debt settlement programs, to regain financial control. (not investment advice)</p>
