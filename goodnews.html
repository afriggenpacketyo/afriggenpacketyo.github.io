          <p>Japan's government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb elevated prices of the staple food. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi expects the released rice, consisting of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, to be sold at lower prices in stores. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, prompting concerns about emergency preparedness and discussions about increasing rice imports to ensure a stable domestic supply. The government aims to distribute the rice to smaller supermarket chains, specialty shops, and major retailers, hoping the cheaper rice will bring down overall prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan continues to lag behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership positions. Despite setting goals to raise the share of women in leadership roles to about 30 percent, progress remains insufficient, with the proportion at major firms stuck in the low teens. The government plans to intensify efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring more opportunities for women in decision-making roles across various fields. The report also highlights the trend of female brain drain in rural areas, focusing on supporting female entrepreneurs and addressing the gender pay gap.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have increased significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have seen double-digit percentage growth compared to the same period in 2024. Analysts suggest that this expansion is partly due to Chinese manufacturers redirecting exports to Southeast Asian factories to circumvent US tariffs. These factories then re-export finished goods, often with enough local content to be declared as made in Vietnam, Thailand, or Indonesia, allowing them to avoid the tariffs.</p>

A survey of 14,000 people in 14 countries revealed that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children.

          <p>Data from the CDC indicates a significant reduction in drug deaths among young Americans, with fatal overdoses plummeting from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. Researchers attribute this trend to increased awareness, wider distribution of Narcan, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens and young adults. There is also concern that a potential cut in federal funding for drug treatment and harm reduction programs could unravel the progress. Despite the overall positive trend, researchers are working to understand the shift and sustain progress, as well as to address the needs of those still struggling with severe addiction.</p>
