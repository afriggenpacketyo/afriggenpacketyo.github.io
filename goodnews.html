          <p>Filmmaker Colin Hanks described past media interviews focusing on comedian John Candy's weight as "heartbreaking" and "soul-crushing," noting such questioning would be unacceptable today. Hanks, director of the documentary "John Candy: I Like Me," revealed Candy's discomfort and anxiety over these personal inquiries, which led to unhealthy eating habits. The documentary, produced with Ryan Reynolds and Candy's children, explores the comedian's life, career, and private struggles, including his efforts to improve his health before his death at 43.</p>

          <p>Germany is preparing to pledge at least €100 million for Gaza's reconstruction, with Development Minister Reem Alabali-Radovan emphasizing international cooperation for the immense task. This comes as former US President Donald Trump declared the "war is over" in Gaza, expressing belief in the ceasefire's durability during his travel to a peace summit in Egypt. Trump's comments were made ahead of an expected release of 20 living hostages by Hamas in exchange for 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The two-year conflict has caused extensive destruction and over 66,000 Palestinian deaths.</p>

          <p>Former US President Donald Trump announced the "war is over" in Gaza while en route to Israel for the expected release of hostages under a ceasefire agreement. He praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar's mediation efforts, predicting the ceasefire would hold and a "Board of Peace" would oversee Gaza's future. The peace plan's first phase involves Hamas releasing 20 living and 28 deceased Israeli hostages, in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees, alongside increased aid to Gaza. Subsequent phases, including governance and Hamas disarmament, remain complex.</p>

          <h2>Strategies for Nurturing Adult Friendships and Combating "Relational Loneliness"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates adults lose about half their friends every seven years due to shifting life stages and priorities, leading to "relational loneliness." Experts like Dr. Marisa Franco and Claire Cohen emphasize honest communication and embracing "messy" lives to maintain connections. Cohen's experience, where transparency reaffirmed a friendship, highlights the importance of speaking up. Psychologists suggest integrating friends into daily routines, prioritizing in-person meetings over virtual ones, and reframing social anxieties to remember the happiness friendships bring. Trusting that bonds are "flexible and not fragile" and taking risks to rekindle connections are key to sustained adult friendships.</p>

          <h2>Thermal Cameras Reveal Stress Levels by Detecting Nose Temperature Drops</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to measure stress levels, discovering that a drop in nose temperature can indicate acute stress and monitor recovery. This non-invasive technique, which could be a "game changer" in stress research, works because stress diverts blood flow away from the nose to other areas like eyes and ears. Researchers observed nose temperature drops of 3-6 degrees in volunteers during a stressful public speaking and mental arithmetic test. This method holds potential for monitoring stress in individuals unable to communicate, such as babies, and even in non-human apes.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) advises Chancellor Rachel Reeves against "directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes" in the upcoming Budget, urging comprehensive tax system reform instead. With pressure to raise tens of billions to meet fiscal rules, the IFS highlights "serious constraints" on major taxes and warns against economically harmful options. It suggests reforms to property and capital gains tax as starting points, advocating for a fairer, growth-friendly system, including updating council tax values. The IFS cautions against a wealth tax and restricting pension contribution relief, proposing better alternatives for increasing pension taxation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in Egypt for an international peace summit where a Gaza peace plan, brokered by US President Donald Trump, is expected to be signed. Starmer is set to commend Trump, Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey for their roles in reaching this stage. However, the UK's claimed "key role" in shaping the plan has been disputed by US Ambassador Mike Huckabee and Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel, who criticized UK decisions like recognizing Palestinian statehood. The summit aims to secure the ceasefire, deliver aid, and establish a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Paramount, backed by billionaire Larry Ellison, has opened bidding for Warner Bros. Discovery, with an initial offer of about $20 a share rejected by the board, though discussions are ongoing. This potential merger, which would consolidate major media assets like HBO, CNN, and CBS News, could dramatically reshape Hollywood. Paramount, under David Ellison, seeks more content to compete with tech giants. Warner Bros. Discovery, burdened by debt despite recent box office successes, was planning to split its assets, making Paramount's swift bid a strategic move to acquire its valuable studios and streaming services.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping recently met, agreeing to be "partners" rather than "rivals" and committing to resolve border disputes. Modi emphasized India's pursuit of "strategic autonomy," avoiding a "third country lens" for bilateral relations, a subtle jab at the US. Both leaders envision Sino-Indian ties as crucial for a multipolar world and an "Asian century," resuming direct flights after five years. This diplomatic overture signals India's effort to reset fraught ties with China and forge an eastern coalition, balancing its position amidst an increasingly tough stance from the US.</p>
