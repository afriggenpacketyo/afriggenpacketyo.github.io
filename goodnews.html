          <p>Scientists have discovered mysterious, ancient radio waves that traveled for 10 billion years to reach Earth, originating from the distant galaxy cluster SpARCS1049. These signals emanate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. Researchers theorize these halos are formed either by particles ejected from supermassive black holes or by cosmic particle collisions. The discovery suggests that these powerful energetic processes have been shaping galaxy clusters for nearly the entire history of the universe.</p>

Officers were performing a wellness check when they discovered the deceased woman and found the visibly emaciated baby on a bed. Bodycam footage shows an officer carefully rescuing the child, who was then transported to a hospital for lifesaving care. The baby is now expected to make a full recovery, while the cause of the mother's death remains under investigation by the medical examiner's office.</p>

The guest list reportedly included Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, and members of the Kardashian-Jenner family. The event, which sparked some local protests over the impact of ultra-wealthy tourism, featured pre-wedding festivities and a reception at an undisclosed location.

          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers losing 9-5 to the Kansas City Royals, pitcher Shohei Ohtani delivered his best performance of the season from the mound. In two innings, he threw 20 strikes out of 27 pitches and recorded the hardest-thrown pitch of his career at 101.7 mph. Ohtani's dominant but limited outing, part of his recovery from a second Tommy John surgery, demonstrated his powerful potential. However, the Dodgers' bullpen struggled after his departure, and the offense was unable to capitalize on opportunities, leading to the end of their five-game winning streak.</p>

          <p>According to renowned computer scientist Harry Shum, the former head of AI at Microsoft, China is rapidly catching up to the United States in the field of artificial intelligence algorithms. While the U.S. maintains a significant lead in AI chip technology, a gap Shum believes will take years to close, China is making major strides in algorithmic efficiency. He cited the Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which achieved results comparable to top American competitors like OpenAI using a fraction of the computing power. This suggests a strategic focus on algorithmic innovation to overcome hardware limitations.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor injuries after likely being bitten by a juvenile shark at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York. The woman was in waist-deep water when she was bitten on her left leg and foot but did not see what attacked her. After examining photos of the non-life-threatening wounds, experts concluded the bites were most likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark. Swimming was temporarily suspended at the beach, but a drone search for the shark was unsuccessful and activities resumed the following day.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied another motion by Donald Trump to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed against him by the five men who were wrongfully convicted in the 1989 Central Park jogger sexual assault case. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The plaintiffs sued Trump for defamation in October, citing false statements he made during a presidential debate where he claimed the men had killed someone and pled guilty.

Researchers studied DNA from over 130 skeletons and found that while family members were initially buried together, genetic connections over time were primarily through the female line. This indicates that men may have moved into their wives' households upon marriage, and female offspring remained connected to their family buildings. The findings are supported by a pattern of preferential treatment, with females receiving five times more grave goods than males.</p>
