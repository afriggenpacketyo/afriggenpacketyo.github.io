          <h2>Parents' Nine Key Practices for Raising Socially Skilled Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 10:23:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study analyzing over 200 parent-child relationships identifies nine key practices that foster exceptional social skills in children. These include openly discussing emotions to build emotional vocabulary, consistently modeling empathy in daily interactions, and nurturing authentic confidence by allowing children to try and sometimes fail. Parents also teach crucial repair skills after conflict, validate their child's feelings, and help them recognize social cues. Furthermore, stepping back to let children solve minor conflicts, treating mistakes as learning opportunities, and prioritizing active listening over lecturing are vital. This article suggests these methods create an emotionally safe environment, enabling children to grow into empathetic adults ready for real-world relationships.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is witnessing a significant decline in its iconic buffet scene, with several major casino buffets transforming into modern food halls. Rick Harrison, star of "Pawn Stars," attributes this shift to evolving dining preferences, likening it to "Darwinism." He champions his own Rick's Rollin Smoke Barbeque & Tavern, emphasizing its 16-hour smoked, locally sourced meats and criticizing overpriced "gimmick" steaks, noting that good American steaks are still accessible. The article also touches on a recent 12% drop in Vegas tourism, which Harrison links to inflation, while still praising the city's diverse culinary options for all budgets.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have formalized a mutual defense pact, deepening their security ties amidst evolving global geopolitical landscapes. This agreement comes as Gulf Arab nations express increasing skepticism about the United States' long-term commitment as their security provider. Analysts interpret Saudi Arabia's move as a strategic effort to diversify its defense partnerships, leveraging Pakistan for protection while navigating heightened US-China tensions. The article suggests that China might view these new alliances favorably, potentially leading to expanded arms sales, although it acknowledges that such shifts could further complicate regional security dynamics.</p>

          <p>Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy, cautions consumers against several common pitfalls when seeking to maximize the value of rewards credit cards. He strongly advises against solely opting for no-annual-fee cards, arguing that "cheaper is not better" due to their typically inferior reward structures compared to cards with modest fees. The article outlines critical mistakes, including failing to update card choices as lifestyles evolve, hoarding points which can diminish in value due to program changes, and neglecting to negotiate with credit card companies for retention bonuses before considering cancellation. Kelly stresses that a strategic approach to card selection and active engagement with issuers are essential for truly leveraging card benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's landmark 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka effectively dismantled the "separate but equal" doctrine, which had been upheld by Plessy v.

Marshall argued that segregation was designed to perpetuate the subjugation of formerly enslaved individuals. Although the ruling did not instantly eradicate all forms of segregation, particularly in housing and schools, it represented a monumental step forward, significantly advancing the United States toward its foundational ideals of true democracy and equality for all citizens.</p>

This article contends that the United States' long-standing policy of technological decoupling, characterized by targeted export controls and blacklisting of Chinese firms, has paradoxically fueled China's pursuit of technological self-sufficiency. In response to external pressures, Chinese companies and research institutions have substantially escalated their domestic R&D investments, reaching over 3.6 trillion yuan in 2024, solidifying China's position as the world's second-largest R&D spender. The article concludes that these US containment efforts are not only proving ineffective but are also detrimental to global innovation and America's broader interests. (not investment advice)</p>
