          <p>A strong 7.4 magnitude earthquake occurred near the east coast of Russia’s Kamchatka region, with its epicenter located approximately 112 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake had a relatively shallow depth of 39 kilometers. Despite its power, there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. A brief tsunami threat was issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning System but was later rescinded, minimizing concerns for widespread impact in the region.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta infringed upon the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court found the company's justification for the removal was unclear and that it applied its content moderation policies inconsistently compared to similar accounts. As a result, Meta has been ordered to review its terms of use to provide clearer mechanisms for users to challenge moderation decisions and better define its rules.</p>

          <p>Boxing analysts are divided on the outcome of the highly anticipated match between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence Crawford. Supporters of Crawford point to his exceptional technical skill, adaptability, and physical advantages like reach as key factors that could help him overcome the significant weight difference. Conversely, those favoring Álvarez believe his proven power, durability, and extensive experience at the super-middleweight class will ultimately prove decisive against Crawford, who is moving up two divisions for this legacy-defining fight.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly anti-corruption protests that led to the collapse of the previous government, a sense of calm has returned to Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki has been sworn in as the nation's first female interim prime minister, a move supported by the youth-led protest movement. Her appointment has led to the dissolution of parliament, with new elections now scheduled for March 5, marking a pivotal moment in the country's political landscape.</p>

          <p>In an effort to simultaneously boost its birth rate and retain scientific talent, Shanghai has introduced a new subsidy for female researchers returning to work after childbirth. The program provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan to new mothers under 40 who hold doctoral degrees and senior-level professional titles. This initiative aims to alleviate the career challenges that women in science often face after having children, addressing two of China's key national policy priorities in a single targeted program.</p>
