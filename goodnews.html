          <h2>Thrifting Gains Popularity Among Americans Concerned About Clothing Costs and Waste</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 20:42:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thrifting is becoming increasingly popular among Americans, particularly young adults, as a way to save money and reduce textile waste. The secondhand market is expected to more than double by 2028, growing 6.4 times faster than the broader retail sector, driven by concerns over rising clothing prices and environmental impact. Small businesses are capitalizing on this trend, offering sewing classes and curated thrift store experiences. Beyond cost savings, thrifting is viewed as a treasure hunt and a way to create a unique style while supporting mission-driven organizations. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are increasing their overseas expansion to ensure survival despite ongoing trade tensions and high tariffs imposed by the U.S. The industry is shifting from exporting to localizing production abroad, with Southeast Asia currently hosting most of the existing overseas capacity. However, future expansion plans are heavily focused on the Middle East and Africa, followed by the U.S. and Europe, as companies seek to mitigate the impact of tariffs that could potentially rise significantly. These strategies are crucial for maintaining competitiveness and market access in the face of trade uncertainties.</p>

          <p>LIV Golf star Patrick Reed made history at the U.S. Open by scoring an albatross on the par-5 fourth hole at Oakmont Country Club. Reed's shot vaulted him up the leaderboard to 2-under, despite the challenging conditions of the course, which include treacherous rough and fast greens. This is only the fourth double eagle recorded at the U.S. Open since record-keeping began. Other golfers, including Rory McIlroy, struggled with the course conditions during their opening rounds.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will be the first in the world to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy for the blood cancer myeloma. This advanced chemotherapy drug, belantamab mafodotin, is designed to target and kill cancer cells while reducing side effects. Clinical trials have shown that it can halt the cancer for nearly three times longer than current therapies. The therapy works by binding a lethal chemotherapy drug to an antibody that targets plasma cells, delivering the drug directly into the cancerous cells. </p>

          <p>A car crash in Blue Ash, Ohio, was reportedly caused by a cicada that flew into the driver's window, startling the driver and causing them to lose control of the vehicle. The Blue Ash Police Department joked that the cicada "fled the scene" after the incident. This incident highlights the broader impact of the 17-year cicada emergence in the Cincinnati area, which has caused disruptions and concerns for residents. Experts predict the cicada activity will decline in the coming weeks, with the emergence expected to end by early July.</p>

          <p>Shinjiro Koizumi, Japan's farm minister and son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, is gaining renewed attention for his efforts to lower rice prices amid rising household costs. This move is seen as a revival of his political prospects after a setback in the LDP leadership race. Koizumi's actions, including releasing government rice stockpiles at reduced prices, are reminiscent of his father's reformist approach and media-savvy tactics. His renewed popularity could make him a key figure for the LDP in the upcoming national election, as he tackles entrenched agricultural distribution networks.</p>

However, some events, including performances by Center Theatre Group and a Grand Performances series show, have been canceled or postponed due to planned protests.
