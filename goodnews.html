          <p>Top tennis players, including Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova, are increasingly speaking out about the importance of mental health amid the pressures of the professional tour. Anisimova, who took a break for burnout, credits listening to her body as key to her recent success. The article highlights how the demanding 11-month season, constant travel, and performance pressure have led other stars like Andrey Rublev and Madison Keys to seek therapy and develop coping mechanisms. Players emphasize the need to separate their identity from their on-court results and find joy outside of the sport to maintain psychological well-being.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of parents living in the U.S. illegally or temporarily. The judge certified a class action lawsuit on behalf of all children who would be affected by the order, stating that the deprivation of U.S. citizenship constitutes irreparable harm. This ruling is one of several legal challenges to the administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause. The government's argument was deemed unpersuasive by the judge, who described the decision to grant the injunction as "not a close call."</p>

          <p>A team of Texas archaeologists has discovered the tomb of Te K'ab Chaak, the founding ruler of the ancient Mayan city of Caracol in Belize. The king, who established the city's royal dynasty in A.D. 331, was found interred with numerous artifacts, including pottery vessels, carved bone tubes, and a jadeite death mask. This marks the first time a ruler's identifiable resting place has been found at the major archaeological site. The discovery provides crucial new insights into the history of Caracol and its early interactions with the powerful central Mexican city of Teotihuacan.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's praise for Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," the BBC has outlined key facts about the deep historical ties between Liberia and the United States. The West African nation was founded in the 19th century by freed African-American slaves, and English is its official language, often spoken with an American-influenced accent. The article notes that Liberia's capital, Monrovia, is named after a U.S. president, and its flag closely resembles the American flag. Liberian officials stated they were not offended by the comments, seeing it as a reflection of a general lack of global understanding about Africa.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is bracing for a heatwave, with temperatures expected to climb significantly and peak over the weekend, potentially reaching 34°C (93°F). In response, the UK Health Security Agency has extended yellow heat health alerts across all of England, warning of potential strain on healthcare services. The hot, dry conditions have also prompted an "extreme wildfire warning" in Scotland. This marks the third official heatwave of the year for some regions, occurring amid England's driest start to the year since 1976, which has led to a hosepipe ban in Yorkshire.</p>

          <p>Massachusetts has been named America's most improved state in CNBC's 2025 business rankings, climbing 18 spots to No. 20 overall after a significant drop last year. The state's turnaround is largely attributed to its relative financial independence from Washington, a key factor in this year's study due to looming federal budget cuts. With a lower-than-average reliance on federal funds and a small federal workforce, its economy is considered more resilient. However, the state still faces challenges, including being the second-most-expensive state to do business in and potential impacts from federal cuts to university research grants.
