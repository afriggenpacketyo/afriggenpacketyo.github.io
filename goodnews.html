          <p>California community college officials are working to combat a surge in fraudulent applications and financial aid losses, with over 1.2 million fake applications detected last year. Scammers exploit the system's accessibility and remote learning options to steal millions in state and federal aid. Officials are considering a $10 application fee and implementing a "complete redesign" of the application system with integrated fraud detection tools. The Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the Education Department and mass layoffs could make the fight against fraud more challenging.</p>

          <p>German lawmakers are set to vote on a new budget that sharply raises public spending, with new debts to pay for record investments in defense and infrastructure. Under Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil's plans, the German government would take on significant new debt to repair the country's aging infrastructure, support a stimulus package for the weakening economy, and fund record levels of military investment. The defense budget would more than double by 2029, reaching 3.5% of GDP. The German government has been operating under a provisional budget since the start of the year due to national elections.</p>
