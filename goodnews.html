          <p>Sweden secured a decisive 4-1 victory over Germany, finishing at the top of their group in the Women's Euro 2025 tournament. This win marks a significant statement from the Swedish team, who have historically performed well in tournaments but have not won the championship since its inaugural year in 1984. Midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd expressed strong confidence in her squad, suggesting there is "something different" about the team this year and that they have the potential to win the entire tournament. The victory sets up a quarter-final match for Sweden against the runner-up from Group D, potentially England or France.</p>

          <p>Large crowds gathered across Northern Ireland for the annual Twelfth of July parades, a major event for the Protestant Orange Order commemorating the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. Thousands of members, accompanied by marching bands, participated in events held in 18 different locations, including a major parade in Belfast. The day is a significant celebration of Protestant culture and Ulster-Scots heritage, drawing spectators and visiting lodges from Scotland and beyond. Officials reported that the events were largely peaceful and well-attended, with sunny weather contributing to what was described as a "great Twelfth of July" by organizers.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers end a seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 win against the San Francisco Giants. In his return to the mound following Tommy John surgery, Ohtani pitched three scoreless innings, striking out four batters and allowing only one hit. While bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan earned the official win, Ohtani's strong start set a positive tone for the team. This outing is a promising sign for the Dodgers, as Ohtani continues to build up his pitching workload while also contributing as a hitter, demonstrating his unique and valuable two-way talent.</p>

          <p>England clinched a 2-0 series win against Argentina after a last-minute try from Jack van Poortvliet secured a 22-17 victory in a dramatic second Test. The match was tightly contested, with the score tied at 17-17 for a large portion of the second half before a late break by Guy Pepper set up the winning score. The series victory is a significant achievement for England's head coach Steve Borthwick, as the team was missing numerous key players who were on duty with the British and Irish Lions. The win marks England's sixth consecutive Test victory as they prepare to face the United States next.</p>

          <p>As China grapples with a declining population, the role of artificial intelligence is becoming a point of discussion, with some viewing it as a factor that could exacerbate the trend. The article highlights individuals who feel less pressure to marry or have children, believing that future AI and robotics will provide companionship and elderly care, traditionally fulfilled by family. While AI is often blamed for reducing incentives for family formation, some experts argue this technological shift may not be entirely negative. They suggest that the AI revolution could fundamentally redefine societal structures around life and family, potentially making traditional demographic concerns obsolete.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's third heatwave of the year reached its peak, with temperatures hitting 33C (91.4F) in Ross on Wye. The heat was widespread, with Scotland recording its warmest day of the year and Northern Ireland its hottest in nearly three years. The extreme temperatures have led to amber heat health alerts in southern England, warnings of wildfire risk in Scotland, and the implementation of hosepipe bans for millions of people in several regions. The heat has also caused disruptions, including the cancellation of a Stereophonics concert in Cardiff due to heat damage on a railway line.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In what was dubbed the "shortest call" in the show's history, financial personality Dave Ramsey gave blunt advice to a long-time listener. The caller, who had $211,000 in cash and a $95,000 mortgage, was emphatically told to pay off the house immediately. The article highlights this moment as a classic example of Ramsey's philosophy, which prioritizes the emotional and behavioral benefits of being debt-free over purely mathematical gains. It also notes the financial counter-argument, pointing out that investing the cash in the market could potentially yield higher returns than the interest saved on a low-rate mortgage.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, has defended his team's use of delay tactics at the end of day three of the third Test against India. English opener Zak Crawley repeatedly delayed the game, ensuring he and his partner would only face one over before the close of play, which angered the Indian team. Southee pointed out that India had used similar time-wasting tactics earlier in the match, including a lengthy delay for captain Shubman Gill to receive a massage on the field. The incident added a layer of tension to the closely contested match at Lord's, with both sides animated by the strategic gamesmanship.</p>

This victory marks her sixth Grand Slam title and signals a return to top form after a challenging year that saw her world ranking dip.

          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have made history by becoming the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 89 years. They defeated their opponents Rinky Hijikata and David Pel in straight sets, 6-2 7-6 (7-3), to claim their maiden Grand Slam title. The victory is a significant moment for British tennis, as the last time two Britons won the men's doubles championship at any Grand Slam was in 1936. The pair, who teamed up less than a year ago, expressed their disbelief and joy at achieving one of their primary goals for the season at their home tournament.</p>
