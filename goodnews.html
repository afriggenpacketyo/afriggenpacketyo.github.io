          <p>Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones anticipates that current market conditions are primed for a significant stock rally before the bull market reaches a conclusive top. He draws parallels to the dot-com bubble of 1999, suggesting today's environment is potentially more explosive due to the combination of fiscal and monetary policies. Jones notes that while the greatest gains often occur in the final year of a bull market, investors must be prepared for a severe correction afterward. He advises owning a mix of gold, cryptocurrencies, and tech stocks to capitalize on the expected surge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a new report from Adobe Analytics, online holiday spending in the United States is forecast to grow by 5.3% to $253.4 billion, a slower pace than the 8.7% increase seen in the previous year. This deceleration reflects broader economic uncertainty, with consumers actively seeking discounts and increasingly using AI-powered tools to research purchases. Despite the slowdown from the ten-year average, the projected increase is still considered notable given current economic pressures. The report also highlights that mobile shopping is expected to account for over 56% of all online holiday sales. (not investment advice)</p>

While China already leads in fields like 5G and new energy, this initiative aims to close the gap in core technologies essential for future economic and strategic competitiveness.

          <p>Both gold and bitcoin have surged to record prices, driven by a confluence of global economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. Investors are increasingly turning to these assets as safe havens amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which has weakened the dollar, and conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. The rally is also fueled by increased demand from institutional investors through ETFs and by central banks purchasing gold as a hedge. President Trump's supportive stance on cryptocurrencies has further bolstered confidence in bitcoin, which recently surpassed the $125,000 mark. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant move within the artificial intelligence industry, OpenAI has entered a multi-billion dollar agreement with chipmaker AMD, with stock in the latter surging over 30% on the news. The deal involves OpenAI deploying 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs over several years, which could give OpenAI up to a 10% ownership stake in AMD through stock warrants. This partnership positions AMD as a core strategic supplier for OpenAI, diversifying its hardware sources and reducing its reliance on Nvidia. The agreement underscores the massive infrastructure investments being made to power the next generation of AI models.</p>

          <p>In a major media industry development, Paramount has acquired the online publication The Free Press for a reported $150 million and named its founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. Weiss, who resigned from The New York Times in 2020 criticizing its progressive orthodoxy, has built The Free Press into a prominent platform for centrist and center-right commentary. The move signals a potential ideological shift for the legacy news network and has been interpreted as an effort to appeal to audiences disillusioned with mainstream media narratives.</p>

Their collective work identified a specific subtype of T-cells, known as regulatory T-cells (T-regs), and the controlling gene Foxp3, which together prevent the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues. This research has opened a new field in immunology and is crucial for developing treatments for autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, as well as certain types of cancer.</p>

He envisions a future where Nvidia's technology can make complex judgments with fewer errors than humans, potentially revolutionizing industries like law and beyond. Cramer recounted his early conviction in the company, which he famously demonstrated by renaming his dog "Nvidia" in 2017 to emphasize his belief in its potential. He maintains that despite its massive stock gains, it is not too late for investors to buy into the company's future. (not investment advice)</p>

Her strong advocacy for fiscal stimulus could boost short-term growth, but it also raises significant concerns about increasing the national budget deficit and raising government bond yields. While she has previously criticized interest rate hikes, her election may not prevent a near-term rate increase by the Bank of Japan, though it could limit further monetary tightening in the future.
