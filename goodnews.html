          <p>Bank of America announced mixed financial results for the second quarter, surpassing earnings estimates but falling short on revenue expectations. The company's profit saw a modest increase of about 3% to $7.12 billion, or 89 cents per share, which was higher than analysts predicted. However, its total revenue of $26.61 billion was slightly below forecasts, primarily due to net interest income missing its target by $70 million. These results follow stronger-than-expected earnings reports from other major banks like JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has lifted a five-year-old ban on airlines from Pakistan, permitting them to resume flight operations after concluding that the country has made significant improvements to its aviation safety standards. This decision follows a similar move by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency earlier this year. The ban was originally imposed in 2020 following a fatal plane crash in Karachi and a subsequent revelation that a large number of Pakistani pilots had fraudulent licenses. The national carrier, PIA, which suffered significant financial losses from the suspension, is now planning its return to profitable UK routes.</p>

          <p>China is advancing its efforts to internationalize its currency by establishing Africa as a key testing ground for the yuan's global rollout. The central banks of China and Egypt recently signed several agreements to encourage the use of the yuan in trade and financial transactions, including cooperation on electronic payments and cross-border settlements. These deals, part of a broader Chinese strategy, aim to integrate the yuan into the local economies through China's Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). Egypt now joins other African nations like South Africa and Nigeria in adopting yuan-based financial arrangements with Beijing.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the upcoming Euro 2025 quarter-final between England and Sweden identifies several crucial on-field battles that will likely determine the outcome. One key area is the duel between England's defense, led by Leah Williamson, and Sweden's potent striker, Stina Blackstenius, whose speed and intelligent runs pose a significant threat. Another vital contest will be on the wings, where England's Lauren Hemp and Lauren James will challenge Sweden's full-backs. The midfield clash is also highlighted as critical, with England's balanced trio needing to counter the creativity and physicality of Sweden's midfielders to control the game's tempo.</p>

          <h2>UK Review Recommends Renaming 'Physician Associates' to 'Physician Assistants'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 06:47:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their titles changed to 'assistants' to prevent patient confusion. The review, commissioned amid debate over the roles, also suggests they wear standardized uniforms and not make initial diagnoses for new patients. This follows cases where patients suffered harm after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors. While the doctors' union feels the review could have been stronger, the union for PAs and AAs expressed concern that the proposed restrictions could lengthen patient waiting lists.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Indonesia have reached a trade deal that reduces American tariffs on Indonesian goods from a proposed 32% down to 19%. According to President Trump, this reduction was granted in exchange for Indonesia providing 'full access' for American firms and lowering its own tariffs on U.S. products. The agreement also reportedly includes Indonesian commitments to purchase billions of dollars in American energy and agricultural goods, as well as 50 Boeing jets. This pact is the latest development following a series of tariff threats the White House issued to numerous trading partners earlier this year.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 06:05:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The asset management firm Blackstone has been significantly expanding its portfolio in the U.S. rental housing market, acquiring apartment complexes, student housing, and single-family rental properties. The company's strategy focuses on regions with strong job and population growth, particularly in major cities and Sun Belt states. Despite its high-profile acquisitions, Blackstone states it owns less than 1% of the total rental homes in the country. Analysts note that the firm is positioning itself to benefit from market conditions where buying existing properties is often cheaper than new construction, which supports rent growth and limits new housing supply.

          <p>A church deacon in Wayne, Michigan, is being praised as a hero for thwarting a mass shooting by ramming his pickup truck into a rifle-wielding attacker. Richard Pryor saw the gunman, who was wearing a tactical vest, begin firing in the church parking lot and decided he had no time to wait for police. He drove his truck into the assailant, temporarily stopping him and allowing the church's armed security team to intervene and fatally shoot the suspect. Over 100 congregants, including many children, were inside the church at the time, and Pryor's decisive action is credited with preventing a major tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying the mechanisms of healthy brain aging to understand how to preserve cognitive function later in life. While memory and processing speed naturally decline after age 40, studies of 'exceptional' performers—those whose brains function like someone 30 years younger—suggest lifestyle factors play a key role. Key recommendations include getting high-quality sleep, maintaining cardiovascular health by controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, avoiding smoking, and getting regular exercise. Scientists emphasize that these measures can help maintain the brain's structure and integrity, potentially leading to a 'younger-looking' brain even in older age and distinguishing normal decline from diseases like Alzheimer's.</p>

          <p>The 2026 race for California governor is in a state of 'suspended animation' as candidates and major donors await a decision from former Vice President Kamala Harris on whether she will run. Since losing the presidential election, Harris has remained largely out of the public eye, and her potential candidacy is causing uncertainty for other Democrats already in the race. While some candidates have pledged to continue their campaigns regardless, many powerful donors are reportedly holding back on significant contributions until Harris makes her plans clear. Her entry would immediately upend the dynamics of the race, though she would also face questions about her past presidential campaigns.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Nvidia has become the world's first publicly traded company to achieve a $4 trillion market capitalization, cementing its position as a primary beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom. The company's valuation has surged dramatically as its powerful chips have become essential for developing AI applications like chatbots and self-driving cars. This milestone was further boosted by recent U.S. government approval for Nvidia to sell some of its AI chips in China. While the achievement is largely symbolic, it intensifies the competitive landscape in the AI sector, with analysts noting that Nvidia's success will attract a huge focus on creating rival technologies.

Moore, who runs a successful shop in Garden Grove, California, is moving away from the secretive 'gatekeeper' mentality of older tradesmen.
