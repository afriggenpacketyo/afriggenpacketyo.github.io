          <p>In the Women's Cricket World Cup, Australian leg-spinner Alana King achieved the best bowling figures in the tournament's history, taking seven wickets for just 18 runs against South Africa. Her record-breaking performance led to South Africa's collapse, as they were bowled out for only 97 runs. Australia easily chased the target, securing a seven-wicket victory with 199 balls to spare and setting up a semi-final match against India. This dominant win solidifies Australia's top position in the group stage, highlighting their strength as they head into the knockout rounds of the competition.</p>

          <p>A vibrant Pablo Picasso portrait of his muse and partner, Dora Maar, titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat," has sold for approximately $37 million at an auction in Paris. Painted in 1943 during a tumultuous period in their relationship, the artwork had been in a private family collection since 1944 and was hidden from public view for over 80 years. The sale price surpassed expectations, becoming the highest-priced artwork sold at a French auction this year. Experts noted the painting's exceptional condition and vivid colors, which were previously known only through a black-and-white photograph.</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic gold medalist Abby Wambach suggests that parents should not attend their children's sports practices to help them develop internal motivation and resilience. In a recent interview, the former soccer star argued that a parent's presence can make a child nervous or overly driven to impress, outsourcing their motivation. By allowing children to interact with coaches and teammates without supervision, they can learn to take risks and make mistakes freely. Wambach believes this approach helps children become self-starters, a trait that contributes to success in adulthood.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debunk Serial Killer Rumors in U.S. Cities Amid Public Fascination</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 09:00:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite persistent social media rumors about a "Rainey Street Ripper" in Austin, Texas, authorities and academic researchers have found no evidence of a serial killer. A study determined that recent drownings in Lady Bird Lake were likely accidental and related to alcohol consumption near the city's bar district. This phenomenon of phantom serial killers has also appeared in New York and Boston, where police have similarly refuted such claims. Experts note that while public fascination with serial killers remains high, fueled by entertainment, the actual number of such criminals has declined by about 80% since peaking in the 1970s due to advances in DNA technology and increased public awareness.</p>

          <p>A CNBC analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data reveals the most common occupations in America's most populous cities and their corresponding median salaries. Across the nation, health and personal care aide is the most prevalent job, though this varies by city. For instance, in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, manual freight and stock movers are among the most common roles, with median annual wages around $40,000.

          <p>A West Virginia family has faced a series of shocking diagnoses after four of their six children were found to have Chiari malformation, a rare condition where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. The journey began when their youngest daughter, Austyn, underwent successful brain surgery for the condition, which had caused developmental delays and constant pain. Subsequently, three of her older sisters—Amelia, Aubrey, and Adalee—were also diagnosed after exhibiting various symptoms. The family traveled to New York for specialized surgeries, and all four girls are now recovering well, living active and happy lives after their treatments.</p>

          <p>Authorities have uncovered and dismantled the first known illegal production facility for weight loss medicine in the United Kingdom, located in Northampton. The operation resulted in the largest-ever single seizure of trafficked weight loss drugs by a law enforcement agency globally, with an estimated value over £250,000. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) seized thousands of unlicensed pens of Retatrutide and Tirzepatide, raw ingredients, and manufacturing equipment. Officials warned the public that these unauthorized products are untested and potentially deadly, urging consumers to only purchase medicines from registered pharmacies.</p>

          <p>In her first UK interview since losing the 2024 election, former Vice President Kamala Harris told the BBC she might run for president again in 2028. Harris stated she is "not done" with public service and dismissed polls that position her as an outsider for the Democratic nomination. She also strongly criticized President Trump, labeling him a "tyrant" and asserting that her campaign warnings about his authoritarian tendencies have been proven correct. Harris reflected on her 2024 campaign, which began late after President Biden withdrew, suggesting the compressed timeline was a major factor in her defeat.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread panic and headlines about AI's potential to revolutionize Hollywood, the technology's actual integration into filmmaking has been slow and has not yet led to major job losses or cost savings. Major studios like Disney have invested heavily in AI divisions but have reportedly seen frustratingly slow progress in achieving efficiencies in large-scale productions. Challenges include integrating new tools into established workflows, legal uncertainties surrounding copyright for AI-generated content, and the high bar for technical quality that current AI models cannot yet meet. While AI is being used for tasks like animation and dubbing, it remains more of a curiosity than a transformative force for now.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has taken a nearly 5% stake in engineering and construction company Fluor, aiming to unlock value from its significant holding in NuScale Power. Fluor's 39% stake in the small modular nuclear reactor company is valued at approximately $4.3 billion, representing over 60% of Fluor's market capitalization. Starboard argues that this holding is depressing Fluor's core business valuation and is urging management to consider a separation, such as a sale or a tax-free spinoff of the NuScale shares. Such a move could lead to a significant rerating of Fluor's stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Charles Schwab survey indicates that 45% of investors are interested in alternative investments like private equity and real estate, with many believing they are necessary to supplement traditional portfolios. Financial advisors suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a practical way to gain exposure to these assets without the typical drawbacks of direct investment, such as illiquidity and long lockup periods. This aligns with a broader trend, as investors have poured over $1 trillion into ETFs this year. While alternatives are gaining popularity, advisors still recommend they constitute a smaller portion of a portfolio, emphasizing that traditional stock and bond investing remains effective for long-term goals.

          <p>Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell has been elected as the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, defeating Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson. The election was triggered by the resignation of Angela Rayner last month. Powell ran on a platform promising to give grassroots members a stronger voice and to push for a "course correction" within the government, drawing support from members dissatisfied with the party's current direction under leader Keir Starmer. In her victory speech, Powell called for the party to be "bolder" and promised to be an ally to Starmer while also bringing critical voices to the forefront.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called off a planned deployment of federal agents to San Francisco after a direct phone call with Mayor Daniel Lurie and lobbying from billionaire CEOs, including Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Salesforce's Marc Benioff. The sudden reversal quelled a day of crisis in the Bay Area, though the president's decision was explicitly tied to being asked "very nicely" and the influence of his "friends." This capricious approach to a potential domestic military deployment has raised concerns about the basis for such critical decisions. The mayor reportedly presented positive crime and economic statistics to the president during their call.</p>

The negotiations aim to establish mechanisms to ensure stability, with the Afghan government focused on territorial integrity and Pakistan seeking to address what it calls "the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil."</p>
