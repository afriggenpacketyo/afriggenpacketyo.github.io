          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to address several hundred senior U.S. generals and admirals at a rare gathering in Quantico, Virginia, next week. He intends to outline his vision for restoring the "warrior ethos" within the military and introduce new standards to achieve this critical objective. This unusual event, bringing together command-level officers from across the globe, represents a significant opportunity for Hegseth to personally convey his strategic message and reinforce the administration's military priorities. The meeting has also sparked discussions regarding the logistical complexities, including heightened security requirements and the substantial travel and lodging costs associated with assembling such a large contingent of high-ranking military personnel, with video planned for public distribution.</p>

          <p>The Stan Lee Experience at Los Angeles Comic Con is debuting an AI-powered holographic image of the late comic book legend, offering attendees an interactive opportunity to engage with a digital avatar. This 1,500-square-foot booth features an AI model trained on decades of Stan Lee's footage, conversations, and writings, including his iconic "Stan Lee’s Soapbox." Developed by Proto Inc. and Hyperreal, the technology incorporates "guardrails" to ensure responses remain focused on the Stan Lee Universe, deliberately avoiding political or sports-related inquiries. This innovative project seeks to maintain and expand Lee's enduring legacy, providing fans with a unique, albeit virtual, connection to his creative storytelling world, while also showcasing potential future applications for this technology.</p>

          <p>Team Europe established a significant three-point lead over the United States on the opening day of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, marking their strongest start on American soil in 21 years. Europe dominated both the morning foursomes, winning 3-1, and the afternoon fourballs, securing a 2½-1½ advantage, culminating in a 5½-2½ overall lead. Key European players like Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood delivered crucial performances, contributing to their team's early success. US captain Keegan Bradley is already facing criticism for his strategic choices, particularly starting with foursomes, despite his insistence that the contest is far from over. Europe now stands as a strong favorite to maintain its impressive lead.</p>

The hosts asserted control early, building a commanding 18-0 lead by halftime with impressive tries from Keanan Brand, Isaac Liu, and Josh Charnley. Although Wakefield attempted a second-half comeback with Jayden Myers' score, Leigh effectively countered, securing their win with a Gareth O'Brien penalty and Alec Tuitavake's powerful try. This crucial victory now propels Leigh into a semi-final match against second-placed Wigan, as they aim to reach their first Grand Final, reflecting their strong season.</p>

          <p>As China begins drafting its 15th five-year plan, a comprehensive blueprint for the country's development, analysts are closely examining how Hong Kong's role as a "superconnector" linking the mainland with global markets could significantly evolve. Despite previous uncertainties, Hong Kong's economy has demonstrated resilience, marked by a rising stock index, a surge in fundraising, and growing appeal to international businesses and talent. Experts like Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ, underscore that Beijing's policy decisions within this forthcoming blueprint will profoundly shape Hong Kong's economic trajectory and the resources directed its way. This article explores the potential for the special administrative region to further strengthen its unique position within China's overarching economic strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting in Gyeongju, South Korea, is anticipated to serve as a crucial diplomatic platform for the US, China, and the two Koreas amidst rising regional tensions. With both Presidents Trump and Xi expected to attend, the summit could potentially pave the way for a US-North Korea summit or even a trilateral meeting involving South Korea, with mediation efforts from Beijing and Seoul. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's recent appearance at China’s Victory Day military parade and subsequent visit suggests a calculated step towards multilateral diplomacy, echoing his past strategy before summits with Trump. The non-binding nature of APEC is considered an ideal venue for building consensus and encouraging high-level dialogue on the Korean peninsula.</p>

          <p>Sinclair and Nexstar have announced the return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" to their ABC affiliate broadcast stations, ending a nearly week-long suspension of the late-night program. The show was temporarily preempted following comments Kimmel made regarding the alleged murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and President Donald Trump's MAGA movement. Both broadcast station owners asserted that their decisions were made independently of any government influence, emphasizing their commitment to local broadcasting responsibilities and First Amendment protections. They engaged in discussions with Disney, ABC's parent company, proposing measures to strengthen accountability, viewer feedback, and community dialogue, although these specific measures were not yet adopted by ABC.</p>

          <p>Chick-fil-A's innovation brand, Red Wagon Ventures, is set to launch a new beverage-focused standalone concept named "Daybright" this fall in Georgia, signaling a direct challenge to established coffee chains like Starbucks. Diverging from traditional Chick-fil-A restaurants, Daybright will exclusively offer innovative drink creations, including specialty coffees, smoothies, and cold-pressed juices, deliberately omitting the chain's signature food items or existing beverage menu, such as lemonade. This strategic expansion marks another significant step in Chick-fil-A's ongoing innovation efforts, following its "Little Blue Menu" concept, and is anticipated to serve as a crucial test market for potential future nationwide beverage offerings.</p>
