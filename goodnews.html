          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, John Cameron Mitchell reflects on his college speaking tour and observes that today's youth, burdened by screens and anxieties, need to rediscover the spirit of punk. He advocates for D.I.Y. collective action, community engagement, and empathy as antidotes to the isolation and division fostered by corporate-controlled culture. Mitchell encourages students to embrace the analog, seek unexpected allies, and create useful stories outside approved systems, suggesting that kindness and empathy are crucial in a world where facts are increasingly suspect.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that motherhood, and caregiving in general, should be recognized as a Hero's Journey, challenging the traditional narrative that only individualistic, external adventures qualify as such. The author suggests that caring for another person involves life-altering trials, triumphs, and profound insights, offering a new lens through which to view the complexities of family life. By reframing care as heroic, the article aims to promote greater respect for caregivers and encourage deeper investment in long-term connections, emphasizing the importance of human connection over rugged individualism.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how Dartmouth College, under President Sian Beilock, has navigated the contentious landscape of campus politics during the Trump administration. Unlike many of its Ivy League peers, Dartmouth has avoided major funding threats and investigations, possibly due to Dr. Beilock's approach of emphasizing free expression, engaging with conservatives, and taking a firm stance against disruptive protests.
