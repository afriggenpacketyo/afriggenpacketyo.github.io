          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a new record high, extending its gains for the tenth consecutive session, after the Finance Minister announced the government would abandon its previous plan to raise taxes on stock investments. This positive market movement occurred amidst mixed trading in other Asia-Pacific markets, as investors monitored U.S.-China talks in Spain and assessed a slate of economic data from Beijing, which indicated a slowdown. The decision to scrap the tax hike is seen as a significant boost to investor confidence and a key factor in the Kospi's robust performance, despite broader regional uncertainties.</p>

          <h2>California Legislature Approves Bill Banning Most Law Enforcement from Wearing Face Masks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 21:54:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 627, the "No Secret Police Act," which prohibits most local and federal law enforcement, including immigration agents, from wearing face coverings during operations. The bill aims to enhance transparency, build public trust, and prevent the impersonation of officers, though it includes limited exemptions for SWAT teams, undercover assignments, and medical masks. Supporters argue it counters "secret police" tactics and "rising fascism," while opponents, like the Department of Homeland Security, contend it compromises officer safety and ignores operational realities. The controversial bill now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, sparking debate over balancing transparency and security.</p>

          <p>Australia has approved a groundbreaking single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a leading cause of death, blindness, and infertility among the beloved marsupials. Developed over a decade by University of the Sunshine Coast researchers, this world-first vaccine aims to significantly reduce the disease's rapid spread, which affects up to 70% of some koala populations. Current antibiotic treatments are often ineffective or have adverse side effects, making this vaccine a crucial breakthrough in conservation efforts.

Credited with guiding the state into a period of greater financial stability in the 1990s, Edgar, a moderate, was known for cutting the state budget and making a temporary income tax surcharge permanent for public schools. Despite his popularity, he surprised many by declining a third term and later distanced himself from the Republican Party's shift to the right, even supporting Kamala Harris.
