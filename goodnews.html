          <p>Public companies are carefully navigating how to discuss the impact of tariffs on their financial results to avoid angering President Trump. Executives are using euphemisms and indirect language to describe the financial impacts of tariffs. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon acknowledged the retailer likely couldn't "absorb all the pressure" from tariffs, while Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz faced backlash after stating the company would raise prices due to tariffs. Advisers are suggesting companies focus on productivity increases and let CFOs handle tariff discussions to minimize potential conflict with the administration.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin briefly reached a new all-time high before slipping back as rising Treasury yields pressured risk assets. The cryptocurrency had been steadily climbing in May, buoyed by inflows into ETFs and optimism surrounding regulatory updates. However, the price has fluctuated as investors react to macroeconomic factors. On-chain data suggests lower selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market, with the number of bitcoin held by public companies continuing to grow. The Senate is also advancing legislation to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins.</p>

The ship had been buried in the sand at the bottom of the lake for decades before storms this winter apparently revealed it.</p>

          <p>Welcome House Raleigh, a ministry of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship of North Carolina, has agreed to resettle Afrikaners as refugees, despite the controversial nature of their status. The decision stems from the ministry's belief in extending a biblical welcome to all, regardless of their background. While acknowledging the history of apartheid, the ministry aims to provide temporary housing and furniture to the refugees. This decision contrasts with the Episcopal Church, which ended its refugee resettlement partnership due to concerns about racial justice.</p>
