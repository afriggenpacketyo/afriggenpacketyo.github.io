          <p>A resident of Leicester, North Carolina, is constructing his dream house using salvaged materials from the wreckage of Hurricane Helene, which devastated the region a year ago. John Saunby has gathered items like porch posts and kitchen floorboards from the debris, turning what was destined for a landfill into a unique home with features like Black Locust bark siding. With the help of his partner, an Appalachian recording artist, he is creating a home with what she calls "the soul of the world in it," representing a story of resilience and creative rebuilding after a natural disaster.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, has advanced to their seventh consecutive World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France. Player Ellie Kildunne was instrumental in the win, scoring two key tries upon her return from a concussion, which earned her the player of the match award. Despite a strong challenge from France that kept the contest close, particularly in the first half, England's dominance in the second half, highlighted by their powerful driving maul, ultimately secured their place in the tournament's final match.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's new striker, Hugo Ekitike, has made a remarkable start to his Premier League career, quickly becoming a fan favorite at Anfield after his £70 million transfer from Eintracht Frankfurt. His performance in the recent 2-1 Merseyside derby win against Everton, where he scored a crucial goal, has highlighted his quality, work ethic, and seamless integration into the team. Ekitike's success presents a welcome challenge for head coach Arne Slot, who now has the enviable task of deciding how to best utilize both him and British record signing Alexander Isak in the forward line.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, typically reserved for wartime or national emergencies, to clear the nation's significant asylum application backlog. The plan involves establishing temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of caseworkers to expedite decisions and reduce the costly reliance on housing asylum seekers in hotels. This focus on law and order and immigration policy marks a key platform for the party, which argues the move would create a more humane and efficient system while saving taxpayer money.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after an exceptionally chaotic qualifying session that was interrupted by a record six red flags. Numerous crashes, including one by championship contender Oscar Piastri, repeatedly halted the session, creating a challenging environment for all drivers. Verstappen managed to set the fastest time in the final moments after the last restart, positioning himself ahead of Williams' Carlos Sainz and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson for the start of the race, while several other top drivers, including Lewis Hamilton, qualified much lower than expected.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes reached new all-time highs this week, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point. This first rate reduction since last December signaled a more accommodative monetary policy, with central bankers suggesting two more cuts could follow in 2025. The move boosted investor confidence, leading to strong weekly gains in the stock market, particularly in the technology sector. The article also notes key company news, including a strong outlook from CrowdStrike and a new partnership between Nvidia and Intel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has used new "golden share" rights to block U.S. Steel from idling its plant in Granite City, Illinois, and laying off nearly 800 workers. These rights, a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon, grant the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick intervened, the company reversed its decision to halt operations, marking the first time the administration has exercised this power and highlighting its increasing influence in the private sector to protect American jobs.

Lewinsky credits younger generations, who viewed her story with fresh eyes, for helping shift public perception and emphasized the importance of women telling their own stories to counter misogynistic narratives and reclaim their identities.</p>

          <p>Since President Trump returned to office, the United States has noticeably reduced its public announcements of warship transits through the Taiwan Strait, a practice that was routine under the previous administration. While Beijing has historically criticized the "public hype" around these operations, some Chinese observers view this change as a tactical shift rather than a substantive change in U.S. policy, as the military still confirms the transits when asked by the media. This quieter approach may be an attempt to manage tensions with China while still maintaining a presence in the strategically sensitive waterway.</p>
