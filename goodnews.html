          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has recognized that Beijing is making significant strides in controlling the flow of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, into the United States. This statement represents a notable change in tone from his previous stance, where he used the fentanyl issue as a justification for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. The remarks were delivered during ongoing high-level trade negotiations aimed at resolving the tariff conflict between the two economic powers. The comments coincided with his signing of the HALT Fentanyl Act into law.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill designed to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. Having already passed the Senate, the legislation seeks to implement consumer protections and establish clear legal definitions for the $250 billion market. Proponents, including President Trump and major financial firms, believe that regulating stablecoins will enable faster, more efficient financial transactions and reinforce the U.S. dollar's role in the digital economy.

          <p>United Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's profit expectations and issued a strong forecast for the rest of 2025. CEO Scott Kirby expressed confidence in a strong finish to the year, stating that the world is "less uncertain" and that travel demand is picking up after a slow start. The airline now projects full-year adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share. While profits were strong, quarterly revenue of $15.24 billion slightly missed analyst estimates, with domestic unit revenue showing some weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

Net income rose 15% to $3.54 billion, with the institutional securities and wealth management segments both delivering strong revenue growth due to higher client activity and asset management fees, respectively.

          <p>India secured a four-wicket victory against England in the first one-day international, successfully chasing a target of 259 with 10 balls to spare. All-rounder Deepti Sharma was the star performer, guiding the tourists with a crucial unbeaten 62. Despite a late-innings wobble, Amanjot Kaur's composed 20 not out ensured India completed their second-highest successful ODI chase. For England, Sophia Dunkley's 83 and Alice Davidson-Richards' 53 were the standout performances, but a sloppy fielding effort and a failure to accelerate their run rate ultimately cost them the match.</p>

The Trump administration reversed its ban on Nvidia's H20 chips, a move seen as a direct result of Huang's persistent argument that restricting access to the Chinese market undermines U.S. tech leadership. Huang has adeptly cultivated relationships with both the U.S. administration and the Chinese tech community, a diplomatic effort analysts say has been crucial for the company's continued success and market dominance.

Known for their plain, tender, and empathetic verse, Gibson's work often explored themes of love, kindness, and social justice with an unselfconscious earnestness.
