          <p>A federal judge in California ruled that the Trump administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act by deploying National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration enforcement. The ruling prohibits using military forces for domestic law enforcement activities like arrests or crowd control within California, though troops can still protect federal property. The injunction is stayed until September 12, allowing for an appeal, and Governor Gavin Newsom praised the decision as a defense of democracy against presidential overreach. The White House indicated it would appeal, criticizing the judge's decision as an attempt to usurp the commander-in-chief's authority.</p>

This transition marks a new era for the iconic fashion magazine, with Malle expressing excitement for the evolving media landscape and Wintour's continued mentorship.

          <p>Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst has officially announced she will not seek reelection in 2026 after serving two terms. Ernst, 55, was the first woman to represent Iowa in the Senate and the first female combat veteran in the chamber. Her decision, following prayer and reflection, opens up a competitive Senate seat in Iowa, a state where Democrats hope to gain ground in the midterm elections, despite its strong Republican leanings. Ernst highlighted her legislative achievements in her announcement, including work on preventing violence against women and supporting farmers.</p>

          <p>Barbara Quart, a 90-year-old Manhattan woman, has painted almost daily for three decades, creating hundreds of works never publicly displayed. Following her cancer diagnosis, her daughter, Alissa Quart, began sharing her mother's art, selling some and gifting others, to bring her mother's joy to new homes. This initiative has transformed the paintings into a public affirmation of Barbara's vision and a way to preserve the deep connection between mother and daughter. The process has been described as both challenging and magical, bringing happiness to Barbara as people appreciate her work.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is strategically expanding its focus on professional contractors through significant acquisitions like SRS Distribution and a proposed bid for GMS, totaling over $22 billion. A key aspect of this strategy is SRS's trade credit program, allowing contractors to purchase supplies and pay later, which analysts call a "hidden gem" for Home Depot. This approach positions the company as both an advisor and financier for complex projects, a capability it previously lacked. The shift aims to capture a larger share of the $250 billion pro market, providing steadier revenue growth compared to the more volatile DIY segment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Tax Experts Highlight 'Golden Opportunity' for 0% Capital Gains Under Trump's New Legislation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 13:17:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to utilize the 0% capital gains bracket under President Donald Trump's new "big beautiful bill." With increased deductions for 2025, more investors may qualify to sell profitable assets without incurring taxes. This strategy, known as "tax-gain harvesting," allows for trimming concentrated positions or rebalancing portfolios tax-free. Additionally, some use it to reset their cost basis, potentially leading to future tax savings. Investors are advised to consider these strategies within their broader financial plans, including legacy goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Independent rural hospitals are increasingly forming "clinically integrated networks" like North Dakota's Rough Rider Network to survive without being acquired by larger systems. These collaborative groups allow hospitals to pool patient rolls for better value-based care contracts and negotiate lower prices for expensive equipment, such as mobile MRI units. The networks also share specialists, invest in community development, and centralize services like employee health insurance. While academic studies on their effectiveness are limited, proponents claim they reduce costs and improve patient outcomes, offering a vital alternative to closures in underserved areas.</p>

          <p>Reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners to convert equity into cash without monthly payments, are becoming a popular option for retirees. While generally easier to qualify for than traditional mortgages due to no credit score requirement, they are not automatic.

Additionally, mandatory counseling ensures borrowers understand the loan's implications. Improving chances involves reducing debt, maintaining good payment history, and documenting income or assets.
