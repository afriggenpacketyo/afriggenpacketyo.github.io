          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, with a 101.7% year-over-year spike, following similar increases in the prior months. The Japanese government has released emergency stockpiles to moderate prices of this staple food, yet core inflation climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023. JP Morgan Asset Management strategist Marcella Chow notes that rice accounts for about 50% of Japan's core inflation, making food prices a key factor in future inflation trends. Government measures to reduce rice prices could boost household spending if extended to processed foods and restaurant prices (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China's central bank maintained its benchmark lending rates, keeping the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, after cutting rates last month for the first time since October. This decision comes as a trade deal with the U.S. eases some growth worries, with both countries agreeing to honor the consensus reached in Geneva. Nomura economists have trimmed their rate-cut forecast for the fourth quarter, suggesting Chinese authorities may exercise limited urgency in rolling out additional fiscal stimulus. Chinese policymakers seem satisfied with the current monetary policy stance, exploring alternative avenues to stimulate economic growth (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>At a recent high-level summit, China and its Central Asian partners expressed shared security concerns, presenting a united front amidst global turbulence. The close ties between China and the five Central Asian countries have sparked questions about Russia's regional dominance as it remains focused on the conflict in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed these concerns, emphasizing that China is a privileged strategic partner and Central Asian countries are natural historical partners. However, diplomatic observers note that Moscow's capacity to counterbalance China's growing influence is limited.</p>

Zuckerberg's strategy escalates the AI talent war, with Meta, Google, and OpenAI competing to develop powerful large language models.

          <h2>Judge Rules Blake Lively Must Disclose Texts With Taylor Swift in Legal Battle</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 18:56:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A judge has denied Blake Lively's motion to keep text messages with Taylor Swift confidential in her legal battle against "It Ends With Us" co-star Justin Baldoni. The judge ruled that since Lively represented Swift had knowledge of complaints about the film's working environment, the texts are relevant to her harassment and retaliation claims. Lively's team claims Baldoni is exploiting Swift's popularity to influence her fan base, while Baldoni's team subpoenaed Swift earlier this year but eventually withdrew it.</p>
