        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A marital dispute reported on Reddit has sparked a wider online debate about food safety. The conflict began when a man refused to eat a meal his wife was preparing with a raw chicken that had been accidentally left in their car's trunk for several hours. While some social media users felt the risk was minimal if cooked thoroughly, a food scientist confirmed the husband's fears, noting that even if cooking kills bacteria, heat-resistant toxins can remain, making the chicken unsafe to consume. The incident highlights common uncertainties regarding proper food handling and the risks of foodborne illness.</p>

          <p>Founded in 1903, the same year as Ford Motor Company, Pewabic Pottery in Detroit has survived over a century by focusing on handcrafted artistry rather than mass production. The studio, known for its unique iridescent glazes and architectural tiles, has weathered Detroit's economic booms and busts, including the Great Depression and the city's bankruptcy. Now operating as a nonprofit, Pewabic continues to use its original equipment and techniques, blending tradition with a sustainable business model. The pottery's resilience and renewed popularity reflect a growing appreciation for artisanal goods in an increasingly automated world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising home equity and changes in the retirement landscape, reverse mortgages are becoming a more considered option for seniors. This article examines how much a 70-year-old homeowner can currently borrow, noting the 2025 FHA loan limit increase to $1,209,750. Using the Principal Limit Factor (PLF), a 70-year-old could access approximately 41% of their home's value, translating to a significant sum before fees and other costs. The article suggests that strategies like choosing a line of credit and comparing lender fees can maximize the benefits of this financial tool for supplementing retirement income.

          <p>Electric aircraft developer Joby Aviation is partnering with defense contractor L3Harris to create a next-generation military aircraft capable of both piloted and autonomous flight. The vehicle will be a hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) craft based on Joby's designs but equipped with a gas turbine for military applications. The partnership aims to address evolving defense needs, focusing on surveillance, reconnaissance, and logistics in contested environments. This collaboration signals a push towards smaller, more adaptable, and potentially autonomous aircraft for modern military operations, with testing expected to begin this fall.</p>

          <p>In a highly unusual event, infielder José Caballero was traded from the Tampa Bay Rays to the New York Yankees in the middle of a game between the two teams. Caballero started the game playing for the Rays, even recording a pop-out in the sixth inning, before being informed of the trade. He was seen saying goodbye to his stunned Rays teammates in the dugout during the seventh inning. After the game, which the Yankees won, Caballero joked that he was "winning today regardless" and expressed his honor in joining the team he rooted for as a child.</p>

          <p>The documentary "Folktales," from filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, follows three Scandinavian teenagers attending a remote Norwegian folk high school. The school's unique curriculum uses dog-sledding and wilderness survival to help students build character and connect with nature, away from their phone screens. The review describes the film as a handsomely photographed and heartwarming look at the teens' journey toward self-reliance and inner peace. While not a deep sociological probe, the film effectively sells its simple message about the healing power of nature, camaraderie, and the bond between humans and animals.</p>

          <h2>Evaluating Credit Card Debt Forgiveness as a Strategy Amid Paused Interest Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 13:39:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate hikes, credit card debt forgiveness remains a viable strategy for those with significant balances. The article argues that since average credit card APRs are still near record highs around 22%, waiting for potential future rate cuts is unlikely to provide substantial relief. For consumers struggling with minimum payments or nearing default, negotiating a settlement to reduce the principal debt can be more effective than hoping for marginal rate drops. This approach can offer a more immediate path out of debt, though it does come with a short-term negative impact on one's credit score.</p>
