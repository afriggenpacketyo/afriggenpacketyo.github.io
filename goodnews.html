          <p>Foxconn, a major Apple supplier, has been granted approval by the Indian government to establish a semiconductor plant in collaboration with HCL Group, representing a $433 million investment. The facility, situated in Uttar Pradesh, is projected to commence operations by 2027, manufacturing display driver chips for various electronics. This deal aligns with Apple suppliers' increasing shift towards India, seeking diversification away from China amidst ongoing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. The plant aims to produce up to 20,000 wafers and 36 million display driver chips monthly, catering to the growing demand for semiconductors in the region.</p>

          <p>Senator John Kennedy argues that the Supreme Court should seize the opportunity to eliminate universal injunctions, which allow individual district court judges to halt federal government policies nationwide. He asserts that this practice grants excessive power to judges, undermining the judicial system and forcing the Supreme Court to rush decisions on complex legal issues. Kennedy emphasizes that this is not an ideological or partisan issue, as justices from across the political spectrum have expressed concerns about universal injunctions. He hopes the court will end this unlawful practice to stabilize the judiciary and the system of government.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is hearing arguments regarding President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children born in the US to undocumented immigrants. The case focuses on whether lower court judges can issue nationwide injunctions to block presidential orders. Trump's administration argues that the phrase "jurisdiction thereof" in the 14th Amendment does not apply to children of undocumented immigrants. Legal experts contend that the president lacks the authority to end birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, potentially impacting tens of thousands of children and leading to statelessness.</p>

          <p>A UK political opinion poll tracker reveals that Labour's support has significantly declined since their landslide victory last summer, while Reform has gained momentum. Reform even held the voting intention lead for the entire month of February, marking the first time in over a century that neither major party held the top spot. The polls indicate that support for Reform has grown across all demographic groups, particularly among younger voters, while Labour's support has slumped across all generations. The Prime Minister's approval ratings have also declined, with recent polls showing him more negatively perceived than Nigel Farage.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, surpassing analysts' forecasts, driven primarily by the services sector. However, economists warn that this strong growth rate is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the UK's faster growth compared to other major economies, critics pointed out downgraded growth forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility and the International Monetary Fund.

          <p>The UK's faster-than-expected GDP growth in the first quarter provides some welcome relief for the Labour government, which is facing pressure from Nigel Farage's Reform and internal divisions over tax and spending. The 0.7% increase in GDP is attributed to the services sector, although manufacturing also contributed positively. While some analysts suggest that this growth may be a "before" picture, reflecting activity pulled forward ahead of looming tariffs, the US-China trade deal has eased some concerns. The article notes that the impact of the ¬£25bn employer national insurance contributions rise, which came into effect in April, has yet to be fully seen.</p>

          <h2>Harvard Law School Discovers Original Magna Carta in its Collection</h2>

          <p>Two British academics discovered that a manuscript held in Harvard Law School's library is an original 1300 version of Magna Carta, not a copy as previously thought. The document, purchased for $27.50 after World War II, is one of only seven such originals still in existence. The discovery was made by chance while Professor David Carpenter was researching for a book. The finding is particularly significant given the challenges Harvard has faced recently, with Professor Nicholas Vincent noting that the document resurfaced at a time when Harvard has come under extraordinary pressure from the Trump administration.</p>
