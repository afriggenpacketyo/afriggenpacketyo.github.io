        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping global trade tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose such tariffs, as the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The court's decision was based on two separate cases brought by small businesses and a coalition of US state governments. The White House has criticized the ruling, stating that unelected judges should not decide how to address a national emergency, while state attorneys general have welcomed the decision, arguing that the tariffs would lead to inflation and job losses. Global markets have responded positively to the ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>United Airlines is set to return to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport through a new partnership with JetBlue Airways, named Blue Sky, allowing JetBlue customers to earn frequent flyer miles on United and vice versa, including reciprocal loyalty benefits. The partnership stops short of flight coordination that JetBlue had in its former alliance in the Northeast with American Airlines, which was struck down by a federal court on antitrust grounds. JetBlue's leaders have long said they need a partnership to better compete against larger airlines like United and their shared rival Delta Air Lines. Some aspects of the partnership will begin as early as the fall, though the airlines didn't provide exact timing.</p>

          <p>A US trade court in New York blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, stating that the president had overstepped his authority by imposing massive duties on imports from trading partners. Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed hope for expanding a trans-Pacific free trade pact, citing growing protectionist moves in an apparent reference to Trump's tariff policy. Japan and Laos also agreed to deepen cooperation in security, economy, and green energy, and Toyota reported a 10% increase in global sales ahead of the impact of higher US tariffs on imported cars.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance addressed the Bitcoin 2025 conference, promoting the Trump administration's efforts to pass stablecoin legislation, viewing them as a force multiplier for the US economy rather than a threat to the dollar. Republicans are attempting to pass the GENIUS Act, a bill that would regulate digital assets, though it faces potential challenges in the House. Democrats previously rejected the act due to concerns about President Trump's personal cryptocurrency ventures creating a conflict of interest. David Sacks, President Trump's top crypto and AI advisor, believes a legal framework for stablecoins could create trillions of dollars of demand for US Treasuries. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite facing headwinds from uncertainty around tariff policy in the U.S. and chip export restrictions to China, Nvidia's financial results beat market expectations, allaying fears about demand for its graphics processing units. The company wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory due to export curbs, but still managed to post strong numbers, sparking positive movement in semiconductor stocks across Japan, South Korea, and Europe.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Advocates are pushing for the adoption of single-staircase designs for apartment buildings up to six stories tall in the US, arguing that modernizing building codes could unleash more affordable housing nationwide. The current double-staircase standard, rooted in historical fire safety concerns, adds significant construction costs and limits design flexibility. Allowing single-stair construction could cut costs by about 10 percent, encourage developers to build more "missing middle" housing, and enable more varied unit layouts. While fire safety officials express concerns about safety, advocates argue that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair designs just as safe, drawing comparisons to countries where single-stair buildings are common.</p>

          <p>Walton Goggins' chances of winning an Emmy for his role in Season 3 of ‚ÄúThe White Lotus‚Äù are examined, noting his previous critically acclaimed performances and limited Emmy recognition. Despite starring in six shows with high Rotten Tomatoes scores, Goggins has only received two Emmy nominations. The analysis suggests that his past roles in gritty shows may not have appealed to Emmy voters, while the Emmy-friendly nature of ‚ÄúThe White Lotus‚Äù and the high number of nominations the show receives may increase his chances, though he could face competition from his co-stars. The likelihood of his success hinges on the appeal of his character, Rick, and the show's overall popularity.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on the rise of cruelty in public discourse and the need to embrace subversive kindness. Drawing historical parallels to the rise of fascism in the US, the piece contrasts the images of exploitation with acts of hospitality and human connection. The author advocates for promoting images of fraternity and breaking down cultural walls, citing Pope Francis's visit to a prison as an example of embracing prisoners and welcoming those from foreign lands. The piece suggests that small moments of encounter can transform individuals and combat the dehumanizing effects of mass content consumption.</p>
