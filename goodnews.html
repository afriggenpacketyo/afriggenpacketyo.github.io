          <p>Index funds, which have long dominated the market, are seeing a resurgence of active management, with actively managed ETFs experiencing net inflows while index funds see outflows. This trend marks a potential transformation in the ETF space, with a record number of new ETFs launching this year and active ETFs now rivaling index ETFs in number. Investors are advised to consider factors like R-squared to assess a fund's active nature and to avoid panic trading during market volatility, remembering that time in the market is more important than timing the market. This shift is also driven by younger retail investors and the increasing use of active ETFs by registered investment advisors. (not investment advice)</p>
