        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the rise and fall of the tech right's support for Donald Trump, noting a shift in Silicon Valley politics from left-libertarianism to a more conservative stance driven by factors like the "Great Awokening," macroeconomic changes, and perceived attacks from liberals. Despite some deregulation and tax cuts, the tech right's priorities were largely ignored by the Trump administration, leading to disappointment and a potential fracturing of the coalition. The author suggests Democrats should consider winning back voters disillusioned by Trump's failures, acknowledging that the initial alliance was a bad bet for the tech industry. This analysis highlights the complex interplay between tech, politics, and economic policy.</p>

          <p>During a New York mayoral debate, Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani engaged in combative exchanges regarding their qualifications and records. Cuomo criticized Mamdani's inexperience, while Mamdani attacked Cuomo's past controversies, including allegations of sexual harassment. The candidates also discussed sanctuary city policies and outreach to Muslim communities, with Mamdani accusing a Cuomo-aligned group of Islamophobia. Brad Lander criticized Cuomo for his use of the term "illegal immigrants" and accused him of avoiding accountability for his time in office.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch called for an end to the windfall tax on oil and gas companies and advocated for new drilling licenses in the North Sea. Speaking at the Scottish Conservative party conference, Badenoch argued the tax, known as the Energy Profits Levy, should be scrapped before its 2030 expiration, claiming there is no longer a windfall to tax. Opposition politicians criticized Badenoch's comments, while the End Fuel Poverty Coalition deemed them "out of touch." Badenoch emphasized the importance of energy security and criticized Labour's extension of the tax, while supporters of the current windfall tax say it will provide necessary governmental revenue. </p>

          <p>USA Fencing's board of directors has amended its policy that prioritized states with LGBTQ-friendly laws for competition host sites and a policy that restricted the playing of the national anthem at some events. The decision follows criticism over the punishment of a fencer who refused to compete against a trans opponent and scrutiny from federal lawmakers. The new policy prioritizes cost, safety, and convenience for all national-event bids, while the national anthem policy aims to provide consistent guidance across tournaments. The organization is also preparing to change its policy allowing trans athletes to compete in the women's category, requiring athletes to compete according to their biological sex if forced to change its stance.</p>

          <p>A new poll indicates that Elon Musk has lost some popularity among Republicans following his public falling-out with Donald Trump. Fewer Republicans now view Musk "very favorably" compared to April, suggesting his opposition to Trump's policies and subsequent online taunts have diminished his standing within the party. While most Republicans still hold a positive view of Musk, the intensity of their enthusiasm has decreased. The poll also reveals that Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company, is viewed less favorably than its peers, highlighting business implications of Musk's political stances.</p>

          <p>Despite heightened tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Blocking the strait, through which roughly 20 million barrels of oil pass daily, would likely trigger further retaliation and negatively impact Iran's largest oil customer, China. Some analysts argue that a full-scale disruption of global oil flows by closing the waterway might even be physically impossible. While Iran has previously threatened to close the strait, experts suggest such action would be a last resort and could be more detrimental to Tehran than its adversaries.</p>
