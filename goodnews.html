          <p>UFC chief Dana White's contentious interaction with a reporter about his new boxing role and the Muhammad Ali Act largely overshadowed the press conference for the Canelo Alvarez vs. Terence Crawford super-fight. White's efforts to amend the act, which critics argue could restrict fighters and create a monopoly, sparked a fiery response from him. Despite the media distraction, both boxers conveyed mutual respect and determination, with Alvarez acknowledging the 50-50 nature of the contest. The bout, set to be streamed globally on Netflix, signifies a new, albeit uncertain, chapter for the sport's promotion under White and Saudi backing.</p>

          <p>A recent International Workplace Group report indicates that Gen Z employees are spearheading the adoption of artificial intelligence in the workplace by actively coaching their older colleagues. Nearly two-thirds of younger staff are providing hands-on guidance and sharing practical tips, fostering a significant knowledge exchange that bridges generational divides. This collaboration is seen as highly beneficial, with 82% of senior directors crediting these innovations with unlocking new business opportunities and allowing them to focus on higher-value tasks. The survey also found that 86% of employees believe AI boosts their efficiency, saving an average of 55 minutes daily and enhancing hybrid team operations.</p>

          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper is emerging as a significant contender against SpaceX's Starlink in the burgeoning satellite internet sector, recently securing its first in-flight WiFi contract with JetBlue for services starting in 2027. While Starlink currently holds a dominant position with thousands more satellites and a larger customer base, this win injects new competition into the market. Amazon plans to deploy over 3,200 satellites by 2029, aiming to bridge the gap with its rival. The overall low Earth orbit satellite market is poised for massive expansion, driven by the anticipated rollout of 6G communications and the need to provide global internet access.

          <p>California's Assembly has approved Senate Bill 79, a contentious housing bill set to override local zoning regulations to significantly increase high-density housing near public transit corridors. The proposed legislation, awaiting final Senate concurrence and the Governor's signature, would allow for taller structures—up to nine stories—adjacent to specific transit stops, and up to six stories within a half-mile, including single-family neighborhoods. Proponents emphasize the necessity of these measures to combat the state's severe affordability crisis, while opponents criticize it as an overreach that diminishes local control and threatens community character. The bill's passage was bolstered by amendments that secured crucial support from a powerful labor union.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) presents a vital solution to the escalating challenges facing the global multilateral order. It argues that the post-World War II system, symbolized by the United Nations, is faltering due to unilateralism, trade wars, and the marginalization of the Global South in decision-making processes. The article warns of a world drifting towards fragmentation, where tariffs and sanctions supersede negotiation, and international law is often disregarded. It positions the SCO as a platform that, by fostering cooperation among states with diverse cultures and political systems, can effectively address these systemic ailments and promote a more stable international environment.</p>
