        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic uncertainty and inflation persist, investors are increasingly turning to gold as a safe-haven asset, driving its price close to $3,300 per ounce. Experts recommend considering gold's price in context, understanding the different investment types like physical gold and ETFs, and being aware of tax implications. Investors should also assess liquidity when choosing between physical gold and ETFs, as physical gold is considered a collectible by the IRS and may be taxed at a higher rate. Strategies include a 'buy and hold' approach for physical gold and using ETFs for short-term exposure to gold prices. (not investment advice)</p>

He contrasted the situation with a previous game in Jacksonville, describing it as miserable, and voiced a preference for dry heat over humidity.

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is renaming its streaming platform from Max back to HBO Max, reversing a change made just two years prior. The decision reflects a shift in strategy to focus on high-quality programming over a large volume of content, aiming to emphasize the prestige and quality associated with the HBO brand. CEO David Zaslav stated that bringing back HBO will accelerate growth, while executives like JB Perrette highlighted the platform's distinct and great programming for adults and families. The move comes as legacy media companies grapple with achieving profitability in the streaming business and prioritize advertising tiers and service bundles.</p>

          <p>The United States announced plans to lift sanctions on Syria, a decision celebrated by Syrians who hope for economic recovery and stability. The move, influenced by discussions with Saudi Arabia and Turkey, aims to aid the new Syrian leadership in rebuilding the war-torn country. Lifting sanctions is expected to facilitate aid deliveries and encourage investments from wealthy neighbors, with potential for significant investments in the oil and gas sector by Turkey. Experts believe the Syrian economy faces immense challenges, needing substantial investment to revive industries and resettle displaced populations, but the sanctions relief is a critical first step.</p>

          <p>Researchers are exploring methods to extract valuable rare earth metals from wastewater, including the toxic brew in Montana's Berkeley Pit, to boost U.S. production for technologies like electric vehicles and defense. The Berkeley Pit contains 50 billion gallons of acidic water rich in elements like neodymium and praseodymium, essential for magnets in electric vehicles and military applications. Extracting metals from wastewater is considered more economical and environmentally friendly than traditional mining. The process involves using specialized technologies to separate and refine these metals, potentially transforming liabilities into valuable resources and reducing reliance on foreign suppliers like China.</p>

The committee passed its portion of the legislation along party lines, but the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) remains a point of contention. The proposed bill would raise the SALT cap to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less. However, some House lawmakers are pushing for a higher limit before the full House vote, while the legislation is expected to face significant changes in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it is reviewing ingestible fluoride prescription drug products for children, aiming to remove them from the market. While fluoride is known to strengthen tooth enamel and reduce cavities, the FDA cited concerns that ingested fluoride may alter the gut microbiome and potentially link to thyroid disorders and decreased IQ. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. supports ending the use of ingestible fluoride, while dental experts largely disagree, emphasizing fluoride's safety and effectiveness in preventing dental decay.

Trust is a key criterion for family offices, often prioritizing long-term relationships over expertise. Young employees are reluctant to work at family offices due to the lack of corporate structure and the perception of it being a "retirement job." To attract talent, some families are willing to pay a salary premium, or "trust delta," and European family offices are offering bonuses and co-investment opportunities.</p>

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was elected as mayor in his home city by a landslide, official results showed Tuesday, despite his detention by the International Criminal Court. The Davao election board proclaimed Duterte won the race for Davao mayor, with the official tally showing that he garnered over 660,000 votes, or eight times as many as his closest rival. Elated supporters chanted "Duterte, Duterte" when the result was announced. His youngest son, Sebastian, the incumbent mayor of Davao, was declared Davao vice mayor.</p>
