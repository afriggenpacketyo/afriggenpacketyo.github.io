          <p>An analysis of Donald Trump's planned meeting with the presidents of Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal explores the potential motivations behind the unusual summit. While the administration frames the meeting around commercial opportunities, experts suggest the focus may be on securing access to critical minerals and cooperation on controlling migration and drug trafficking routes. For the African leaders, many of whom face domestic legitimacy challenges, the meeting offers a significant boost to their international standing and a valuable political photo opportunity.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government is set to amend its Employment Rights Bill to provide statutory bereavement leave for parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. Currently, paid leave is only guaranteed for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time to grieve, a move praised by campaigners and MPs as a major step in formally recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement rather than just a medical issue.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that exercising between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. is associated with a lower risk of obesity and a smaller average waist size compared to working out at other times. However, fitness and wellness experts emphasize that this benefit is highly dependent on getting adequate rest, recommending seven to eight hours of sleep per night. They advise that for those who are sleep-deprived but already active, prioritizing an extra hour of sleep is likely more beneficial than an early-morning workout.</p>

          <p>Oscar Black, a 15-year-old from County Armagh, has set a new record by becoming the youngest person to swim the notoriously difficult North Channel solo. He completed the 46-kilometer (28.5-mile) swim from the Gobbins to Portpatrick in 16 hours and 38 minutes. To achieve the feat, he had to overcome powerful currents that stalled his progress for hours and endure up to 20 jellyfish stings, demonstrating immense physical and mental fortitude.</p>

          <p>As many U.S. cities adopt tougher policies, Los Angeles County is embracing the principle of harm reduction to manage its large homeless population and associated substance use challenges. A new Skid Row Care Campus provides services like clean syringes and overdose prevention supplies alongside traditional addiction treatment. This approach, which aims to save lives and improve public health without mandating immediate sobriety, stands in contrast to the national political push for more punitive, enforcement-based measures.</p>

Critics argue their high omega-6 fatty acid content and chemical refining processes promote chronic inflammation. However, many nutrition scientists counter that clinical trials do not support these claims, asserting that these oils are healthier than saturated fats and that the primary health issue is their widespread use in ultra-processed foods.</p>

          <p>The recent youth-led protests in Kenya are drawing strong parallels to the pivotal "Saba Saba" (July 7th) demonstrations of the 1990s, which successfully pushed for a multi-party democracy. Analysts observe that while today's movement is decentralized and technologically driven, the core grievances of corruption, economic injustice, and state-sanctioned violence remain strikingly similar. The government's forceful response also mirrors the past, but activists note that attempts at intimidation are now fueling greater resistance rather than fear.</p>

          <p>The distinct flavor of American chocolate, often perceived as slightly sour or tangy by those accustomed to European varieties, is largely due to the use of butyric acid to increase shelf life. While European chocolate recipes are strictly regulated to ensure higher cocoa content and the use of cocoa butter, U.S. brands often contain more sugar and other additives. These differences reflect divergent historical paths in chocolate production and deeply ingrained, regional consumer preferences.</p>
