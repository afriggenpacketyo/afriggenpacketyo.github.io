          <p>Nuno Espirito Santo has been appointed as West Ham's new manager, with analysis suggesting his tactical approach aligns well with the club's current squad. His preference for low-possession, counter-attacking football, previously seen at Wolves and Nottingham Forest, is expected to minimize West Ham's defensive weaknesses and maximize strengths of players like Jarrod Bowen. The article highlights Nuno's adaptability and strong interpersonal skills, which are crucial for improving team morale after reports of player discord with the previous manager. This appointment signals a return to a more pragmatic style, aiming to leverage the team's transition-heavy attacking capabilities.</p>

          <p>China has scheduled a pivotal Politburo meeting to discuss the upcoming 15th five-year plan, which will outline the nation's strategic direction for 2026-2030. President Xi Jinping has previously stressed the importance of a forward-looking approach, considering the dynamic international environment. This high-level gathering, involving over 370 Central Committee members, is set to occur approximately one week before Xi's anticipated meeting with US President Donald Trump at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. The plan's final endorsement in March's legislative session will be instrumental in shaping China's future development and global standing.</p>

Plans include public events, the launch of a new Premiership Women's Rugby season with expanded media coverage, and significant investment in grassroots development through the "Impact 25" program. Despite past failures to capitalize on men's World Cup success, the Rugby Football Union has pre-loaded legacy efforts, leading to a 35% increase in age-grade girl players.

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, has achieved a clear victory and a new parliamentary majority in elections marred by accusations of "massive Russian interference." Despite bomb scares at polling stations and alleged plots for unrest, PAS secured 50% of the vote, signaling Moldova's continued path towards EU integration. Opposition leaders, notably Igor Dodon, prematurely claimed victory and called for protests, which officials blamed on Moscow-backed criminal groups. The article highlights the country's struggle with Russian influence, including the pro-Russian Transnistria enclave, and ongoing challenges like inflation and corruption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metropolitan Police is consulting on a policy that would compel officers to declare their membership in Freemasonry, aiming to address concerns about impartiality, conflicts of loyalty, and the force's reputation. This move stems from recommendations in the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel report, which highlighted "recurring suspicion and mistrust" surrounding Freemason ties in past investigations. While not banning membership, the policy would require disclosure to superiors. London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan previously opposed a compulsory register on human rights grounds, but the Met emphasizes strengthening trust as a core part of its "New Met for London" plan.</p>

          <p>The increasing decline of traditional American malls and shopping centers is creating new, more favorable real estate opportunities for small, local business owners. Rising vacancy rates, currently at 5.8%, allow entrepreneurs like health practitioners and artists to negotiate better rents and flexible lease terms in prime commercial spaces previously out of reach. This trend is driven by a softening demand for traditional retail and a shift towards service-based businesses that offer unique community experiences. While rental rates are still increasing, their slower pace, combined with landlords' desire to fill empty spaces, provides a lifeline for smaller enterprises.</p>

          <p>Shares in Sony Financial Group surged 36% on its market debut Monday after parent company Sony Group spun off the unit, which includes Sony Life Insurance, Sony Assurance, and Sony Bank. The spin-off, valuing the company at over $6.7 billion, allows the financial arm to raise its own growth capital while maintaining brand ties with the wider Sony ecosystem. Sony cited competing investment demands in entertainment and semiconductors as a key reason for the separation. Meanwhile, broader Japanese markets saw declines, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose, ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy meeting where interest rates are expected to hold steady.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article offers guidance on identifying and managing "energy vampire" friends—individuals who tend to deplete one's emotional resources through constant complaining, self-focus, or a lack of genuine interest. Psychologist Suzy Reading and journalist Radhika Sanghani explain common signs, such as an excessive need for attention or subtle mood-chipping behaviors. They suggest three strategies: having an honest conversation about feeling unheard, setting clear boundaries if the friend is unwilling to change, and altering shared activities to reduce opportunities for dominance. The goal is to protect one's well-being while potentially maintaining the friendship.</p>
