        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Euro 2025 draw has placed England and Wales in what is being called the most difficult group, alongside formidable opponents France and the Netherlands. This "group of death" features three teams ranked in the top 11 globally, creating a highly competitive early stage for the tournament. Experts and team managers acknowledge the challenge, with data from Opta suggesting a 37% chance that the eventual tournament winner will emerge from this group. While England are the defending champions and the Netherlands won in 2017, they face a French team on an eight-game winning streak and a determined Welsh side making their tournament debut.</p>

          <h2>A Cultural Reflection on Joey Chestnut's Return to Competitive Hot Dog Eating</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Competitive eater Joey Chestnut has reclaimed his title at the Coney Island hot dog eating contest, an event this article frames as a uniquely American spectacle of excess and determination. The piece delves into Chestnut's rigorous training regimen, which includes yoga, neck exercises, and developing a specific mental state of "anger and calm" for competition. Beyond the sport itself, the article explores the event as a cultural touchstone, reflecting America's complex relationship with food, abundance, and freedom. It presents the contest as an honest, if grotesque, distillation of consumer culture and a spectacle that is both absurd and deeply serious.</p>

          <h2>Paris Reopens Seine River for Public Swimming After More Than a Century</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 02:35:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has officially reopened sections of the Seine River for public swimming, a legacy project from the 2024 Olympics. Three supervised swimming zones, complete with amenities like changing rooms and lifeguards, have been established near landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame Cathedral. The ban, in place since 1923 due to pollution, was lifted after a €1.4 billion investment to improve water quality, including building a massive wastewater storage tank. While the river hosted Olympic events, officials will continue to monitor water quality and enforce safety measures due to strong currents and boat traffic.</p>

          <p>Scotland's rugby team began their New Zealand tour with a hard-fought 29-26 victory against the Maori All Blacks in a thrilling match in Whangarei. Both teams scored four tries, but a crucial first-half penalty by Adam Hastings ultimately secured the win for the tourists. The game was fast-paced, with the lead changing hands multiple times before Scotland established an advantage. Despite a late surge from the Maori All Blacks that pushed the game into the 85th minute, Scotland's defense held firm in the final moments to clinch a memorable win on their first tour of New Zealand in 25 years.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by discovering a "genetic switch" that allowed them to restore damaged ear tissue in mice. The research, published in the journal *Science*, found that the inability of mice to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue development. By reactivating a dormant genetic pathway, the team achieved complete restoration of lost tissues, including cartilage. While human application is still a distant goal, the findings offer hope by proving that the mechanism for organ regeneration can be switched back on in mammals.</p>

Despite Estevao's man-of-the-match performance, a late own goal from Palmeiras sent Chelsea through to face Fluminense.
