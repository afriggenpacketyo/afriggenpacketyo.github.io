          <p>The United States has established a new trade deal with Vietnam, imposing a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports, a significant reduction from a previously threatened 46% levy. President Donald Trump announced the agreement, which also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are made in other countries, like China, and trans-shipped through Vietnam. In return, Vietnam will reportedly grant U.S. products full market access with zero tariffs. The deal affects numerous major brands that have manufacturing hubs in Vietnam, which had become a popular alternative to China for production.</p>

Alexander, 21, was held captive by Hamas in Gaza for 19 months after being abducted during his military service in Israel on October 7, 2023. The president spoke with Alexander by phone following his release last month, and his return to his hometown of Tenafly, New Jersey, was met with a large community celebration.

          <p>OpenAI has publicly distanced itself from a new Robinhood product, clarifying that the "OpenAI tokens" being offered to European users are not equity in the company. In a social media post, OpenAI stated it did not partner with Robinhood on the initiative, did not endorse it, and has not approved any transfer of its equity. Robinhood's new offering, which also includes tokens for SpaceX, aims to give retail investors in Europe indirect exposure to private companies through a special purpose vehicle, highlighting a growing tension between crypto platforms and the companies whose assets they tokenize.</p>

          <p>The European Parliament will hold a no-confidence vote next week against the European Commission and its president, Ursula von der Leyen. The motion was initiated by a right-wing Romanian MEP, primarily citing a lack of transparency regarding text messages exchanged with Pfizer's CEO during multibillion-euro COVID-19 vaccine negotiations. While the vote is largely symbolic and not expected to pass, it highlights growing frustration within Brussels over the Commission's recent decisions. For the motion to succeed, it would require an absolute majority of 361 votes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to suspend access to asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border, ruling that the president's declaration of an "invasion" was unlawful. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss stated that the president exceeded his authority and could not unilaterally supplant immigration laws enacted by Congress. The ruling, which gives the administration 14 days to appeal, would require the government to resume processing asylum claims if it stands.
