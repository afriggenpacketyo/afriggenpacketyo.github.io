          <p>Samsung Electronics has secured a $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors to Tesla, a deal confirmed by Elon Musk. The agreement, running until the end of 2033, will see Samsung's new Texas facility dedicated to producing Tesla's next-generation AI chips. This partnership is strategically crucial for Tesla's AI development and represents a significant order for Samsung's foundry business, which has faced challenges in competing for AI-related demand. The deal underscores the intense competition and massive investment in the advanced semiconductor industry.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have struck a framework deal, establishing a 15% US tariff on most European goods, including cars, which avoids a threatened 30% rate. While the Trump administration hails it as a major victory, the EU views it as a necessary compromise to prevent a more damaging trade war and secure stability, even though the new rate is higher than before. The agreement also sees the EU committing to purchase billions in US energy and military equipment, rebalancing a trade relationship that has long been a point of contention.</p>

          <p>In a major law enforcement success, the U.S. Justice Department has shut down four dark web sites dedicated to the trade of child sexual abuse material. The investigation, dubbed "Operation Grayskull," has resulted in the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led and moderated the network, which had over 120,000 members worldwide. The sites housed millions of files depicting horrific abuse, and the operation has been hailed as one of the most successful of its kind in dismantling such sophisticated and encrypted criminal enterprises.</p>

          <p>China's technology hub of Shenzhen has introduced a new policy granting leniency to innovators whose government-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The rules state that researchers will not be held accountable or penalized if projects stall due to reasonable issues like unforeseen technical difficulties or market changes, provided there was no misconduct. This move is designed to encourage scientists and entrepreneurs to "boldly explore uncharted territories" and take greater risks in pursuit of significant scientific breakthroughs without fear of failure.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals a growing trend among five Eastern Caribbean nations offering 'citizenship by investment' programs, where individuals can obtain a passport by purchasing property for as little as $200,000. These "golden passports" are increasingly popular, especially among US citizens concerned about domestic political instability, who view it as an insurance policy. While the programs are a vital source of revenue for the small island nations, they have drawn scrutiny from the EU and US over concerns about security, tax evasion, and financial crime.</p>

This has fueled Tamil pride and created a flashpoint between the state government and the federal government, which is accused of suppressing the findings to maintain a dominant historical narrative.</p>
