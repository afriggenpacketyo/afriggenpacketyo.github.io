          <h2>Standard Chartered Exceeds Profit Expectations Amid Growth in Wealth Management</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 00:44:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Standard Chartered has reported first-quarter profits exceeding expectations, driven by strong growth in wealth management, global markets, and global banking. The bank's profit before taxation rose to $2.103 billion, with Wealth Solutions being a standout performer, posting a 28% increase in operating income. While the bank booked a $219 million credit impairment charge, CEO Bill Winters expressed confidence in the bank's ability to improve returns despite global economic complexity. The earnings do not fully capture the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, as the "reciprocal" tariffs announced in April were put on hold.</p>

          <p>First results are coming in from local elections being held in parts of England, with Reform UK potentially securing its first mayoral victory in Greater Lincolnshire. Labour has retained several mayoralties, but with reduced majorities in some areas. Overnight counts have shown Reform taking seats from both Conservatives and Labour. A recount is underway in the Westminster by-election in Runcorn and Helsby, indicating an extremely close race between Labour and Reform. Most of the 23 council results are expected on Friday afternoon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to accelerate tariff talks, aiming for a mutually beneficial deal by June. After meetings in Washington, officials plan intensive ministerial discussions starting mid-May, focusing on non-tariff barriers and economic security cooperation. Japan is considering proposals to increase purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and expand tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice. The Trump administration's new 24 percent tariffs on goods imported from Japan have been paused until early July under a 90-day reprieve of its so-called reciprocal duties targeted at dozens of trading partners.</p>

A by-election is also being held in the Runcorn and Helsby constituency, triggered by the resignation of the former Labour MP. Results are expected throughout the day, with the bulk of council results due by early evening.</p>

          <p>The Runcorn and Helsby by-election is undergoing a recount due to an extremely close result, with Reform UK and Labour separated by just four votes. The vote, triggered by the resignation of the former Labour MP, is a key electoral test for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Labour held the North Tyneside and Doncaster mayoralties by just a few hundred votes. Reform is still hoping to make further gains in the Greater Lincolnshire mayoral contest, as well as in council elections, where most counting is starting later.</p>
