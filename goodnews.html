          <p>Japanese beverage giant Asahi has partially restarted operations at its breweries and factories after a significant cyberattack disrupted its ordering and delivery systems. The attack, which did not affect production systems directly, forced a shutdown and led to product shortages at major retailers across Japan. While the company is resuming shipments for key products like Asahi Super Dry, it confirmed that the plants are not yet at full capacity and some new product launches will be postponed. This incident highlights a growing trend of cyberattacks impacting major global corporations and their supply chains.</p>

          <p>Turkey has become the leading international destination for hair transplants, attracting approximately one million medical tourists in 2022 for this procedure alone. The industry's boom is driven by significantly lower costs compared to countries like the U.S., with clinics offering all-inclusive travel packages that appeal to a global clientele. While the economic benefits for Turkey are substantial, generating billions in revenue, concerns are rising about the risks associated with unregulated "black market clinics." Experts warn of potential health complications from unlicensed practitioners and a lack of proper medical oversight in the rapidly expanding market.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has entered a multi-billion dollar agreement to deploy AMD's Instinct graphics processing units, significantly boosting AMD's position in the competitive AI chip market. As part of the deal, OpenAI will receive a warrant that could give it up to a 10% ownership stake in AMD, contingent on deployment milestones. This strategic partnership aims to diversify OpenAI's hardware suppliers, reducing its reliance on Nvidia, and marks a major validation of AMD's AI technology.

          <p>Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, announced that its vaccination programs saved a record 1.7 million lives in 2024, marking a significant achievement in global public health despite declining funding. The success is attributed to large gains in routine immunizations against diseases like measles and polio, as well as the introduction of the first routine malaria vaccinations in 17 African countries. This progress underscores the profound impact of vaccines, which are credited with saving an estimated 154 million lives over the past 50 years. However, challenges remain, including the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment and reaching over 14 million infants who received no vaccines at all.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party has announced a plan to offer a £5,000 tax rebate to young people in their first job, intended to help them save for a down payment on their first home. The "First Job Bonus" would redirect the first £5,000 of an individual's National Insurance contributions into a designated savings account. Shadow Chancellor Sir Mel Stride also proposed abolishing business rates for many high street retail, hospitality, and leisure firms. The party states these policies would be funded by a £47 billion annual savings drive, achieved through cuts to welfare, the civil service, and foreign aid.</p>

          <p>Three men have been sentenced to prison for their roles in a violent protest outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which was housing asylum seekers. The court heard that a peaceful demonstration descended into serious disorder, with police officers being punched, kicked, and pelted with objects over a four-hour period. The protest was reportedly motivated by hostility towards asylum seekers following the arrest of one resident for sexual assault. A senior police officer described the event as a scale of disorder unprecedented in his 20-year career in Essex, highlighting the intense community tensions.</p>

          <p>A year after Rwanda's first Marburg virus outbreak, Dr. Tsion Firew reflects on the harrowing experience and the country's model response that achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded for the disease. The outbreak, which primarily affected healthcare workers, was met with a swift and decisive government reaction, including rapid testing, clinical trials for a vaccine, and the pioneering use of experimental treatments. Dr. Firew, an emergency room physician, describes the immense personal toll, including sending her young children abroad for safety, while highlighting the stark contrast with disorganized responses she witnessed elsewhere, championing Rwanda's success as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.</p>

This breakthrough has opened a new field of immunology, paving the way for innovative treatments for autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as new approaches to cancer therapy.</p>

          <p>Stocks in emerging markets have recently outperformed major U.S. indices like the S&P 500, driven by several favorable economic factors. A weakening U.S. dollar has made debt cheaper for emerging economies and their exports more competitive, attracting global investment. Furthermore, the International Monetary Fund has upgraded its growth outlook for these markets, particularly China, due to structural improvements. Compared to the high valuations of U.S. stocks, emerging market equities are considered relatively inexpensive, making them an attractive option for diversification for some investors.

          <p>The U.K. government has unveiled a consultation on major reforms to the house-buying system in England and Wales, aiming to reduce costs, delays, and collapsed sales. The proposals would legally require sellers to provide key property information upfront and introduce the option of binding contracts to prevent last-minute withdrawals. While the government estimates these changes could save first-time buyers hundreds of pounds and shorten transaction times, some experts express concern that it could create new delays. This initiative is part of a broader housing strategy that also includes pledges to increase the housing supply.</p>
