          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated he is hopeful that a government shutdown can be avoided as the funding deadline approaches. He emphasized the Democratic goal of finding bipartisan common ground to secure a spending agreement that addresses the needs of the American people, particularly regarding healthcare. A key point of contention is the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, which Democrats argue is urgent to prevent a shock to struggling families. Both Jeffries and his Republican counterpart, Steve Scalise, have expressed a desire to prevent a shutdown ahead of a planned meeting with President Trump.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Voters in Zurich, Switzerland, have approved a measure to severely restrict the use of leaf blowers and vacuums, with over 61% in favor. The new rules will completely ban gas-powered models and only permit the use of electric devices from October to December each year to combat noise and dust pollution. Supporters argued the devices are loud, spread fine dust, and harm microorganisms, recommending rakes as an alternative. Opponents of the ban contended that it unnecessarily complicates maintenance and represents an overreaching culture of prohibition.</p>

          <p>The Zombies, a key band from the 1960s British Invasion, are reflecting on their unconventional path to lasting fame, which came long after their initial success. Their classic song "Time of the Season," released in 1968, took a full year to become a chart-topping hit, by which time the band had already broken up. Their album "Odessey and Oracle" was also initially ignored but is now regarded as a rock masterpiece. Surviving members Rod Argent, Colin Blunstone, Hugh Grundy, and Chris White recently celebrated their induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, finally receiving recognition decades after their peak.</p>

          <p>China is pioneering a new industrial manufacturing model, known as a "pull system," to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency of car manufacturing. This approach aims to streamline space system production for better quality, lower costs, and increased flexibility in response to growing global space activity. Unlike traditional "push" systems based on forecasts, the pull model has final assembly stages request components from suppliers only when needed. Researchers believe that mastering this scalable production method will be crucial for dominating the future of the space industry.</p>

She identifies phrases like "It'll just take a second," "No worries if not," and "I'm not an expert, but..." as common examples of "imposing syndrome," where individuals minimize their contributions to avoid being a bother. Mason argues that these habits can lead to being underestimated and suggests using more direct and confident language to better articulate requests and convey expertise, ultimately doing more justice to one's ideas.</p>

The dynamic culminates in a classroom confrontation where she labels him a "diseducator," forcing him to re-evaluate his entire approach to teaching and his relationship with his students.

          <p>Financial coach Andrea Ewalefo suggests that automating finances is the most effective money management strategy for neurodivergent individuals, such as those with ADHD or autism. Challenges like executive dysfunction, decision fatigue, and time blindness can make traditional budgeting systems difficult to maintain. By setting up automatic payments for bills, savings, and investments to coincide with paydays, individuals can reduce the mental energy, or "spoons," required for financial tasks. This approach helps prioritize essential payments and savings goals, providing the freedom to spend remaining funds without the stress of potentially missing obligations.</p>
