          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on scams related to the national college entrance examination, known as the gaokao. The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly launched a campaign to investigate and eliminate illegal and harmful information. Scammers are falsely claiming that artificial intelligence can predict exam questions and selling mock papers at inflated prices. The government is also targeting social media accounts and private tutors alleging access to top-secret information from teachers involved in setting the exam papers, as over 13.3 million students prepare to take the high-stakes test.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government's release of stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has led to cheaper rice becoming available in stores. Consumers are flocking to purchase the more affordable product. Ito-Yokado Co. and Iris Ohyama Inc. were the first to sell the rice at a price of 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5-kilogram bag. The government is selling 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 in an effort to bring down soaring rice prices affecting households.</p>

          <p>BBC Sport has launched a new interactive game called UEFA Champions League Squares. Players can answer trivia questions to earn edit tokens before each Champions League matchday. These tokens allow changes to the gamecard, such as marking a square as correct, flipping a team, or swapping a square for another randomly selected tile. The game offers various ways to score points, with extra time considered during the knockout stages, but not penalty shootouts. New users can still receive a gamecard after the cut-off time but will not have the chance to edit it.</p>
