          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high, driven by factors like softer U.S. inflation, de-escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Cumulative inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $40 billion, with minimal outflows in May. On-chain data suggests reduced selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market. Regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments are expected to further drive Bitcoin prices higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering restricting or banning the private prescription of cross-sex hormones to individuals under 18. This review follows the NHS's decision to halt the prescription of puberty blockers for under-18s at gender identity clinics. Health officials are exploring legal mechanisms to address private and overseas providers prescribing these drugs. The court rejected a judicial review application, stating the government is taking necessary steps and needs time to consider the issues, acknowledging the sensitivity and lack of consensus in this policy area.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt on the rise, credit card debt forgiveness is a unique debt relief option. Before applying for credit card debt forgiveness, cardholders should first consider their alternative relief options such as credit counseling, debt management programs, debt consolidation loans and balance transfer credit cards. Additionally, you'll need to meet a series of qualifying criteria first, which includes having a debt load of at least $5,000 to $10,000, being delinquent on your existing payments and a financial hardship.

          <p>News of former President Joseph Biden's advanced prostate cancer has revived long-standing questions about the benefits versus the harms of a blood test that screens for the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in the U.S.  Elevated PSA can be a marker for cancer. It also can signal a false positive or an inactive cancer, triggering a painful biopsy, and leading to overtreatment with punishing side effects, including impotence, incontinence and bowel dysfunction. A new era in prostate-cancer screening has arrived, Seibert believes. Today, instead of men immediately having their prostates biopsied when they get an elevated PSA test, he and an increasing number of prostate-cancer specialists recommend first getting an MRI and, when possible, watching and waiting.</p>
