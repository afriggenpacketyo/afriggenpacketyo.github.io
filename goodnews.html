          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop Advanced Vision Sensor Inspired by Human Eye</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 22:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team at Fuzhou University in China has created a novel vision sensor using semiconductor "quantum dots" that can adapt to extreme changes in light faster than the human eye. This new system is designed to mimic the human visual system's ability to adjust to varying light conditions and remember those settings for faster future adaptation. The technology aims to overcome the limitations of current sensors, promising quicker computation with lower energy consumption. The development represents a significant step forward in neuromorphic engineering and visual sensing technology.</p>

          <p>A writer shares a personal reflection on her relationship with her younger brother, who was exceptionally quiet as a child, leading her to often speak for him. She describes how, after their family was struck by profound grief, her brother found his voice not in words but through playing the guitar. The essay explores the different ways people communicate and process trauma, with the author using writing to reclaim memories and her brother using music to express his inner world. She concludes by celebrating his unique musical language and her own journey in learning to listen.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina, with tropical storm warnings being canceled for the region. However, the system is still expected to bring heavy rain, with forecasts of 2 to 4 inches and localized amounts up to 6 inches, prompting flash flood concerns. Flood watches have been issued for parts of central North Carolina and south-central Virginia as the system moves northward. Authorities also warn of dangerous surf and rip currents along the Atlantic coast for the next several days.</p>

          <p>Despite Elon Musk's announcement of a new "America Party," experts in election law highlight the immense challenges he faces in establishing a viable third party in the United States. The process involves navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are heavily biased towards the two major parties and often require enormous signature-gathering efforts. Furthermore, any attempt would likely face intense and costly legal challenges from both Democrats and Republicans. Experts suggest that building a national party is a multi-year, multi-hundred-million-dollar project, making it an extremely daunting task even for the world's wealthiest person.</p>

          <p>Two individuals were rescued by bystanders from their SUV just minutes before it caused a massive explosion at a Domino's Pizza in Herriman, Utah. The vehicle had crashed into the commercial building, rupturing a gas line and leading to the subsequent blast, which was caught on video. The driver and a passenger were saved by two "courageous bystanders" before the vehicle was engulfed in flames. While multiple people from the three-vehicle accident were hospitalized, no one was inside the building at the time of the explosion, and no injuries were reported from the blast itself.</p>

Officials are hopeful for continued progress before a predicted midweek heat wave could present new challenges for the nearly 1,400 firefighters on the scene.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents the legal right to bereavement leave following a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. Currently, statutory leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time away from work to grieve a loss that can be heartbreaking. The new law will extend the right to at least one week of leave for parents who experience a pre-24-week loss, a move welcomed by support organizations as an important acknowledgment of its impact.</p>
