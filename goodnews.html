          <p>The U.S. and EU have announced specific details of their new trade agreement, establishing a 15% blanket tariff on most EU exports to the U.S. The framework also includes the EU eliminating tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods and committing to significant purchases of American energy and AI chips. While some European leaders expressed concerns about the deal's balance, officials have hailed it as a foundational step to strengthen economic ties. The agreement caps tariffs on sensitive sectors like automobiles and pharmaceuticals, avoiding previously threatened higher rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis superstar Serena Williams has publicly shared her experience with using GLP-1 weight loss medications, stating she turned to them after struggling with weight management post-childbirth. In a campaign for the telehealth company Ro, Williams revealed she lost 31 pounds in eight months, feeling she needed help when traditional diet and exercise were not producing results. She also addressed the stigma surrounding these drugs, encouraging people to see it as a form of self-care rather than an "easy way out." Williams is now a celebrity ambassador for the company, aiming to normalize the conversation around medically assisted weight loss.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Explain How Home Equity Loans Can Offer Savings in High-Interest Environment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 10:38:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current economic climate of high interest rates, financial experts suggest that home equity loans can be a strategic way for homeowners to save money. These loans allow borrowing against a home's value at a fixed rate, which is often significantly lower than rates on credit cards or personal loans. This makes them particularly effective for consolidating high-interest debt or funding value-adding home improvements, which may also offer tax benefits. However, experts caution against using them for discretionary spending and stress the importance of stable income, as the home is used as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A small, rural football academy is playing a significant role in the recent success of Bangladesh's national women's teams. Founded in 2014 by a former teacher, the Rangatungi United Women's Football Academy has overcome social and financial barriers to develop top-tier talent. Several of its players, including 17-year-old star Mosammat Sagorika, were key members of the senior and under-20 squads that recently qualified for their respective Asian Cups for the first time. The academy's success is helping to change conservative attitudes towards women's sports in the country and build a foundation for future international achievements.</p>

          <p>The United States has backed down from threats to impose exceptionally high tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union. Under the newly detailed trade framework, these key sectors will face a 15% tariff, in line with most other EU goods, rather than the previously floated rates of up to 250%. The decision provides significant relief to European exporters, particularly in major pharmaceutical hubs like Ireland and Denmark. This move is a key component of the broader trade deal aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and the EU. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since May 2023, the average interest rate for a five-year fixed mortgage in the UK has fallen below 5%, reaching 4.99%. This milestone, along with a recent dip in two-year fixed rates, signals a trend of steadily falling borrowing costs and increased competition among lenders. While the immediate financial savings for borrowers may be modest, financial analysts view the sub-5% level as a symbolic turning point that could boost buyer confidence. However, experts caution that with inflation remaining elevated, further significant rate cuts in the near term are unlikely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart has raised its sales and earnings outlook for the full year, driven by strong performance and continued growth in its online business. The retail giant reported that its U.S. comparable sales rose by 4.6% in the second quarter, fueled by grocery and health product sales. Global e-commerce sales also saw a significant 25% jump, with its online operations in the U.S. becoming profitable. Despite these gains, the company acknowledged that rising costs from tariffs are creating pressure, which in some cases are being passed on to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sales of previously-owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to the previous month, defying analyst expectations of a decline. The National Association of Realtors reported that the increase was likely influenced by a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were signed. Housing inventory also grew, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to moderate price increases. The median home price saw a marginal year-over-year increase, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point as affordability slightly improves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial advisors suggest that the timing of an annuity purchase is critical to its effectiveness as a retirement tool. Generally, annuities are not recommended for individuals under 50 due to withdrawal penalties and the long-term potential of other growth investments. Conversely, insurance companies often do not sell them to people over 90. For older adults, annuities may not be suitable if basic income needs are already met or if liquidity for emergencies is a priority. Experts recommend evaluating personal health, existing income streams, and tax implications before committing a significant portion of assets to these products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new film "Honey Don't!," co-written by Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke, is a pulpy, desert-set mystery starring Margaret Qualley as a private investigator. The review describes the movie as a deliberately messy and smutty B-movie that prioritizes style and attitude over a coherent plot. Qualley's performance is praised for its charisma, alongside strong supporting roles from Aubrey Plaza and Chris Evans. While the script contains sharp dialogue, the overall film is considered shaggy and less focused, functioning more as an affectionate in-joke for its creators than a tightly constructed noir.</p>

The assessment was based on genetic analysis and comparisons of physical characteristics like skull shape, which revealed significant diversity among different populations. The newly recognized species are the Southern giraffe, the Reticulated giraffe, and the Northern giraffe, joining the Masai giraffe. Scientists state that this more precise classification is vital for developing effective conservation strategies to protect the world's tallest mammal.</p>
