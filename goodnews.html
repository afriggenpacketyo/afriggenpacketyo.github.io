        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigerian artist John Madu is being celebrated in a new exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, titled "Van Gogh x John Madu: Paint Your Path." The self-taught artist created ten large paintings that infuse Vincent van Gogh's famous motifs with a modern, cosmopolitan West African sensibility. Madu, who was influenced by Van Gogh's work from a young age, sees parallels in their self-taught journeys and their shared inspiration from East Asian art. He identifies as a global citizen and aims to create art that transcends geographical labels, reflecting his vibrant Lagos upbringing.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank announced second-quarter net profits of €1.485 billion, significantly surpassing analyst forecasts and marking a strong recovery from a loss in the same period last year. Despite mixed results in its investment banking unit and challenges from a strong euro, the bank's overall revenues were in line with expectations at €7.8 billion. The positive results, driven partly by a strong performance in fixed income and currencies, have boosted investor confidence and kept the bank on track to meet its full-year targets.

          <h2>China Aims to Strengthen Nepal Ties with Trans-Himalayan Projects Amid Rivalry with India</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is pushing to implement more trans-Himalayan infrastructure projects in Nepal, focusing on areas like agriculture, new energy, and health to boost its influence in the region. The move is part of a broader competition with India, which has traditionally been Nepal's primary ally due to cultural and geographical proximity. In recent years, Beijing has significantly increased its economic engagement with the landlocked Himalayan nation. This has been achieved through substantial investments in various projects, from road networks to hydropower plants, drawing Nepal closer into its sphere of influence.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the UK to sign a long-negotiated free trade agreement with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal, which has been in development for nearly three years, aims to cut tariffs and improve market access for both nations, potentially boosting bilateral trade by £25.5 billion annually by 2040. The agreement is expected to facilitate UK exports of products like whisky and cars to India, while reducing taxes on Indian clothing and footwear exports to the UK. It represents a significant diplomatic and economic achievement for both countries.</p>

          <p>A mountain biker from Angus, Scotland, has achieved the remarkable feat of riding his bike down all 282 of the country's Munros, which are mountains over 3,000 feet. Sean Green, 36, is believed to be only the second person ever to complete this challenge, which took him over eight years. The endeavor required him to climb each summit while carrying his bike before cycling down the often-treacherous paths. Green stated that the most difficult aspects of his quest were the logistical challenges and the time spent away from his family.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch a program offering monthly electronic coupons to its senior citizens to help cover the costs of elderly-care services. This rare form of direct fiscal support is aimed at easing the financial burden on families and boosting consumption in the growing elder-care market. The subsidies, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan, will be available to seniors assessed as having moderate to severe disabilities. The initiative is part of Beijing's broader effort to strengthen its social safety net in response to a rapidly aging population and to foster new economic growth drivers.</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal battle, former city traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for rigging the Libor interest rate quashed by the UK's Supreme Court. The ruling overturns one of the most high-profile prosecutions following the 2008 financial crisis and raises questions about potential compensation and the possibility of appeals from other convicted traders. The decision is expected to lead to calls for a public inquiry into how the rate-manipulation scandal was investigated, particularly the role of banks investigating themselves and pressure from government bodies.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, upholding a lower court's nationwide block on its enforcement. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that the order's interpretation, which would deny citizenship to many individuals born in the United States, violates the 14th Amendment. The ruling marks the first time an appellate court has weighed in on the matter, keeping the injunction in place and moving the issue closer to a potential review by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A major new study indicates that walking just 7,000 steps per day can significantly boost brainpower and reduce the risk of serious diseases like cancer, dementia, and heart disease. Published in The Lancet, the research suggests this more achievable target may be more effective for public health than the widely-known but less evidence-based goal of 10,000 steps. The 10,000-step benchmark originated from a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan. Researchers believe that promoting a 7,000-step goal could encourage more people to track their activity and make practical improvements to their long-term health.</p>
