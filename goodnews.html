          <p>European stock markets are expected to open higher today, with investor attention focused on France's imminent confidence vote for Prime Minister Francois Bayrou. Bayrou, widely anticipated to lose, called the vote due to ongoing political wrangling over a substantial €44 billion budget cut proposal. His objective is to lower France's budget deficit to 4.6% by 2026, although this remains above European Union limits, facing opposition from parties against both spending cuts and tax increases. If Bayrou is unseated, President Emmanuel Macron will be tasked with appointing the country's fifth prime minister in less than two years. This political uncertainty contrasts with generally positive movements in Asia-Pacific markets and stable U.S. stock futures, which are awaiting critical inflation data this week.

          <p>David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and former Caltech president, has died at 87, concluding an illustrious career that profoundly shaped 20th-century science. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1975 for his co-discovery of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme fundamental to understanding how genes modify cells and critical for comprehending retroviruses like HIV. Beyond his groundbreaking laboratory work, Baltimore was a prominent public advocate, leading discussions on the ethical implications of genetic engineering from its early days to the advent of CRISPR technology. Caltech President Thomas Rosenbaum lauded his transformative contributions to biology and medicine, alongside his significant role as a mentor and institutional leader. Baltimore's legacy encompasses both pioneering scientific discoveries and a steadfast commitment to guiding the responsible application of biological advances.</p>

          <p>A recent social media debate, initiated by Michael Owen, regarding who was the better footballer at age 17, has prompted a diplomatic reply from Wayne Rooney. Owen presented statistical evidence, highlighting his 18 Premier League goals at ages 17 and 18, and his Ballon d'Or win at 22, compared to Rooney's six and nine goals respectively during the same teenage years. Rooney, who is six years younger than Owen, conceded that Owen's claims were "fair" and expressed deep admiration for him as a player he had always looked up to. Despite Owen's impressive early career and accolades, his trajectory was significantly impacted by injuries, whereas Rooney ultimately enjoyed a longer and more successful career, becoming Manchester United's all-time leading scorer and winning more major titles.</p>

          <p>Japanese stock markets witnessed a notable jump, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 climbing 1.5% and the Topix index reaching a record high, in response to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's weekend announcement of his resignation. This unexpectedly strong market reaction is largely attributed to investor enthusiasm surrounding potential successors, particularly Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, the latter being favored for her advocacy of deregulation and opposition to interest rate hikes, which is seen as a driver for growth. Concurrently, the Japanese yen weakened, and government bond yields continued their ascent, reflecting ongoing concerns about persistent inflation and fiscal instability. Analysts at BMI anticipate a period of prolonged uncertainty for Japan as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party navigates the selection of its next leader. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz clinched his second US Open trophy and sixth major title overall, triumphing over defending champion Jannik Sinner in a historic four-set final. The 22-year-old Spaniard showcased dominant form, losing only a single set across his seven matches in the tournament. This championship clash marked an unprecedented occasion, being the first time the same two men have contested three consecutive Grand Slam finals within a single season, with Alcaraz now holding a 10-5 lead in their head-to-head rivalry. The match, which experienced a delay due to heightened security measures for President Trump's attendance, highlighted Alcaraz's aggressive style and his capacity to elevate his game under pressure, leading him to declare it "the best tournament so far that I have ever played."</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz has lauded his second US Open title victory as the "best tournament" of his career, achieved by defeating his rival Jannik Sinner in four sets to secure his sixth Grand Slam championship.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking collaborative study between China and the U.S., leveraging seismic data from marsquakes recorded by NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has unveiled an unexpected discovery: Mars possesses a solid inner core. This core measures approximately 600 kilometers in radius, representing about 18% of Mars' total radius, a proportion similar to Earth's inner core. The finding is particularly surprising because current planetary models suggest Mars should not have cooled enough to form such a solid core, challenging existing scientific assumptions about its internal structure. This revelation could potentially revive long-standing debates regarding whether Earth was uniquely capable of developing plate tectonics, and it adds Mars to an exclusive group of celestial bodies, including Earth and the Moon, known to harbor a solid inner core.</p>

Police successfully recovered 26 checks and approximately $10,000 in cash during the arrests. Shirehjini was also found to be in possession of a handgun, with additional firearms and various drugs seized during the investigation. The swift apprehension of the suspects within five days of the incident brought a measure of relief to the newly married couple, although the specific motive behind the theft remains undetermined.</p>

          <p>South Korea has successfully negotiated an agreement with the United States to facilitate the repatriation of its citizens who were detained during a substantial immigration raid at a Hyundai manufacturing facility in Georgia. The operation led to the apprehension of nearly 500 workers, including over 300 South Korean nationals, prompting immediate diplomatic engagement from Seoul. South Korea's presidential chief of staff confirmed that a chartered plane would be dispatched to bring the detainees home once all necessary administrative processes are finalized, with concurrent efforts to enhance the visa system to prevent future incidents. While the White House defended the enforcement action, President Trump reiterated his call for foreign companies to prioritize hiring and training American workers, underscoring the importance of adhering to U.S. immigration laws, amid lingering concerns that the raid might discourage foreign investment.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz clinched his second US Open title, triumphing over rival Jannik Sinner in four sets, during a match notably delayed due to heightened security protocols for President Trump's attendance. President Trump observed the final from a luxury box, eliciting a mixed reception of cheers and boos from the audience during the national anthem, with the U.S. Tennis Association reportedly advising broadcasters to omit crowd reactions. Alcaraz, who now reclaims the World No. 1 ranking, humorously remarked on the frequency of his encounters with Sinner, quipping he sees him "more than my family" after their third consecutive Grand Slam final. This event underscored the logistical and public relations challenges that arise when high-profile political figures attend major sporting events, impacting both event scheduling and media coverage.</p>
