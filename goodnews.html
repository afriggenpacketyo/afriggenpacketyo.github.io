        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising seniors on the best age to consider a reverse mortgage, a loan that allows homeowners to tap into their home equity without immediate repayment. Factors such as current age, the amount of equity, and long-term financial goals are crucial in this decision. While the minimum qualifying age is typically 62, many specialists suggest that the late 60s to early 70s often represents a "sweet spot," as older borrowers can access more funds and have a clearer picture of their retirement needs.

Research published in JAMA Network Open showed a significant increase in use among people who were uninsured, younger, or living in rural areas.

Recounting an incident where a player he managed was left in tears after being racially abused, Rooney argued that society and football clubs must do more to stop it. He proposed that sanctions such as points deductions or significant financial penalties are necessary to force clubs to take the issue seriously and create lasting change.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are advising savers on how to determine the right amount of money to invest in a certificate of deposit (CD), given the current interest rate environment. Key considerations include an individual's personal liquidity needs, their overall financial stability, and a comparison of CD rates with other low-risk savings options. With the Federal Reserve potentially lowering rates soon, locking in a higher rate now could be beneficial, but it requires careful planning. (not investment advice)</p>
