          <p>One of Big Bear's eaglets, Sunny, has taken its first flight from the nest, marking a significant milestone for the famed bald eagle parents, Jackie and Shadow.

Experts say the eaglets will remain in the habitat for one to three months after fledging, eventually venturing out on their own by fall.

Their attorneys argued that the prosecution was unjust, as the men believed they were freeing the sharks from an illegal fishing line.
