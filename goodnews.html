          <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi sits down for an in-depth interview, sharing his family's personal story of fleeing the Iranian revolution and losing everything, which he says shaped his perspective. He addresses his tenure at Uber, which began in 2017 with the difficult task of cleaning up a notoriously toxic corporate culture, stating the company is now getting it right more often. Khosrowshahi also discusses navigating the current political climate under President Trump, the economic pressures leading to higher ride costs, and his own concerns about wealth inequality. The conversation highlights his focus on adjustment and resilience, both in his personal life and in leading Uber's expansion into autonomous vehicles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new plans for supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to partner in tackling obesity by making healthy food more appealing and accessible. Under the strategy, retailers will be encouraged to use methods like promotions on healthy items, loyalty point incentives, or altered store layouts to guide consumers toward better choices. Health Secretary Wes Streeting emphasized this is a collaborative approach, not a "nanny state" dictation of what people should buy. The initiative aims to reduce obesity, particularly in children, and alleviate the estimated ¬£11 billion annual cost to the NHS, responding to reports that healthy food is often significantly more expensive than less healthy options.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Identifies Four Key Questions for Assessing Relationship Happiness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 09:27:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist who studies couples, many people in unhappy relationships fail to recognize their situation due to unhealthy habits like emotional suppression or normalizing problems. The article suggests asking four key questions to assess relationship health: Do you feel like a team during conflict? Can you be your authentic self? Is your partner curious about your inner world? Do they take accountability for mistakes? Answering "no" to these questions may indicate underlying dissatisfaction. Healthy relationships are characterized by collaborative problem-solving, the freedom to be genuine, sustained curiosity about each other, and a mutual commitment to owning up to errors and making amends.</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued four people from a 61-foot sailboat that caught fire approximately one mile off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. All four individuals on board were able to evacuate safely to a bystander's boat and were brought to shore without any injuries. Eyewitness video captured thick black smoke billowing from the vessel, with one witness reporting that the boat was engulfed in flames very quickly and that there were sounds of explosions. The U.S. Coast Guard and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are now investigating the cause of the fire.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to the narrative of a "sex recession," this article argues that Gen Z is spearheading a new sexual revolution, even if they are having less partnered sex than previous generations. The piece posits that for Gen Z, sex is deeply intertwined with politics, identity, and a rejection of traditional gendered expectations. Having grown up post-#MeToo and post-Roe, many young people view sexual freedom as a political battleground and are more inclusive in their definitions of sex, moving beyond heteronormative concepts like virginity. This generation's activism and re-evaluation of sexual norms are presented as a progressive force, challenging conservative efforts to restrict sexual and reproductive freedoms.</p>

          <p>A new report from asset management firm Vanguard reveals a strong correlation between income and retirement savings, with higher earners accumulating significantly larger 401(k) balances. For instance, the median balance for workers earning between $100,000 and $149,999 is nearly double that of those earning between $50,000 and $74,999. Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, the data shows persistent progress in retirement saving behaviors, with many Americans prioritizing long-term financial goals. The study also highlights the effectiveness of automatic enrollment, as employees in such plans for over ten years have median balances approximately 60% higher than those who had to voluntarily opt-in.</p>

          <p>Priyanka Jain, CEO of the health company Evvy, emphasizes that in a startup environment, the most valuable employees are those who can both develop strategies and execute them. She looks for candidates who demonstrate a passion for going beyond their job description and can get into the details of solving a problem, not just theorizing about it. Jain finds it concerning when a candidate is only interested in high-level strategy and sees execution as beneath them, as startups lack the luxury of having separate roles for these functions. To identify this trait, she asks candidates to describe a problem they solved, listening for the level of detail in their explanation of the process.</p>

          <p>A California couple, Malana Moberg and Roland Salvato, sold their San Francisco apartment to purchase a historic chateau in Druelle Balsac, France, for approximately $835,000. Seeking a new challenge, they have since invested over $300,000 to renovate the 12th-century property, turning it into a bed and breakfast and a venue for all-inclusive workshops. While the business is not yet profitable, the income from guests helps cover the chateau's significant running costs, allowing the couple to live off their savings. They view themselves not as business owners seeking profit, but as caretakers of a piece of history, finding fulfillment in the experience and the legacy they are preserving.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its flagship welfare reform bill to avert a major rebellion from its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had mishandled the rollout and that concerns from over 120 MPs led to a stronger final package. Key changes include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and reversing a plan to freeze the health-related component of Universal Credit. Rebel MPs expressed satisfaction with the U-turn, suggesting the bill will now pass, though the episode has raised questions about the Prime Minister's ability to manage his party.</p>

Jefferies reiterated a buy rating for McDonald's, citing its value proposition and potential for sales acceleration. Stifel upgraded EPR Properties to buy, noting improvements in its cost of capital could fuel significant external growth through acquisitions in experiential real estate. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its buy rating for Halliburton, highlighting the resilience of its international business and idiosyncratic growth opportunities despite near-term softness in North America.
