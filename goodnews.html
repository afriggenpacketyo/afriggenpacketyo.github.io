          <h2>Home Depot CFO States Tariffs Will Not Cause Price Increases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 07:21:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, announced that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. More than half of Home Depot's products are sourced from the U.S., and the company has been diversifying its imports, aiming to have no single country outside the U.S. represent more than 10% of purchases by next year. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to increase prices due to tariffs. Home Depot expects total sales to grow by 2.8% for the full year, with comparable sales rising about 1%.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that the ancestor cell of animals and plants metabolized hydrogen, existing before the Great Oxidation Event, which occurred at least 2.1 billion years ago. The study, published in Nature, suggests that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes lived around 2.72 billion years ago in oxygen-deficient conditions. This research supports the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotes, challenging previous findings and providing insights into the evolution of complex life on Earth, potentially impacting the exploration of life in outer space.</p>

          <p>The Northern Jaguar Project in Sonora, Mexico, is working with ranchers to conserve jaguars by paying them for photos of wild cats taken on their land. The program, called Viviendo con Felinos, aims to transform jaguars from threats to valuable assets, compensating ranchers for each photo of a jaguar, puma, ocelot, or bobcat. This initiative has expanded protected areas and fostered tolerance among ranchers, contributing to a stable jaguar population. The program is working to help ranchers farm in a way that protects both felines and cattle.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary tariff reduction, 95% of Chinese exporters plan to increase exports to markets outside the U.S., according to an Allianz Trade survey. The U.S.-China "decoupling" remains likely, as Chinese exporters pivot away from the U.S. and American firms shift production out of China. Many firms expect a dent in export turnover due to U.S. tariffs, which remain high even after the recent agreement. Southeast Asia is the top choice for Chinese businesses seeking to move production overseas.</p>
