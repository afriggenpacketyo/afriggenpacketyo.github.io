          <p>Financial analysts forecast that China's yuan will continue to appreciate against the US dollar into 2025, building on its recent gains. The People's Bank of China has set the currency's reference rate at its strongest level in months, reflecting improved sentiment about China's economic resilience. According to Goldman Sachs, this trend is driven by China's macro data being stronger than feared and growing investor concerns about US government debt and fiscal policy. The investment bank predicts the yuan could break the 7 per dollar mark within six months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a recent tech conference, experts emphasized the importance of emerging economies developing "sovereign AI" to ensure strategic autonomy and address local needs. Panelists noted that many dominant AI models are English-based, creating a need for systems tailored to different languages and cultures. They identified open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing as key tools for democratization, allowing countries to build their own AI ecosystems without relying solely on a few major tech companies. This approach could foster local talent and create a more inclusive global AI landscape.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 23:44:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey of Chinese factory activity indicated a surprising return to growth in June, contrasting with official data that showed a contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI registered 50.4, beating expectations and suggesting improving conditions for the eighth time in nine months, particularly among export-oriented firms. Analysts attribute the divergence from official figures to differences in survey timing and company coverage, with some suggesting the positive result reflects a delayed response to a US-China tariff reduction. Despite the expansion, new export orders declined and business optimism weakened amid fierce market competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law two significant bills aimed at speeding up housing construction by reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The legislation, which exempts most urban housing projects from lengthy environmental reviews, was pushed through the legislature by tying it to the state budget. This move overcame opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor unions who had concerns about the changes. Proponents hail the new laws as the most consequential housing reform in the state's recent history, potentially unlocking numerous stalled development projects to address California's housing crisis.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology companies after facing intense pressure from the Trump administration. The White House had labeled the tax a "blatant attack" and threatened retaliatory tariffs, leading to the cancellation of trade talks. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced the tax would be dropped as part of a "bigger negotiation," and trade discussions between the two countries have since resumed. The 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, and its removal is seen as a significant victory for the U.S. tech industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that a naturally occurring compound called betaine, produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, can help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents inflammation and organ aging by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This finding helps explain the molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. It also suggests potential future anti-aging strategies that could simulate the effects of exercise by targeting this pathway, offering new insights into promoting longevity.</p>
