          <h2>MIND Diet Linked to Lower Dementia Rates in New Research</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 15:29:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research presented at NUTRITION 2025 suggests that the MIND diet, a hybrid of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, may significantly reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. The diet emphasizes "brain-healthy foods" such as leafy green vegetables, berries, nuts, and olive oil, while limiting pastries, refined sugar, red meat, and fried foods. The study, analyzing data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults, found that those who followed the MIND diet had an overall 9% reduced risk of dementia, with some groups showing a 13% lower risk, suggesting it's never too late to adopt a healthy diet. The findings indicate that dietary patterns play a crucial role in preventing cognitive decline.</p>

          <p>Antonio McDowell, 49, has been exonerated after serving 28 years in prison for a wrongful conviction stemming from the actions of disgraced Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara. McDowell was initially arrested after being shot, but he was then framed for an unrelated murder when he refused to falsely identify Guevara's chosen suspect. McDowell is the 51st person to be exonerated in a case investigated by Guevara, who has a history of coercing false confessions. After years of legal battles, McDowell's murder and carjacking convictions were overturned, allowing him to walk free.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging continued surveillance of a new norovirus strain, GII.17, which may disrupt the typical seasonal pattern of outbreaks. Last year, the norovirus season started earlier in October due to the emergence of GII.17, displacing the previously dominant GII.4 strain. Several other countries also experienced unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus after GII.17 surged to dominance, prompting questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again, though it is not yet determined.</p>
