        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent influx of young Chinese immigrants to Paris is transforming the city's culinary landscape, leading to a boom in restaurants serving authentic regional Chinese cuisine. Establishments like Tonton Mao are moving beyond traditional Cantonese fare, targeting a younger demographic with specialties such as northeastern kaochuan skewers. This trend reflects a shift from older generations of restaurateurs, with new owners focusing on specific, high-quality dishes and even flying in chefs from China to ensure authenticity. The article highlights how this culinary expansion is adding a new layer of diversity to Paris's famed food scene.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A consortium of lenders has put forward a new rescue plan aimed at preventing the financial collapse of Thames Water, the largest water company in the UK. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to improve services and stabilize its finances. The plan, which requires no taxpayer funding, would also see a halt to shareholder dividends and a commitment from new shareholders not to sell the business before March 2030. This development comes after years of financial instability and fears of a government-led temporary nationalization.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda hit Bermuda as a Category 2 storm, bringing powerful winds and heavy rainfall to the island before weakening to a Category 1 and moving further out into the Atlantic. As of early Thursday, the storm's center was moving away from Bermuda, with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph. The National Hurricane Center reported that hurricane-force winds were recorded on the island, though no immediate reports of significant damage were available. The storm is expected to continue weakening, while swells from Imelda are still causing life-threatening surf conditions along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI has finalized a secondary share sale worth $6.6 billion, allowing current and former employees to sell stock at a new valuation of $500 billion. This transaction solidifies OpenAI's position as the world's most valuable privately-held company, surpassing SpaceX. While up to $10.3 billion in shares were authorized for sale, only about two-thirds were sold, which is being interpreted internally as a sign of employee confidence in the company's future prospects. The sale serves as a way to reward and retain talent amid intense competition in the AI industry without pursuing a public offering.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are conducting tests with robotic dogs in a lava tube cave in Heilongjiang province to prepare for future lunar exploration. The cave's environment is considered "strikingly similar" to underground conditions on the moon, which are of high scientific interest for potential human bases. The four-legged robots are being trained to act as "scouts," navigating narrow passages that are inaccessible to human researchers to perform surveying tasks. This research aims to advance the embodied intelligence technologies necessary for deep-space exploration and to overcome challenges posed by the harsh lunar environment.</p>

          <p>Major European defense companies, including Saab, BAE Systems, and Rheinmetall, have expressed support for a proposed plan to create a multi-layered "drone wall" along Europe's eastern border to counter security threats from Russia. The initiative has gained momentum following recent airspace incursions in several NATO member states. While defense giants stand ready to contribute technology and expertise, some smaller firms have raised concerns about potential bureaucratic delays and the need to also address threats from drones launched within EU territory. The plan reflects a growing urgency among European leaders to bolster regional defenses against unmanned aerial systems.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has described the two-child benefit cap as having a "devastating impact" and signaled that the government may soon lift the policy. The rule, introduced by the Conservatives, prevents families from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. Phillipson, who is leading a child poverty task force, emphasized the "real urgency" to address the issue as it contributes to rising child poverty rates. The government is reportedly considering options for the November Budget, including replacing the cap with a tapered system.</p>
