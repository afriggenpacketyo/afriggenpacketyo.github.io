          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that the August 12 deadline for a new trade deal with China is likely to be extended. He expressed optimism about the state of trade relations, stating that he anticipates working out the extension during upcoming talks in Stockholm. Bessent also hopes to broaden the discussions to include China's manufacturing output, its purchases of sanctioned oil, and its role in the Ukraine war. The current 90-day tariff suspension followed a period of escalating trade tensions where both nations imposed steep import duties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett has publicly refuted reports that Berkshire Hathaway's railroad, BNSF, was collaborating with Goldman Sachs on a potential takeover of a rival railway. The billionaire investor stated that neither he nor his successor, Greg Abel, had been in contact with any bankers from Goldman Sachs regarding a deal. Buffett, known for his skepticism towards investment bankers, dismissed the claims which had been reported by Semafor and Reuters. The initial reports suggested BNSF was exploring a bid after competitor Union Pacific showed interest in acquiring Norfolk Southern.</p>

          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, though profits were down from the previous year due to the impact of U.S. auto tariffs. The company affirmed its full-year guidance, which accounts for a potential $4 to $5 billion hit from the trade policies, stating it is working to mitigate at least 30% of these costs. CEO Mary Barra emphasized that GM is adapting to the new trade landscape while also navigating a shift toward electric vehicles. The automaker noted that EV demand may slow following the expiration of federal tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst expectations, largely due to strong performance in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa division. However, the company saw its global unit case volume decline by 1%, with North America, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific markets all reporting a drop in volume. CEO James Quincey noted that while economic uncertainty has impacted consumer confidence, sales have shown sequential improvement in some challenged markets, including the U.S. The company narrowed its full-year earnings outlook to the higher end of its previous forecast.

          <p>This travelogue explores the Greek island of Corfu through the lens of author John le Carré, whose real name was David Cornwell, and his masterpiece "A Perfect Spy." The article delves into how the island, a minor setting in the novel, reflects the themes of espionage, hidden identities, and the inescapable influence of the past that defined le Carré's work. It connects the author's own tumultuous relationship with his con-man father to the novel's protagonist, Magnus Pym. The narrative weaves together the island's complex history, its modern-day tourism, and the author's personal demons.</p>

Bessent suggested that leading such a review would be a positive legacy for Powell, allowing him to "right-size" the Fed's expanding functions while keeping interest rate decisions independent. The comments come amid heightened scrutiny of the Fed, including criticism over cost overruns on its building renovation project.</p>

Despite recent trade-related challenges, such as tariffs on aluminum, the company's shares have risen 13% this year.
