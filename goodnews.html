          <p>OpenAI has been awarded a $200 million contract to provide the U.S. Defense Department with artificial intelligence tools, marking the first contract between OpenAI and the department. The one-year contract aims to develop prototype AI capabilities for critical national security challenges in both warfighting and enterprise domains. This development follows OpenAI's previous announcement of collaboration with defense technology startup Anduril for deploying advanced AI systems. CEO Sam Altman has expressed OpenAI's commitment to engaging in national security areas, emphasizing the company's pride in contributing to these efforts. The contract is with OpenAI Public Sector LLC, with work primarily based in the National Capital Region. Optimism surrounding AI and national security is cautiously balanced with considerations of ethical implications.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2019, all 13 of Yosemite National Park's campgrounds will be open to visitors this summer, offering an additional 500 campsites. Maintenance and staffing challenges had kept several campgrounds closed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The park anticipates high demand, as reservations are already filling up quickly for the summer season. Visitors can still access the park using day passes if campgrounds are unavailable. This reopening marks a significant step toward restoring full access to one of America's most visited national parks.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reduced the hours of the nightly curfew in downtown L.A., now beginning at 10 p.m. instead of 8 p.m., due to diminishing protests and reduced crime. The curfew was initially enacted following chaotic protests in response to President Trump‚Äôs immigration crackdown. Arrests have decreased in recent days, contributing to the decision to adjust the curfew. The LAPD will maintain a strong presence in the downtown area to ensure the safety of residents, businesses, and demonstrators.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health was illegal. The judge stated that the cuts, which targeted research with a perceived connection to diversity, equity, and inclusion, constituted unlawful racial discrimination and discrimination against the LGBTQ community. The judge ordered the reinstatement of grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit. The ruling follows concerns raised by NIH employees about the cutting of over 2,100 research grants since Donald Trump took office.</p>
