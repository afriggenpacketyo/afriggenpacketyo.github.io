          <p>The municipal government of Shaoxing, China, has launched a new stimulus measure to encourage consumer spending by offering subsidies for large dining events. Under the plan, banquet organizers who host five or more tables and spend over 10,000 yuan can receive up to 5,000 yuan back from the government. This local initiative aims to invigorate the catering sector as part of a broader effort to boost economic growth. The policy highlights the balance local officials must strike between stimulating consumption and adhering to national anti-extravagance campaigns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to open higher, following a strong performance on Wall Street where a tech rally lifted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Investor optimism was fueled by a favorable court ruling in an Alphabet antitrust case, suggesting tech giants may be resilient to regulatory threats. However, growing concerns about the broader economy and pressure on global bond markets, with the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield rising, continue to weigh on sentiment. Futures indicate gains for markets in Japan and Australia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it froze over $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University. Judge Allison D. Burroughs stated the administration used allegations of campus antisemitism as a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault" without following proper legal procedures. The ruling restores funding for more than 900 research projects in critical areas like medicine and science. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, which has been hailed as a major victory for academic freedom.</p>

          <p>In Montana's Blackfoot Valley, the Mannix family and other local ranchers have formed the Old Salt Co-op to challenge the industrial food system and ensure their long-term survival. The cooperative focuses on regenerative ranching, a practice that improves soil health and resilience by strategically grazing cattle and allowing land to rest. By processing a significant portion of their livestock locally and selling directly to consumers through their own restaurants and butcher shop, they are creating a sustainable, community-focused model. This approach aims to secure food sovereignty and build a more viable future for agriculture.</p>

          <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC), a major UK union group, is calling on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider implementing wealth taxes to fund public services. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak suggested targeting windfall profits from banks and financial institutions, as well as online gaming and gambling companies. He argued that a more progressive tax system is needed to deliver the change voters expect and warned that failure to do so could lead to disillusionment with mainstream politics. The Treasury responded that its top priority remains growing the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing from personal experience and a career in law enforcement, a former police detective has outlined essential actions to take immediately after a car accident. The first step is to stop the car and turn off the engine, which is a legal requirement in the UK. Subsequently, one should check for injuries, move the vehicle to a safe place if possible, and activate hazard lights. It is crucial to call 999 if anyone is injured, if the other driver leaves the scene, or if the collision is blocking the road.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached in North Carolina that will prevent approximately 98,000 voters from being removed from the rolls, settling a lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice. The DOJ had sought to disqualify voters who registered without providing a driver’s license or partial Social Security number. After intervention from the Democratic National Committee, a consent order was negotiated that allows these voters to cure the issue by providing the information while casting a provisional ballot, thus preserving their ability to vote in future elections.</p>

          <p>A federal judge's ruling in a major antitrust case against Google caused its parent company Alphabet's stock to surge 9%. While Judge Amit Mehta found Google to be a monopolist in online search, he spared the company from the most severe potential penalty: being forced to sell its Chrome web browser. The judge deemed a divestiture "incredibly messy and highly risky." However, he did impose other remedies, including requiring Google to share some of its valuable search data with rivals to help restore competition in the market.</p>
