          <p>JPMorgan Chase announced third-quarter earnings that exceeded analyst predictions, with profit rising 12% to $14.39 billion. The bank's revenue grew by 9% to $47.12 billion, largely driven by a record trading revenue of $8.9 billion for the quarter. CEO Jamie Dimon attributed the strong performance to a resilient U.S. economy but also noted the firm is preparing for potential future turbulence due to geopolitical uncertainty and inflation risks. The bank increased its provision for credit losses, signaling anticipation of higher loan defaults ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

This strong performance reflects a broader trend on Wall Street, where market volatility has benefited trading desks.

The legislation requires AI chatbots to disclose their non-human nature and prompt minors to take breaks, while also mandating social media platforms to label potential mental health risks. Another key law will require device makers like Apple and Google to implement age verification tools in their app stores. These measures represent a significant step in regulating Big Tech, holding companies accountable for promoting safer digital environments for young users.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has fined luxury fashion brands Gucci, Chloe, and Loewe a total of more than €157 million for violating EU competition rules. The investigation found that the companies illegally restricted independent retailers from setting their own prices, both online and in stores, by imposing minimum sales prices and dictating discount periods. This anti-competitive behavior resulted in artificially higher prices and reduced choices for consumers. The parent companies, including Kering and LVMH, were found to have engaged in practices that undermined fair market competition within the luxury goods sector.</p>

          <p>Meta has announced new content policies for Instagram that will limit what teenage users can see to a standard comparable to a PG-13 movie rating. The changes will hide accounts that share sexualized content or media related to drugs and alcohol, and will no longer recommend posts containing swear words to teens. This move aims to address widespread criticism regarding child safety and mental health on the platform. The company stated the goal is to provide parents with a more familiar standard for understanding the content their children are exposed to on the app.</p>

          <p>Former England bowler Stuart Broad has stirred the pot ahead of the upcoming Ashes series, claiming Australia's current team is their "worst since 2010." Responding to predictions of a dominant Australian victory, Broad pointed to question marks over the fitness of captain Pat Cummins and an aging bowling attack. He argued that while winning in Australia is notoriously difficult, the current English squad is the strongest since their last victory down under in 2010-11. Broad believes these factors create the potential for a highly competitive and compelling series.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Germany indicates that the vast majority of employees are not worried about artificial intelligence posing a threat to their job security in the near future. Only about 5% of respondents expressed concern that AI could replace their jobs within five years, while two-thirds reported being "not at all concerned." This widespread complacency exists despite expert analysis suggesting that nearly 40% of jobs in Germany involve tasks that could be largely automated. The survey also highlighted a knowledge gap, with less than 40% of employees having received any formal training on AI.</p>

          <p>China's military is training soldiers to become "human abacuses" by using an ancient mental calculation technique as a backup for when advanced technology fails in combat. State media showcased a drill where a soldier mentally calculated the trajectories of multiple targets in seconds after a simulated radar failure, enabling precise targeting. This training highlights a strategy to ensure operational continuity and human resilience in high-stakes situations where electronic systems could be compromised. The promotion of these skills aligns with China's efforts to bolster national confidence in its military capabilities.</p>

Aghion and Howitt developed a mathematical model centered on "creative destruction," the process where new technologies replace outdated ones. Their collective research highlights that embracing technological disruption and having a skilled workforce to implement it are crucial for long-term prosperity.</p>

          <p>A new injectable drug called lenacapavir is being hailed as a potential game-changer in the fight against HIV, offering nearly 100% protection with just two shots per year. This innovation could overcome major hurdles associated with daily prevention pills, such as adherence and stigma, which have limited their global uptake. The drug has been approved by regulators in the U.S. and Europe, and the Trump administration plans to roll it out in several low-income countries. However, the success of its deployment will depend on overcoming political challenges and ensuring equitable access for the most at-risk populations.</p>
