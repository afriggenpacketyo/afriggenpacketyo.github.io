          <h2>Waymo Aims to Double Robotaxi Production in Arizona by 2026</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Waymo and Magna International plan to double robotaxi production at their Mesa, Arizona plant by the end of 2026, increasing capacity to over 2,000 Jaguar I-PACE vehicles and eventually tens of thousands of fully autonomous vehicles per year. The expansion will support Waymo's growing commercial robotaxi service, which currently operates in several major cities and plans to expand to Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C. in 2026. Waymo is also exploring partnerships with Toyota to bring self-driving technology to personally owned vehicles, and the company is in competition with Tesla, which plans to launch its own robotaxi service in Austin. The article highlights the differences in technology and approach between Waymo and Tesla, with Waymo using more sophisticated and expensive sensors. Optimism about Waymo's ability to produce robotaxis is high as they continue to beat Tesla to market with the product.</p>

          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has decided not to run for Senate in 2026, depriving Republicans of their strongest potential challenger against Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff. Despite being heavily courted by top Republicans, Kemp announced his decision, stating that being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for him and his family. Kemp's decision leaves the field open for other Republican candidates, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene, Mike Collins, and others, and this news comes as Kemp continues to raise funds, leaving open the possibility he may seek higher office in 2028. Ossoff, who has raised $11 million in the first quarter of 2025, is preparing for a tough race.</p>

          <p>Gold bars and coins could be a smart investment worth considering this May due to a rising price and easy access, but potential investors should also consider the costs of storage and insurance. While the current price is high, it may continue to rise, presenting a short-term profit opportunity. However, for those who haven't invested yet, the high price may be a deterrent. It's advised to monitor the market and consider fractional gold options to lower the entry price. It's important to limit gold to no more than 10% of your overall portfolio.

She also apologized to her parents and siblings for lost time and the weddings, anniversaries, birthdays and other milestones missed. Since her retirement and the birth of her daughter, Lloyd has gained a new perspective and has allowed herself to be vulnerable and emotional.</p>
