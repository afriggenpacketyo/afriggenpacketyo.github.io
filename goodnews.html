        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Angela Zhang, a law professor at USC, US tariffs and tech restrictions are pushing Chinese tech companies to innovate and become more competitive. Higher tariffs make it difficult for Chinese products to compete in the US market, but this is forcing companies to cut costs and scale up. Zhang notes that Chinese firms are likely to explore other markets, such as Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and seek deeper trade relations with Europe, potentially offering technology transfers for market access. Despite the challenges posed by the US, Chinese firms are expected to continue pushing for technological advancement. </p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter, is refusing and attempting to return her pardon for her involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and whitewash the events of that day. She sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally reject the pardon, and the Department of Justice has noted her non-acceptance. Hemphill's stance contrasts with other January 6 defendants who actively sought and celebrated their pardons, and she anticipates criticism from Trump for her decision. </p>
