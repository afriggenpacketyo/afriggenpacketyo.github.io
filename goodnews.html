        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to support the entertainment industry after President Trump suggested tariffs on movies filmed overseas. The proposal aims to counter the loss of film and television production to states and nations with more attractive incentives. Senator Adam Schiff also indicated his office was working on a similar federal film incentive proposal. The move follows industry concerns that tariffs could harm Hollywood more than help it, as cheaper labor and tax credits have lured productions away.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to admit approximately 12,000 refugees into the United States, partially blocking the president's efforts to suspend the refugee admissions program. The order followed arguments regarding the interpretation of a federal appeals court ruling. The judge rejected the government's analysis, stating that it was rewriting the judicial order. The ruling aims to ensure the processing of refugees who had already been approved for travel to the U.S.</p>

          <p>The South Texas home of Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company is progressing towards becoming an official city named Starbase. Voters, primarily Musk's employees, approved the formal organization of Starbase as a city.

The creation of an official company town has drawn critics who worry it will expand Musk's personal control over the area.</p>
