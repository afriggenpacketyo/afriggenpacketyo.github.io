          <p>Proposed budget cuts to NASA under the Trump administration, which could total billions, are raising concerns for the European Space Agency (ESA) and international research collaborations. The cuts prioritize Mars-focused programs while phasing out the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft. ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher emphasized the importance of cooperation in space activities and stated that ESA would assess the full repercussions of the changes. The shift signals a move away from the moon and towards Mars, potentially impacting various science projects and researchers globally.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Church is beginning the process of selecting Pope Francis' successor, with cardinals sequestered in the Vatican to elect a new leader. The conclave involves multiple rounds of voting, with a two-thirds majority required for a successful election. Cardinals are prohibited from using cellphones, the internet, or television during the process. Several contenders have emerged as potential candidates, each with different priorities and visions for the future of the Church. The election of the next pope is also seen as a referendum on Pope Francis' papacy and its reforms.</p>

          <p>Many companies now send emails offering customers the option to opt out of Mother's Day-related marketing, a practice that reflects a broader trend of corporations attempting to connect with consumers on a more personal level. While well-intentioned, these emails highlight the inherent absurdity of brands trying to navigate sensitive family dynamics. Despite the efforts to be empathetic, the idea that one can simply opt out of pain or regret is a fiction, as grief and loss are ever-present realities for many. The article also points out that Mother's Day has evolved into a commercial event focused on acquisition, far from its original intention of expressing simple gratitude.</p>

Pickens, known for his talent but also his immaturity, will join the Cowboys in exchange for draft picks. The Steelers' acquisition of DK Metcalf in March made Pickens expendable. Pickens, who averaged 18.1 yards per catch in 2023, struggled to control his emotions and faced criticism for inattentive blocking, leading to the Steelers' decision to move on.</p>

          <p>Credit card debt forgiveness can be a smart option for seniors with high medical expenses, low income, or no significant assets, offering financial relief. However, it may not be suitable for seniors with assets or those who plan to use credit in the future, as it can damage credit scores and trigger tax consequences. Seniors should consider contacting card issuers for lower interest rates and exploring debt repayment strategies like the snowball method. It is also crucial to be wary of predatory actors and ensure the credit card forgiveness program is legitimate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A second US fighter jet has been lost to the Red Sea after falling from the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier within eight days. The F/A-18F Super Hornet went overboard while attempting to land on the Truman's flight deck on Tuesday when a manoeuvre failed, with the two pilots sustaining minor injuries in the incident. The incident is under investigation, and involves jets that are worth tens of millions of dollars each.</p>
