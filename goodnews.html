          <p>Sweden's Volvo Cars reported a significant drop in second-quarter operating profit but still beat analyst expectations, causing its shares to rise. The company, owned by China's Geely, is adapting its U.S. strategy in response to tariffs by planning to produce its popular XC60 SUV at its South Carolina plant starting in 2026. This move aims to better utilize the U.S. factory and mitigate the impact of tariffs on imported vehicles. Simultaneously, Volvo is reducing its sedan and station wagon offerings in the American market due to waning demand.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that the most significant impact of artificial intelligence will be in scientific applications, such as drug discovery and understanding biology. Speaking at an event in Beijing, Huang explained that while AI has been applied to human tasks, its ability to decipher the complex language of nature, like proteins and cells, holds greater promise. He believes that AI can help design new medicines and extend human life, representing a profound area of opportunity. This vision was shared during a discussion with Alibaba Cloud founder Wang Jian.</p>

          <p>Maryland has become the first state to utilize a fund established under the Affordable Care Act to help cover expenses for patients traveling to the state for abortion care. In the wake of Roe v. Wade's overturn, states where abortion remains legal have seen a surge in out-of-state patients, straining local abortion funds. Maryland's new law allows the state to allocate up to $2.5 million annually from a $25 million surplus account, originally funded by insurance company fees, to support these non-profits. This approach presents a potential model for other states facing similar financial pressures.</p>

          <p>Director Ari Aster's latest film, "Eddington," is a Western-style period piece set in a fictional New Mexico town during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. The movie dramatizes the cultural and political divisions over masking and public health mandates, with characters played by Pedro Pascal and Joaquin Phoenix representing opposing viewpoints. Aster describes the film as a satire about a society where people inhabit different realities, leading to paranoia and ultimately violence. He hopes the film serves as a reflection on a deeply polarized time.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking second-quarter profit, surging nearly 61% year-on-year due to the relentless demand for artificial intelligence chips.

          <p>Andre Correa do Lago, the Brazilian diplomat presiding over the next UN climate talks, emphasized the challenge of keeping climate change relevant amid global conflicts and economic pressures. He stated that while wars and trade disputes dominate headlines, the threat of climate change continues to grow and requires urgent, integrated action. He advocates for reframing climate action as a driver of economic growth and jobs, aiming to mainstream it into all sectors of policy. Despite setbacks like the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord, he remains optimistic about achieving global cooperation.</p>

Biegun argued that Chinese officials understand they must make such commitments to create a temporary balance in the trade relationship, as the trade balance is the primary metric used by the U.S. president to gauge economic fairness.
