          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has incorporated over 6,000 new words in the past year, primarily influenced by social media and celebrity culture. Among the notable additions are "skibidi," a versatile term from a viral YouTube series, and "delulu," a derivative of delusional. Other entries like "tradwife," "broligarchy," and "mouse jiggler" reflect evolving societal trends and remote work practices. The dictionary's lexical program manager emphasized that only words expected to have lasting power are included, capturing the dynamic evolution of the English language.</p>

          <p>Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems, related to the network's airing of false claims about the 2020 election. This settlement follows a similar, larger payout by Fox News to Dominion for its election coverage. The lawsuit accused Newsmax of broadcasting conspiracy theories from figures like Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell, alleging Dominion's equipment was compromised. This resolution avoids a trial and addresses one of the final outstanding defamation cases concerning the election's integrity.</p>

          <p>MSNBC will undergo a significant rebranding, changing its name to 'My Source News Opinion World,' or MS Now, and removing the iconic peacock logo. This move is part of Versant's upcoming separation from Comcast's NBCUniversal, aiming to establish a distinct identity for the political news network. Despite the name change, MSNBC's leadership assures that its journalistic focus and commitment to audiences will remain unchanged. The network is also aggressively hiring to build its own independent newsroom, signaling a new chapter for the cable news entity.</p>

          <p>Bournemouth has finalized a deal to acquire Liverpool winger Ben Doak for an initial £20 million, with an additional £5 million in add-ons. The 19-year-old Scottish international is expected to complete his transfer shortly, following a successful loan spell at Middlesbrough last season. This move aims to provide Doak with more first-team opportunities, having played sparingly for Liverpool since 2022. The sale contributes to Liverpool's substantial summer transfer income, nearing £200 million, largely from selling youth and development players for significant profit.</p>

          <p>A major experiment in rural Kenya reveals that unconditional cash transfers of $1,000 to low-income families drastically cut infant and child mortality rates by nearly half. The study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found that cash payments were particularly effective in reducing deaths during birth and the immediate post-natal period. This impact is attributed to improved access to healthcare facilities and better nutrition, as families no longer had to choose between medical care and basic necessities. The findings suggest cash aid can be as impactful as traditional medical interventions in saving young lives.</p>

          <p>The opening weekend of the Premier League season highlighted Liverpool's defensive vulnerabilities, particularly their susceptibility to counter-attacks, a stark contrast to their previous season's record. Despite attacking reinforcements, the team's balance appears off, with misplaced midfield passes leaving the defense exposed. While sloppy passing is a factor, the analysis suggests Liverpool's commitment of numerous players to attack leaves too few defenders back. Manager Arne Slot may need to adjust full-back and central midfielder positions to provide better protection against counter-attacking sides. The tactical shifts will be a key storyline for their season's performance.</p>

However, the remnants of the hurricane are forecast to bring unsettled weather, including wet and windy conditions, to the UK next week. Meteorologists clarify that reports of a '600-mile wall of rain' are misleading, as such weather systems are typically large but do not produce continuous sheets of rain. The high pressure system currently over the UK will shift, leading to a change in weather patterns by mid-week.</p>

While their offenses remain formidable, the pitching and defensive issues threaten their chances in their respective league playoff races.

A Rhodium Group report indicates a historic shift, as Chinese EV companies are now prioritizing foreign markets despite higher costs and risks abroad. This move aims to sidestep intense domestic competition and build an offshore economic empire. The surge in overseas investment contrasts with declining domestic outlays and underutilized factory capacities within China, reflecting a strategic pivot to global expansion for the EV sector.
