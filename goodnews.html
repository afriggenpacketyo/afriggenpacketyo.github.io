          <p>Vox correspondents Anna North and Adam Clark Estes discuss the implications of AI for children's education and development. They express both hopes and fears, highlighting AI's potential in fields like medicine and language decoding, while also worrying about its impact on essential skills like writing and math. They also ponder how AI will change school assignments and grading, suggesting a shift towards oral presentations or audio-visual production skills. The article emphasizes the importance of parents engaging with AI alongside their children to guide them in its responsible use.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House passed a Republican tax bill that includes an increase to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000, phasing out over $500,000. This provision, part of President Trump's tax package, aims to provide relief to lawmakers in high-tax states such as New York, New Jersey, and California, where the current SALT deduction is capped at $10,000. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially offsetting some benefits of the higher SALT cap. The House proposal could face pushback in the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

Military officials emphasized that the test was not a response to current world events but a demonstration of the nation's nuclear deterrent strength.

          <p>William Robert Braddock III, a former Republican congressional candidate from Florida, received a three-year federal prison sentence for threatening to have his primary opponent, Anna Paulina Luna, murdered. Braddock pleaded guilty to sending an interstate transmission of a threat to injure, stemming from a 2021 incident where he threatened to have Luna killed by a "Russian-Ukrainian hit squad." Luna, who eventually won the primary and general election, was the target of Braddock's disparaging behavior for months, leading to the threats.

          <p>Net migration to the UK nearly halved in 2024, falling to 431,000, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study in the UK following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government, and large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving. The Home Office also reported a decrease in the number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels, though the figure remains higher than when Labour came to power last year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said there had been a "300,000 drop in net migration since the election" last year.</p>
