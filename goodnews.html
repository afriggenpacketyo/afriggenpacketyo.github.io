          <p>Singapore successfully avoided a technical recession, reporting a 1.4% economic growth in the second quarter of 2025, a significant reversal from the previous quarter's contraction. This growth was primarily driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector and a 4.4% increase in construction, beating economists' expectations. Despite this positive performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy due to unclear U.S. tariff policies. The report underscores the nation's economic resilience while acknowledging its vulnerability to international trade volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is intensifying efforts to resolve a nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers, aiming to hire 2,000 new personnel by the end of the year. The initiative, bolstered by a $12.5 billion investment, includes streamlined hiring processes and advanced simulation technology at its Oklahoma City training facility to expedite certification. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the administration is leveraging every opportunity to address the shortage, which has previously caused delays at major airports. These measures are designed to enhance the safety and efficiency of the nation's airspace.</p>

          <p>China's trade data for June revealed stronger-than-expected performance, with exports increasing by 5.8% and imports rising by 1.1% year-over-year. The export surge is attributed to businesses rushing shipments to capitalize on a temporary tariff reprieve with the U.S. Notably, this marks the first time this year that imports have grown, signaling a potential rebound in domestic demand. This economic activity occurs as Beijing and Washington work towards an August deadline for a durable trade agreement, following a period of intense tariff exchanges and subsequent negotiations.

          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a symbol for women's rights in France after publicly testifying about the decade of sexual abuse she endured, has been awarded the Legion of Honor. This is the country's highest civilian award, recognizing her courage in a case that shocked the nation and led to significant legal reforms. Her ex-husband and 50 other men were convicted for drugging and assaulting her. Pelicot's insistence on a public trial helped push the French Senate to pass a bill including lack of consent in the criminal definition of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Banyan Group founder Kwon Ping Ho, a 30-year veteran of the luxury hotel industry, observes that modern tourists have vastly different expectations than previous generations. He notes that today's travelers, particularly younger ones, are jaded with standard group tours and seek deeper, more authentic experiences that involve interaction with local communities. This shift from checklist sightseeing to experiential travel is supported by recent studies showing a willingness to splurge on unique experiences. Ho also highlights the rise of "rainbow tourism," with travelers now coming from a diverse range of developing nations, not just Europe.</p>

          <p>Ireland's Armagh Observatory is marking a major scientific milestone: 230 years of continuous, daily weather observation. This unbroken sequence of handwritten data, which began on July 14, 1795, is the longest of its kind in the UK and Ireland. The tradition continues today, with a human observer manually recording temperature and other data, a practice largely replaced by automated stations elsewhere. This invaluable long-term record has chronicled significant weather events and contributed to the development of meteorology, including the invention of the four-cup anemometer by a former director.</p>

While stars like Yoshinobu Yamamoto have been exceptional, issues in the bullpen and inconsistent hitting remain areas for improvement as the team heads toward the trade deadline aiming for a repeat championship.</p>
