          <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has defended the company's decision to increase in-office requirements to three days a week and alter sabbatical eligibility, despite facing criticism from employees. Khosrowshahi stated that these changes are necessary for improved collaboration, innovation, and company culture, emphasizing the need for Uber to be at its "A game" as a "Gen-AI powered company." Some employees questioned whether the changes were intended to reduce attrition, but Khosrowshahi denied any cost-cutting motives. Uber reported first-quarter results that exceeded earnings expectations but fell short on revenue, with shares declining following the report.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is predicted to reenter Earth's atmosphere around May 10, 2025, after a failed Venus mission. Experts estimate the half-ton mass of metal could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, including parts of the United States, South America, Africa, and Europe. While the risk of impact is small, there is a slight chance the spacecraft could hit someone or something upon reentry. Experts suggest that if the heat shield fails, the spacecraft will burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, however, if the heat shield holds, it'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.</p>

          <p>Tom Brady shared advice he gave to Shedeur Sanders after Sanders experienced a slide in the NFL Draft, eventually being selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round. Drawing from his own experience as a late-round pick, Brady emphasized that the draft is just the beginning and that Sanders should use it as motivation. Brady encouraged Sanders to focus on his performance and leadership once he gets to the Browns, noting that many successful players were not high draft picks. Sanders had a NIL deal with the Brady Brand when he was the quarterback at Jackson State.</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates continue to offer strong returns, exceeding current inflation rates and providing a safe investment option with FDIC insurance.

Strategies such as CD laddering can help investors take advantage of high short-term rates while also saving for the long term.
