          <p>Hall of Fame coach Don Nelson voiced his disapproval of the Dallas Mavericks' trade of Luka Donƒçiƒá by wearing Donƒçiƒá's signature Jordan Brand sneakers to an NBA Finals news conference. Nelson, who coached the Mavericks for eight seasons, expressed his belief that trading Donƒçiƒá to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis was a "tremendous mistake." He cited Red Auerbach's philosophy of retaining generational talents and honoring them for a lifetime. Despite some fan anger subsiding due to the Mavericks winning the draft lottery, Nelson's protest underscores the significance of Donƒçiƒá's departure.</p>
