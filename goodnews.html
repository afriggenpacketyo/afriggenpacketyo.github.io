          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching a deal with Pakistani authorities. The agreement addresses key demands from demonstrators, including cheaper wheat and reduced electricity tariffs, bringing an end to demonstrations that resulted in the deaths of at least ten people, including three police officers. The alliance leader expressed gratitude for the government's willingness to resolve the issues, though leaders remain hopeful that this deal will be implemented more successfully than previous unfulfilled promises from last year's protests.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's All Blacks secured a 28-14 bonus-point victory over Australia in a rain-affected Rugby Championship game in Perth. Center Quinn Tupaea was instrumental, scoring two crucial tries late in the first half that swung the game in New Zealand's favor. The win moves the All Blacks to the top of the championship table, but their title hopes are not yet secure. South Africa can still claim the championship if they win their final match against Argentina.</p>

          <p>Lyft CEO David Risher shared the story of how he left a secure management job at Microsoft in 1996 to join what was then a small online bookstore called Amazon. He was convinced by founder Jeff Bezos's intense focus on the customer experience and his bold prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000. Risher recalls that even his boss, Bill Gates, called it the "stupidest decision" at the time, highlighting the immense risk and vision involved in Amazon's early, formative years.</p>

This push is driven by the electricity needs of AI data centers and a new ban on Russian uranium imports, which previously supplied a significant portion of US fuel. The plant's expansion is a critical part of the US strategy to build out a domestic nuclear supply chain, though bottlenecks in other areas like uranium conversion remain a challenge.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the long-held belief in the enduring value of a prestigious college brand is weakening among American families. As tuition soars and the job market tightens, parents and students are increasingly prioritizing practical considerations like cost, career outcomes, and hands-on learning opportunities over mere reputation. This shift is causing a reevaluation of what makes a "good" college, with many families opting for less-ranked schools that offer better financial aid or specific programs, leading to more fluidity in the traditional college hierarchy.</p>
