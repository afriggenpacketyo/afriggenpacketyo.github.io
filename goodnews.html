        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a dramatic return to Test cricket, England's Jofra Archer electrified the crowd at Lord's by taking a key wicket early in his spell against India after a four-year injury layoff. The second day of the match saw fortunes swing, as England's Joe Root not only scored a magnificent century but also set a new record for the most catches by an English outfielder. However, India's Jasprit Bumrah delivered an influential performance of his own, claiming five wickets to disrupt England's batting lineup and restrict their first-innings total to 387. India concluded the day's play at 145-3, trailing by 242 runs and setting the stage for a compelling continuation of the contest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widely adopted goal of walking 10,000 steps per day originated not from scientific research but from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer called the "Manpo-kei," or "10,000 step meter." While the number was initially arbitrary, subsequent studies have shown that significant health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower counts like 2,500 steps. Many health experts still endorse the 10,000-step target as it aligns with general physical activity guidelines of about 150 minutes per week and provides a simple, actionable goal for patients. Ultimately, researchers emphasize that consistency and intensity are key, and any amount of walking is better than none.</p>

          <h2>Essays Explore American Exceptionalism Through the Lens of Global and Hemispheric History</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 13:20:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two recent essays in The Atlantic challenge the traditional notion of American exceptionalism by drawing parallels and lessons from other nations, particularly in Latin America. One article reviews a book on Argentina's Dirty War, highlighting how the state-sponsored atrocities of the past offer cautionary tales for any society, including the U.S., where checks on state power erode. Another piece discusses a history of the Western Hemisphere, suggesting that democratic concepts like birthright citizenship were pioneered in Latin America, upending the view of the U.S. as a sole guiding force. These perspectives argue that the U.S. is not immune to authoritarianism and has much to learn from global experiences.</p>

          <h2>Market Commentary Highlights Amazon and Nvidia Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

          <p>Despite a weaker market driven by concerns over President Trump's announcement of a 35% tariff on some Canadian goods, several megacap tech stocks showed resilience. Morgan Stanley raised its price target for Amazon, citing manageable tariff impacts and accelerating growth in its AWS cloud business. Nvidia's stock also continued its ascent after the company surpassed a $4 trillion market capitalization, with CEO Jensen Huang's meeting at the White House seen as a significant positive signal. Meanwhile, Starbucks shares dipped despite a positive analyst rating, as investors remain focused on the company's U.S. turnaround and strategy in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 13:12:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals with low incomes struggling with debt, several relief options can provide a path to financial stability. Credit counseling and debt management plans can help by negotiating lower interest rates with creditors, making payments more manageable without reducing the principal balance. For those already behind on payments, credit card debt forgiveness programs may allow for settling debts for a fraction of the amount owed, though this can impact credit scores. Additionally, many lenders offer hardship programs with temporary relief, and in cases of overwhelming debt, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can offer legal protection and a chance to discharge or restructure what is owed.</p>

          <p>Member of Parliament Rupert Lowe has been cleared of wrongdoing by the parliamentary standards commissioner following a brief investigation into donations for his "Rape Gang Inquiry" crowdfunder. The complaint alleged a failure to register donations in a timely manner, but the commissioner confirmed no rules were broken as the 28-day window for registration had not expired. Lowe described the complaint as a "malicious attempt" to undermine his inquiry and stated he provided irrefutable evidence to the authorities. The inquiry, which has raised over £600,000, is investigating gang-based sexual exploitation in the UK.</p>

In an interview, Oswalt discussed how the special will explore his experiences with sadness and confusion in these rapidly changing times.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Individuals living on Social Security can qualify for credit card debt forgiveness, but the process has unique considerations. While a fixed, low income can make it easier to demonstrate the financial hardship required for negotiation, the ability to save up for a lump-sum settlement can be a significant challenge. A key advantage for recipients is that Social Security benefits are legally protected from garnishment by most creditors, which can provide significant leverage in settlement talks. However, before pursuing this path, individuals should assess their cash flow, consider the stress of ongoing collections, and compare alternatives like debt management or credit counseling to find the best fit.</p>

          <p>High-yield savings accounts continue to offer competitive interest rates, often exceeding 4.30%, making them an attractive option for savers in the current economic climate. A major advantage is the flexibility they provide, allowing easy access to funds without the penalties associated with CDs, which is valuable amid economic uncertainty. However, a key drawback is that these high rates are variable and may fall sooner than expected, as banks could preemptively lower them ahead of anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts. Savers should also be aware that the best rates are typically offered by online-only banks, which may be a shift for those accustomed to traditional branch banking.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high, surpassing $118,000, driven by the largest single-day inflow into Bitcoin ETFs this year, totaling $1.18 billion.

The recent passage of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which is expected to increase the federal deficit, is also seen as a positive catalyst for the cryptocurrency. This significant upward movement reflects growing institutional confidence and investment in Bitcoin, solidifying its strong performance in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Marco Argenti, Goldman's tech chief, stated this agentic AI could boost worker productivity by up to four times, handling drudgery like code updates.

          <p>A 2025 analysis of living costs across the U.S. has identified the nation's most affordable states, with West Virginia ranking as the cheapest. Following West Virginia are Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, and North Dakota, all offering lower costs for housing, goods, and services compared to the national average. The study highlights that in these states, a smaller percentage of household income is spent on essentials like housing. For example, in West Virginia, fewer than 20% of residents are cost-burdened by housing. These states provide a more affordable lifestyle, which is an attractive factor for both residents and businesses looking to relocate. (not investment advice)</p>
