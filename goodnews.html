        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent imposition of triple-digit tariffs on Chinese products, which led to significant trade disruptions, has been partially rolled back following trade talks in Geneva. The tariffs, initially raised to 145%, caused American businesses to cancel orders and warn of higher prices, while Chinese factories faced shutdowns. The new agreement lowers tariffs to 30% on Chinese goods entering the U.S. and to 10% on American goods entering China, however it is still unclear what concessions China will make. The decision is a welcome relief for businesses, but uncertainty remains as both countries have until mid-August to reach a comprehensive trade deal.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials and state media are portraying the initial trade agreement and tariff pause with the U.S. as a major win for Beijing. They claim their firm public stance convinced the Trump administration to significantly reduce tariffs, with the U.S. import duties dropping from 145% to 30% on Chinese goods, and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods decreasing from 125% to 10%. Social media users in China are celebrating the deal, viewing it as a vindication of their negotiating tactics and a demonstration of China's resilience in trade negotiations with the United States.</p>

While Coinbase's stock remains volatile and below its 2021 peak, its inclusion in the S&P 500 is expected to increase its value due to funds tracking the index adding it to their portfolios.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariff receipts reached a record $16.3 billion in April, driven by revenue from President Trump's trade policies. This surge in customs duties, an 86% increase from March and more than double the previous year, contributed to a surplus of $258.4 billion for the month, reducing the year-to-date budget deficit to $1.05 trillion. Despite this boost, high interest rates continue to strain the budget, with net interest on the national debt totaling $89 billion in April.</p>

These additives, Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract, and calcium phosphate, have been vetted through a rigorous process and are not indicated to be harmful. While natural doesn't automatically equate to safety, experts suggest these additives should be safe, especially in the small amounts used for coloring.</p>

This comes amid a backdrop of rising immigration numbers and previous government failures to meet migration targets. Labour is grappling with practical and political trade-offs around immigration, and Starmer's language is seen as a response to concerns raised by Reform UK and a recognition of public sentiment.</p>

          <p>Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone, and various entertainment industry groups have sent a letter to President Trump urging him to support tax measures that would incentivize film and TV production in the U.S. The letter supports Trump's proposal to create a 15% corporate tax rate for domestic manufacturing activities, using a provision from the old Section 199 of the federal tax code as a model. They are also requesting an extension of Section 181 and an increase in tax-deductible qualified film and TV production expenditures.</p>

          <p>As home prices and mortgage rates remain high, renting has become a more common choice, but rents are also surging, making comfortable living unaffordable in many cities. Renters now need to earn at least $80,000 annually to afford the typical apartment rental, and in cities like New York, Boston, and San Francisco, that number rises to $100,000 or more. The lack of adequate housing supply is a major factor, with construction not keeping pace with demand.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariff Strategy Falters in Achieving Trade Rebalancing Goals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent trade truce between the U.S. and China, marked by reduced tariffs, highlights the contradictions in President Trump's trade strategy. While large tariffs risk damaging the economy, modest tariffs lack the impact needed for a significant reordering of the global trading order. The shift suggests a move away from grand ambitions of restoring U.S. manufacturing and reducing dependence on China, instead focusing on securing a deal that can be framed as a win.</p>

          <p>The recent trade truce between the United States and China, which involves a drastic reduction in tariffs, is being welcomed but may not be enough to prevent shortages. The temporary truce will see the United States lower tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, and China reduce its import duties on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%, starting Wednesday. Despite this de-escalation, supply shortages and price increases on Chinese products may still affect American consumers due to weeks of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has defended the White House plan to receive a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar for use as America's Air Force One, despite ethical concerns. Trump stated that Qatar is "giving us a gift" and that it would be "a stupid person" if he did not accept it, while a Qatari spokesman said it would be "inaccurate" to refer to the plane as a gift and described it as an aircraft for "temporary use". Critics, including Democratic lawmakers, have raised legal and ethical questions about the plan, citing the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution.</p>
