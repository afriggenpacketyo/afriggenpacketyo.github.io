          <p>America's second-largest cicada swarm, Brood XIV, is anticipated to emerge across the East Coast, potentially being the second-biggest ever. These periodical cicadas emerge every 13 or 17 years and are categorized by broods. Brood XIV will emerge in states ranging from Georgia to New York, with the emergence lasting about a month, depending on the weather. While cicadas do not bite or sting and are not harmful to humans, pets, household gardens, or crops, people should keep in mind that what they are seeing is unique. This event is specific to the U.S.</p>

          <p>If you have not filed your 2024 tax return, there are several important questions to consider to mitigate potential penalties and enforcement actions from the IRS. Determine if you filed an extension, and if so, understand what it covers. Ascertain how much you owe and explore options for payment plans if you cannot afford to pay it right now. Ensure you have received all the necessary documents to file accurately and assess your risk of IRS penalties or enforcement action. Consider whether working with a tax professional would make the process easier and cheaper in the long run. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has placed new limits on the scope of federally mandated environmental impact statements for major transportation and energy projects. The decision, in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, was 8-0. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, said use of NEPA to stymie energy and infrastructure programs has gotten out of hand and needs to be curtailed. The decision clears the way for a proposed rail line linking Utah and Colorado, and could lead to more expeditious approvals of similar construction programs nationwide. Justice Sonia Sotomayor concurred with the judgment but wrote separately to explain her reasoning.</p>

          <p>Giant statues of snakes have been erected in Geneva to raise awareness of the snakebite crisis, which causes roughly 140,000 deaths each year. The Strike Out Snakebite initiative, launched at the World Health Forum, aims to put the dangers of snakebite back on the global health agenda. The statues are intended to attract attention to the hidden burden of snakebites, which disproportionately affects poor communities in rural areas. The initiative's goal is to ensure that every adult and child who needs an antivenom gets a high-quality antivenom delivered to them rapidly.</p>

          <p>About 20 Los Angeles Times subscribers attended a hike to Sycamore Canyon falls in Point Mugu State Park. The 3.5-mile trek started on the Wendy Trail in Rancho Sierra Vista/Satwiwa, national parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains. Hikers learned about efforts to restore the land back to oak woodlands and coastal sage scrub. The group navigated steep inclines and rocky terrain before reaching the waterfall, where they rested before hiking back as the sun started coming out. The event provided an opportunity for subscribers to connect with nature and each other.</p>
