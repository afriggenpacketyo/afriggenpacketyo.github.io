          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that nonfarm payrolls increased by 139,000 in May, surpassing the Dow Jones estimate of 125,000. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%. Hiring decreased slightly in May even as consumers and companies braced against tariffs and a potentially slowing economy. This indicates a slightly stronger labor market than anticipated despite economic uncertainties. The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in April, a figure that was revised downward.</p>
