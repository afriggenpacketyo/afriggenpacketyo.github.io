          <h2>Audio Reveals Biden Joking About Age During Classified Documents Interview</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newly released audio from former President Joe Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur reveals Biden joking about being a "young man" despite struggling with memories of key events, such as the death of his son Beau and the year Donald Trump was elected. Hur's report, which declined to press charges against Biden for mishandling classified documents, described him as a "sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory." The article notes the report amplified Republican concerns about Biden's mental fitness, and that Biden dropped out of the presidential race later in 2024, with Kamala Harris losing to Trump in the election. The optimism score is 70 because the article describes a stable political transition.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 04:00:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article discusses the growing gap between the rich and the average person, arguing that wealth begets wealth and policymakers have failed to address wealth accumulation effectively. It proposes the idea of an "extreme wealth line," similar to the extreme poverty line, to identify when wealth becomes harmful to society. The article suggests that wealth concentration can undermine economic competition, harm the environment, and tear at the social fabric. It calls for a democratic way of defining extreme wealth and implementing measures such as higher taxes or mandatory charitable donations for those exceeding the line. The optimism score is 60 because it describes a problem and potential solutions.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The research, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups can be traced back to these early settlers, whose cultures exist in the genes of modern Indigenous groups. The study also found that the early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, providing new insights into South American communities.
