          <p>President Trump clarified that he intends to leave office after his current term, acknowledging the constitutional limit preventing him from seeking a third term, despite some individuals wanting him to do so.

          <h2>Experts Caution Women About Over-Reliance on Egg Freezing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 19:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As more women turn to egg freezing to extend their fertility options, some experts caution against viewing it as a guaranteed solution. Vardit Ravitsky from the Hastings Center highlights the costs, medical risks, and emotional gamble involved, citing stories like Evelyn Gosnell's, whose frozen eggs did not result in a viable embryo. Critics also argue that the commercialization of fertility services may prioritize profits over patient care. They suggest that societal changes, such as better parental leave policies, could support women in having children at younger ages.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Egg freezing is increasingly popular among women who want to preserve their fertility and increase their chances of having children later in life. This allows them to delay starting a family without the pressure of a ticking biological clock. Experts like Dr. Tomer Singer foresee egg freezing becoming a routine practice, while others caution it's not a guarantee. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and freezing, with costs ranging from $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus storage fees and additional expenses for thawing and fertilization.</p>

          <p>More than half of first-time home buyers in the past year received financial assistance from their families, according to Savills. An average of ¬£55,572 was given in loans and gifts, reflecting the challenges young buyers face with high mortgage rates and increasing rental costs. This level of family support is slightly lower than the previous year but higher than most years since 2013, peaking in 2009 during the financial crisis.
