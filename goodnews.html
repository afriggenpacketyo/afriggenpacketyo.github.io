          <p>Conan O‚ÄôBrien and Ryan Reynolds humorously compared Meghan Markle‚Äôs new lifestyle brand, As Ever, and its artisanal jam offerings to Reynolds' late father's job as a food broker. The comedians joked about the Duchess of Sussex's $14 raspberry jam, which is crafted with a hint of lemon and packaged in elegant Keepsake Packaging. This commentary follows criticism of Markle's venture as inauthentic, with experts noting the importance of relatability and connection in building a successful lifestyle brand. The experts say that Markle's brand is missing that crucial component. </p>

          <p>This article reflects on the life and legacy of Malcolm X, a prominent figure in the Black civil rights movement, on the centennial of his birth. It discusses his advocacy for self-confidence and fighting for rights "by any means necessary," including violence if needed, in response to the oppression faced by African Americans. The article highlights his early life marked by racism and violence, his involvement with the Nation of Islam, and his later shift away from racial separatism after a pilgrimage to Mecca. The article concludes by noting his lasting influence on Black identity and political activism. </p>

          <p>Kenton Cool, a British mountain guide, has achieved a record-breaking 19th ascent of Mount Everest, surpassing his own previous record for the most climbs by a non-Sherpa guide. The 51-year-old reached the summit along with other climbers during the current spring climbing season. Cool first summited Everest in 2004 and has climbed it almost every year since, with exceptions in 2014 and 2015 due to tragic events. Only Nepali Sherpa guides have more ascents of the world's highest peak, with Kami Rita holding the record at 30 climbs. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that altering the way bricks are stacked in kilns in Bangladesh could drastically reduce air pollution. By implementing a zig-zag pattern that improves airflow and ensuring consistent coal delivery, kilns can operate more efficiently. The study found that these simple interventions reduced fuel use by 23% and decreased carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions by approximately 20%. This low-cost solution not only benefits the environment but also improves worker conditions and increases profits for kiln owners. </p>

          <p>An opinion piece addresses concerns about Hong Kong's legal system after 2047, when the "one country, two systems" framework is set to expire. The author urges calm, drawing on experiences from the lead-up to 1997, when similar anxieties arose. While acknowledging the need to consider future legal adaptations, the piece suggests that Hong Kong should not prematurely abandon its existing legal structures. The treaties that gave Britain control over Hong Kong Island and urban Kowloon in perpetuity should be considered in the discussion. </p>

          <p>Dan Richards contrasts the resurgence of night trains in Europe with the decline of long-distance public transport in the United States. Europe is revitalizing its sleeper train network to compete with short-haul flights, driven by environmental concerns. In contrast, the United States is cutting funding for public infrastructure, leading to a binary choice between fast, environmentally damaging options and slow, run-down alternatives. Richards advocates for investing in rail networks to promote community, connection, and a more sustainable future. </p>
