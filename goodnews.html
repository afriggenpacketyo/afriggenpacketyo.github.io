          <h2>Hawley Announces Expansion of Nuclear Waste Compensation Program in Senate Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 10:14:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has announced a significant expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) in the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill." The proposal, if adopted, would allow individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, as well as "downwinders" exposed to nuclear radiation, to be compensated for exposure to toxic waste. The reauthorization of RECA also includes claims for increased levels of atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers to the list of those eligible for benefits. Hawley hopes this shows the country stands beside those affected by nuclear exposure, offering a measure of vindication and appreciation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from implementing further portions of his executive order imposing new requirements for voter registration. Judge Denise Casper granted a preliminary injunction sought by attorneys general from 19 states, finding that the states were likely to succeed in their case. The ruling prevents the Trump administration from requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the national voter registration form and from directing the secretary of defense to update federal applications for absentee voting for military members and overseas voters. Casper stated that the executive order's mandates conflicted with the will of Congress.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated that Japan's position to call for the removal of U.S. tariffs will not change. This announcement comes as Japan prepares for another round of tariff talks with U.S. officials in Washington. The prime minister's firm stance underscores the ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries and Japan's commitment to advocating for the elimination of tariffs. The discussions are crucial for both nations' economic relations and broader trade policies.</p>

          <p>A second federal judge has ruled that additional provisions of President Trump's executive order related to voting need to be paused. Judge Denise Casper affirmed a pause on the requirement that people provide documents proving citizenship when registering to vote using the national registration form. Casper also blocked a provision aimed at barring states from counting mail ballots postmarked by Election Day but received after the election. The judge emphasized that states, not the president, have the power to set election rules according to the Constitution.</p>

          <p>England has recalled left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone for their five-match T20 series against India. Ecclestone had been taking a break from domestic cricket to prioritize her wellbeing and recover from a quad injury, but was expected to return for the India series. She missed England's T20 and ODI series wins over West Indies in May and June as she recovered from a knee injury. The India series will be the first time Ecclestone has represented England since January's Ashes defeat in Australia.</p>
