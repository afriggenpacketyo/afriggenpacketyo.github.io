          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, nicknamed "razor blade throat" due to its symptom of a severe sore throat, is being monitored by health officials. The variant, derived from Omicron, has been detected in multiple states and is the second most dominant in the U.S., accounting for approximately 37% of cases. Experts indicate the variant appears more transmissible due to changes in its spike protein, but it doesn't seem to cause more severe illness or increase hospitalization rates. Health experts recommend updated vaccinations, practicing good hygiene, and considering masks in crowded areas.</p>

          <p>A study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are reducing shoreline pollution, with areas enacting such policies experiencing a decrease of up to 47% in plastic bag waste collected during cleanups. The effectiveness of these policies varies, with fee-based approaches proving more successful than partial bans. California's initial ban, while well-intended, led to an increase in thicker plastic bag waste due to loopholes. The study also suggests that bag laws may reduce harm to marine life, with a decrease in entangled animals in areas with such policies.</p>

          <p>"28 Years Later," directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, is praised as an excellent horror film that shocks and moves audiences. The film adopts an ambitious approach by extending its geographic coverage and exploring a supposedly idyllic community serving as a refuge from the rage virus. The film is the start of a trilogy, with the second installment already filmed, and it features well-developed characters, particularly Spike, a child of the apocalypse who becomes a child of war. The film is visually captivating, despite its brutal and intense scenes.</p>

          <p>Diego Luna revealed that before his role in "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," he was primarily offered roles as drug dealers in Hollywood. Luna noted that Hollywood productions were not "sending messages" that he could be himself in projects where he could see himself reflected in the roles. He also recounted being asked to clean up his accent early in his career. Luna's presence in American productions has helped increase Latinx representation in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>President Joe Biden will participate in a Juneteenth Celebration Service at the Reedy Chapel AME Church in Galveston, Texas. The church is historically significant as one of the locations where the order announcing the end of slavery in Texas was read in 1865. In 2021, Biden signed legislation making Juneteenth a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S. Juneteenth became the nation's first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established in 1983.</p>

          <p>Federal agents were stationed outside Dodger Stadium on Thursday morning, prompting speculation about their activities. Sources familiar with the situation reported that the agents were denied entry to the stadium grounds when they attempted to access the parking lots. The Dodgers have been under pressure to make a statement in support of immigrants since the raids began earlier this month, and announced plans to assist affected communities. A singer performed the national anthem in Spanish at the stadium as a protest against the immigration raids.</p>
