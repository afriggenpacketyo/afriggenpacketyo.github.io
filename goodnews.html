        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has delayed by one month a plan to cut off access to crucial satellite data used for hurricane forecasting. The decision came after scientists and NASA raised alarms, warning the move could set forecasting back decades. The administration cited a "significant cybersecurity risk" as the reason for the original plan, which involves decommissioning a data ingest system managed by the US Navy. The data is also vital for monitoring polar sea ice changes.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order lifting some U.S. financial sanctions on Syria to support the country's stability following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. The move would terminate a 2004 declaration that froze Syrian government assets, a decision made after Trump met with Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa. However, targeted sanctions will remain in place against former leader Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, and terrorist-linked entities, aiming to maintain pressure on the old regime while assisting the new transitional government.</p>

          <p>England's recent Test match victory over India highlighted the critical importance of efficiently dismissing the opposition's lower-order batsmen, often called the "tail." Fast bowler Josh Tongue was particularly effective, taking three wickets in each innings against India's tail, which offered little resistance. This skill, which involves aggressive and intimidating bowling, has been a weakness for England in the past. The ability to prevent the opposition's tail from scoring significant runs is seen as a key factor for England's future success, especially in the upcoming Ashes series.</p>

          <p>A key provision in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" would create a new federal income tax deduction for workers who earn tips. The proposal, framed as a benefit for the working class, would eliminate federal income tax on tips, though state, local, and payroll taxes would still apply. However, critics and policy analysts note that the tax cut would be temporary, expiring in 2028, and would not benefit the lowest-earning workers who often have no federal income tax liability to begin with. The House and Senate versions differ on income caps and deduction limits for the tax break.</p>

          <p>Tyson Foods has announced a $23.5 million investment to expand its facility in Robards, Kentucky, aiming to increase production capacity and meet growing market demand for its protein products. The project is scheduled for completion by spring 2026. Simultaneously, the company is facing labor unrest at its beef-processing plant in Amarillo, Texas, where 3,200 unionized workers have voted overwhelmingly in favor of a strike. The workers are demanding higher wages and improved benefits, and the union has filed unfair labor practice charges against the company.</p>

          <h2>UK Food Delivery Apps to Implement Stronger Checks to Prevent Illegal Work</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 13:36:49 EDT</div>

          <p>Major food delivery companies in the UK, including Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and Just Eat, have agreed to strengthen their security measures to prevent illegal work. The move comes after reports that some asylum seekers, who are not permitted to work, were using other people's accounts to make deliveries. The companies will increase the use of facial verification and other fraud detection technologies to ensure that only legally registered account holders are working. This agreement with the government aims to curb the illicit sharing of accounts within the gig economy.</p>
