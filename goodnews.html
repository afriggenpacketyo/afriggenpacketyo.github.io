          <p>A Lakers fan, Andrew Garcia, dropped his small claims lawsuit against LeBron James after receiving a compensatory offer from the PrizePicks fantasy sports app. Garcia had sought to recoup money spent on tickets, believing James was announcing his retirement, which turned out to be a marketing stunt. PrizePicks deposited promo funds equivalent to his ticket cost into his account, along with an offer for Lakers game tickets and merchandise. Garcia stated he chose to dismiss the case as he felt fully compensated, avoiding any appearance of "double-dipping" after the generous offer.</p>

          <p>This article explores the U.S. Constitution's history, emphasizing its design for amendment and adaptation over two centuries, citing the 13th and 19th Amendments as key examples. Historian Jill Lepore highlights that the founders expected constant revisions, with over 200 state-proposed amendments leading to the Bill of Rights. Jeffrey Rosen of the National Constitution Center notes concerns that checks-and-balances are not functioning as intended, with Congress inactive and courts overly powerful. Despite current political challenges, the article asserts the Constitution's enduring principles against tyranny, urging a renewed commitment to its intended framework for a "more perfect union."</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed rare earth companies surged as investors reacted to Chinese export restrictions and U.S. efforts to build a domestic supply chain. The Trump administration, in collaboration with Australia, signed an agreement to invest in critical mineral ventures, aiming to reduce reliance on China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated price floors for industries like rare earths to combat market manipulation. This policy has spurred rallies in miners like NioCorp, Energy Fuels, and USA Rare Earth, with expectations of further government backing for domestic producers to secure essential minerals for technology and defense.

          <p>The Disneyland Resort is set to transform its "Soarin’ Around the World" attraction into "Soarin’ Across America" in 2026, coinciding with the U.S. 250th anniversary. This patriotic makeover, also planned for Walt Disney World’s Epcot, will feature American landscapes and cityscapes. The initiative is part of a broader "Disney Celebrating America" program, launching on Veterans Day and continuing through July 4, 2026, with America-themed programming across Disney networks. This move, however, has sparked debate regarding its nationalistic pride during a divisive political climate, contrasting with Disney's recent shift towards more global and diverse park visions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homebuyers and those looking to refinance should be cautious of common mistakes as mortgage rates continue to cool. One error is assuming rates will only decrease further, as historical data shows fluctuations, making it wise to act if current rates are affordable. Another is overlooking alternative savings like mortgage points or adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which can offer lower initial rates. Finally, don't strictly adhere to the traditional 1% refinancing rule; even half a percentage point reduction can yield significant savings. Always calculate total savings, including closing costs, and ensure a long enough stay to recoup these expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Year-end is a popular time for Roth IRA conversions, where pretax funds are moved to a Roth account for future tax-free growth, incurring upfront taxes. This timing allows for precise current-year income estimates, crucial for multi-year tax projections. Financial advisors note that tax uncertainty, especially regarding the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's expiration and ongoing debates over Affordable Care Act subsidies, influences decisions. While some advocate for earlier conversions, waiting until year-end minimizes the risk of unexpected income triggering tax benefit phaseouts.
