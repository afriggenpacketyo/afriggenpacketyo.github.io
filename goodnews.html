          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka has been excluded from the England squad for their World Cup qualifier against Andorra, with head coach Thomas Tuchel citing Saka's limited training participation during the week. Saka, who has 43 caps for the Three Lions, missed three months of action due to a hamstring injury but returned for the final two months of the campaign. Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins has also been left out of the squad due to a minor injury, while the reason for Conor Gallagher's omission remains unclear.

The investment thesis for Amazon centers on its e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing strengths, while Alphabet's thesis revolves around digital advertising and cloud services.
