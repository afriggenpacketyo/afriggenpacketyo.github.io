          <p>Vivek Ramaswamy, a GOP gubernatorial candidate in Ohio, and Senator Jon Husted have publicly endorsed each other's campaigns. This move is being presented as a significant display of party unity in the Republican-dominated state, aiming to consolidate support ahead of the November elections. The endorsements bridge the establishment wing of the party, represented by Husted, and the "America First" base aligned with Ramaswamy. Political analysts suggest this rare collaboration sends a powerful message that the party is a "big tent" focused on winning key state-level races.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, is set to propose a fellowship scheme with discounted visas to attract American cancer scientists to the United Kingdom. The initiative is a direct response to the Trump administration's decision to cut billions of dollars from biomedical research grants, a move that has caused concern within the US scientific community. Davey's proposal aims to position the UK as a global leader in cancer research by stepping into the void left by what he terms the US government's "anti-science agenda." The speech is part of a broader critique of President Trump's policies.</p>

He highlighted names across various sectors, including T-Mobile in telecommunications and Royal Caribbean in the consumer travel space. In finance, he pointed to companies like Capital One and Citigroup, suggesting the sector is well-positioned for growth. Cramer's analysis aims to find companies with above-average growth potential at a lower-than-average price, even as major indexes reach new heights (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area in the early hours of Monday, centered near Berkeley. The quake was widely felt across the region, waking many residents and causing shaking strong enough to knock items from shelves, but no major damage or injuries have been reported. Public transit services, like Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), ran at reduced speeds while safety inspections were conducted on the tracks. Officials and residents view the event as a stark reminder of the seismic risks in the earthquake-prone region and the constant need for preparedness for a much larger event.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to television on Tuesday, nearly a week after it was "pre-empted indefinitely." The suspension followed a monologue where Kimmel commented on the political response to the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. In its statement, Disney explained the show was paused "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation," calling some of the host's comments "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The decision to pull the show had sparked a nationwide debate on free speech, drawing criticism from First Amendment advocates and fellow entertainers.</p>

          <p>NASA has officially introduced its newest class of ten astronaut candidates, selected from a pool of over 8,000 applicants. The group, which for the first time includes more women than men, is composed of pilots, a geologist, a biomedical engineer, and a former SpaceX launch director. These candidates will now undergo two years of intensive training for future missions to the International Space Station and, eventually, the Moon and Mars as part of the Artemis program. The selection comes at a time of uncertainty for the agency, with budget cuts and the planned retirement of the ISS later this decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is launching a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if they present with the same symptoms three times without improvement. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. The guidance encourages doctors to take further action, such as ordering more tests or seeking a second opinion, to prevent avoidable deaths. The goal is to make this "three strikes and rethink" approach standard practice to improve patient safety and catch serious illnesses earlier.</p>

          <p>China has begun the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, a comprehensive economic and social blueprint that will guide the nation's development from 2026 to 2030. This long-term planning is considered a key strategic advantage by President Xi Jinping as the country aims to achieve the status of a "moderately developed country" by 2035. The plan will be crucial for navigating rising uncertainties, including economic headwinds at home and geopolitical tensions abroad. Experts suggest that to succeed, Beijing may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over the rigid quantitative targets of the past.</p>

          <p>Police in Menlo-Atherton, California, believe they prevented a potential school shooting after receiving a tip through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system. The tip flagged concerning Instagram posts by a former student, leading to a temporary lockdown of two schools while police located the individual and recovered weapons from their home. The "Say Something" system was created by Sandy Hook Promise, an organization founded by victims' families from the 2012 school shooting. This incident marks the 19th credible planned school attack the system has helped thwart since its launch in 2018.</p>

          <p>Deion Sanders appeared to confirm reports that his son, quarterback Shedeur Sanders, turned down opportunities to be drafted by the Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles. Speaking on a podcast, the elder Sanders explained that his son questioned the logic of sitting behind established young MVP-caliber quarterbacks like Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts for potentially many years. Shedeur Sanders, once considered a potential first-round pick, was eventually selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL draft. Deion Sanders stated he is now preaching patience to his son as he begins his professional career.</p>
