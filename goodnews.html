          <p>This article from the "We the People" series delves into the pivotal history and application of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution. It recounts the dedicated mission of John Feerick, a young lawyer who, in the years leading up to President John F. Kennedy's assassination, advocated for clear constitutional instructions regarding presidential succession and disability. The article explains how this amendment, a critical addition to the Constitution, provides a framework for addressing situations where a US president becomes unable to perform their duties. It highlights the foresight and necessity of establishing such a mechanism to ensure governmental stability and prevent power vacuums, detailing the man who championed this essential constitutional safeguard.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 02:53:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reports that the UK economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing Reuters' forecast of 0.1% growth. This rebound, led by the services sector and construction, followed a weaker April and May influenced by US tariffs and business uncertainty. Despite this positive data, economists like George Brown of Schroders express skepticism about the momentum continuing into the third quarter, citing a softening labor market and persistent inflation pressures. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates, balancing sticky inflation against cooling employment and subdued growth, indicating a finely balanced economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article details the South Korean Supreme Court's rejection of a $21,600 copyright claim against the creators of the viral children's song "Baby Shark." US composer Jonathan Wright alleged the 2015 hit copied his 2011 rendition. However, the court upheld previous rulings, determining that Wright's version lacked sufficient originality to warrant copyright protection, as both songs are based on a traditional melody popular at US summer camps. The ruling affirms that Pinkfong's "Baby Shark," which boasts over 16 billion YouTube views, is based on a public domain singalong chant.</p>
