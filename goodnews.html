          <p>President Trump is weighing the possibility of ending federal conservatorship of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a move supported by investor Bill Ackman. The potential privatization has sparked debate, with supporters arguing it could improve the firms' operations and opponents warning of potential risks to the housing market. Senator Elizabeth Warren cautioned against prioritizing Wall Street interests over affordable housing for average Americans. The decision could significantly impact mortgage rates and the stability of the housing finance system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough in underwater communication, enabling error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean. This milestone could pave the way for real-world applications in long-range undersea messaging, with both civilian and military implications. The project team developed a self-tuning system capable of mapping signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography. This advancement addresses challenges such as signal scattering, Doppler shifts, and ambient noise that typically hinder underwater communication over long distances.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a rapid 40-pound weight gain and severe swelling after contracting COVID-19, leading to a diagnosis of pericardial constriction. Despite numerous tests, doctors struggled to identify the cause until a cardiologist suspected the rare condition, where the sac around the heart thickens and prevents it from fully opening. Open-heart surgery successfully removed the scarred pericardium, relieving the pressure and allowing Mauceri to regain his health. Mauceri has since returned to conducting and expresses gratitude for the medical intervention that restored his quality of life.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that tooth sensitivity can be traced back to ancient armored fish, whose exoskeletons evolved into our teeth. Yara Haridy and her colleagues found that the structure of invertebrate armor resembled vertebrate teeth, indicating a shared function. By examining modern-day fish, they discovered nerves in tooth-like scales, suggesting the armor allowed ancient fish to sense their environment. This research explains why we experience toothaches and connects our anatomy to our evolutionary history.</p>
