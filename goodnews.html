          <p>Bukayo Saka, the Arsenal winger, was omitted from England's squad for the World Cup qualifier against Andorra due to fitness issues, as confirmed by head coach Thomas Tuchel. Saka had only participated in one full training session during the week, suggesting a link between his absence and his physical condition. Atletico Madrid midfielder Conor Gallagher and Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins were also left out of the matchday squad, with Watkins returning home due to a minor injury. Saka, who is 23, has not yet played under Tuchel, and his participation in the friendly against Senegal remains uncertain. The England team is currently unbeaten in World Cup qualifying, having won their opening matches against Latvia and Albania. </p>

Lee's progressive stance suggests a potential shift in Seoul's foreign policy, although continuity in trilateral military cooperation is expected.
