          <p>A Chinese national, Haoxiang Gao, who was charged with illegal voting at the University of Michigan, has fled the U.S. after admitting to registering and casting a vote in the 2024 general election. Despite a judge ordering him to surrender his passport and remain in Michigan, Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai using a Chinese passport. The FBI has charged him with flight to avoid prosecution, though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China. This case is one of a few instances of non-citizens voting in federal elections in modern history, with analysis finding only 30 suspected cases out of 23.5 million votes cast in the 42 jurisdictions reviewed.</p>

          <p>Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize Foundation, expresses optimism about the future of AI and biotech despite the ongoing tech war between the US and China. He emphasizes that scientific breakthroughs in one country benefit humanity as a whole due to the universal nature of biology, math, physics, and chemistry. Diamandis contrasts this cosmopolitan vision with the current political climate, where the US has curbed international student visas and cut scientific funding. He voices concern over the long-term implications of these cuts on the speed of scientific discoveries.</p>

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) supports collaboration among universities to address these challenges but recognizes concerns about breaking business laws. Universities UK suggests greater collaboration could help institutions cut costs and become more efficient. University budgets have been strained by a drop in international students and rising fees, leading to course cutbacks and job losses.
