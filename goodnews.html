          <p>A fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, was damaged in what the mayor called "an apparent explosion" on Saturday morning. Reports of a loud boom and images of broken glass and smoke were shared on social media, with the explosion occurring less than a mile from downtown. The mayor, Ron deHarte, said that there were still structures on fire in the area, but that there were no reports of injuries as of yet and that the source of the explosion was not immediately known. Police, firefighters, and medical crews were on the scene, and the public was advised to avoid the area.</p>

The program has seen participation from over 500 independent Chick-fil-A operators and has helped employees avoid an estimated $11 million in student debt.

          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz criticized President Trump in a law school graduation speech, accusing him of creating a national emergency by repeatedly violating the rule of law. Walz called on graduates to stand up to abuses of power, citing Trump's immigration crackdown and questions about due process. He described Trump as a tyrant abusing power to persecute scapegoats and enemies, while also attacking big law firms that have acquiesced to Trump in the face of threats. Walz, considered a potential 2028 candidate, acknowledged his remarks were pointed for a celebratory ceremony but asserted his duty to address the issue head-on.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a high-stakes presidential election between the hard-right "sovereignist" George Simion and the pro-EU liberal Nicusor Dan. Simion, a fan of Trump and Orban, won the first round and advocates for Romania to exit NATO and the EU, while Dan stands for the rule of law, transparency, and support for Ukraine.

This expansion is part of an ambitious plan to diversify the UAE's economy and increase its influence over global supply chains.

It emphasizes the importance of acknowledging both the tragedies and triumphs of Black history, highlighting the museum's ability to balance the past with the present and future. The museum's approach should be an example for other institutions to follow, as it does not shy away from the tragedies, but neither does it give short shrift to the joy.</p>
