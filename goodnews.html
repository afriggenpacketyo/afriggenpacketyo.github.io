          <p>John Edward Bruce, a prominent Black journalist and Pan-Africanist pioneer born before the Civil War, will finally receive a headstone 101 years after his death. Despite his international renown and founding several newspapers, he was buried in an unmarked grave in Yonkers, New York, in 1924. A new black granite headstone, funded by private and public efforts, will soon be installed to honor his significant contributions to preserving Black history and culture. Organizers noted that his fame did not translate to wealth, and plans for a monument likely fell through due to historical circumstances like the Great Depression.</p>

          <p>A Michigan man, Joshua Taylor, is leading an effort to make adult changing tables more common in public spaces to serve teenagers and adults with disabilities. Taylor, who experiences incontinence due to a genetic condition, highlights the indignity and difficulty caregivers and individuals face, often resorting to changing on dirty bathroom floors or in cars. He argues that the lack of accessible facilities forces many people with disabilities to stay home, limiting their participation in community life. Working with the national organization Changing Spaces USA, he is successfully advocating for installations across Michigan to address this essential need.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that the stock market's recent recovery is primarily driven by the strong earnings reports from major technology companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. Despite a weak labor report and concerns over new tariffs that initially caused a downturn, the market rebounded sharply, with the Nasdaq surging nearly 2%. Cramer highlighted impressive growth in cloud services for Microsoft and user engagement for Meta as key factors. He suggested that the financial strength, diverse revenue streams, and controlled expenses of these tech giants make them resilient forces in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New, stricter firearms licensing laws have taken effect in the U.K., a change championed by Emma Ambler, whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered in 2020 with a legally held weapon. The new rules, which apply from August 5, require two character references for shotgun certificate applications instead of one and mandate police to consult with applicants' partners to check for signs of domestic abuse. The changes were also influenced by other fatal shootings, including the 2021 Plymouth incident. Ambler expressed emotional relief and hope, stating the changes signify that victims' voices have been heard and could prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>Dr. Lisa Carchedi, a psychiatrist in Maryland, gave her older sister, Gina Warsaw, the gift of life by donating a kidney. The transplant took place on April 1, the anniversary of their father's death, who had always emphasized the importance of family. Warsaw had been suffering from kidney failure and undergoing dialysis before her sister was found to be a match. The kidney was removed using a minimally invasive, single-port robotic surgery, a technique that reduces scarring and recovery time. Both sisters are recovering well, celebrating their strengthened bond on National Sisters Day.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that his office has saved the state nearly $170 billion by successfully challenging the Trump administration in court. Speaking alongside Governor Gavin Newsom, Bonta reported spending over $5 million in the last six months on 37 lawsuits and numerous legal briefs. The largest savings came from a lawsuit that blocked an attempt to freeze federal funding. Other legal victories protected billions in funding for transportation, education, and healthcare. Newsom affirmed his commitment to providing Bonta's office with the necessary resources to continue fighting what they see as unlawful federal actions.</p>

          <p>The southern Chinese province of Hainan is positioning itself to become a major medical tourism destination, with a goal of attracting over 1.5 million domestic medical tourists annually by 2027. The initiative, outlined in a new government plan, aims to approve new medical products for the market and introduce dozens of innovative international drugs and devices each year. This strategic push comes as competitor South Korea is set to remove value-added tax refunds for foreign tourists seeking cosmetic surgery, potentially making China a more attractive option for medical and aesthetic procedures in the region.</p>

          <p>New guidance from the U.K.'s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that patients coming off obesity injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro receive structured support for at least a year. This advice addresses the common issue of patients regaining a significant portion of their lost weight after treatment ceases. The guidance emphasizes that weight management is a long-term commitment and suggests patients need help building sustainable habits, such as healthy eating and exercise, to maintain their progress. An estimated 1.5 million people in the U.K. are using these jabs, mostly through private means.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner over a large downward revision to jobs numbers, experts clarify that such revisions are a normal part of the process. The BLS issues preliminary monthly reports to provide timely data, then revises them as more survey responses are collected from businesses and households. While the recent 258,000-job downward revision for May and June was large, it is not unprecedented, especially in a volatile economy. Former officials and analysts emphasize that this process is a feature designed for accuracy, not a bug or a sign of manipulation.</p>
