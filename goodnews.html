          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which raised concerns about his mental acuity following an investigation into his handling of classified documents. Audio recordings from Biden's October 2023 interviews with Hur revealed Biden struggling to recall key dates and events. When questioned about Hur's description of him as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory," Biden defended his mental fitness. The report, along with public gaffes, fueled Republican criticism, while Democrats initially defended Biden before eventually calling for him to drop his candidacy due to age and mental acuity.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, causing the skyline to disappear and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its first-ever dust storm warning for the city. The storm, fueled by high winds over dry farmlands, reduced visibility to zero in some areas and disrupted travel, including a ground stop at Midway International Airport. Residents reported feeling the debris in the air, and expressways experienced significant backups. The National Weather Service noted that dust storm warnings are more common in rural parts of central and southern Illinois, making the event in Chicago highly unusual.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin judge pleaded not guilty to federal charges of helping an undocumented immigrant evade immigration authorities, drawing parallels to a similar case in Massachusetts involving Judge Shelley Joseph. Joseph was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant escape a courtroom to avoid ICE. While the charges against Joseph were later dropped, the case sparked debate about federal overreach and the balance between state and federal authority. The article explores the complexities of how state judges should balance their courtroom prerogatives with federal immigration enforcement.</p>
