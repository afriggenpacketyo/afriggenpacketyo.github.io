          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump announced a delay in imposing 50 percent tariffs on all imports from the European Union until July 9 to provide more time for trade negotiations.

The extension comes after Trump had expressed frustration with the EU's negotiating tactics and threatened to enact the tariffs on June 1. European officials have offered to reduce tariffs on industrial goods and increase purchases of U.S. energy in exchange for reduced tariffs on European products.</p>
