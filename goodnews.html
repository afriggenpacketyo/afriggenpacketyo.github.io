          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is rebranding its streaming service back to HBO Max, reversing its previous decision to rename it Max. The company aims to emphasize quality over quantity in its programming, mirroring a similar strategy shift by competitor Disney. CEO David Zaslav stated that the change aims to capitalize on the HBO brand's reputation for high-quality media. This move comes after the company's streaming business improved its profitability and added 22 million subscribers globally in the past year, however they also lost the rights to National Basketball Association games beginning next season.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move celebrated by many Syrians hoping for economic recovery after a decade of civil war. The decision follows a meeting between Trump and Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara, a former rebel leader, marking the first time in 25 years the leaders of the two countries had met. While the Syrian government lauded the meeting as "historic," analysts caution that the economic impacts of lifting sanctions may take time to materialize, as rebuilding the war-torn country and reintegrating it into the global economy is a complex process.</p>

          <p>Credit card balances in the U.S. have decreased to $1.18 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, marking a $29 billion drop from the previous quarter. However, credit card debt remains 6% higher than the same period last year, and with APRs exceeding 21% on average, it's crucial for cardholders to reduce their debt. Strategies for reducing credit card debt include debt settlement, debt consolidation through personal loans or balance transfer credit cards, and seeking help from a credit counselor. Experts advise choosing a strategy that aligns with individual circumstances and can be consistently followed.</p>

State Farm argued that the increase is necessary to avoid a financial crisis and prevent the company from dropping more policies. The decision comes amid California's efforts to retain insurers in the state, which has been increasingly affected by wildfires. In exchange for the rate increase, State Farm will receive a $400 million cash infusion from its parent company and halt some non-renewals through the end of the year.</p>

The plans could save farmers up to ‚Ç¨1.58 billion per year and limit on-site checks on farms to once per year. Smaller farmers would be exempted from conditions tying the receipt of subsidies to environmental regulations, and certified organic farms would be considered as automatically meeting certain environmental regulations.

          <p>Researchers at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have accidentally transmuted lead into gold nuclei during experiments involving collisions between lead nuclei. While the transformation is an incidental outcome of their experimentation, the researchers estimate that LHC collisions conducted between 2015 and 2018 resulted in 86 billion accidental gold nuclei. However, the resulting amount of gold is extremely small and short-lived, and the process is wildly inefficient.

          <p>This article shares a snapshot of Tibetan children playing in Dharamshala, India, where the Dalai Lama and thousands of Tibetan refugees settled. The author was resting near a playground between interviews for a story on the shrinking number of Tibetan children in a boarding school built for them. The school continues to take in Tibetan children as boarders and teaches them about their heritage. Despite the serious context of the story, the author was laughing as they took the picture of the children, noting that children find a way to play no matter where they are.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have advanced trillions of tax breaks as part of President Donald Trump's economic package. The House Ways and Means Committee passed its portion of the legislation, but the battle over the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) remains unresolved. While the current proposal would raise the SALT cap to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, some House lawmakers want to see a higher limit before the full House vote. The full House vote could come as early as next week, but the legislation could see significant changes in the Senate.</p>
