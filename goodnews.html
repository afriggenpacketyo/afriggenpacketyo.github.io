          <p>The annual Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement, anticipated in October, may be postponed due to a potential federal government shutdown. The COLA is calculated using third-quarter inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose report could be delayed. Experts project the 2026 increase to be between 2.7% and 2.8%, which would provide a modest boost to beneficiaries' monthly checks. However, the final net increase will also depend on the forthcoming announcement of Medicare Part B premium costs. (not investment advice)</p>

Terri Lesley was terminated in 2023 after she refused to remove certain books from the youth shelves as demanded by some community members and local officials. Her lawsuit claimed her First Amendment rights were violated and she was subjected to a hostile work environment for not discriminating against LGBTQ+ individuals. Lesley stated she felt vindicated by the settlement and would never regret standing up for constitutional principles.</p>

          <h2>Delta Air Lines Exceeds Profit Forecasts Amid Strong Demand for Premium Travel</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-09 07:02:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta Air Lines has issued a fourth-quarter profit forecast that surpasses analyst expectations, attributing the positive outlook to rising airfares and strong, resilient demand for luxury and premium travel. The airline's third-quarter results also beat estimates, with revenue from its premium segment growing by 9%, while main cabin revenue saw a slight decline. CEO Ed Bastian noted there were no signs of a consumer pullback on high-end products and that cash sales have been picking up since July. The strong performance suggests improved demand following a period of overcapacity in the domestic market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Gallup Poll Reveals Sharp Decline in Alcohol Consumption Among US Republicans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-09 07:00:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll has identified a significant trend toward sobriety within the American right wing, with the percentage of Republicans who report drinking alcohol dropping from 65% to 46% in just two years. This 19-point plunge is far more dramatic than the single-digit declines seen among Democrats and independents. While the exact cause is unknown, theories include the influence of teetotaling figures like Donald Trump, a rise in Christian temperance, and a growing "Make America healthy again" wellness movement. Prominent conservative figures have noted that elective sobriety is becoming increasingly common and accepted in their circles.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen successfully survived two no-confidence votes in the European Parliament. The challenges, brought by the hard-right Patriots for Europe faction and the far-left alliance The Left, failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority for her removal. While the outcome was expected, the votes highlight the increasing fragmentation within the parliament and the difficulty von der Leyen's Commission faces in building stable majorities to pass legislation. She received support from just over half of the 720-seat parliament in both votes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government in England and Wales has launched a review of what it calls "outdated" licensing rules, which could lead to extended opening hours for pubs and bars. The proposed reforms aim to boost the hospitality sector by cutting red tape, making it easier for venues to serve food outdoors and host live music. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer framed the review as a way to support economic growth, critics have raised concerns that relaxing alcohol regulations could lead to an increase in antisocial behavior. A four-week call for evidence will allow pub landlords and communities to provide input.</p>
