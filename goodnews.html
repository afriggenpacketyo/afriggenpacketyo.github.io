          <p>India is launching an ambitious "Semiconductor Mission," backed by $18.2 billion in investments, to establish a complete domestic chip supply chain from design to manufacturing. This strategic push aims to reduce reliance on imports, secure its electronics market, and capture a share of the global industry shifting away from China. The government has approved ten projects, including fabrication plants and testing facilities, and is offering significant financial incentives to attract global players like Taiwan's Powerchip. While India possesses a large pool of engineering talent, experts caution that building a successful ecosystem is a long-term challenge requiring improvements in infrastructure, policy, and intellectual property protection.

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, is calling for the UK to offer discounted visas to American cancer scientists whose research has been affected by funding cuts under the Trump administration. In a speech, Davey will propose a fellowship scheme to attract researchers, stating, "If Trump won't back this research, we will." The move follows the U.S. government's decision to slash billions from biomedical research grants, a decision that U.S. medical organizations warned would be "devastating" to scientific progress. Davey's proposal frames the UK as a leader in science, stepping into a vacuum created by what he calls the U.S. government's "anti-science agenda."</p>

          <p>Copenhagen Airport temporarily suspended all take-offs and landings for approximately four hours after two to three large, unidentified drones were spotted flying in the vicinity. The airspace closure, which began around 8:30 PM local time, caused significant disruptions, with at least 35 inbound flights being diverted to other airports. Authorities launched an investigation into the incident, and the airport has since reopened. However, officials warned passengers to expect continued delays and cancellations as operations gradually return to normal, advising them to check their flight status directly with their airlines.</p>

Among his picks are T-Mobile in telecommunications, Royal Caribbean and Expedia in the consumer travel sector, and several financial institutions like Capital One, American Express, and Citigroup.

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, waking residents across the region. The quake was centered just east of Berkeley, and while it was widely felt, there were no reports of significant damage or injuries. The event caused minor disruptions, such as merchandise falling from store shelves and temporary speed reductions on the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system for track inspections. Officials and seismologists noted that the quake serves as a reminder for residents in the seismically active region to be prepared for the possibility of a much larger and more destructive earthquake.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air, ending a suspension that began after the host made comments about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The company stated the initial decision was made because some remarks were "ill-timed and thus insensitive," but decided to reinstate the show after conversations with Kimmel. The suspension had sparked a nationwide debate on free speech, drawing criticism from First Amendment advocates and fellow late-night hosts. The controversy began after the FCC chairman, a Trump appointee, suggested regulatory action against ABC, leading several affiliate station owners to pull the show before the network's official suspension.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's National Health Service (NHS) has launched a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if they present with the same or worsening symptoms on three separate occasions. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. The guidance encourages doctors to order more tests, seek a second opinion, or refer the patient to a specialist to prevent misdiagnoses and avoidable deaths. The Royal College of General Practitioners supports the rule, acknowledging the challenge of identifying serious illnesses with ambiguous early symptoms, particularly in younger patients.</p>

          <p>China is in the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, a comprehensive economic and social blueprint that will guide the nation's development from 2026 to 2030. This long-term planning is a cornerstone of Beijing's governance, aimed at achieving ambitious goals such as reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As officials prepare to discuss the plan, experts note that it will need to be flexible, likely prioritizing qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets. This approach is seen as necessary to navigate rising uncertainties, including domestic economic challenges and a complex international landscape, while steering the country toward its long-term strategic objectives.</p>

          <p>Police in Menlo-Atherton, California, successfully prevented a potential school shooting after receiving a tip through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system. The tip alerted authorities to concerning social media posts made by a former student, leading to a temporary lockdown of two schools while police located the individual and recovered weapons from their home. The "Say Something" tip line was created by Sandy Hook Promise, an organization founded by families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. This incident marks the 19th credible planned school attack the system has helped to thwart since its inception, highlighting the critical role of community vigilance in preventing gun violence.</p>

In a podcast appearance, the elder Sanders explained that Shedeur was hesitant to join a team where he would be a long-term backup to an established star like Lamar Jackson or Jalen Hurts. Shedeur, once considered a potential first-round pick, was ultimately selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round. Deion Sanders defended his son's desire for a viable path to playing time, stating that players don't develop by sitting on the bench in the NFL.</p>
