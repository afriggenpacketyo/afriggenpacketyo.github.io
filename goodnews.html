          <p>Top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi has expressed Beijing's willingness to restart dialogue and rebuild trust with Canada, signaling a potential mending of strained bilateral ties. The comments were made during a meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand in Beijing, which Wang described as a "fresh start" for the relationship. He stated that China is prepared to advance the settlement of legitimate concerns and return relations to a stable and sustainable path. This diplomatic effort follows Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's recent visit to Washington to manage escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered one of the most dominant postseason performances in baseball history, powering the Los Angeles Dodgers to the World Series with a 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. Ohtani hit three solo home runs and, as the starting pitcher, struck out ten batters while allowing only two hits into the seventh inning. This incredible two-way display secured a four-game sweep of the National League Championship Series for the Dodgers. Ohtani was named the NLCS MVP for his efforts, which ended a previously quiet postseason for the superstar.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are scheduled to conduct a new round of trade negotiations next week, aimed at preventing further escalation of their tariff dispute. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia. In a recent interview, President Donald Trump acknowledged that the cumulative tariff rate on Chinese goods is not sustainable but stated that China's own export controls on rare earths forced his hand. The talks come as a previous tariff truce agreement is set to expire on November 10. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study in North America has yielded promising results for the Galleri blood test, which can detect more than 50 types of cancer by identifying cancerous DNA fragments in the bloodstream. The trial, involving 25,000 adults, found that the test successfully identified a wide range of cancers, three-quarters of which currently lack any screening program. More than half of the cancers detected were at an early, more treatable stage, and the test correctly identified the cancer's origin in 90% of cases. The NHS is currently conducting a larger trial in England, with results expected next year.</p>

          <p>A woman from Newport, Wales, discovered she had a large, cancerous tumor on her kidney after a seemingly minor accident during a holiday weekend at Butlin's. Charlotte Morjaria, 31, sought emergency care for what she believed was a broken rib after a friend playfully lifted her over his shoulder. A CT scan to check for internal damage unexpectedly revealed the 7cm tumor, which had produced only subtle symptoms that were easily attributed to other causes. Following surgery to remove her kidney, she is now cancer-free but requires lifelong monitoring.</p>

          <p>A surge in overseas orders is fueling a competitive hunt for executive talent among Chinese energy storage companies, with firms offering high salaries to lead their international operations. In the first half of this year, Chinese firms secured nearly 200 overseas orders totaling 186 gigawatt-hours, a year-on-year increase of over 220%. The majority of these orders originate from the Middle East, Australia, and Europe, as the U.S. market remains constrained by tariffs.

          <p>After his father's death, Antony Easton discovered a suitcase revealing his family's hidden past as wealthy German Jews named Eisner whose fortune was stolen by the Nazis. The contents led him on a decade-long investigation, uncovering a multi-billion-pound steel empire, Hahn'sche Werke, that was forcibly sold at a low price to a Nazi-supporting conglomerate. Further research showed that a trusted family adviser, Martin Hartig, took control of the family's properties and never returned them. Easton has since begun the process of restituting stolen artworks, including one from a Berlin museum.</p>
