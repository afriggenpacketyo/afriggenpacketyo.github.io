          <p>Following two days of trade talks in London, US President Donald Trump announced a wide-ranging deal with China to maintain the truce established after earlier talks in Geneva. The agreement is expected to cover various points of contention, including shipments of rare earth minerals, student visas, and tariffs. While Trump declared the accord "done" on his Truth Social platform, Chinese representatives have remained reticent, stating they will submit a report for President Xi Jinping's approval. The outcome of these negotiations could have significant implications for the global economy. </p>

          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung ordered the discontinuation of loudspeaker broadcasts along the border with North Korea to promote peace. In response, Pyongyang appears to have stopped its loudspeakers near the border targeting the South. The broadcasts, which included propaganda messages and K-pop music, had resumed in June 2024 after North Korea launched trash-filled balloons toward the South. Lee vowed to reopen communication channels with North Korea, though Pyongyang continues to reject diplomatic overtures amid growing ties with Russia.</p>

The Spending Review also includes more money for artificial intelligence and transport projects. However, the Foreign Office and the environment department will see reductions in day-to-day spending, and the chancellor is restricted in how much can she spend as a result of her two self-imposed rules. </p>

The astronomers spotted a mysterious new star glowing in the southern sky and described it as being about the size of a cup-shaped oil lamp with a pure yellow color. The detailed account confirms that the phenomenon was a nova, a slow, temporary brightening caused by a dying star, rather than a comet or meteor. The discovery provides unprecedented insights into the celestial event.</p>
