          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed confusion over the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite a strong quarterly performance and an increased forecast for full-year sales and earnings. Simon highlighted Walmart's success in growing its top-line revenue and expanding margins while effectively managing the impact of tariffs, stating the company is "hitting it on all cylinders." He suggested that investors may have overreacted to a one-time earnings miss caused by restructuring costs rather than a systemic issue. Simon now believes Walmart's combination of low prices and convenience has created a sustainable advantage in attracting and retaining shoppers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aberdeen midfielder Dante Polvara made a significant impact in a Europa League playoff match, coming off the bench to score a crucial goal and lead his team to a 2-2 draw against FCSB. The 25-year-old American, who has been used sparingly this season, entered the game with his team down 2-0 and immediately revived their hopes with a skillfully taken goal just three minutes later. His energetic performance, which included creating multiple chances and winning most of his duels, has intensified calls for manager Jimmy Thelin to give him a starting role. Polvara's future at the club is currently under discussion, with his contract expiring at the end of the season.</p>

His company aims to make its high-end cleaner, which features an AI-powered robotic arm for clearing obstacles, affordable for the mass market within the next few years. Currently priced at around $2,600, the company's goal is to lower the cost to a few hundred dollars to increase the low household penetration rate of robotic vacuums. To navigate U.S. tariffs and expand globally, Roborock has begun working with suppliers in Vietnam and is investing heavily in AI research and development.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers salvaged a four-game series split against the Colorado Rockies with a 9-5 victory, driven by a strong offensive performance. Freddie Freeman hit a two-run homer in the first inning, and the team continued to score in each of the first five innings to build a commanding lead. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw secured his eighth win, allowing three runs over 5.2 innings before the bullpen closed out the game. The win keeps the Dodgers in first place in their division as they head into a crucial series against the second-place San Diego Padres. Multiple Dodgers players had multi-hit games, contributing to a total of 20 runs scored in their two wins at Coors Field.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese authorities are seeking to address destructive, cutthroat competition by revising the country's 1998 pricing law for the first time. The proposed amendment targets what is known as "involution," where severe oversupply leads companies to engage in aggressive price slashing, often selling products at a loss. Industries like solar panel manufacturing have been particularly affected, with one executive estimating that nearly half the industry's capacity is excessive. The revision, drafted by the country's top economic planning and market regulation agencies, aims to establish more sustainable and regulated pricing practices to stabilize various economic sectors.

          <p>Crystal Palace achieved a historic 1-0 victory over Fredrikstad in the Uefa Conference League play-off, marking the club's first-ever win in a European competition. The celebratory atmosphere was bittersweet, however, as star midfielder Eberechi Eze was absent from the squad ahead of an expected transfer to Arsenal. Manager Oliver Glasner confirmed after the match that Eze would be leaving, expressing frustration that the club had not secured a replacement sooner. The win allows Palace to advance with an advantage in their European campaign, but the club now faces the challenge of reinvesting the transfer fee to strengthen the squad before the window closes.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeastward into the Atlantic Ocean, away from the North Carolina coastline. Although the storm is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., it generated life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the East Coast, prompting warnings for beachgoers to stay out of the water. Storm surge warnings and evacuation orders remained in effect for parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks, which experienced tropical storm conditions. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Erin will gradually weaken over the next few days and is expected to become a post-tropical storm by Saturday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wealthy investors are increasingly using a tax strategy known as a 351 conversion to defer capital gains on highly appreciated assets. The process involves exchanging a diversified portfolio of stocks for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches, which legally postpones the tax liability until the ETF shares are sold. While some financial advisors praise the method for its effectiveness, the article notes there are strict diversification requirements and high investment minimums, typically around $1 million. The strategy also has potential downsides, such as limited flexibility once the assets are converted into the specific ETF. (not investment advice)</p>
