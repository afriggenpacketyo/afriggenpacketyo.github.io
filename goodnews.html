          <p>Chinese engineers have completed a new 500-megawatt turbine, reportedly the world's largest single-unit capacity for its type, designed for the Datang Zala Hydropower Station in Tibet. The 80-tonne component was developed over four years by Harbin Electric Machinery Company. Constructed from durable martensitic steel, the turbine is a key part of a project on the Yuqu River, a tributary of the Nu River. Two of these record-setting turbines will be installed at the power station.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings has seen a dramatic rebound, with new listing volumes reaching $14 billion in the first half of the year, an eightfold increase from the same period in 2024. This surge, driven by Chinese companies seeking listings, positions the city to potentially surpass Nasdaq and the NYSE. The revival is attributed to factors like supportive policies from Beijing, a slowdown in mainland A-share listings, and U.S. delisting fears. High-profile listings and significant capital inflows from mainland investors have fueled the market's strong performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating after a piece of a wing flap from a Delta Air Lines Boeing 737 was discovered in the driveway of a home in Raleigh, North Carolina. The part belonged to a flight from Atlanta that had landed safely at Raleigh-Durham International Airport on Tuesday night with 109 passengers and six crew members. Delta confirmed that an inspection after landing revealed the missing component. No injuries were reported, and the airline is cooperating fully with the investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy that broadly suspends the ability of migrants to seek asylum after crossing the southern border. In his ruling, Judge Randolph Moss stated that the president does not have the unilateral authority to create an "alternative immigration system" that bypasses laws enacted by Congress. The January executive order had characterized the border situation as an "invasion." The judge's decision, which has been stayed for 14 days to allow for an appeal, was praised by civil liberties groups as a critical defense of asylum rights.</p>
