          <p>This upcoming week is critical for the stock market, with investors closely monitoring several key events. The Federal Reserve is expected to announce its interest rate decision, while new reports on inflation and employment will provide crucial insights into the economy's health. Additionally, major technology and consumer companies like Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon are scheduled to release their quarterly earnings reports, offering a gauge of corporate performance amidst ongoing trade negotiations and economic uncertainty. The confluence of these events will likely introduce significant volatility for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a potential trade war ahead of an August 1 deadline. The deal establishes a general 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by the Trump administration. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing an additional $600 billion in the American economy. The deal aims to rebalance the trade relationship and bring stability, although specific details are still emerging.</p>

          <p>Tech company UBTech has unveiled the Walker S2, a humanoid robot designed for factory work that can operate nearly 24/7 by swapping its own batteries without human assistance. When its power runs low, the robot autonomously navigates to a charging station, removes the depleted battery, and inserts a fresh one, a process that takes about three minutes. This innovation, already being tested in Chinese car factories, represents a significant step toward continuous automation in manufacturing and other sectors. The development highlights a broader push in robotics to create machines capable of sustained, independent work.</p>

          <p>German football club Bayern Munich has reportedly agreed to a deal with Liverpool to sign Colombian forward Luis Diaz for a fee of €75 million (£65.5 million), including add-ons.

The 28-year-old has been a key player for Liverpool since joining from Porto in 2022, contributing significantly to their recent successes.</p>
