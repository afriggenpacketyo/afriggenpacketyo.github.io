          <p>At the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asean defence chiefs emphasized their individual agency, with the Philippines asserting that it is not a pawn in the rivalry between the United States and China. This assertion came after the US Defence Secretary urged Indo-Pacific allies to increase military spending to counter China's influence. Despite acknowledging China's pursuit of superpower status, the Philippine Secretary of National Defence stressed that smaller states are acting in their own strategic interests, not merely at the behest of major powers. The Asean nations seek to diversify trade ties and avoid economic uncertainties stemming from US tariffs.</p>
