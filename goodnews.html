        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill advanced in the House after conservatives initially stalled it due to concerns about insufficient spending cuts. Negotiations over the weekend led to a second vote by the House Budget Committee, allowing the bill to proceed toward a floor vote before the Memorial Day deadline. Four conservative representatives voted present, enabling the legislation to move forward. Speaker Mike Johnson indicated that there would be minor modifications to the bill, but details of the changes were not immediately disclosed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" passed a critical hurdle in the House of Representatives, moving closer to a chamber-wide vote. The House Budget Committee advanced the legislation after conservatives initially blocked it, seeking assurances of stricter Medicaid crackdowns and green energy subsidy repeals. Republicans are using budget reconciliation to pass Trump's agenda, requiring adherence to specific rules related to federal spending, tax, and national debt. The bill aims to enact Trump's campaign promises on tax cuts, immigration, energy, and defense, though Senate changes are expected, necessitating further House consideration before potential enactment by July 4th.</p>

          <p>The South Solon Meeting House in Maine, resembling a typical New England church from the outside, holds a unique interior covered in 70-year-old frescoes, earning it the nickname "the Sistine Chapel of Maine." Painted by artists in the 1950s under the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, the murals depict biblical scenes and have garnered renewed interest due to a website created by Colby College students. The meeting house, built in 1842, now serves as a community space and art venue, showcasing historical features like original pews. The frescoes continue to inspire art enthusiasts and educators, offering a glimpse into the artistic endeavors of the past.</p>

          <p>Despite the effects of high tariffs, China's economy remained largely resilient in April, before Washington and Beijing agreed to remove or pause most of the duties. Industrial output grew by 6.1% year-on-year, surpassing economists' estimates, while retail sales rose by 5.1%, slightly below expectations. The National Bureau of Statistics acknowledged the impact of external shocks but noted steady growth due to coordinated macroeconomic policies. A Politburo meeting affirmed the need to bolster domestic consumption amid uncertain global trade conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

Fellow climbers have praised Cool's achievement, highlighting his experience, strength, and charisma.

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, secured the Romanian presidency after a challenging race against right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion initially won the first round, capitalizing on anger from Romanians over the annulled presidential race due to Russian interference claims. Dan, however, ultimately prevailed with 54% of the vote, advocating for fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine. The election took place amid political turbulence, with the government collapsing earlier in the month due to its candidate's failure to reach the second round.</p>

          <p>A tentative agreement has been reached to end New Jersey's first statewide transit strike in over 40 years, just three days after it began. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen called off the strike at about 6 p.m., and NJ Transit announced that trains would resume a full schedule on Tuesday morning. The agreement was announced by Governor Philip D. Murphy, who said it was fair to NJ Transit's employees while also being affordable for the state's commuters and taxpayers. In the meantime, NJ Transit will rely on its original strike contingency plan, involving chartered buses running from four satellite locations into New York City or to stations on the PATH commuter train service.</p>

Patients signing up to a GP practice who received a blood transfusion before 1996 will be offered a test for hepatitis C, as thousands may have been exposed to the virus through contaminated blood transfusions in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. The effort follows revelations of undiagnosed cases, where people with life-threatening liver damage caused by the virus over many years continue to be identified.
