          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to a two-year low of 3.85% due to receding inflation concerns. Recent data indicates a four-year low inflation rate of 2.4% in the first quarter of 2025, providing the RBA room to ease monetary policy. While the RBA prioritizes returning inflation to its target range of 2-3%, it acknowledges uncertainties in the economic outlook. Analysts have highlighted potential downside risks from global trade tensions and domestic economic uncertainty, prompting forecasts of further dovish actions from the RBA.</p>

The Budget Committee approved the bill after a previous setback, but challenges remain in the Rules Committee and on the House floor. Disagreements persist over spending cuts, green energy tax credits, and work requirements for Medicaid, reflecting the diverse priorities within the Republican Party.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has struck deals with the European Union and the United States, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners. However, these agreements required politically sensitive concessions, reflecting Britain's diminished position in the post-Brexit era. While the deals offer benefits such as easier travel to the EU and reduced tariffs on British cars in the US, they come at a cost, including allowing European trawlers to fish in British waters and granting greater access to American agricultural products. This article analyzes the implications of these trade-offs for Britain's economy and its relationship with global trading blocs.</p>

          <p>Sesame Street will now be available on Netflix after funding was cut for PBS. Netflix will offer subscribers a new season of the show and 90 hours of previous episodes, while the show will still be available on PBS. The government body Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which backed the two broadcasters, has since announced the termination of a federal initiative which funded shows for children, including Sesame Street. Netflix said the iconic programme is a "beloved cornerstone of children's media, enchanting young minds and nurturing a love of learning".</p>

          <p>China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April, despite the ongoing trade war initiated by US President Donald Trump. This influx of capital contrasts with market concerns surrounding rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this trend indicates a shift in global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from US dollar assets. The Bank of America noted that a weaker US dollar, peaking US bond yields, and China's economic recovery are driving investment towards emerging markets.</p>

          <p>China has reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first cut in seven months, to boost its economy amid a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) lowered the 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. This action follows state-backed commercial lenders reducing deposit rates and is part of a broader package of stimulus measures. Analysts expect the PBOC to continue easing policy, forecasting further rate cuts by year-end.</p>
