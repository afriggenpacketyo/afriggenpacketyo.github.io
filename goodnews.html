          <p>The Bank of England has decided to maintain interest rates at 4.25%, even as inflation remains above the Bank's target rate, hinting at potential rate cuts as early as August. Governor Andrew Bailey acknowledged the unpredictable global landscape, particularly the impact of the conflict between Israel and Iran on energy costs. While marginally raising expectations for the UK economy, the Bank noted underlying growth remains weak, with signs of softening in the labor market. Policymakers are carefully monitoring events in the Middle East and their potential effects on oil prices, indicating a cautious approach to future monetary policy decisions. Optimism remains that a summer rate reduction could provide relief for borrowers, but the situation remains complex. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, now a federally recognized holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, originating on June 19, 1865, when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom. Celebrations include parades, parties, concerts, and educational workshops. Despite some corporate sponsors tapering their support, communities continue to honor the day as a symbol of unity and resilience. The name "Juneteenth" combines June and nineteenth, marking the date when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, to announce the Emancipation Proclamation, which had been issued two years prior. Opal Lee, known as the "Grandmother of Juneteenth," has played a significant role in advocating for its recognition.</p>
