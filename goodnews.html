        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping cautioned against "tariff wars" and advocated for global peace and stability in a veiled criticism of the United States. Speaking at the China-Celac forum in Beijing, Xi emphasized that "bullying or hegemonism only leads to self-isolation." His remarks align with China's broader strategy to gain support from other nations against the backdrop of trade tensions with the U.S., despite a recent 90-day tariff pause agreement. Washington is also attempting to increase its influence in Latin America, including pressuring Panama regarding Chinese control over the canal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie's in New York saw underwhelming bidding, signaling a potential slowdown in the art market. The auction, featuring works by modern masters like Mondrian and Picasso, totaled $272 million including fees, but fell short of pre-sale expectations. Experts attributed the muted enthusiasm to economic uncertainty related to President Trump's tariffs. Despite some successful sales, such as a Monet painting fetching nearly $43 million, the withdrawal of a major Warhol painting highlighted weakness in that market. The auction results suggest a shift from the frothy art market of 2022, requiring auction houses to work harder to secure sales.</p>

The model ordinance states that policies must prioritize shelter and services and not unduly limit local authority to clear encampments. The effort is supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding, as Newsom approaches the end of his term and speculation about his political future increases.</p>
