          <p>Surgeons in Guangzhou, China, have successfully performed a pig-to-human lung transplant on a brain-dead human recipient, marking a significant advancement in xenotransplantation. The genetically modified pig lung demonstrated viability and functionality for 216 hours, or nine days, without signs of hyperacute rejection or uncontrolled infection, a critical outcome given the lung's anatomical complexity and direct contact with the outside environment. This pioneering study underscores the progress made in genetic modifications and immunosuppressive strategies, offering a potential solution to the global organ shortage crisis. However, the researchers acknowledge that substantial further tests and challenges must be addressed before this procedure can be translated into clinical practice.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Singapore have achieved a significant breakthrough in the development of remote-controlled cyborg cockroaches, aiming to deploy them as a tiny, agile army for disaster search and rescue missions. Their latest research, published in Nature Communications, details the industrialization of these "insect robot factories," including enhanced control mechanisms that boost the cockroaches' turning ability from 70 to over 80 degrees. This advancement promises to reduce both the time and cost associated with mass-producing these hybrid robots, making their practical application in real-world scenarios more attainable. The innovation holds considerable potential for navigating collapsed structures and hazardous environments, offering a novel approach to locating survivors and assessing damage in the aftermath of disasters.</p>

          <p>A district court judge in Utah has mandated that the state's Republican-controlled legislature must redraw its congressional map in time for the 2026 midterm elections, ruling that the current boundaries violate voters' rights. The map, initially drawn in 2021, was found unlawful for bypassing a commission established by voters to ensure non-partisan redistricting. This existing map had fragmented Salt Lake County, the state's most populous and a Democratic-leaning area, across all four congressional districts, leading to wide Republican victories. While the ruling introduces uncertainty for the GOP's slim national House majority, Republican lawmakers are expected to appeal, potentially delaying the implementation of new maps until 2028.</p>

          <p>Korean Air has finalized a substantial deal worth approximately $36 billion to acquire 103 Boeing passenger and cargo jets, including 787, 777, and 737 models. This major purchase comes amidst President Donald Trump's ongoing efforts to encourage U.S. trading partners to boost business with American companies, and was announced shortly after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with Trump in Washington. The agreement is intended to modernize Korean Air's fleet and enhance its competitiveness, particularly as it moves forward with a merger with Asiana Airlines. The deal is a significant win for Boeing, which has faced challenges in recent years, and is expected to support a substantial number of jobs across the United States.</p>

The Raiders, facing an injury to their presumed backup Aidan O’Connell, sought a quarterback with starting experience, which Pickett brings from his 25 starts with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Pickett's tenure with the Browns was brief, joining after Deshaun Watson's injury but missing valuable training camp time due to a hamstring issue. This trade now intensifies the competition for Cleveland's backup quarterback position between rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders, with the final roster decisions imminent ahead of the regular season.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has implemented new restrictions on flying with cordless hairstyling tools, mandating that devices powered by lithium metal or lithium-ion batteries, or gas/butane fuel, are only allowed in carry-on bags. This policy is a crucial safety measure, as these power sources are combustible and pose a significant fire risk if they overheat or combust in the cargo area of a plane, where incidents might go unnoticed for longer. To further mitigate risks, these tools must also have a safety cover securely fitted over their heating elements. This regulation aligns with existing rules for other lithium-battery-powered items like cell phones and laptops, all aimed at ensuring that any potential thermal events can be immediately addressed by cabin crew or passengers.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has once again postponed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, with the latest scrub attributed to an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad. This marks the second consecutive delay for the milestone mission, which aims to demonstrate critical fixes and upgrades following three previous catastrophic failures earlier this year. A successful flight is vital for accelerating SpaceX's launch schedule and advancing autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, a prerequisite for NASA's planned moon landing as early as 2027 and eventual missions to Mars. Despite acknowledging thousands of engineering challenges, SpaceX founder Elon Musk remains optimistic about perfecting full reusability and orbital refueling, which he views as foundational technologies for establishing a city on Mars.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has committed to restoring over $6.8 billion in education funding to U.S. schools, reversing an earlier decision to freeze the congressionally allocated money following a multi-state lawsuit. The funds, which support crucial programs such as after-school and summer learning, teacher training, and resources for English-learners, had been withheld just weeks before the school year began, causing widespread uncertainty for communities and districts. Led by California's attorney general, the lawsuit argued that the administration's actions illegally impounded funds, violating the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Although the administration had previously suggested the money was being "grossly misused," the agreement ensures the restoration of these vital resources, benefiting approximately 1.4 million children, many from low-income families.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Fire Department crews have successfully contained a brush fire that burned approximately nine acres in Sherman Oaks, near Haskell Creek, preventing further spread. Although the fire's progression has been halted, full containment will necessitate the use of heavy equipment for mop-up operations and the establishment of bare-earth dozer lines along the perimeter, with work expected to extend into the early evening. Fire officials have cautioned the public about potential traffic delays on the 405 Freeway, advising commuters to use alternative routes to avoid the affected area. This incident occurs amidst a 10.2-mile repavement project on the 405, which already includes a series of overnight road closures, exacerbating potential traffic disruptions.</p>

          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken, a medical expert and BBC presenter, is challenging conventional wisdom on posture, asserting that rigidly maintaining an upright position can actually be counterproductive for back health. He proposes three dynamic principles for improving posture and alleviating back pain: prioritizing continuous movement, building foundational strength, and cultivating a flexible mindset. Dr. van Tulleken stresses that staying in any single position for extended periods is detrimental, advocating for regular breaks and varied movements throughout the day. He also recommends simple exercises to strengthen the core and back, cautioning against restrictive posture gadgets. Ultimately, he highlights the significant role of emotional and psychological factors, such as stress, in back pain, suggesting that addressing lifestyle and mindset is as crucial as physical adjustments.</p>

This includes nine students awarded scholarships under the Chevening scheme, a predominantly government-funded initiative, and around 30 others with fully funded places through private schemes. This marks a significant development, as these would be the first Gazan students to leave the territory for UK studies since the onset of the Hamas-Israel war in 2023. However, the plan faces considerable logistical and diplomatic hurdles, primarily requiring Israel's individual approval for each student to exit Gaza. This initiative also runs parallel to the UK's efforts to evacuate critically ill and injured Gazan children for medical treatment.</p>

Zambada expressed remorse for the harm caused by illegal drugs and admitted to perpetuating corruption in Mexico through payments to police, military, and politicians.

This widespread weather disruption is a consequence of a surge of monsoonal moisture and atmospheric instability across the Western U.S., which has recently delivered dangerous dry lightning, significant dust storms, and unseasonal summer rainfall.
