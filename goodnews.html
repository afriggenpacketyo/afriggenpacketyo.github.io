          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are nearing all-time highs, showcasing a significant recovery after a sharp decline in April. This rebound is primarily fueled by diminished concerns over trade tariffs, robust performance within the technology sector, and widespread investor optimism regarding potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Despite ongoing risks such as geopolitical instability and future tariff policies, the market has demonstrated notable resilience, largely driven by confidence in major tech corporations and the broader economic forecast.

During a 3-1 victory against the Colorado Rockies, the 37-year-old left-hander recorded five strikeouts over six innings, bringing his career total to 2,997. Manager Dave Roberts opted to pull Kershaw from the game early, setting the stage for him to achieve the historic feat in front of a home crowd at Dodger Stadium during the team's upcoming homestand. He is set to become just the 20th pitcher in MLB history to join the prestigious 3,000-strikeout club.</p>

          <p>The British government is reportedly set to soften its proposed welfare reforms following significant opposition from over 100 Labour backbench MPs. The expected compromise will protect existing recipients of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health component of Universal Credit from cuts, which will now only apply to future claimants. This represents a major policy reversal for the government, which had faced a potential defeat on its flagship bill. The legislation aims to save ¬£5 billion annually by 2030 to address rising health-related benefit spending.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has successfully captured its first direct evidence of a planet outside our solar system, a significant milestone since its 2021 launch. The exoplanet candidate, named TWA 7b, is believed to be a gas giant with a mass similar to Saturn and orbits the young star TWA 7. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging and a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare and detect the faint object. While a small possibility remains that it could be a background galaxy, the evidence strongly suggests it is a newly discovered planet.</p>

Teran was accused of improperly downloading confidential police records while at the Sheriff's Department and using them in her role with the D.A.'s office. The court ruled unanimously that the records in question were publicly available court documents, and her actions did not constitute a crime under the computer access statute used by the prosecution. This decision is a significant rebuke to the politically charged case brought by the state's attorney general.</p>

His performance covered his entire catalog, from his early nihilistic R&B to his massive pop hits like "Blinding Lights."

While the plot revolves around a familiar AI-takeover theme, the review highlights director Gerard Johnstone's shaggy sense of humor and focus on the strange nature of humanity itself.
