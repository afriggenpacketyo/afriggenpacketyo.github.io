        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chinese animated film 'Nobody' has become the highest-grossing 2D animated feature in the country's box office history, earning over 1 billion yuan. Developed by Shanghai Animation Film Studio, the movie has surpassed popular Japanese films like 'Suzume' and 'The Boy and the Heron,' signaling a potential shift in market dominance. The film is based on the 2023 online series 'Chinese Bizarreries' and is distinguished by its unique ink-wash painting aesthetic, which aims to create a distinctly Chinese visual style. This success marks a significant cultural and commercial achievement for China's domestic animation industry.</p>

Zelensky noted it was their "best of meetings," and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated his expectations were exceeded. The talks focused on securing an end to the war in Ukraine and ensuring the return of Ukrainian children captured by Russian forces. Despite the positive tone, doubts linger regarding the specifics and reliability of the commitments made toward Ukraine's security and long-term support.</p>

          <p>Fast-fashion giant Shein is reportedly exploring a move of its corporate headquarters from Singapore back to China. This strategic consideration is aimed at persuading Beijing to approve its planned initial public offering in Hong Kong. The company has faced significant regulatory hurdles and delays in its attempts to list publicly in both London and the United States, partly due to allegations of forced labor in its supply chain and policy headwinds in Western markets. A return to China could streamline the approval process with Chinese regulators, though the discussions are still in a preliminary phase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Air Canada's 10,000 flight attendants have ended their four-day strike after their union, CUPE, reached a tentative agreement with the airline. The strike, which began on a Saturday, caused significant disruptions during the peak summer travel season, affecting approximately 130,000 travelers daily and leading to numerous flight cancellations. The breakthrough came after late-night negotiations assisted by a mediator. The dispute centered on wages and compensation for unpaid work performed on the ground, with the union initially defying a back-to-work order from the Canada Industrial Relations Board before the deal was struck.</p>

          <p>Home Depot reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations, marking the first time it has missed on both metrics since 2014. Despite the miss, the home improvement retailer maintained its full-year forecast, anticipating total sales growth of 2.8%. The company noted that homeowners continue to show a "deferral mindset" regarding large projects, but it saw encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in transactions over $1,000 and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. The retailer's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could spur more home improvement spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant influx of American capital, including from private equity, is flowing into Europe's top soccer leagues, causing club valuations to soar. This trend is driven by the sport's rapid revenue growth, which has increased by 750% since the 1996-97 season. For instance, Manchester United's valuation has risen from £790 million in 2005 to around £5 billion in 2024. Experts suggest U.S. investors are drawn to European soccer as a more accessible alternative to the high-priced NFL or NBA franchises, with many adopting multi-club ownership models to maximize their investments, a practice that is attracting regulatory scrutiny.

          <h2>Belgian Cities Utilize Natural Wetlands as a Defense Against Increased Flooding</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Flanders region of Belgium, cities like Mechelen are turning to the restoration of natural wetlands to combat the dual threats of intense flooding and severe droughts driven by climate change. The region's high degree of urban sprawl and sealed surfaces exacerbate flood risks from heavy rainfall. By "depoldering" land—giving rivers more space—and restoring marshlands, authorities are creating natural buffers that can absorb excess water during storms and release it slowly during dry periods. This nature-based solution, part of the comprehensive 'Sigma Plan,' demonstrates a strategic shift from traditional hard infrastructure to more sustainable climate adaptation methods.</p>

The article highlights that Ford has never won a major competitive acting award, though he holds numerous lifetime achievement honors. At 83, his performance in 'Shrinking' has made him a frontrunner for the award, offering a chance for voters to finally acknowledge his acclaimed work.</p>

Experts explain that interpreting crime data accurately depends heavily on the chosen time frame, as different periods can tell different stories.
