        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK police have successfully dismantled a major international criminal gang suspected of exporting up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones to China annually. The operation, triggered by a single victim tracking their stolen iPhone on Christmas Eve, led to 18 arrests and the recovery of over 2,000 devices. Authorities believe this network was responsible for handling nearly half of all phones stolen in London, where phone theft has almost tripled in the last four years. The investigation revealed that thieves were paid up to £300 per handset, which could then be sold for as much as £4,000 in China.</p>

El-Anani's nomination comes as the cultural agency faces significant financial challenges following the departure of the United States.

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index achieved a new record high for the second day in a row, influenced by a technology stock rally on Wall Street. The U.S. market surge was largely driven by a significant deal between AMD and OpenAI, which sent AMD's shares soaring and positively impacted chip-related stocks in Japan. Despite the Nikkei's early gains, it closed relatively flat, while Japanese Government Bond yields rose to their highest levels in years. The Japanese yen also continued to weaken against the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has launched the world's first commercial underwater data center, located in the sea near Hainan province. The facility consists of a 1,300-tonne data cabin submerged 35 meters deep, which leverages seawater for natural and energy-efficient cooling. This innovative approach is expected to significantly reduce the energy consumption and operational costs typically associated with land-based data centers. The project is part of Hainan's broader strategy to develop new technologies for its blue economy, with plans to eventually deploy 100 such data cabins.</p>

          <p>Footballer Ashleigh Plumptre has opened up about her decision to move from the Women's Super League in England to Al-Ittihad in the Saudi Women's Premier League. Initially hesitant, the Nigeria international was persuaded by the project's vision, though she acknowledges the move hurt some of her LGBTQ+ fans due to Saudi Arabia's laws on same-sex relations. Plumptre, who recently extended her contract, aims to challenge Western perceptions of the country, stating she feels safer living in Jeddah than in the UK. She also noted that while the league's standard is still developing, facilities are improving and there is a growing commitment to the women's game.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has raised its 2025 economic growth forecast for China to 4.8%, up from a previous prediction of 4%, bringing it closer to Beijing's official target of around 5%. This revision comes despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and reflects the impact of government stimulus measures that have supported the economy. However, the report cautions that this momentum may slow, projecting growth to ease to 4.2% in 2026 as export growth moderates and domestic challenges like a real estate slump and sluggish consumer spending persist.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese automotive manufacturer BYD has seen its UK vehicle sales surge by 880% in September compared to the previous year, making Britain its largest market outside of China. The company sold over 11,200 cars last month, with its plug-in hybrid Seal U SUV being the most popular model, capturing a 3.6% share of the UK market. This growth is attributed to the UK's lack of tariffs on Chinese EVs, unlike the EU and US, and strong overall demand for electric vehicles. Despite the EV sales boom, traditional petrol and diesel cars still constituted over half of new car sales in the UK.</p>

          <p>For the first time in 100 years, pine martens have been released into Exmoor National Park as part of a major conservation effort. The Two Moors Pine Marten Project successfully introduced 19 of the mammals, relocated from Scotland, to secret locations within the park. Each animal is fitted with a radio collar, allowing researchers to monitor their progress as they reintegrate into the ecosystem. Conservationists have hailed the reintroduction as a positive sign for nature restoration, as pine martens play a critical role in balancing woodland wildlife.</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to unveil a lower-cost version of its best-selling Model Y SUV in an effort to combat falling sales and growing competition in the electric vehicle market. While CEO Elon Musk previously canceled plans for an entirely new $25,000 vehicle, this new model is anticipated to be a more affordable variant based on existing platforms. The announcement, teased for October 7, comes as Tesla faces pressure from competitors in China and Europe. Key details such as the final price, driving range, and cost-reduction measures are highly anticipated by investors and consumers.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers staged a crucial seventh-inning rally to secure a 4-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, taking a 2-0 lead in the National League Division Series. After being shut down for most of the game by Phillies starter Jesús Luzardo, who had retired 17 consecutive batters, the Dodgers' offense came alive. The inning was sparked by key hits from Teoscar Hernández and Freddie Freeman, followed by three two-out RBIs that put the Dodgers ahead. Despite a late push from the Phillies in the ninth, reliever Roki Sasaki closed the game for his second save of the series.</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence scored a dramatic one-yard rushing touchdown with just 23 seconds left to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs 31-28. The game-winning play was unconventional, as Lawrence tripped after the snap but managed to recover and dive into the end zone for the score. This victory snapped an eight-game losing streak for the Jaguars against the Chiefs, dating back to 2009, and improved their season record to 4-1. Lawrence accounted for three total touchdowns in a resilient performance that overcame two earlier turnovers and a missed pass interference call.</p>

          <p>The Minnesota-born Mexican restaurant chain Chi-Chi's has made its return, opening a new location in St. Louis Park nearly two decades after the company ceased operations. The original chain, founded in 1975, grew to over 200 locations before facing bankruptcy and a damaging hepatitis A outbreak that led to its closure in 2004. The revival was made possible through an agreement with Hormel Foods, which owns the trademark, allowing the founder's son to open new physical restaurants. The opening day was fully booked with reservations, drawing in nostalgic customers eager to revisit the once-popular establishment.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has publicly broken from the Republican party line, calling for an extension of expiring Obamacare subsidies to prevent health insurance premiums from doubling. In a social media post, the far-right congresswoman stated that despite her opposition to the 2010 law, she cannot support allowing the tax credits to expire, as it would directly impact her constituents and her own adult children. This move aligns her with a key Democratic demand during the current government shutdown and puts her at odds with conservative colleagues and GOP leadership, who have been noncommittal on the issue.</p>
