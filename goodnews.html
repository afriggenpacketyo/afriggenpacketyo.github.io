          <p>Following Inter Miami's 4-0 defeat to Paris St-Germain in the Club World Cup, questions are arising about whether this was Lionel Messi's final major global appearance. At 38, Messi's contract with Inter Miami ends in 2025, and his participation in the 2026 World Cup remains unconfirmed, although teammates and colleagues expect him to play. Despite the loss, Messi displayed moments of his signature skill, earning praise from commentators for his clever play.

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he has found a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok, which faces a potential ban in the U.S. due to national security concerns. In a Fox News interview, Trump mentioned a group of "very wealthy people" are prepared to acquire the platform, with more details to be revealed in about two weeks. A potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes President Xi Jinping is likely to grant. This development comes after Trump extended the deadline for parent company ByteDance to sell TikTok to September 17.</p>

          <p>With the UK experiencing a significant heatwave, animal welfare experts are reminding dog owners of the severe dangers of exercising their pets in hot weather. The RSPCA notes that dogs are far more likely to suffer heat-related illness from exercise than from being left in hot cars, as they have a limited ability to regulate their body temperature. Key signs of overheating include heavy panting, lethargy, and excessive drooling. The article strongly advises against walking dogs in the heat, suggesting instead to keep them in cool, indoor spaces and to check pavement temperatures before any necessary outdoor trips.</p>
