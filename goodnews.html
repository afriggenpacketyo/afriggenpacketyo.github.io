          <p>A Japanese nutritionist living in the U.S. highlights six 'longevity foods' she found in abundance during a visit to a Costco in Kyoto, Japan. She was impressed by the incredible variety compared to American stores, particularly the wide selection of seaweed, a nutrient-dense staple in Japan. The store also offered an amazing variety of tofu and other soy-based foods, seasonal Japanese produce like enoki mushrooms and mizuna, and healthy ready-to-eat meals. The extensive options for traditional rice crackers and numerous brands of green tea also stood out as items she wishes were more common in U.S. locations.</p>

          <h2>Taiwan Voters Reject Effort to Recall Opposition Lawmakers in Key Election</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 12:38:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwanese voters have rejected a large-scale effort to recall two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the balance of power in the legislature where it currently lacks a majority. The recall campaigns were initiated by critics who accused the KMT of obstructing key legislation and passing reforms that favor China. The outcome means President Lai Ching-te's government will likely continue to face significant legislative resistance, highlighting deep political divisions on the self-ruled island.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 12:11:22 EDT</div>

          <p>Tadej Pogačar is set to win his fourth Tour de France title after maintaining his substantial overall lead through the penultimate stage of the race. The final day is traditionally processional, meaning the Slovenian rider's victory is all but assured barring any unforeseen accidents. The 20th stage was won by Australian sprinter Kaden Groves, who secured his first-ever Tour stage victory with a solo attack 16km from the finish. Groves' win marks a significant personal achievement, as he has now won stages in all three of cycling's Grand Tours.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at record highs this week, buoyed by positive news on trade deals and a strong start to the second-quarter earnings season. The market reacted favorably to President Trump's announcement of a "massive" trade agreement with Japan, with investor focus now shifting to upcoming talks with China and the European Union. So far, a third of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings, with 80% beating expectations on both revenue and profit. Economic data on home sales showed mixed signals on pricing, an important factor for tracking inflation trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris has claimed pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix, narrowly beating his teammate Oscar Piastri in a competitive qualifying session. Norris set the fastest time on his first lap in the final session, while a mistake on Piastri's second run cost the Australian a chance to take the top spot. The result sets up an intriguing race, with championship rival Max Verstappen starting from fourth after a self-described "so bad" lap. With rain expected for the race on Sunday, the conditions could lead to a chaotic and unpredictable contest at the front of the grid.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 68-year-old dog trainer, was unexpectedly diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a terminal lung disease, after a routine pre-surgery X-ray revealed scarring on his lungs. With a prognosis of less than a year to live and his lung function rapidly degrading, he was initially resistant but ultimately agreed to a double-lung transplant. After a month in the hospital and a successful surgery, Kennedy, now 75, has a lung capacity of 98% and is returning to his normal life.

          <p>US President Donald Trump is reportedly interested in visiting China this autumn, though a previously rumored September visit is no longer being considered, according to sources. Officials in both Washington and Beijing are said to be working on securing a trip for October or November. A potential meeting could occur before or after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea. Recent in-person talks between the two countries' top diplomats were described as positive, suggesting that groundwork is being laid for a potential high-level summit between the leaders later this year.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration alters federal student loan repayment options, workplace benefits are becoming an increasingly important source of relief for indebted workers. A key provision in the recent One Big Beautiful Bill Act made the tax-free status of employer contributions (up to $5,250 annually) toward employee student loans a permanent feature. This has encouraged more companies to offer or consider these programs as a tool for attracting and retaining talent. With federal options narrowing and wage garnishments for defaulted loans set to resume, employer assistance is a critical lifeline for many borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has released a global action plan for artificial intelligence, just days after a similar announcement from the U.S., escalating the technological competition between the two nations. At the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Premier Li Qiang called for international cooperation and proposed a global AI organization. China's "AI plus" plan emphasizes integrating the technology across industries and offering assistance to developing nations in the Global South. This contrasts with the U.S. approach, which analysts see as an effort to build its own alliance of allies while restricting China's access to advanced technology.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, "Swag," has produced a potential song of the summer with its No. 2 hit, "Daisies," offering a soothing and novel sound in a stale pop landscape. The album marks a departure from his past work, embracing a more subtle, R&B-influenced style with aqueous, muffled production that feels both comforting and complex. The article suggests the album's downtempo, melancholic yet intricate mood resonates with the current cultural moment, which seems to favor reserved, simmering music over overt hedonism. The success of "Swag" fills a void by meeting listeners in a state of emotional fragility and need for stability.</p>

          <p>Brazil is undertaking a massive public health initiative by breeding and releasing millions of "good mosquitoes" to combat the devastating spread of dengue fever. These insects, developed by the nonprofit World Mosquito Program, are engineered to carry Wolbachia, a naturally occurring bacteria that prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside them. Field trials in the city of Niterói have shown dramatic success, with dengue cases plummeting by roughly 90% after the modified mosquitoes were introduced. The Brazilian government is now scaling up the project, building a massive new factory to produce billions of these "Wolbitos" annually.</p>
