          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index surged to a new record high, surpassing the 44,000 mark for the first time. The rally followed the surprise resignation announcement of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, sparking investor optimism for a new wave of fiscal stimulus to support the economy. Technology stocks, including Advantest and Tokuyama Corp, led the gains, while the Japanese yen also strengthened against the U.S. dollar. This market movement reflects investor bets on future government policy and its potential economic impact (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older has increased by 46% between 2021 and 2023, with many seniors turning to the substance for relief from pain, PTSD, and other ailments. As cannabis becomes legal in more states for both medical and recreational use, the associated stigma is diminishing, particularly within retirement communities. However, some medical professionals caution against this trend, citing research that links cannabis use, regardless of ingestion method, to cardiovascular risks. A professor at UC San Francisco warns that smoking marijuana can harm the cardiovascular system, and even edibles are not without potential health risks.</p>

          <p>Infielder Max Muncy was activated from the injured list and immediately placed in the cleanup spot for the Los Angeles Dodgers, providing a much-needed boost to the team's slumping offense. Muncy had been sidelined for 23 games with an oblique injury, during which the team posted a losing record. Manager Dave Roberts praised Muncy's return, highlighting the valuable presence he brings to the lineup. Muncy is the first of several key players expected to return from injury soon, including pitcher Alex Vesia and utility player Tommy Edman, as the Dodgers look to regain their form ahead of the playoffs.</p>

          <p>A port operator in Dalian, China, is establishing a new fruit transit center to support a 'durian express' shipping service aimed at delivering the popular fruit from Southeast Asia to northeastern China more quickly. This initiative is designed to reduce shipping times from nearly two weeks to as little as six days, ensuring the freshness of the perishable and often expensive fruit for the region's 100 million consumers. The project addresses logistical challenges in a market that is geographically distant from major durian sources like Malaysia and Thailand. Analysts note that northeastern China is an underpenetrated market with growing consumer curiosity for durians.</p>

          <h2>California Lawmakers Pass Bill Targeting Online Puppy Mill Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 19:53:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California legislature has passed a bill aimed at closing a loophole that allows online dealers and brokers to sell dogs from commercial puppy mills. The new legislation, AB 519, will ban online marketplaces and middlemen who misrepresent themselves as local breeders from selling dogs, cats, and rabbits to California consumers. This move builds on a 2019 law that barred pet stores from selling commercially bred animals but did not cover the growing online sales market. Proponents, including the state's Attorney General, argue the bill is a crucial step to shut down deceptive sales tactics and protect families from unknowingly purchasing sick or poorly bred pets.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the latest COVID-19 vaccines for specific high-risk populations, including adults aged 65 and older and younger individuals with certain underlying medical conditions. This narrower approval framework means access may be limited for some people who were previously eligible. Conditions that qualify an individual include asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, and pregnancy, as these can inhibit the body's ability to fight a severe infection. While officials state anyone can get a vaccine after consulting a doctor, the change could affect insurance coverage and how pharmacies administer the shots this fall.</p>

The visit, during which Trump will be hosted by King Charles at Windsor Castle, is expected to draw large protests in both London and Windsor. Police drones will provide an "eye in the sky" to monitor the event, which is being treated as one of the larger security operations the force has managed.</p>

          <p>England's Test cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has expressed frustration with what he calls "disrespectful" misconceptions about his team's aggressive style of play, often dubbed "Bazball." Since he and captain Ben Stokes took over in 2022, the team has been known for a fearless approach, but McCullum argues it is not as reckless as it is often portrayed. He stated that the perception of players just swinging the bat wildly is an oversimplification that ignores the hard work and strategic determination of the team. McCullum emphasized that his focus has always been on creating a positive mindset that allows players' talent to flourish under pressure.</p>

          <p>Incumbent Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere has won a second term after his Labour Party emerged as the top vote-getter in the country's parliamentary election. With approximately 28% of the vote, Labour will be able to form a majority government with the support of four other left-leaning parties, securing a narrow majority of 87 seats in the 169-seat parliament. The election campaign focused on domestic issues such as the rising cost of living and the quality of public services, as well as the tumultuous international political landscape. The populist Progress Party on the right also saw significant gains, doubling its result from the 2021 election.</p>

He pointed to fears that Alphabet would be forced into a punitive breakup by the Department of Justice, which did not materialize, causing the stock to rally. Cramer also noted that concerns about Amazon's cloud services falling behind and Apple's weak AI strategy have largely subsided as the market shifted focus. He suggested that negativity can be easily generated but is often not acknowledged when the feared outcomes fail to occur (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The long-running succession drama within the Murdoch family has concluded with a $3.3 billion settlement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over the media empire, including Fox News and News Corp. The agreement resolves a legal dispute initiated after Rupert Murdoch attempted to alter his family trust to ensure his oldest son would maintain the companies' conservative direction. Under the deal, siblings Prudence, Elisabeth, and James Murdoch will relinquish their shares and future roles in the trust. This move effectively ends their potential influence and cements Lachlan's leadership, securing the ideological future of the influential media assets.</p>
