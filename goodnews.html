          <p>After 36 years, investigators identified Marina Ramos as the woman found murdered in the Arizona desert in 1989, leading to the discovery of her two infant daughters. Ramos's DNA, cross-referenced with old fingerprints, helped identify her and subsequently locate her children, Elizabeth and Jasmin, who were abandoned in a California park two days after their mother's death. The girls were adopted and raised together, bringing a resolution to their mysterious past, though the search for Ramos's killers continues. This article details the long-awaited breakthrough in a cold case.</p>

          <p>Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike was sent off for a "stupid" shirt-removal celebration after scoring the winning goal in a Carabao Cup match, according to manager Arne Slot. Ekitike, who had already received a yellow card, apologized on social media, acknowledging his emotions got the better of him. This incident means the £69m signing will be suspended for an upcoming Premier League game, a setback for the in-form player. Slot emphasized that such a celebratory action is unwise, especially with a prior booking, and expressed confidence Ekitike would learn from the mistake.</p>

          <p>Jerome Cohen, a groundbreaking scholar of Chinese law and a consistent critic of its system, has died at 95. As professor emeritus at NYU Law and founder of its US-Asia Law Institute, Cohen was the first American to practice law in Communist China in 1960. His extensive writings on Chinese criminal procedure and international law are widely regarded, and he was known for advocating for Chinese dissidents while promoting engagement with Beijing. Cohen's profound influence shaped global debates on China's legal system for over six decades.</p>

          <p>California's Senate Bill 576, now awaiting the governor's signature, seeks to regulate the volume of commercials on streaming services like Hulu and Netflix. Inspired by a new mother's frustration with ads waking her baby, the legislation would prohibit commercials from being louder than the programming they accompany. This expands on the existing federal CALM Act, which applies to broadcast, satellite, and cable TV but not streaming. While streaming industry groups initially opposed the bill, they became neutral after an amendment removed the ability for private lawsuits.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, a key focus is addressing the urgent cash needs of local governments, which are grappling with financial woes. Recent actions, such as Hubei province forcing a resident to pay $200,000 in back taxes on undeclared overseas income, signal a wider clampdown on tax enforcement. While China has long required tax on foreign earnings, enforcement was previously lax. The upcoming plan is expected to outline strategies to alleviate these local-level financial pressures and reform tax collection.</p>

          <p>China has endorsed Brazil’s $125 billion Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), injecting momentum into this significant initiative ahead of COP30. The TFFF, developed with World Bank support, aims to reward tropical countries for preserving forests by channeling returns from low-risk investments. Payments are contingent on keeping annual deforestation below 0.5%, with a fifth of resources dedicated to Indigenous peoples and local communities. Brazilian President Lula da Silva, who announced a $1 billion initial contribution, emphasized the fund as an investment in humanity against climate chaos, urging other nations to make ambitious pledges.</p>

          <p>Tether, the leading stablecoin issuer, is reportedly planning to raise $15 billion to $20 billion through a private placement, which could value the crypto company at approximately $500 billion. This valuation would place Tether among the world's largest private companies, alongside OpenAI and SpaceX. The transaction involves new equity, and while talks are early, the move aligns with Tether's efforts to re-establish a US presence, especially given President Trump's pro-crypto stance. The company recently named a US CEO and launched a new US-regulated token.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will introduce a player challenge system for called balls and strikes starting in the 2026 season, following years of testing. The system, powered by an automated strike zone (ABS), allows batters, pitchers, and catchers to challenge calls immediately, with a video replay displayed on the scoreboard. Each team will receive two challenges per game, retaining a challenge if the call is overturned. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred stated the system balances the umpire's role with correcting missed calls and preserving game pace, a change largely welcomed by players.</p>

          <p>Michelob Ultra has become the best-selling beer in the US by volume, two years after its parent company, Anheuser-Busch, saw Bud Light lose the top spot following a consumer boycott. The success marks a turnaround for Anheuser-Busch, which faced a difficult 2023. Constellation, Modelo's owner, cited a "challenging macroeconomic environment" and stricter US immigration policies impacting Hispanic consumers for its declining sales. Michelob Ultra's growth is attributed to the launch of its non-alcoholic version and increased marketing efforts, amid a broader trend of declining beer consumption in the US.</p>

While Canada's immigration system is seen as a viable alternative, some experts caution about its own challenges, including scaled-back immigration and lower average wages compared to the US.
