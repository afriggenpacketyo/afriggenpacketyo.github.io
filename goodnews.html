          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to fund private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Democrats argue the legislation will harm public schools by diverting funds to wealthier students already in private schools. Attorney General Ken Paxton praised the bill as a victory for parents and students, ensuring educational freedom. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence will receive a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the constitutional transfer of power by refusing to overturn the 2020 election results. Pence defied pressure from then-President Trump to reject electoral votes cast for Joe Biden during the January 6, 2021, Congressional session. The award recognizes Pence's decision to stay inside the Capitol as it was stormed by Trump supporters and to preside over the certification after the building was secured. Since leaving office, Pence has established a conservative political action group and criticized the "radical Left and liberal media." Optimism score: 70</p>
