          <p>The Federal Trade Commission is investigating approximately a dozen advertising groups and watchdogs, suspecting them of violating antitrust laws by coordinating boycotts among advertisers. The regulator is examining whether these groups colluded to pressure advertisers to withdraw their support from certain platforms or content providers. This investigation raises concerns about potential restrictions on free speech and fair competition in the advertising industry, as well as the extent to which advocacy groups can influence advertising decisions. The outcome could significantly impact how advertising boycotts are organized and executed. The FTC's inquiry aims to ensure a level playing field and protect advertisers from undue pressure.

          <p>Pennsylvania Democratic Senator John Fetterman has publicly disagreed with his party's stance on border security, emphasizing the need for a secure border. Fetterman highlighted the high number of people arriving at the border, calling it unacceptable and a national security issue. He expressed his support for immigration reform while stressing the importance of maintaining order and control at the border. Fetterman's comments reflect a growing divide within the Democratic Party on immigration policy, and his willingness to challenge his own party's line.

          <p>The Trump administration has temporarily halted its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision provides relief to older student borrowers who may rely on Social Security as a fixed income source. The pause allows borrowers more time to address their defaulted loans and avoid potential reductions in their benefits. The administration's move reflects concerns about the financial impact on retirees and aims to protect vulnerable Social Security recipients.

          <p>A judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing inadequate due process. Judge John Holcomb, a Trump appointee, ruled that the government has not provided sufficient notice for individuals to challenge their deportation. This ruling adds to the legal complexities surrounding the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, which has faced challenges in multiple states. The administration has used the law to deport individuals accused of gang membership, particularly those associated with Tren de Aragua.</p>

          <p>Several Republican senators are seeking to modify President Trump's budget package, which narrowly passed in the House, before it can pass in the Senate. Concerns among GOP senators include Medicaid changes, deeper spending cuts, clean energy tax credits, and the state and local tax deduction. Senator Rand Paul has indicated his opposition due to concerns about the bill's impact on the national debt. These sticking points suggest that the bill will likely undergo significant revisions in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Analysts are comparing Pop Mart's success with its collectible character Labubu to that of Sanrio's Hello Kitty, suggesting that the Chinese toymaker may have created a new model for cultural exports. Labubu, a popular plush charm, has gained international attention, attracting high-profile fans and boosting Pop Mart's stock. The character's appeal lies in its universal lovability rather than explicitly promoting Chinese culture. With surging international sales, Pop Mart has become a favorite among investors, signaling a shift in how Chinese brands can succeed globally.</p>
