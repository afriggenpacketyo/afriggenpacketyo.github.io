        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his selection as the top pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd has revealed unconventional plans for rookie Cooper Flagg. Kidd intends to test the 6-foot-9 forward's versatility by playing him at the point guard position during the upcoming NBA Summer League. The goal is to make Flagg uncomfortable and push his development by having him run the offense, a role he occasionally filled at Duke where he led the team in assists. Kidd emphasized that he is not concerned about potential mistakes, viewing them as a necessary part of growth for a young player.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol was dispatched this week to investigate an unusual report of a baby tiger on the side of Highway 166 in San Luis Obispo County. A concerned driver had called in what they believed to be a stranded cub. However, upon arrival, the responding officer discovered the animal in question was not a tiger but a deceased hawk. The incident highlighted a comical case of mistaken identity, and the California Department of Transportation was notified to handle the removal of the bird. Ownership of exotic animals like tigers is illegal for private citizens in California.</p>

The event was outlawed under a controversial new law that restricts gatherings promoting homosexuality to minors, which critics view as an attack on LGBTQ+ rights and democratic freedoms. Budapest's mayor supported the march by declaring it a municipal event, and numerous EU officials attended in solidarity. The large, peaceful demonstration was seen as a major show of resistance against Orb√°n's increasingly repressive policies.</p>

Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams, who scored two tries, left the field with a tight hamstring, creating a potential depth issue at the position. Head coach Andy Farrell praised the team's attacking intent and the creativity of fly-half Finn Russell, but also noted a high penalty count in the first half that needs to be addressed.
