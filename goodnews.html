          <p>A major power outage disrupted the final day of the Cannes Film Festival in southeastern France, affecting approximately 160,000 households and disrupting traffic due to non-functional traffic lights.

Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that all scheduled events, including the Palme d'Or ceremony, would proceed as planned by switching to an independent power supply. The article notes that screenings at satellite venues were briefly suspended but later resumed.</p>

          <p>ValueAct Capital has acquired a significant stake in Rocket Companies, citing the company's technological leadership and market share in the mortgage industry. The article notes that Rocket's stock price has not reflected its competitive advantages due to a small float, controlled ownership, and a convoluted share class structure. However, upcoming acquisitions and a simplified capital structure are expected to increase the public float and attract long-term institutional investors. ValueAct believes Rocket can further enhance its operations through artificial intelligence, potentially growing its market share significantly. (not investment advice)</p>
