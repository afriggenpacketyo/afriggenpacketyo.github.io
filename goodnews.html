          <p>A cybersecurity expert evaluates the security differences between using a wired Ethernet connection and Wi-Fi for home internet access. While Ethernet is inherently more secure due to its physical nature, the article concludes that a well-configured Wi-Fi network with strong passwords, WPA3 encryption, and an updated router can be nearly as safe. The piece emphasizes that overall network hygiene, such as using antivirus software and a VPN for sensitive tasks, is more critical than the connection method alone. It provides several actionable steps for users to enhance their home network security regardless of how they connect.</p>

          <p>Despite short-term market volatility, some leading Wall Street analysts are recommending three specific technology stocks for long-term investment. The article details positive outlooks for Snowflake, a cloud data platform benefiting from AI integration, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which secured a major partnership with OpenAI for its AI chips. Dell Technologies also received a favorable review following its raised long-term financial targets, driven by strong demand for its AI servers. These analyses suggest that the ongoing artificial intelligence boom is a significant growth catalyst for these companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While younger generations increasingly shop online, department stores continue to attract baby boomers by offering distinct advantages over e-commerce. The article highlights benefits such as more generous return policies, in-person customer service, and promotional events that create a loyal customer base among older shoppers. In contrast, younger consumers are more influenced by social media trends and often use "bracketing"—ordering multiple sizes online and returning most—a practice that online retailers are making more restrictive. High-end stores like Bloomingdale's are leaning into this by focusing on luxury brands and personalized service to appeal to wealthier, often older, clientele.</p>

          <p>Organizers and participants of the Chicago Marathon are moving forward with the event despite recent, aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the city known as Operation Midway Blitz. The marathon route passes through diverse neighborhoods, including the predominantly Latino area of Pilsen, causing concern among residents and runners. Community groups plan to be present as a precaution, though they do not expect direct ICE action at the race itself. The city's mayor has encouraged participation as a form of resistance to what he calls federal overreach, while local business owners note an underlying tension despite the celebratory atmosphere.</p>

          <p>An international peace summit is scheduled for Monday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to be co-chaired by President Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The summit, attended by over 20 world leaders, aims to implement the first phase of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which includes the release of all remaining hostages. The article also notes that after the hostage exchange, Israel's defense minister has pledged to destroy all of Hamas's remaining tunnel networks under Gaza. Pope Leo XIV has praised the peace plan, encouraging all parties to courageously pursue a just and lasting peace.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Use AI to Uncover Hidden Protein Similarities in Convergent Evolution</h2>

          <p>A research team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has utilized an advanced AI protein language model to study convergent evolution, where unrelated species independently develop similar traits. Traditional methods focus on simple sequence similarities, but the AI model can analyze complex 3D protein structures. This allowed the scientists to identify high-order features in proteins that evolved separately but perform similar functions, such as echolocation in both bats and dolphins. The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, highlight a previously underrated genetic basis for how different species arrive at the same functional solutions.</p>

          <p>Following a new ceasefire agreement, preparations are underway to significantly increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, with a target of around 600 trucks per day. The United Nations has vast quantities of food and medicine ready for delivery once Israeli inspections are complete. For residents, the ceasefire allows many to return to their neighborhoods, though they often find only rubble where their homes once stood. The deal also includes the release of Israeli hostages and some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, with preparations for their reception ongoing in both Israel and Gaza.</p>

          <p>Two of China's senior officials recently conducted tours to different provinces, highlighting key national priorities. In the eastern province of Zhejiang, Vice-Premier Zhang Guoqing urged manufacturers to integrate advanced technologies like artificial intelligence into their production processes to create "new quality productive forces." He emphasized supporting specialized firms to innovate in niche areas and increase R&D investment. The tours signal a dual focus in Beijing's domestic policy: advancing the country's high-tech industrial power while simultaneously addressing poverty and public health challenges in other regions.</p>

          <p>China is undertaking one of its most challenging and expensive infrastructure projects, a 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet. Dubbed a "project of the century," the line will traverse extreme terrain, including high-altitude mountain ranges and permafrost, with an average elevation over 4,500 meters. The total investment for the project could reach 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), making it one of the costliest rail lines ever built in the country. This article explains the immense engineering hurdles and strategic importance of the railway for Beijing, which aims to enhance connectivity and economic integration in its western regions.</p>

          <p>The European Union is gradually implementing its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will track the entry and exit of non-EU citizens in the 29-country Schengen Area. The system, which replaces manual passport stamping, will require travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, on their first use. This registration will be valid for three years. While the goal is to enhance security and streamline travel, there are concerns about potential delays during the initial rollout at key transit points like the Port of Dover and Eurostar terminals.</p>
