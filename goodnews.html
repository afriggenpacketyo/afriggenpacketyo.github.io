          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described his meeting with President Trump and European leaders as a significant move toward ending the war with Russia. He stated that work is already underway to define concrete security guarantees for Ukraine, with national security advisors in constant contact. Following the talks, Zelenskyy confirmed that while no date is set, the U.S. supports a trilateral meeting between Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia as soon as possible. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed that his expectations for the talks were exceeded and suggested a potential meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy could occur within two weeks.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its acceptance of a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators, who now await a formal response from Israel. The plan reportedly involves a 60-day truce during which about half of the remaining hostages would be released while negotiations for a permanent ceasefire continue. However, senior Israeli officials have recently stated that they will only accept a comprehensive deal that secures the freedom of all hostages and meets other conditions for ending the war. Meanwhile, the Israeli cabinet is expected to approve a new military offensive in Gaza City.</p>

          <h2>Health Experts Question Widespread Use and Efficacy of Dietary Supplements</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the widespread use of dietary supplements by over 60% of Americans, experts caution that the industry is loosely regulated and many products lack scientific evidence to support their health claims. The 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act allows manufacturers to make vague claims without undergoing clinical trials, creating what critics call a "Wild West" environment. Health columnist Anahad O’Conner notes that while some supplements like creatine have shown modest benefits, others like collagen have no convincing studies behind them. Experts generally advise obtaining nutrients from a healthy diet unless a specific deficiency is diagnosed by a doctor.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after reaching a tentative agreement with the union representing its flight attendants, ending a strike that began on Saturday and stranded thousands of passengers. The breakthrough came after talks involving a government-appointed mediator. The airline confirmed that service would gradually restart, though it may take days to return to a full schedule. The dispute centered on pay and scheduling, with the union arguing that the airline's offer was below inflation and did not compensate staff for all hours worked, including boarding time.</p>

          <p>American families are altering their back-to-school shopping strategies this year in response to concerns over inflation and potential tariffs on imported goods. According to the National Retail Federation, many households are shopping earlier than usual and focusing on essential items to manage costs. Prices for typical school supplies have reportedly risen over 7% this year, prompting consumers to seek discounts, compare prices online, and consider refurbished electronics. Experts suggest that retailers are offering deep discounts on basic items to attract customers, while store-brand products can offer significant savings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Since its formation in 1992, the English Premier League (EPL) has grown into the world's most dominant and wealthiest club soccer league, with a combined commercial revenue of over $8.5 billion in the 2023-24 season. This financial power, fueled by massive global broadcast deals valued at over $5 billion a season, allows EPL clubs to attract top international talent. Unlike other European leagues often dominated by one or two teams, the EPL is known for its competitive balance, where teams from the bottom of the table can defeat those at the top, which contributes to its massive global viewership.</p>

          <h2>Paying College Athletes Sparks Debate Over the Future of Non-Revenue Sports</h2>

          <p>Recent legal decisions allowing college athletes in revenue-generating sports like football and basketball to be paid are prompting a debate over the financial viability of non-revenue sports. The article argues that the long-standing system of using profits from top sports to subsidize teams like squash and rowing is an arbitrary and unfair use of funds. With athletic budgets now needing to accommodate direct payments to star players, the author suggests that cutting these less popular, often upscale sports would be a logical and overdue market correction, despite a recent executive order from President Trump aiming to protect them.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a letter of gratitude from his wife, First Lady Olena Zelenska, to former U.S. First Lady Melania Trump. The letter thanks Mrs. Trump for her attention to the issue of at least 19,500 Ukrainian children who Kyiv says have been abducted by Russia during the war. This gesture follows Mrs. Trump's own public letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, imploring him to protect the innocence of children and restore their safety. President Zelensky emphasized that Mrs. Trump's compassion and voice give strength to the cause of returning the separated children.</p>

          <h2>American Investors Increase Ownership Stakes in Top European Soccer Clubs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 06:41:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. investors and private equity firms are increasingly acquiring stakes in top European soccer clubs, now holding ownership in a majority of England's Premier League teams. This trend is driven by the sport's rapid revenue growth, which has seen income for the top five leagues balloon by 750% since the 1996-97 season, leading to soaring club valuations. For American investors, European soccer presents a more accessible alternative to the higher price tags of major U.S. sports franchises. This influx of capital is leading to new business models, such as multi-club ownership, as investors seek to maximize their returns.</p>

          <h2>Consumers Cut Back on Fast Food, Opting for Smaller Supermarket Treats Amid High Prices</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New consumer research indicates that people are spending less at casual and fast-food restaurants, with customer visits dropping 6% over the summer compared to last year. This decline is attributed to high grocery price inflation, which is causing consumers to seek more affordable indulgences. Instead of dining out, shoppers are buying smaller, branded treats from supermarkets, with sales of these items growing faster than cheaper, own-label alternatives. The trend suggests people are trading down from restaurant meals but still trading up for quality treats at the grocery store as a cost-effective reward.</p>

          <p>Home Depot reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell slightly below Wall Street expectations, marking its first miss on both metrics since 2014. The home improvement retailer attributed the results to a continued "deferral mindset" from homeowners amid a sluggish real estate market. Despite the miss, the company maintained its full-year forecast, citing building momentum throughout the quarter and growth in big-ticket transactions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Belgian Cities Utilize Wetland Restoration to Combat Increased Flooding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 06:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Flanders region of Belgium, which is highly urbanized and prone to flooding, authorities are implementing nature-based solutions to manage excess water from increasingly intense rainfall. The strategy, part of the comprehensive Sigma Plan, involves restoring wetlands and "depoldering" agricultural land to give rivers more space to overflow safely. These restored natural areas act as giant sponges, absorbing water during heavy rains and slowly releasing it during dry periods. The project, which initially faced local resistance, is now seen as a global model for climate adaptation and community engagement.</p>
