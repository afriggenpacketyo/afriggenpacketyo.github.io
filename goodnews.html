          <p>Actor Matthew McConaughey has revealed a key piece of advice for maintaining a healthy marriage, which he details in his new book, "Poems & Prayers." He advocates for couples to switch from a king-size to a queen-size bed to foster greater physical closeness and intimacy. McConaughey explains that the smaller space prevents couples from becoming distant, literally and figuratively, ensuring they remain connected, especially after children are no longer sharing the bed.</p>

          <p>In his new book, "Breakneck," analyst Dan Wang presents a novel framework for understanding the dynamic between the United States and China, characterizing them as a "lawyerly society" versus an "engineering state." He argues that while America's legalistic approach has its merits, it has led to physical stagnation, whereas China's engineering-driven governance has produced remarkable infrastructure and manufacturing successes. Wang suggests that despite China's own internal issues like youth unemployment, the U.S. could benefit from studying China's achievements in physical dynamism to address its own challenges.</p>

          <p>A homeowner in Hermosa Beach, California, has demonstrated the feasibility of creating an environmentally friendly home that generates more energy than it consumes, even for less than the cost of a traditional remodel. The "Green Idea House" utilizes solar panels, strategic architectural design like roof overhangs for passive heating and cooling, and all-electric appliances to achieve its net-zero status. The project highlights the importance of meticulous planning, homeowner dedication, and adapting to a changing climate, offering a blueprint for sustainable living that saves thousands annually on utility bills.</p>

          <p>The 190th edition of Oktoberfest officially began in Munich as Mayor Dieter Reiter tapped the first beer barrel, proclaiming the traditional phrase "O'zapft is!" The world's largest beer and folk festival is expected to draw over six million visitors from around the globe to the Theresienwiese fairground.

          <p>A dramatic political upheaval in Nepal, largely driven by Gen Z-led anti-corruption protests, has resulted in the resignation of the prime minister and the appointment of the nation's first female leader, Sushila Karki. The movement was fueled by youth frustration over unemployment and the lavish lifestyles of political elites, which activists exposed on social media. The protests escalated into violent clashes, leading to dozens of deaths before the government was overthrown, marking a significant generational shift in the country's political landscape.</p>

          <p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, edible insects like caterpillars (Mbinzo) and palm weevil larvae (Mpose) are not just a delicacy but a vital source of protein and vitamins for many. These insects are harvested from forests or farmed commercially and sold in bustling markets, providing a more accessible and nutritious alternative to expensive meat in a country where poverty is widespread. This traditional practice, which has grown in recent decades due to food scarcity, offers a sustainable food source that organizations are now cultivating to support vulnerable populations like orphans.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are engaged in an urgent space race to land humans on the moon by the end of the decade, with both nations targeting the strategic lunar south pole. The U.S. Artemis program aims to establish a permanent base, but faces challenges from potential funding cuts and delays with private partners like SpaceX. Meanwhile, China is making steady progress with its military-led program, raising national security concerns that the first nation to establish a presence could claim the resource-rich region.</p>

          <p>Despite industry trends of moving productions out of state for cost savings, veteran television producer David E. Kelley is reaffirming his commitment to filming in California. His company decided to keep its projects, including "Big Little Lies" and "The Lincoln Lawyer," in the Los Angeles area, even after facing uncertainty from recent wildfires. This decision is seen as a reinvestment in the local Hollywood community, aiming to support the industry's workforce and infrastructure, bolstered by recent improvements to the state's film and TV tax credit program.</p>

          <p>Athletes at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, including Great Britain's Keely Hodgkinson, have raised concerns about the logistics of the main warm-up facility. The venue is located a 15-minute bus journey from the main stadium, which athletes find draining and disruptive to their pre-competition routines. World Athletics President Lord Coe acknowledged the situation is "not perfect," explaining that the post-Olympics loss of a closer track created challenges, but stated that organizers have done their best to manage the situation.</p>

          <h2>Neuroscientist Explains the Science of Romantic Obsession and How to Overcome It</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's book "Smitten" explores the concept of "limerence," a state of profound romantic infatuation that can become an unhealthy obsession. Limerence is characterized by intrusive thoughts and extreme emotional highs and lows, often driven by uncertainty in a relationship with an unsuitable or unavailable person. To break the cycle, Bellamy recommends strategies such as limiting contact, reframing positive daydreams into negative "daymares," and focusing on new personal goals to create a sense of purpose outside the obsession.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the UK's Liberal Democrats gather for their annual conference, the party is grappling with its future direction following a successful general election campaign. Leader Sir Ed Davey's headline-grabbing stunts helped raise the party's profile, but polling suggests voters may now want to see a more serious approach. The party's challenge is to build on its gains, which were primarily in southern England at the expense of the Conservatives, and to define a clear economic and social platform that can appeal to a broader electorate while both major parties are distracted by internal turmoil.</p>
