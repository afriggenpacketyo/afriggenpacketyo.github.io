          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index increased by 0.1% in May, falling short of economists' expectations, with the annual inflation rate at 2.4%. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also showed a smaller increase than anticipated, raising concerns among Federal Reserve officials about the impact of tariffs on inflation. Energy prices declined, offsetting increases in food and shelter costs, while vehicle and apparel prices also decreased. Despite the modest inflation figures, some economists caution that the full impact of tariffs may not be reflected in the CPI data for several months. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts anticipate that home equity loan rates will not significantly decrease immediately following the Federal Reserve's June meeting. Factors such as inflation remaining above the 2% target and the economy's continued strength suggest the Fed will likely hold rates steady. While HELOC rates are closely tied to the Prime Rate and may decrease with Fed rate cuts, home equity loan rates are more connected to the bond market and broader economic conditions, suggesting stability. Experts advise borrowers to consider their borrowing purpose, long-term goals, and ability to handle payments before taking out a home equity loan. (not investment advice)</p>
