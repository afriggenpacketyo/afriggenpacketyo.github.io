          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to launch a pilot program to cover expensive weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound under Medicare and Medicaid. This move could significantly expand access for millions of Americans and would be a major financial victory for pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. The plan is similar to a previous Biden administration proposal and is expected to start in 2026 for Medicaid and 2027 for Medicare. While the news is viewed as a positive development for the industry, details regarding pricing and patient eligibility parameters remain unclear.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order creating a new task force to manage federal preparations for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The president will personally chair the group, which is tasked with coordinating security, transportation, and visa processing for the international event. This move mirrors a similar task force established for the 2026 World Cup and underscores the administration's focus on overseeing major international events held in the U.S. The president stated he would authorize the use of the National Guard or military if necessary to ensure the games are safe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Realtor.com shows that median home prices are declining in certain U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant price drops from their 2022 peaks, largely due to an increase in housing inventory from new construction and homes staying on the market longer. In contrast, the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices and limited inventory, with markets like Milwaukee seeing a 26% price increase since 2022. This regional divergence highlights a split in the national housing market, offering some relief to buyers in specific areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An industrial accident at a cement plant in Yreka, California, released a large dust cloud, leading county officials to issue a temporary shelter-in-place order for residents. The Siskiyou County Sheriff's Office advised people to stay indoors, turn off air conditioning, and close windows as a precaution against potentially hazardous airborne cement particles. The order was lifted in under an hour after the cloud dissipated. Officials stated the alert was issued out of an abundance of caution and that any settled particles on outdoor surfaces could be safely washed away. The cause of the incident is under investigation.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparison of the potential interest earnings from depositing $10,000 into either a 3-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. With current rates, a high-yield savings account at 4.30% would narrowly outperform a 3-month CD at 4.25% over the term, earning just over a dollar more. However, the CD offers a guaranteed fixed rate, which is an advantage if interest rates fall as predicted, while the savings account rate is variable. The article advises savers to consider their financial goals and need for liquidity, as the earnings difference is negligible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles started their title defense in The Hundred cricket tournament with a decisive six-wicket victory over the London Spirit at Lord's. The Spirit were bowled out for just 80 runs, the second-lowest score in the history of the men's competition. Invincibles' bowlers Rashid Khan and Sam Curran were instrumental, taking three wickets each, with Curran delivering a historically slow wicket-taking ball. Despite a challenging pitch, the Invincibles comfortably chased the small total with 31 balls remaining, marking a powerful start to their season.</p>

          <p>This article outlines three critical questions for homeowners considering borrowing a $100,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) in the current economic climate. With impending Fed rate cuts, homeowners should assess if cuts are guaranteed and how they will concretely impact their variable-rate HELOC payments over time. The piece also advises borrowers to consider whether a fixed-rate home equity loan might be a more stable and predictable alternative, given that average rates for both products are currently similar. The article stresses the importance of cautious borrowing, as foreclosure is a risk for non-payment. (not investment advice)</p>
