          <p>The NHS in England plans to establish specialized mental health crisis centers across the country over the next decade, aimed at alleviating overcrowding in hospital accident and emergency departments. These centers will be open to walk-in patients, referrals from GPs, and police, providing immediate care from specialist staff. NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hailed the initiative as a pioneering model that ensures individuals receive the right support in the right setting, potentially speeding up access to appropriate care and reducing hospital admissions. However, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expressed skepticism, emphasizing the need for robust testing and proper funding to ensure the effectiveness of the scheme.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, has emphasized the bloc's commitment to securing a trade agreement with the United States based on mutual respect, rather than threats. This statement comes after former U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the U.S. from the EU. Sefcovic highlighted that EU-US trade is unmatched and should be guided by mutual respect, while also asserting that the EU stands ready to defend its interests. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, with leaders advocating for negotiations as the best way forward.</p>

Both steelmakers have welcomed this decision, with Nippon Steel emphasizing its commitment to protecting American workers, the American steel industry, and America's national security.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming to make it available to consumers at 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms, in response to soaring rice prices. The government intends to bypass auctions to directly control prices, with the reserve rice expected to reach store shelves as early as June. This initiative comes amid mounting criticism that the government has failed to curb the spike in rice prices, which is hurting households as inflation outpaces wage growth. Koizumi also mentioned exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution of the lower-priced rice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are adopting the concept of "quiet quitting," prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike previous generations who showed unwavering loyalty to their employers, these workers are choosing to do the bare minimum at their jobs to have more time for personal pursuits. A study by Mynavi Career Research Lab found that 45% of Japanese workers admit to doing the bare minimum, with those in their 20s being the most likely to engage in this practice. This shift reflects a desire for more "me time" and a rejection of the sacrifices made by their parents' generation.</p>
