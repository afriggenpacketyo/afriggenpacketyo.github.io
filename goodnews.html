        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has responded to Steven Gerrard's recent comments that their 'golden generation' of players failed to win trophies due to being "egotistical losers." Speaking on his podcast, Rooney disagreed with the assessment, stating that while the team had big characters, their failure was not due to a poor attitude or lack of effort. He suggested that the current generation of players benefits from a different social dynamic and a better relationship with the media, but emphasized that his era of players worked hard and simply "didn't quite manage to get over the line."</p>

Ap Iorwerth promised a "new government, with new energy and new ideas," signaling a strategic shift to challenge Labour's century-long dominance in Welsh politics by appealing to a broad coalition of voters across the country.</p>

          <p>Despite challenging seasons, Tommy Edman and Andy Pages were instrumental in the Los Angeles Dodgers' series-clinching 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. Edman, who battled injuries all summer, started the decisive 11th-inning rally with a crucial single after a long at-bat. Subsequently, Pages, who had been struggling throughout the postseason, came to the plate with the bases loaded and hit a ground ball that prompted a game-ending throwing error by the Phillies' pitcher. Their timely contributions highlighted the team's depth and resilience as they advanced to the National League Championship Series.</p>

          <p>The prospect of a ceasefire deal in Gaza has dominated the front pages of British newspapers, with headlines like "Peace within reach" and "A moment of shared hope." The Daily Express and Daily Mail credited former President Trump's forceful personality for compelling the parties toward an accord. However, other outlets like The Daily Telegraph and The Financial Times urged caution, highlighting significant unresolved issues in the proposed framework. These include Hamas's refusal to disarm and uncertainty over which nations would contribute to an international stabilization force, underscoring the fragility of the potential peace.</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was discovered on a Dutch beach in 2004 has been identified as 35-year-old German citizen Eva Maria Pommer, solving a two-decade-long mystery. Her identification is the fourth success for Operation Identify Me, an international police campaign launched in 2023 that uses public appeals and shared data to name unidentified female victims of unexplained deaths. The breakthrough came after a crucial tip was provided to Dutch police following a television appeal in Germany. While her identity is now known, the cause of death remains unexplained as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists from China and Spain has discovered that adding salt to ice allows it to generate a significant electrical charge when bent or subjected to non-uniform strain. This phenomenon, known as flexoelectricity, could pave the way for developing low-cost, clean energy sources in cold environments. The researchers demonstrated that the electrical response from this saline ice is comparable to some of the best ceramic materials currently used for their electrical properties. The team successfully fabricated devices using the salt-doped ice, showcasing its potential as a novel power source.</p>

          <p>A judge has thrown out Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's hit song "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that Lamar's lyrics, which accused Drake of serious misconduct, constituted "nonactionable opinion" within the context of a highly publicized rap battle and would not be taken as verifiable facts by a reasonable listener. Drake had sued the record label, which represents both artists, for allowing the song's publication and promotion. A spokesperson for Drake indicated plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a temporary order halting the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois, including the city of Chicago. The administration had ordered the deployment to protect federal facilities and agents from what it described as violent protesters, but local officials argued the move was a politically motivated escalation. The judge stated that allowing the troops would only "add fuel to the fire" and found the Department of Homeland Security's narrative of events to be unreliable. The order will remain in effect for two weeks, pending further legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Democratic Governor of Maine, Janet Mills, is reportedly planning to launch her campaign for the U.S. Senate next week, setting up a high-profile challenge against incumbent Republican Senator Susan Collins. Mills, who is term-limited as governor and has been a top recruit for national Democrats, would enter what is expected to be one of the most closely watched and expensive races of the midterm elections. The contest in the Democratic-leaning state presents a rare opportunity for Democrats to flip a Republican-held seat as they seek to contest the GOP's narrow Senate majority.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at stabilizing the California FAIR Plan, the state's property insurer of last resort, which faced massive losses from recent wildfires. One key bill allows the state to issue bonds on behalf of the plan to cover catastrophic claims, while another increases legislative oversight by adding lawmakers to its governing committee. These reforms are designed to enhance the plan's financial resilience and transparency as climate-fueled fires make it increasingly difficult for homeowners in high-risk areas to obtain traditional insurance coverage.</p>
