          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to hold a summit in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting, held at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, follows Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal, a promise he made during his presidential campaign. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will not be in attendance, he is expected to be briefed afterward, though he has stated that any agreement made without Ukraine's involvement would be considered a "dead decision."</p>

          <p>A technology analyst has asserted that U.S. government intervention in the struggling chipmaker Intel is "essential" for national security, following reports that the Trump administration is considering acquiring a stake in the company. The argument suggests that such a move would be critical to revitalizing Intel and reducing America's reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. This discussion aligns with the administration's goal of increasing domestic production of high-end technology, with funds from the CHIPS Act potentially being used for the investment.

          <p>A book checked out from the San Antonio Public Library in 1943 has been returned nearly 82 years late. The book, a parenting guide titled "Your Child, His Family, and Friends," was discovered among a deceased man's possessions by his child, who mailed it back from Oregon. A letter accompanying the book explained that the borrower was likely the man's grandmother, who moved to Mexico City shortly after checking it out. The library, which eliminated late fees in 2021, noted that the fine would have amounted to almost $900.</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting an American-made electric pickup truck it claims can sell for about half the price of an average vehicle in the U.S. The company's strategy is to offer a simple, barebones base model that owners can customize with over 100 planned accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. While the truck's initial sub-$20,000 price point was advertised with federal tax credits, the company maintains its appeal even as those incentives are rolled back, despite facing more competition in the sub-$30,000 vehicle market.

          <p>Shares of Salesforce surged after regulatory filings revealed that activist hedge fund Starboard Value increased its stake in the company by 47% during the second quarter. This move has sparked speculation on Wall Street that another round of activist pressure may be imminent, similar to the successful campaign in 2022-2023 that pushed for greater profitability and efficiency. Analysts suggest this could signal renewed pressure on Salesforce management to refocus on its core business and avoid dilutive acquisitions amid recent stock underperformance.

          <p>A DeKalb County judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester involved in demonstrations against the Atlanta police training center known as 'Cop City.' The judge ruled that the state violated the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to secure an indictment more than two years after their arrest. This decision is seen as a significant victory for opponents of the training center, as the state has pursued aggressive charges, including RICO conspiracy, against dozens of activists.</p>

          <p>The common spice cloves, often used in baking, may offer several health benefits, including improved gum health and lower blood sugar levels, according to various research studies. Clove oil contains eugenol, a compound with natural antimicrobial properties that can help control plaque and kill harmful bacteria and fungi in the mouth. Studies also suggest that clove extract can significantly lower blood sugar after meals, and the spice is rich in essential minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium, which support bone and heart health.</p>

          <p>Recent monsoon storms have delivered much-needed rain to parts of the Phoenix metropolitan area, though the distribution has been uneven. Areas like north Scottsdale and Queen Creek received substantial downpours of up to two inches, providing temporary relief from the heat. However, other parts of the region, including central Phoenix and the West Valley, experienced little to no rainfall. Meteorologists indicate there is still a chance for more scattered thunderstorms, but the main weather system is expected to move out of the area soon.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," written and directed by Zach Cregger, is being hailed for its daring and satisfying ending that provides clear answers to its central mystery. The movie follows a community grappling with the unexplained disappearance of a third-grade class, eventually revealing a supernatural villain behind the events. The review praises the film for delivering a cathartic climax where the villain is defeated, but also for underscoring the lasting trauma of the tragedy, reminding viewers that vanquishing evil does not erase the suffering it has already caused.</p>

          <p>A fact-check analysis indicates that President Trump's recent claims about "out of control" crime in Washington, D.C. are misleading. While the city did experience a crime spike in 2023, official data from the Metropolitan Police Department and other sources show a significant decrease in violent crime and homicides in 2024 and 2025. The article points out that comparing D.C.'s crime rate to that of states is an inapt comparison, and that when compared to other major cities, D.C. does not have the highest murder rate.</p>
