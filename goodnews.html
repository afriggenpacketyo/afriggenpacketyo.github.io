Sergei Bobrovsky's stellar performance in goal sealed the victory. The Panthers' dominant performance silenced Connor McDavid and the Oilers, ending Canada's 31-year Stanley Cup drought.

          <p>Brazil has declared its commercial flocks free of the bird flu virus after a 28-day period without any new outbreaks on commercial farms, according to the country's Ministry of Agriculture. This declaration follows the complete disinfection of the farm where Brazil's only commercial outbreak was detected last month. Several importers, including China, had banned chicken imports from Brazil pending measures to control the disease. Agriculture Minister Carlos Favaro stated that Brazil is working to resume exports with its trading partners, with the World Organization for Animal Health needing to confirm Brazil's disease-free status. Brazil's first outbreak occurred on a chicken breeder farm, where 17,000 birds were culled. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it would hold its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach as it evaluates the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank expects inflation to worsen in the coming months, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year, consistent with its March projections. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited solid labor market conditions and economic growth but cautioned that the Trump administration's new tariffs are likely to drive up inflation and slow down growth. The Fed anticipates that inflation will rise to 3% by year-end, with unemployment edging up to 4.5%. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that American taxpayers will not be responsible for the ongoing appeal of President Donald Trump's $83 million defamation case. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied Trump's request to have Justice Department lawyers argue in his appeal of columnist E. Jean Carroll's defamation case against him. A New York jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her in 2019 when he denied her accusation of sexual assault. DOJ lawyers had argued that since some of Trump's alleged conduct fell within the scope of his role as president, the Justice Department should be able to defend him. Oral arguments in Trump's appeal are scheduled for June 24. </p>
