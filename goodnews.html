          <p>The LSU Tigers clinched the NCAA baseball championship by sweeping Coastal Carolina in the Men's College World Series final with a 5-3 victory. The game was marked by early drama, including the ejection of Coastal Carolina's head coach in the first inning for arguing with the home plate umpire. LSU responded to Coastal Carolina's initial lead with a series of runs, highlighted by Chris Stanfield's two-run single and Derek Curiel's RBI single in the fourth inning. Chase Shores closed out the game for LSU, securing their eighth title and solidifying their status as a baseball powerhouse.</p>

          <p>Kyoto experienced a record high of 10.88 million foreign visitors in 2024, with overall visitors reaching 56.06 million, the second highest on record. Despite overtourism concerns, a survey by the Kyoto city government revealed high satisfaction levels among both foreign and Japanese tourists, with over 90% expressing satisfaction with their visit. Temples, shrines, and historical sites remain popular attractions, though Japanese visitors were more likely to be bothered by crowds. To combat overtourism, Kyoto plans to implement a lodging tax increase in 2026, with revenues directed toward strengthening measures to address the issue.</p>

          <p>As the use of artificial intelligence expands, cases of harmful responses such as hate speech and copyright infringements are increasing, highlighting the need for more stringent regulations and testing. Researchers emphasize that current methods are insufficient to ensure AI models behave as intended, calling for more robust evaluation practices like red teaming. They suggest involving third parties, such as journalists and ethical hackers, in testing to uncover potential flaws. Standardized 'AI flaw' reports and incentives are also recommended to improve the understanding and management of risks posed by AI tools.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Identifies Phrases That Hinder Children's Cooperation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a parenting expert identified five phrases that often trigger defiance in children. These phrases, such as "Because I said so" and "Stop crying," can activate a child's fight-or-flight response, hindering cooperation. Instead, the expert suggests using language that respects a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries, such as explaining decisions and acknowledging feelings. By fostering emotional safety and involving children in problem-solving, parents can create an environment where cooperation feels natural and raise emotionally resilient adults.</p>

          <p>Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, is now available via NHS GPs in England, but only for individuals meeting strict criteria, including a BMI of 40 or over and multiple health conditions. This staggered approach ensures those most in need receive treatment while managing resources, with long-term plans to broaden availability. Patients will also receive "wrap-around" care, including exercise and diet support. While some GP practices caution patients not meeting the criteria against booking appointments, concerns arise that demand will exceed supply, and some GPs need training to safely administer the injections.</p>

          <p>China has become the world leader in electric vehicles (EVs) through long-term planning, government funding, and a focus on dominating future technologies. The country's leadership, inspired by engineer Wan Gang, invested heavily in subsidies and infrastructure, fostering a competitive EV start-up sector. Chinese EV makers, such as BYD and XPeng, offer affordable EVs with advanced technology, and China dominates critical supply chains in battery production. While Western countries impose import taxes on Chinese EVs, the UK remains an attractive market, highlighting China's significant impact on the global EV industry.</p>

          <p>NHS Lothian is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that offers ketamine-assisted therapy. While ketamine is known as a party drug, it has shown potential in treating depression, making patients more receptive to psychotherapy. Experts emphasize the need for controlled administration and lower doses compared to recreational use, as well as the importance of assessing patients to ensure that they are diagnosed with depression prior to receiving ketamine treatments.</p>
