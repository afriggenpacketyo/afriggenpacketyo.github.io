          <p>In a new initiative to increase social mobility, the UK government has announced that its main civil service internship scheme will be exclusively for students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This determination will be based on their parents' occupations when the applicant was 14 years old. The policy aims to make the civil service more representative of the country it serves and ensure it harnesses a broader range of talent. Successful interns from this program will also be given priority for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry route into the civil service.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled plans for a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom to be built in the White House's East Wing, with a capacity for 650 guests. The project, estimated to cost around $200 million, will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, not by taxpayers. The administration stated the new venue is a necessary addition for hosting major state functions, which currently require large tents on the property. Construction is slated to begin in September, with the design paying respect to the architectural heritage of the existing White House.</p>

          <p>Amid growing pressure to match competitors' investments in artificial intelligence, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated the company will significantly increase its AI spending and is open to acquisitions. During an earnings call, Cook emphasized that Apple is actively looking to acquire companies of all sizes to accelerate its AI roadmap, having already purchased around seven smaller companies this year. While Apple's capital expenditures are lower than rivals like Google and Microsoft, executives explained their hybrid investment model and focus on developing proprietary AI-powering chips. Cook also expressed confidence that the iPhone will remain a central product, with new AI devices likely being complementary rather than substitutes.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers concluded the MLB trade deadline with relatively minor acquisitions, adding relief pitcher Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call. Despite speculation, the team's front office chose not to pursue blockbuster deals, instead expressing confidence in their current roster to defend its World Series title. While National League rivals like the San Diego Padres and New York Mets made significant additions, the Dodgers focused on addressing specific needs without giving up major prospects. The team is banking on the return of injured players and a return to form from its star hitters to carry them through the remainder of the season.</p>

          <p>Cole’s French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant claiming to have invented the famous sandwich, has delayed its planned closure by 45 days. The decision comes after a massive outpouring of community support, with long lines of customers forming since the closure was announced. The owner, Cedd Moses, struck a deal with the landlord to extend service, providing a temporary reprieve for the landmark establishment and its staff. While grateful for the surge in business, Moses remains skeptical about the restaurant's long-term viability and is actively seeking a new buyer who will preserve its historic value.</p>

The 24-year-old, who had spells with the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars, never played in a regular season game. In a social media post, Rees-Zammit stated it was the right time to come home and get back to doing what he does best. Before his switch to the NFL, he was a prominent player for Wales, earning 32 caps, and is now expected to return to professional rugby for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's decision to pause interest rate cuts, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a strategic choice. With CD rates still relatively high, this period offers an opportunity to lock in favorable returns before potential future rate drops. The article advises savers to shop around for the best rates rather than allowing their CDs to auto-renew, which could result in a lower-yield account. Acting before the bank's grace period expires is crucial to maximizing savings in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve extending its pause on interest rate cuts, Americans with high-interest credit card debt are advised to focus on proactive relief strategies rather than waiting for external economic shifts. The article suggests that even a small rate cut would have a minimal impact on high average credit card rates, which remain near record highs. Borrowers are encouraged to consider personal debt reduction plans, such as the debt snowball or avalanche methods, or to explore professional debt relief services. The key takeaway is that taking independent action is essential for regaining financial stability in the current environment. (not investment advice)</p>

While both offer significantly better returns than traditional savings, high-yield savings accounts currently tend to have a slight edge on interest rates, potentially earning slightly more over time. However, the difference is often negligible, and the choice may come down to other features, such as the check-writing capabilities typically offered by money market accounts.
