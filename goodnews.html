          <p>Pakistan has taken on the one-month rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council, a position it will hold for the eighth time. While the role is largely symbolic and lacks executive authority, it comes during a period of significant global instability and heightened geopolitical tensions. Pakistan's UN ambassador stated a commitment to peaceful conflict resolution, though the presidency is expected to provide a platform to raise ongoing issues with India over the Kashmir region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article questions why French cinema has been slow to depict the country's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism, unlike Hollywood. The author highlights recent independent films like "No Chains No Masters" and a biopic on Frantz Fanon that are finally addressing these topics but often struggle for mainstream visibility. The piece argues that while audiences are ready to confront this history, French film institutions have been reluctant to make room for these compelling and overdue narratives.</p>

          <p>At a recent tech conference, experts emphasized the importance of emerging economies developing "sovereign AI" to ensure strategic autonomy and cultural relevance. This involves creating AI systems tailored to local languages and contexts, rather than relying on English-based models from major tech companies. Panelists suggested that leveraging open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services can democratize the technology and empower nations to build their own unique AI ecosystems.</p>

          <p>A private survey, the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI, indicated that China's factory activity unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official data that showed a contraction. The reading of 50.4 was driven by the fastest production growth since November, as better trade conditions and promotions boosted new orders. However, the survey also noted declining export orders and weak employment, with businesses remaining cautious amid fierce market competition and an uncertain external environment.

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, as a key factor in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine helps prevent inflammation and the aging of multiple organs by inhibiting a specific enzyme. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging effects of exercise and could suggest new strategies for simulating its benefits.</p>
