          <p>A significant breakthrough may have occurred in the 300-year-old search for the treasure of French pirate Olivier Levasseur, known as "La Buse." Archaeologists believe they have identified the wreck of the Nossa Senhora do Cabo, a Portuguese warship captured by the pirate in 1721 near the island of Reunion. The ship was carrying a vast fortune in gold, silver, and jewels, estimated to be worth over $138 million today. The discovery near the island of Nosy Boraha, a former pirate hideout, could provide vital clues to the location of the legendary lost treasure.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Reasons for Low Penalty Conversion Rate at Women's Euro 2025</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Euro 2025 tournament has seen a notably low success rate for penalty kicks, currently at just 58.5%, a significant drop from previous competitions. This article explores several potential reasons for this trend, including increased psychological pressure on players due to the sport's growing popularity and media spotlight. Experts also point to improved goalkeeper preparation, with better data analysis and scouting allowing keepers to anticipate takers' moves more effectively. The professionalization of the women's game has led to physically more capable and smarter goalkeepers, making penalties a far less certain source of goals.</p>

          <p>Following a court ruling that established its duty under Georgia's Open Records Act, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released nearly 300 pages of documents related to the controversial "Cop City" police training center. The lawsuit, brought by a news outlet and a research group, sets a potential precedent for the transparency of private police foundations nationwide. The released records provide insight into the APF's lobbying efforts, including strategies to counter a public referendum on the project. This development marks a significant step for activists and journalists seeking accountability from these often-opaque organizations.</p>

          <p>A tsunami warning for Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has been lifted following a series of five strong earthquakes that struck off the coast. The most powerful quake registered a magnitude of 7.4, occurring at a relatively shallow depth of 20 kilometers east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially issued a warning for potentially major waves but later downgraded and then canceled the alert. A separate tsunami watch for Hawaii was also ended, and there have been no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage from the seismic events.</p>

The book explores the era's spirit of discovery, a time when vast regions of the world remained unmapped. It highlights the Roosevelts' secret quest to be the first to bring knowledge of this elusive black-and-white bear to the world's attention.</p>

A JPMorgan analyst is bullish on Alphabet, raising its price target based on solid fundamentals in Search and YouTube, and its potential in generative AI. The same analyst also upgraded the price target for Meta, believing its vast user base, advertising strength, and investments in AI and the Metaverse justify a premium valuation.

          <p>Recent conservative criticism of the new "Superman" film's immigrant narrative overlooks the character's deeply leftist and anti-establishment origins, according to comic book author Grant Morrison. Created in 1938 by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original Superman was portrayed as a "Champion of the Oppressed," fighting corrupt bosses and tearing down slums. This article traces the character's evolution from this socialist figure to a patriotic symbol during wartime and a suburban father figure in the 1950s. The analysis argues that Superman has always been a malleable metaphor, reflecting the societal values and anxieties of each era.</p>

          <p>China could effectively respond to U.S. technology restrictions by shifting its focus to collaboration with the Global South on artificial intelligence, according to policy analysts. This strategy would involve moving beyond the direct rivalry with the U.S. and instead promoting inclusive AI infrastructure, technology sharing, and the co-development of ethical standards with developing nations. By fostering cooperative innovation and equitable access to advanced technologies, Beijing could create an alternative to the U.S. strategy of "small yard, high fence" decoupling. This approach would build new partnerships and counter American efforts to isolate China's tech industry.</p>

          <p>A new study from Common Sense Media reveals that nearly three-quarters of U.S. teenagers have used conversational AI companions for social activities like flirting, seeking advice, or simply chatting. While over half use these tools regularly, the research indicates that teens are not replacing human relationships, with 80% prioritizing their real-life friendships. However, the study raises concerns, noting that a third of teens have discussed serious matters with AI instead of people and have felt just as satisfied. The findings highlight the complex role of AI in adolescent social development and the potential risks of data privacy and over-reliance.</p>

After a rookie season marked by drops, Johnston showed significant improvement last year and is now poised for a potentially larger role in the offense. The departure of Williams, a trusted target for quarterback Justin Herbert, puts more pressure on the receiving corps, including standout Ladd McConkey and promising rookie Tre’ Harris.

He advocates for a shift to proportional representation with multi-member districts, a common system globally. This change would allow parties to gain legislative seats in proportion to their vote share, making every vote more meaningful and breaking the political "doom loop."</p>

The selections include Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park," praised for its tighter story and iconic moments not present in Michael Crichton's novel. Other notable picks are "The Talented Mr. Ripley," which adds more suspense and clarity to the protagonist's motives, and "The Devil Wears Prada," which elevates its source into a sharp commentary on professional relationships.

          <p>Following the British and Irish Lions' first Test victory over Australia, the narrative has focused on the "desperation" of the Wallabies to keep the series alive in the next match. However, this analysis questions how far desperation alone can carry a team that may be outmatched. The article notes that while Australia showed fight, the Lions' sloppy play in the latter part of the game contributed more to the close score than Australian brilliance. The piece argues that if the Lions can maintain their early-game form, their superior physicality and creativity will likely secure the series, regardless of the Wallabies' determination.</p>

This marks the first time a clear numerical target has been set for reducing pollution spills, responding to widespread public outrage over the deteriorating state of the nation's rivers and coastlines.

The incident had sparked a heated debate in Italy over managing human-wildlife conflict as the region's bear population grows.
