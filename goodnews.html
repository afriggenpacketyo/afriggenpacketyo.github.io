          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility in South Texas is on track to become an official city named Starbase, following a vote approved by local residents, primarily SpaceX employees. This move aims to facilitate the growth of Starbase as a community, giving SpaceX greater control over local infrastructure and services. However, critics worry about Musk's expanding influence, including potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches. The city's incorporation coincides with SpaceX seeking federal permission to increase launch frequency from five to 25 annually.</p>
