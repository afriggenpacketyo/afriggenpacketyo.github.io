          <p>In an unusual alliance, Amazon utilized a rocket from its direct competitor, SpaceX, to launch 24 of its Project Kuiper internet satellites into orbit. This collaboration is part of Amazon's effort to build a constellation of over 3,000 satellites to provide global broadband service, competing with SpaceX's established Starlink network. Amazon is under a Federal Communications Commission deadline to deploy half of its planned satellites by July 2026. The launch highlights the intense competition and massive investment in the growing satellite internet market.</p>

          <p>Adelita Grijalva has won the Democratic nomination in the special primary election for Arizona's 7th Congressional District, a seat previously held by her late father, Rep. Raúl Grijalva. The district is heavily Democratic, stretching across southern Arizona and including parts of Tucson. Grijalva, a progressive, will face Republican nominee Daniel Butierez in the special general election in September. While the seat is not expected to shift party control of the House, it is one of three vacancies that will likely narrow the slim Republican majority.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents Certificates of Deposit (CDs) as a viable option for savers looking to protect their money's buying power against inflation, with top accounts offering rates higher than the current inflation level. The report notes a significant difference between national average CD yields and the more competitive rates offered primarily by online banks. It also explains the phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently provide higher returns than long-term ones. Laddering CDs is suggested as a strategy to capitalize on high short-term rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The influencer industry is facing a significant shift as economic turbulence and recession fears make both audiences and brands more cautious with their spending. Consumers are reportedly pushing back against ostentatious displays of wealth, leading to a decline in trust.

          <p>The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, showed no change in June, contrary to economists' expectations of a 0.2% increase. This flat reading, which follows a consumer inflation report showing a modest rise, suggests that recently imposed tariffs have had only a marginal impact on prices so far. While the overall index was flat, final demand goods prices rose 0.3%, offset by a decline in services. The data provides a mixed signal for the Federal Reserve, which remains cautious about the potential inflationary effects of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Professional cycling teams at the 2025 Tour de France are increasingly incorporating heat training to boost rider performance. This method involves deliberately raising an athlete's core body temperature to a feverish state, either actively by wearing heavy clothing during exercise or passively through saunas. Sports scientists claim this stressor is highly effective, potentially more so than altitude training, as it can increase blood volume and improve oxygen delivery to muscles. This trend, once considered unconventional, is now a mainstream strategy for gaining a competitive edge in elite endurance sports.</p>
