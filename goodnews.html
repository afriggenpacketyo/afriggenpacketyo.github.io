          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 9-5 victory against the Colorado Rockies, allowing them to split the four-game series at Coors Field. The offense was productive early, with Freddie Freeman hitting a two-run homer in the first inning, and the team scored in each of the first five innings. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw earned his eighth win of the season, despite giving up a few runs over five and two-thirds innings. This win provides the Dodgers with needed momentum as they head to San Diego for a crucial series against the second-place Padres.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the nearly half-billion-dollar penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial, ruling the amount was excessive. While the court upheld the finding that Trump was liable for fraud, it determined the massive fine likely violated constitutional protections against severe punishments. The ruling keeps non-monetary penalties in place, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in the state for three years. The New York Attorney General's office plans to appeal the financial aspect of the decision to the state's highest court.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are considering the first revision to the country's 1998 pricing law in an effort to combat "involution," a term for destructive internal competition marked by aggressive price wars. The proposed amendment targets industries like solar panel manufacturing, which has been suffering from severe oversupply and loss-making sales due to intense price slashing. The goal is to regulate pricing and prevent companies from selling products below cost, aiming to establish a more sustainable and stable market equilibrium across various economic sectors.

          <p>Crystal Palace achieved a historic 1-0 victory over Fredrikstad in the Uefa Conference League, marking the club's first-ever win in a European competition. The celebratory atmosphere at Selhurst Park was bittersweet, however, as star midfielder Eberechi Eze was absent from the squad ahead of an expected transfer to Arsenal. While fans celebrated the on-pitch success, which follows their recent FA Cup and Community Shield trophies, the focus now shifts to how the club will reinvest the transfer fee and strengthen the team before the transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>Enterprise software company Workday reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue growing 13% year-over-year. However, the company's stock dipped in after-hours trading after it issued guidance that was merely in line with estimates and highlighted specific market pressures. CEO Carl Eschenbach warned of challenges related to funding slowdowns for state and local governments and uncertainty in the higher education sector, partly due to the Trump administration's move to shut down the Department of Education.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has started moving northeast into the Atlantic, away from the North Carolina coastline. Although the storm is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., it brought tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks and generated life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the East Coast. Storm surge warnings and evacuation orders remain in effect for parts of North Carolina, as officials caution that dangerous coastal conditions will persist for several days even as the storm's center moves further out to sea.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining popularity among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. The method involves exchanging stocks from a taxable portfolio for shares in a new or existing exchange-traded fund (ETF), a transaction that is not immediately taxable. While the strategy can be highly effective, it is subject to strict diversification rules and can result in investors being "stuck" in a specific ETF, limiting future flexibility.

          <p>Newly released public records reveal that during immigration raids in Los Angeles, the U.S. military identified specific hotels for federal agents to avoid due to "harassment" from protesters. Community activists had organized demonstrations, some lasting through the night, at hotels where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were staying, pressuring the establishments to evict them. The documents, which show military officials tracking the protests, suggest the community-led actions were successful in disrupting the logistics of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the city.</p>
