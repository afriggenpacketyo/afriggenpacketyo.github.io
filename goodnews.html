        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that deporting noncitizens to Libya without due process would violate his existing court order. This decision came after reports that the White House considered such plans, prompting lawyers for a group of migrants to file an emergency motion to prevent deportations to Libya or Saudi Arabia. Judge Murphy clarified that any imminent removals to these countries would defy his previous preliminary injunction, which barred the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens to any country other than their origin without due process. The judge cited Libya's dangerous conditions, including crime, terrorism, and armed conflict, making deportations there a violation of the court's order.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, an advocate of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s health agenda, to be the next U.S. Surgeon General. Means, who replaces the withdrawn Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, is known for her "MAHA" credentials, referring to Kennedy's "Make America Healthy Again" slogan. She co-founded Levels, a health app, and has criticized the food and drug industries, aligning with Kennedy's views on lifestyle choices and health conditions. While supported by Kennedy's allies, some within his anti-vaccine base express concern over Means' stance on mRNA vaccines. Means has previously voiced support for vaccine safety and questioned the current vaccine schedule, potentially causing health declines in children.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is predicted to reenter Earth's atmosphere imminently. The spacecraft, intended for a Venus mission, failed to leave Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction and has been gradually losing altitude. Experts estimate the half-ton object could land anywhere between 52 degrees north and south latitude, encompassing a vast area including parts of the United States, South America, Africa, and Europe. While the risk of impact is low, the possibility of the spacecraft, built to withstand Venus's atmosphere, surviving reentry raises concerns about a metal object falling from the sky.</p>

Simo, who previously served on OpenAI's board, will assume the title of CEO of Applications, overseeing business and operational teams to scale the company's research efforts. This move comes shortly after OpenAI restructured into a public benefit corporation, retaining nonprofit control. Simo will remain CEO of Instacart for a few months before transitioning to chair.

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party has secured enough seats to form a minority government in Canada, falling short of a majority in the recent election. Carney will remain Prime Minister, succeeding Justin Trudeau earlier this year. Key rivals, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, both lost their seats. The Liberals won 168 seats, requiring 172 for a majority, while the Conservatives secured 144 seats. Increased support for the two largest parties came at the expense of smaller parties, particularly the NDP. The Liberals hold the most seats in Ontario and Quebec, while the Conservatives dominate Alberta.</p>

          <p>A Standard Chartered analyst, Geoffrey Kendrick, has apologized for his previous prediction that Bitcoin would reach $120,000 by the second quarter of 2025, stating that the target now seems "too low." Kendrick attributes this revised outlook to changing market dynamics, with flows becoming the dominant factor driving Bitcoin's price. He notes significant inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and increasing allocation to Bitcoin by large investors. Bitcoin's price is currently approaching $100,000, supported by institutional money piling in. Kendrick, who has long been bullish on Bitcoin, suggests his earlier forecast may have underestimated the cryptocurrency's potential.</p>

He suggested that increased new car prices could potentially benefit used car sales. Carvana's first-quarter sales rose 46% year-over-year, with net income reaching $373 million and adjusted EBITDA at $488 million.

          <p>Bill Gates has pledged to donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045. This donation is among the largest philanthropic gifts ever, estimated at $107 billion. The pledge will allow the foundation to spend an additional $200 billion over the next 20 years, primarily on global health and education. Gates cited the impact of the foundation's work and the need to address global challenges as reasons for the decision. He says spending down his fortune will help save and improve many lives now, which will have positive ripple effects well beyond the foundation's closure.</p>

          <p>Britain is set to announce a trade deal with the United States, which could help some sectors and boost confidence among consumers and businesses. The deal aims to mitigate the impact of recent increases in U.S. tariffs. However, the British economy faces other challenges, including the global economy lurching from one crisis to another. While the U.S. is an important trading partner, trade flows are heavily skewed toward services, which were not affected by higher tariffs. The Bank of England cut interest rates a quarter point to 4.25 percent, partly influenced by trade uncertainty.</p>
