          <p>Actress Winona Ryder recently shared a personal anecdote about her admiration for fellow actor Christopher Walken, revealing she has kept the wishbone from a rotisserie chicken he once gave her. She also reminisced about having a significant crush on Al Pacino during her early twenties while they were working together. Ryder recounted a time she directly confessed her feelings to Pacino, who gently let her down. The actress, now happily with her partner Scott Mackinlay Hahn, shared these stories in a recent interview, offering a glimpse into her experiences in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Venus Williams, at 45 years old, was defeated by Magdalena Frech in the DC Open, ending her attempt to secure her first back-to-back tour wins since 2019. This loss followed a significant victory earlier in the week, where she became the oldest woman to win a tour-level singles match since 2004. Williams had recently returned to the sport after a long absence due to surgery for uterine fibroids. Despite the loss, she received a standing ovation from the crowd, acknowledging her enduring presence and impact on the sport.</p>

          <p>The D.C. city council chairman has announced a new stadium agreement with the Washington Commanders, moving forward despite President Trump's recent threat to block any deal unless the team reverts to its former name. The deal, which involves redeveloping the RFK Stadium site, reportedly offers significant revenue benefits to the district. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson expressed confidence that the proposal will pass an upcoming vote, characterizing the president's comments as an unhelpful distraction. The agreement marks a key step in the NFL team's potential return to the city.</p>

          <p>When automated systems at the U.S. Postal Service cannot read an address due to poor handwriting, the mail is not returned to sender but instead sent electronically to a specialized facility in Salt Lake City. At this Remote Encoding Center, hundreds of "data conversion operators" work around the clock to decipher millions of hard-to-read addresses each day. These employees can process around 900 pieces of mail per hour, ensuring that even the most illegibly addressed letters and packages reach their intended destinations. This operation highlights a crucial human element within the national mail system.</p>

          <p>The 2026 U.S. Senate race in North Carolina is taking shape, with sources indicating that Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley and former Democratic Governor Roy Cooper are both preparing to run. Whatley's potential candidacy has reportedly received a blessing from the White House, with President Trump endorsing him should he enter. The announcements are expected in the coming days for the seat being vacated by Republican Senator Thom Tillis. This sets the stage for a high-profile and competitive battleground contest in the next election cycle.</p>

          <p>A 41-year-old employee at a Chuck E. Cheese in Tallahassee, Florida, was arrested while dressed as the chain's mouse mascot in connection with a debit card theft. Police were called after a customer, whose card was stolen weeks earlier, identified the employee from security footage at other locations where the card was used. The officer detained the suspect by telling him, "Chuck E, come with me," and escorted him out in handcuffs. The stolen debit card was allegedly found in the employee's pocket inside the costume.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at creating new federal rules for the evolving landscape of college sports, particularly regarding name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals. The order seeks to ban "pay-for-play" payments while allowing brand endorsements, and it directs that revenue-sharing arrangements must preserve opportunities in women's and non-revenue sports. It also instructs the National Labor Relations Board to clarify the employment status of college athletes. The move attempts to impose federal guardrails on what the White House described as an "out-of-control, rudderless system."</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has launched a new program to deliver food, groceries, and medicine to immigrant parishioners who are afraid to leave their homes due to ongoing immigration raids. The initiative aims to support vulnerable members of its community who fear being arrested and deported. Archbishop José Gomez stated that many "good, hard-working" people are now too scared to go to work or be seen in public. The program, which has already received significant donations, builds on infrastructure developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to serve homebound individuals.</p>

          <p>Four traders convicted of manipulating the Libor inter-bank lending rate are now appealing to have their convictions overturned. This move follows a landmark UK Supreme Court decision that quashed the similar convictions of two other traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo. The court's ruling has opened the door for these new appeals. The original convictions stemmed from a large-scale investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into the Libor scandal, which was a central issue during the 2008 financial crisis. The SFO has declined to seek a retrial in the other cases.</p>

These figures are appearing on a diverse range of podcasts and shows, seemingly in an effort to reach new audiences and differentiate themselves after the party's 2024 loss. The article notes a rhetorical shift, with some candidates taking more moderate or centrist positions on cultural issues. This early maneuvering indicates that potential contenders are not wasting time in a party now facing a leadership vacuum.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer stated that major technology companies are not overspending on artificial intelligence but are, in fact, underspending. He argues that the AI race is a "winner-take-all" situation, and companies must invest heavily to secure a dominant position, pointing to Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditures as justification. While acknowledging skepticism due to current chatbot inaccuracies, Cramer believes the technology will improve and that the company with the most accurate AI could achieve a near-monopoly.

          <p>As regulators, particularly the US FDA, move to ban or phase out artificial food colorings like Red Dye No. 3, companies are accelerating their search for natural alternatives. Firms are exploring sources like microalgae and specially grown vegetables to create stable, vibrant pigments that can replace synthetic dyes in food and drinks. While natural colors can be more expensive and present challenges in stability and vividness, major food giants like Kellogg's and Nestlé have pledged to reformulate their products. This shift reflects growing consumer and regulatory pressure to remove synthetic chemicals from the food supply.</p>
