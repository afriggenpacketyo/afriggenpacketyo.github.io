          <p>Financial planners suggest keeping some cash in your wallet to handle situations where digital payments are not possible, such as power outages or vendor minimums. According to a Federal Reserve survey, Americans carry an average of $67 in their wallet, though cash usage has slightly decreased. Experts recommend carrying between $50 to $100 for typical expenses like gas, food, or parking, while others emphasize the importance of cash during tech failures or emergencies. One financial advisor now carries a couple hundred dollars after his credit card was declined due to suspected fraud.</p>

Additionally, a sentence regarding Chinese investment in a special economic zone on disputed islands claimed by Japan was removed.
