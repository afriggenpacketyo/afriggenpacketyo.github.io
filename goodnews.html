          <p>DoorDash announced its acquisition of restaurant booking platform SevenRooms for $1.2 billion in an all-cash deal, expected to close in the second half of 2025. The company also reported first-quarter revenue of $3.03 billion, which fell short of the expected $3.09 billion. Despite the revenue miss, DoorDash highlighted strong consumer demand and engagement across its marketplaces. The company also stated that they have agreed to a deal with Deliveroo worth $3.9 billion, which will expand their ability to build world class services that increase their potential to grow local commerce and support their financial goals.</p>

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% jump in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles. However, the company warned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU cars could negatively impact its profitability this year. Ferrari had previously announced a 10% price increase on certain models in response to the tariffs. The automaker said that the 2025 guidance is subject to a potential risk of 50 basis points reduction on profitability percentage margins in relation to the update of the commercial policy following the introduction of import tariffs on EU cars into the USA.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has declared she will challenge the UK government, led by Keir Starmer, when its policies negatively impact Wales, prioritizing the nation's interests over party loyalty. Morgan highlighted potential harm from cuts to disability benefits and winter fuel allowance, advocating for Wales to benefit more from wind power revenues. She also called for changes to the Barnett formula, which determines funding for Wales, and demanded Wales be prioritized for rail investment. Morgan emphasized that her approach is not a split, but a form of responsible governance, and criticized Reform UK and Plaid Cymru.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Met Gala, with the theme "Tailored for You," celebrated Black style and the history of dandyism, coinciding with the Costume Institute's exhibition, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style." The event explored the influence of Black identity on fashion, highlighting Black designers and their contributions. The exhibition was inspired by Monica L. Miller's book, "Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity." Dandyism is a discipline, and a lot of the times it shows up in tailored clothes, but it's not only people who wear suits, it's become more casual and I think just more free and fluid.</p>

          <h2>Prices Fall for Airfare, Produce, and TVs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 06:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Although inflation remains above policymakers' target, prices have fallen for some consumer goods. Consumers are seeing lower prices for airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline. Economists attribute these declines to idiosyncratic factors, supply and demand dynamics, and seasonal effects. However, economists warn that tariffs threaten to roil the picture and put upward pressure on many consumer prices, and that these lower prices may not last.</p>
