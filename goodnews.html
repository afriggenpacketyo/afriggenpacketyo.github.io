          <p>China is actively engaging in party diplomacy, particularly with communist parties, as demonstrated by President Xi Jinping's recent meetings with leaders from the remaining communist countries. The Communist Party’s International Department plays a crucial role in these interactions, fostering connections with over 600 parties globally. This department has become a key diplomatic channel for China, facilitating increased engagement with regions like the Middle East. While China isn't aiming to promote a communist international movement like the Soviet Union, party-to-party relations remain a significant component of its diplomatic strategy.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic, despite his age, expresses his desire to continue competing in Grand Slams, although his body is posing challenges. After a semi-final defeat at the US Open, Djokovic acknowledges the difficulty of overcoming younger rivals like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner in Grand Slam events. While he plans to keep fighting for trophies, Djokovic recognizes the physical toll of best-of-five matches against these top players, and his scaled-down schedule reflects his focus on major tournaments. He remains a top player, but Father Time is catching up, requiring him to adapt his game.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan and Haitian migrants is unlawful. The ruling allows approximately 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians to continue living and working legally in the U.S., but the DHS has indicated it will appeal the decision. The judge stated that revoking their protected status was unprecedented and violated the law, given the dangerous conditions in their home countries. This ruling comes after previous legal battles over the TPS program, and it requires the administration to spend funds on projects authorized by Congress.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's yuan has experienced a recent rally primarily driven by stronger guidance from its central bank, rather than market forces, while the US dollar index has remained relatively steady. Analysts believe that this period of strengthening will be measured, as Beijing aims to avoid harming the competitiveness of its exporters amidst trade tensions with the United States. Despite Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinting at a potential interest rate cut, the US dollar index has not shown significant weakening. China's central bank appears to be deliberately pushing up the yuan despite the lack of corresponding movement in currency markets.</p>

          <p>The Garnet fire in the Sierra National Forest is threatening the McKinley grove of giant sequoias, prompting efforts to protect the trees. Firefighters are laying down sprinkler lines to keep the fire at a low intensity as it approaches the grove, which contains roughly 200 giant sequoias. The McKinley Grove Road is being used as a major containment feature, with crews conducting strategic burns to reduce fuels, while cooler temperatures and increased humidity are providing some relief. Approximately 20% of the world's mature giant sequoias have been lost in the last decade due to wildfires.</p>

The woman allegedly bragged about the feat on social media, sharing a picture of Maya with an “I Voted” sticker, and the Orange County Registrar of Voters contacted the district attorney’s office after the resident self-reported her actions.</p>

          <p>Prince Hisahito of Japan has reached adulthood, marking the first male royal to do so in 40 years, but he may also be the last due to the monarchy's male-only succession policy. Hisahito is second in line to the throne and will likely become emperor, but after him, there are no other male heirs. This has sparked debate over whether to reverse the ruling that abolished female succession, while Hisahito is a university freshman studying biology and is devoted to dragonflies. The shortage of male successors is a serious concern for the monarchy, reflecting Japan's aging and shrinking population.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has proposed a compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him a trillionaire if the company meets ambitious benchmarks over the next decade. Musk would receive roughly $900 billion if Tesla's value increases from $1.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion and production goals are met, including one million Robotaxis and humanoid robots. The proposal requires shareholder approval and aims to retain Musk's focus on Tesla, while his previous pay package remains in legal limbo after being struck down by a Delaware judge.</p>
