          <h2>Psychology Expert Outlines Five Principles for Achieving Happiness Without Great Wealth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 11:51:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing from his book, "The Art of Spending Money," author Morgan Housel outlines five psychological rules for finding happiness that do not depend on high income. He argues that true contentment comes from appreciating the ordinary, managing expectations, and desiring less, rather than constantly pursuing more wealth. Housel illustrates this by contrasting the contentment of his low-income grandmother-in-law with the dissatisfaction of billionaires he has met. The central idea is that happiness is found when nothing feels missing, regardless of one's material lifestyle.</p>

          <p>Tesla has released a new version of its Full Self-Driving supervised technology, but the announcement has been overshadowed by investor anticipation for a more significant reveal. The company teased a major announcement with cryptic social media clips, leading to speculation about a new, lower-cost Model Y or an update on the long-promised next-generation Roadster. This comes as Tesla, facing a multi-quarter sales slump and increased competition, attempts to refocus investor attention on its future as a robotics and autonomous driving company. The anticipation caused Tesla shares to climb 5%.</p>

          <p>The World Trade Organization has significantly increased its forecast for global trade growth in 2025 to 2.4%, up from a previous estimate of 0.9%. This robust expansion is attributed to strong demand for AI-related goods like semiconductors, as well as favorable macroeconomic conditions in major economies. However, the outlook for the following year is less optimistic, with the WTO slashing its 2026 growth forecast to just 0.5%. The anticipated slowdown is due to the cooling global economy and the full impact of higher trade tariffs being felt across markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center has announced the formation of Tropical Storm Jerry over the central Atlantic Ocean, making it the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. At the time of the announcement, the storm was located over 1,300 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands and posed no immediate threat to land. With maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, Jerry is tracking westward across open waters. Forecasters indicated that tropical storm watches might be issued for the northern Leeward Islands as the system progresses.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club is purchasing additional shares of GE Vernova, citing a strong conviction in the long-term demand for AI infrastructure. The article highlights that the power equipment maker is well-positioned to benefit from the massive energy requirements of new AI data centers being developed by companies like OpenAI. Despite expected softness in GE Vernova's onshore wind business, the analysis suggests this has already been priced into the stock. The move reflects a bullish outlook on the company's role in powering the artificial intelligence revolution. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The estate of Michael Bond and the producers of the Paddington films are suing Avalon, the company behind the satirical show "Spitting Image." The lawsuit, filed in the High Court, cites copyright concerns over the show's depiction of the beloved children's character. In a YouTube series, "Spitting Image" portrayed Paddington Bear as a foul-mouthed podcast host who swears, advertises guns, and admits to drug use. This crude parody is a stark departure from the gentle, well-mannered bear known to generations of fans, prompting the legal action to protect the character's integrity.</p>

          <p>Facing a desperate shortage of soldiers, Ukraine is reorienting its military strategy to fight a long-term war of attrition against Russia. This article details how Ukrainian commanders are leveraging technology, particularly drones, to minimize direct contact and reduce casualties. The new approach also involves more precise artillery use, better troop rotation plans, and innovative uses of ground robots for resupply and evacuation. This shift reflects a growing confidence that Ukraine can inflict steady losses on the enemy while conserving its own limited manpower, potentially turning the tide in the protracted conflict.</p>

Speaking at an economic forum, Dalio argued that gold is an excellent diversifier that performs well when traditional assets like stocks and bonds decline. He compared the current economic environment of high debt and government spending to the early 1970s, suggesting that fiat currencies are not an effective store of wealth in such conditions.

          <p>With the S&P 500 continuing to set record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to look beyond the popular index to ensure proper diversification. The article notes that the market capitalization-weighted nature of the S&P 500 gives it a heavy concentration in a few large technology companies, which can increase portfolio risk. To mitigate this, advisors suggest alternatives like total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or equal-weighted S&P 500 funds. This approach aims to create a more balanced portfolio in case of a market pullback. (not investment advice)</p>

The new carrier-based aircraft is designed to replace the aging F/A-18 Super Hornet fleet and is considered central to U.S. efforts to counter China's growing military capabilities.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data reveals a clear trend of startups staying private for longer before going public, with the median age for an IPO now at 13 years, up from 10 in 2018. This shift is largely attributed to the massive growth in alternative capital from private equity, venture capital, and sovereign wealth funds. This abundance of private funding allows companies to mature and raise substantial capital without the regulatory burdens and short-term pressures of being publicly traded. As a result, companies are much larger and have higher revenues by the time they eventually enter the public markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An unusual number of ladybirds have been reported swarming in and around UK homes, a phenomenon experts say is normal for this time of year. The recent spell of warm, sunny weather has prompted the insects to become active and seek out sheltered spots to enter diapause, a form of winter hibernation. Many of these ladybirds are the invasive harlequin species, which often prefers to shelter inside buildings. The surge in their population is also linked to the warm spring and summer, which led to a boom in aphids, their primary food source.</p>
