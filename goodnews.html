          <p>Shares of design software company Figma jumped 7% after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman showcased its integration with ChatGPT at the annual DevDay conference. Altman demonstrated how users could verbally instruct ChatGPT to create a workable diagram within Figma, streamlining the design process. The integration will allow ChatGPT to suggest using Figma when relevant and enables users to access the tool without leaving the chat interface. This partnership highlights the growing trend of embedding generative AI capabilities into established software platforms to enhance functionality and user experience.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates, savers are evaluating the best place for their money between certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. A comparison shows that for a $10,000 deposit, earnings are currently very similar over terms ranging from three to twelve months. However, CDs offer a fixed interest rate, guaranteeing the return, whereas the variable rate on a high-yield savings account is likely to decrease with future Fed cuts. The article suggests that while both options are far superior to traditional savings accounts, the guaranteed return of a CD may be more appealing in a falling-rate environment.

          <p>As the Federal Reserve implements interest rate cuts, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is becoming a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For a $150,000 HELOC, current monthly payments are estimated to be around $1,811 for a 10-year repayment period and $1,424 for a 15-year period. These costs are notably lower than they were a year ago, and they are expected to decrease further with anticipated future rate cuts due to the variable nature of HELOC rates. The article notes that homeowners only make payments on the amount they actually draw from the credit line, offering flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paramount has announced its acquisition of The Free Press, a news site co-founded by Bari Weiss, and has appointed Weiss as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. Weiss is a prominent journalist known for her vocal criticism of legacy media and left-leaning culture, which she articulated in a widely publicized resignation from The New York Times in 2020. The move is seen as a significant effort by CBS News's parent company to broaden its ideological diversity and appeal to a wider audience. In her new role, Weiss will shape the editorial direction of the network's flagship programs while The Free Press continues to operate under its own brand.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors considering a reverse mortgage to supplement retirement income, lenders typically require homeowners to have at least 50% to 60% equity in their property. This means the outstanding mortgage balance should not exceed half of the home's appraised value. The actual amount a senior can borrow is not the full equity amount but is instead calculated based on the borrower's age, current interest rates, and federal lending limits. If a homeowner falls short of the required equity, options include paying down the existing mortgage, waiting for the property value to appreciate further, or exploring alternative financing solutions like a home equity loan.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal of her conviction for sex-trafficking, upholding her 20-year prison sentence. The court declined to hear the case without providing an explanation, exhausting one of Maxwell's key legal avenues for overturning the verdict. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for abuse by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. Her legal team expressed deep disappointment but stated they would continue to explore other options to challenge the conviction. Maxwell was recently moved to a minimum-security prison facility in Texas.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has found Ali Muhammad Ali Abd–Al-Rahman, a leader of Sudan's Janjaweed militia, guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Darfur. This is the court's first conviction related to the genocide in the region, which began over 20 years ago. Abd–Al-Rahman was convicted on 27 counts for his role in mass killings, sexual violence, and torture carried out between 2003 and 2004 as part of a government-backed campaign to suppress a rebellion. The verdict is a landmark moment for international justice, though arrest warrants for other Sudanese officials, including former president Omar al-Bashir, remain outstanding.</p>

          <p>For over 60 years, the Bread and Puppet Theater has been a fixture of American radical political performance, known for its giant puppets at anti-war protests and its annual touring circus. Founded in 1963 by Peter Schumann, who still directs the troupe at age 91, the theater blends medieval traveling play traditions with contemporary political satire. The current show addresses topics from labor unions to the war in Ukraine and is staunchly pro-Palestinian. Despite facing some audience walkouts and growing concerns about free expression, the performers remain committed to their ethos of anti-capitalism and using art to make revolution "irresistible."</p>

          <p>In a Netflix interview recorded before her death, renowned primatologist Jane Goodall humorously stated she would like to put Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and other world leaders on a one-way trip into space. Goodall, who died last week at 91, compared the behavior of certain alpha male humans to that of chimpanzees competing for dominance through aggression. She identified Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu as other figures she would include on the spaceship, with Musk serving as the host. The interview provides a final glimpse into her sharp wit and critical perspective on human politics and behavior, shaped by a lifetime of scientific observation.</p>
