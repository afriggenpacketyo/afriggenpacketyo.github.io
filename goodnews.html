        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dietitians are highlighting a common breakfast mistake that leads to afternoon cravings for sugary snacks: consuming low-protein, high-carbohydrate meals in the morning. Foods like pastries and sugary cereals cause blood sugar spikes and subsequent energy crashes, leaving people feeling hungry again quickly. Experts recommend starting the day with 20 to 30 grams of protein, which aids in satiety, mood regulation, and sustained energy levels throughout the day. Simple additions like beans, hemp seeds, or Greek yogurt can significantly boost protein intake and help manage appetite.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, has successfully raised $10 billion through a combination of debt and equity, according to Morgan Stanley. The new capital will be used to expand the company's infrastructure, including its Colossus supercomputer, and further develop its AI chatbot, Grok. This significant funding round intensifies the competition in the AI sector, positioning xAI to better challenge industry leaders like OpenAI and Anthropic. Musk aims to differentiate Grok as a "maximally truth-seeking" and "anti-woke" AI, integrating it with the X social media platform.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over its impact on the federal deficit, some major banks view President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" as a potential positive for the U.S. economy in the near term. Analysts from institutions like Nomura and Citi suggest that by extending the expiring 2017 tax cuts, the legislation would prevent a significant fiscal contraction and could stimulate business investment. However, critics, including the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, warn that the bill is fiscally irresponsible, projecting it will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt. The American Bankers Association has expressed strong support for the tax relief provisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robinhood has expanded its cryptocurrency offerings in the European Union, notably introducing tokenized shares of private companies, including OpenAI and SpaceX. This move, which caused Robinhood's stock to hit an all-time high, allows European users to trade fractional shares of these unlisted companies 24/5 with no commission. The initiative marks a significant step in making private equity more accessible to retail investors, a goal facilitated by the EU's more flexible regulatory environment compared to the U.S. The company also launched crypto staking for Ethereum and Solana domestically for its American users.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has voted 99-1 to remove a controversial provision from a major Republican spending bill that would have prevented states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade. The measure faced strong bipartisan opposition from state officials and governors, who argued it was a gift to the tech industry that would hinder their ability to protect citizens from AI-related harms. Proponents of the moratorium had claimed that a patchwork of state laws could stifle innovation and U.S. competitiveness with China. The removal of the provision marks a significant victory for states' rights and advocates for AI safety.</p>

          <p>Amidst an uncertain global landscape, Chinese President Xi Jinping has emphasized the strategic importance of developing a "unified national market" to bolster the nation's economy. During a high-profile economic meeting, leaders stressed the need to better integrate domestic and foreign trade and support firms that can transition from export-oriented production to serving internal demand. The policy aims to make China's economy more resilient by prioritizing domestic consumption and standardizing regulations for businesses across the country. This focus reflects a strategic pivot to rely more on internal strength as external economic pressures and geopolitical tensions continue to rise.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer spending on most luxury goods fell in the first five months of 2025, but the jewelry category has proven to be a resilient bright spot, according to a Citigroup report. While spending on items like handbags and ready-to-wear clothing has faltered, luxury jewelry sales have consistently increased, surging 10.1% year-over-year in May. Analysts suggest this outperformance is driven by the perception of jewelry as a tangible investment, its sentimental value, and the recent run-up in gold prices. In contrast, other luxury categories have struggled, facing challenges from significant price hikes without corresponding increases in product innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

One of the most significant schemes, allegedly run by a transnational criminal organization from Eastern Europe, used stolen American identities to submit over $10 billion in fraudulent claims to Medicare.

          <p>As extreme heat becomes more common, it is crucial to understand the difference between heat exhaustion and the more dangerous heat stroke. Heat exhaustion presents with symptoms like headache, heavy sweating, and dizziness, and can be treated by moving to a cool place and rehydrating. However, if left untreated, it can progress to heat stroke, a life-threatening condition where the body's temperature regulation fails and sweat production stops. Heat stroke requires immediate emergency medical attention, and first aid involves cooling the person's body as quickly as possible while waiting for help to arrive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-forgotten novel written in 1932 by the acclaimed German journalist and historian Sebastian Haffner has become a bestseller nearly a quarter-century after his death. Titled "Parting," the autobiographical love story was penned when Haffner was a 24-year-old law trainee in Berlin, just as the Nazi party was rising to power. The manuscript was discovered by his son in 1999 but was only recently published, topping German bestseller lists within a week. The novel captures a final moment of hope and youthful freedom in the Weimar Republic, offering a lighter counterpoint to Haffner's later, somber historical analyses.</p>

By using reverse image search and verifying coordinates on Google Maps, the fact-check confirms the location is in Iran, not Israel.
