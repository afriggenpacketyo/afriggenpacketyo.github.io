          <p>OpenAI announced that its ChatGPT platform is projected to reach 700 million weekly active users, a fourfold increase year-over-year. This rapid expansion is accompanied by significant financial momentum, with the company securing $8.3 billion in new investments and annual recurring revenue hitting $13 billion. To support this growth, OpenAI is making massive investments in AI infrastructure, including a $500 billion joint venture and major data center deals with partners like Oracle and G42. The surge in users and capital highlights the intense competition and investor confidence in the burgeoning AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The company, which develops rockets and lunar landers, has seen significant revenue growth, though its net losses have also increased. The move follows a trend of space-tech companies testing public markets amid high-profile successes from competitors like SpaceX. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell by 23% on Monday, a significant drop after its stock more than tripled on its first day of trading last week. The company had a successful initial public offering, raising around $412 million, which signaled renewed investor appetite for high-growth tech companies. Despite the recent decline, Figma's valuation remains significantly higher than the price Adobe had offered in a failed 2022 acquisition attempt. The company has demonstrated strong revenue growth and, unlike many recent tech IPOs, has a history of profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision, rooted in Ireland's own history of colonization, has been hailed by Palestinian diplomats as significant progress.

          <p>The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence has created an unexpected bottleneck in the power supply, placing GE Vernova at the center of the AI revolution. The company, a major producer of gas-fired turbines, is seeing record-breaking orders as tech giants race to build energy-intensive data centers. This surge in demand has led to a financial windfall for GE Vernova, with its stock doubling this year, and its manufacturing capacity is largely sold out for years to come. The situation highlights how the AI buildout is fundamentally reshaping demand in traditional industries like energy and manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dame Stella Rimington, the first woman to serve as director general of the British security service MI5, has passed away at the age of 90. She led the agency from 1992 to 1996, a period during which the identity of the head of MI5 was made public for the first time. Her groundbreaking role and public profile were widely believed to have inspired the character of "M," played by Dame Judi Dench, in the James Bond film series. After joining MI5 in 1969, she rose through the ranks to break one of the highest glass ceilings in the intelligence community.</p>

          <p>After a decade of investigation, scientists have identified the cause of a mysterious wasting disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. The culprit is a bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, which was found in the bodily fluid of infected sea stars. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species, with the sunflower sea star population declining by 90%, leading to ecological imbalances like the explosion of sea urchin populations. This discovery offers hope for developing interventions to help the critically endangered sea star populations recover.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month delay on its retaliatory tariffs against U.S. goods, which were scheduled to take effect this week. This suspension provides time for both sides to implement the broader trade agreement reached in late July between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Trump. An EU spokesperson stated the move is intended to restore stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The underlying deal includes a 15% tariff on most EU goods but is still being finalized, with this delay seen as a key step in the ongoing negotiations.</p>

          <p>A new clinical trial has found that people lost twice as much weight on a diet of minimally processed foods compared to a diet of ultraprocessed foods, even when the latter met official nutritional guidelines. Over an eight-week period, participants on the minimally processed diet naturally consumed fewer calories and lost more weight and body fat. This was the largest and longest randomized controlled trial on the topic to date. The findings suggest that the level of food processing itself, beyond just nutritional content, plays a significant role in calorie consumption and weight management.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains the "60% reverse mortgage rule," a key regulation for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs) that can significantly impact seniors tapping into their home equity. This FHA rule limits borrowers to withdrawing no more than 60% of their total loan proceeds during the first year, unless a larger amount is needed to pay off mandatory obligations like an existing mortgage. While designed to prevent homeowners from depleting their equity too quickly, this restriction can pose challenges for those needing a larger lump sum for immediate expenses. It encourages long-term financial planning but may make reverse mortgages less suitable for some borrowers' needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Josh Brolin is making his debut in the horror genre with the new film "Weapons," where he plays a father searching for answers after his child and others mysteriously disappear. Brolin described the role as a creative challenge and an opportunity to confront themes of masculinity, as his character grapples with the loss of control and the inability to express affection. Despite his extensive career in blockbuster films like "Dune" and the "Avengers" series, Brolin said he was drawn to the project because he was unsure if he could perform in the genre. The film is set to open in theaters on Friday.</p>
