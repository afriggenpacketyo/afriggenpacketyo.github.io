        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the approximately $527 million financial penalty against former President Trump in his civil fraud case, deeming the fine "excessive" and a violation of the Eighth Amendment. While the massive disgorgement was vacated, the court upheld other sanctions, including a three-year ban on Trump serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation. New York Attorney General Letitia James has announced her office will appeal the decision to the state's highest court, emphasizing that the ruling still affirmed that Trump had violated the law.</p>

          <p>Chipotle has launched an autonomous drone delivery service, named "Zipotle," in the Dallas, Texas area through a partnership with logistics provider Zipline. The service uses small aircraft called Zips to deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes within minutes, aiming to keep food fresh and serve hard-to-reach locations like backyards. Initially available to a small number of customers from one location in Rowlett, the service will expand in the coming weeks. The drones hover at 300 feet and gently lower the order to the ground, with a current weight capacity of 5.5 pounds.</p>

          <p>The Trent Rockets defeated the Oval Invincibles by six wickets in The Hundred women's cricket tournament, keeping their slim chances of qualification alive. Despite a mid-innings wobble while chasing a modest target of 110, the Rockets reached their goal with 16 balls remaining, thanks to a composed unbeaten 19 from Heather Graham. Earlier, the Invincibles struggled to build momentum, with former Australian captain Meg Lanning's 45 being the standout performance in their total of 109-7. Both teams now face a difficult path, needing to win their remaining games and rely on other results to advance.</p>

          <p>The performance group Lucha VaVoom de La Liz is bidding farewell to its longtime home, the Mayan theater in downtown Los Angeles, which is permanently closing after 35 years. The troupe, known for its unique blend of Mexican lucha libre wrestling and burlesque, will hold its final show, titled "The Good, the Bad and the Fabulous," at the historic venue. The Mayan's president cited an "unrelenting barrage of adversity" over the past five years as the reason for the closure. While the performers and fans express sadness over leaving the venue, Lucha VaVoom plans to continue its shows at a new location.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With certificate of deposit (CD) rates remaining elevated, savers can still secure attractive returns on their cash reserves without market risk. A $25,000 deposit could yield varied returns depending on the term length; for example, a 1-year CD at 4.30% would earn approximately $1,075, while a 5-year CD at 4.20% could generate around $5,250. While shorter terms offer more liquidity, longer terms provide higher overall earnings and protection against potential future rate drops. This makes CDs a compelling option for predictable, guaranteed growth on funds that are not needed immediately. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July, defying expectations of a decline and reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units. This uptick is attributed to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory increased by 15.7% from the previous year, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price saw a minimal 0.2% annual increase, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point toward greater affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new photo essay examines the complex emotional landscape of "empty nesters," parents whose children have grown up and moved out. The project documents various households in Los Angeles County, revealing that the experience is far from uniform and often involves a mix of grief, relief, and reinvention. For some, the departure brings a profound sense of loss, while for others it marks a period of rediscovered autonomy and a chance to redefine their identities and relationships. The essay also highlights the modern fluidity of the empty nest, with many adult children returning home, creating a state of perpetual flux for their parents.</p>

          <h2>The Concept of 'Moral Offsetting' for Meat Consumption Gains Traction Through Charity Fundraiser</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent fundraiser for anti-factory farming charities, amplified by podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, has raised over $2 million and highlighted the concept of "moral offsetting." The idea, promoted by the organization FarmKind, suggests that individuals who feel guilty about eating meat but are unwilling to go vegan can offset the harm by donating to effective animal advocacy groups. This approach frames donations as a pragmatic way to reduce animal suffering, similar to how carbon offsets work for environmental impact. While it provides a tangible way for people to contribute, critics worry it could absolve consumers of personal responsibility for their dietary choices.</p>

          <p>This article explores five key teachings from the Baha'i faith that can be applied to achieve greater happiness, regardless of one's religious beliefs. These lessons include having faith in the future, viewing suffering as a catalyst for growth, seeking deeper spiritual happiness over fleeting pleasures, and understanding that one's own happiness is tied to making others happy. The author notes that these principles, which emphasize service and virtue, align with findings from social science on well-being. The Baha'i faith, which originated in 19th-century Persia, offers a tested framework for living a positive and meaningful life despite worldly troubles.</p>

          <p>Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed Africa's heavy reliance on imported vaccines, the continent is making gradual progress toward establishing its own manufacturing capabilities. Initiatives are underway in countries like South Africa, Senegal, Kenya, and Rwanda, with BioNTech building mRNA facilities in a flagship project. However, significant hurdles remain, including a lack of infrastructure and funding, with Africa still producing only 0.1% of the world's vaccines. The African Union aims to increase this to 60% by 2040, supported by new funding mechanisms like the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator, but achieving self-sufficiency will be a long-term process.</p>
