          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, narrowly missed earning an automatic spot on the U.S. Junior Ryder Cup team. After entering the final round of the Junior PGA Championship tied for second place, he shot a 74, dropping him into a tie for ninth. The top two finishers secured qualifying spots for the prestigious junior event. Despite strong performances in the second and third rounds, his final-day performance left him four strokes short of the qualifying position needed to represent the United States.</p>

          <p>A mechanical failure caused a tractor-trailer to crash on Interstate 83 in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, ripping open its trailer and spilling its entire cargo of hotdogs across the highway. The incident, which caused minor injuries to four people, led to significant traffic delays during the morning rush hour as cleanup crews worked to clear the slippery franks. The local fire chief noted the unusual challenge of the cleanup, remarking on the surprisingly slick nature of the hotdogs, which were deemed unusable after hitting the warm road.</p>

By offering a faster, more accessible model that gets patients on treatment in a single visit, the clinic serves as a powerful example of how to combat the silent epidemic. With drug costs dropping, policymakers are now considering a bipartisan national plan to eliminate the disease, which could save the government an estimated $7 billion over a decade by treating patients early and effectively.</p>

          <p>ESPN has reportedly reached a deal to acquire several NFL media properties, including the popular NFL Network and RedZone channel, in exchange for giving the league an equity stake in ESPN potentially worth billions. The agreement, which is expected to be announced soon, would also grant ESPN access to more regular-season games and the NFL's fantasy football operations. This major consolidation of sports media assets deepens the existing partnership between the two giants and comes as ESPN prepares to launch its own direct-to-consumer streaming service.</p>

While the unresolved Himalayan border dispute remains a major obstacle, shifting global geopolitics and trade wars are nudging the two Asian powers toward renewed engagement. Experts see potential for cooperation but emphasize the need to overcome a significant trust deficit.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves at the trade deadline to strengthen their roster for the remainder of the season. The team acquired right-handed relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase to reinforce their bullpen and added versatile outfielder Alex Call for lineup depth. Manager Dave Roberts expressed confidence that these additions raise the team's overall floor. The Dodgers are also hopeful that injured rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki can return in late August, serving as another key late-season addition to the pitching staff.</p>

          <p>At an internal town hall meeting, social media giant ByteDance revealed that the median service length for its current employees is 2.9 years. The company, which owns TikTok and its Chinese counterpart Douyin, shared that about half of its 120,000-person workforce has been with the company for over three years. This disclosure appears to counter online speculation about high turnover rates. The figures suggest ByteDance is a relatively attractive employer within China's competitive tech industry, especially after it abandoned the infamous "996" work culture.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Secretary has stated that recent negotiations in Stockholm have advanced talks with China, expressing optimism about reaching a beneficial deal. While the secretary noted the potential for an agreement, the Trump administration has delivered mixed messages and has not yet confirmed any specific consensus. China's vice-minister of commerce indicated that a pause on new tariff increases would be extended, but this has not been officially announced by the U.S. side, leaving the status of the trade relationship in a state of cautious anticipation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who have been living and working legally in the U.S. for years. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the administration's decision was "preordained" and potentially motivated by racial animus, citing statements from the president and the DHS Secretary. The administration has vowed to appeal the ruling.</p>
