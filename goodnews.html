          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index surged to a record high, marking its second consecutive day of gains following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation.  The technology sector led the rally, with significant increases in shares of Advantest, Tokyo Electron, and Renesas Electronics. Analysts attribute the market's positive response to investor anticipation of potential fiscal stimulus under the next LDP leader.  Despite short-term volatility expectations, analysts foresee greater long-term political stability and economic growth, projecting further Nikkei gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study reveals a significant decline in the number of mothers of young children in the US workforce, the steepest drop in over 40 years.  High childcare costs are cited as the primary reason, forcing many mothers to choose between work and childcare responsibilities. Economist Misty Heggeness emphasizes the lack of sufficient policy support for caregivers, highlighting the difficult choices facing working mothers.  One mother shares her personal experience of leaving her job due to the financial burden of childcare.</p>

          <p>A study reveals a significant increase in cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older, attributed to its perceived medicinal benefits and decreasing stigma.  While some seniors report using cannabis for pain management and relaxation, medical professionals caution about potential health risks associated with THC, particularly cardiovascular issues.  Research links cannabis use to increased risks of cardiovascular disease, acute coronary syndrome, and stroke.  Despite these concerns, some seniors believe the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>
