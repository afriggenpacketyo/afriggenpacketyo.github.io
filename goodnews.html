          <p>Pakistan has taken on the rotating one-month presidency of the United Nations Security Council, its first since 2013. The role is largely symbolic but comes at a time of heightened global geopolitical tensions. Pakistan's UN Ambassador, Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, stated his country's commitment to peaceful conflict resolution during this period of increasing threats to international security. It is anticipated that Pakistan may use the platform to raise the issue of its recent conflict with India over the disputed Kashmir territory, a move India is reportedly preparing to counter.</p>

          <p>This opinion article highlights a recent wave of French films that are finally addressing France's history of colonialism and slavery, a topic long considered a blind spot in the nation's cinema. Films like "No Chains No Masters," a biopic on anti-colonial thinker Frantz Fanon, and "Zion," a thriller set in Guadeloupe, are bringing these overdue narratives to the forefront. Despite their critical and public success, particularly in the French Caribbean, the author notes these films receive minimal mainstream media coverage and are often marginalized at major festivals like Cannes, suggesting the industry is not yet fully ready to embrace them.</p>

          <p>China's yuan has reached its strongest level against the US dollar since last November, appreciating over 1.8% in the first half of the year. Analysts attribute this trend to a more resilient Chinese economic outlook than previously feared and growing investor concerns about the sustainability of US government debt. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs are now forecasting that the yuan will continue to strengthen, potentially breaking the key level of 7 per dollar within six months. These projections reflect shifting sentiments in global currency markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid a severe heatwave with temperatures expected to reach 40 degrees Celsius, German education unions are demanding nationwide heat protection regulations for schools. They are calling for measures such as green roofs, shade sails, and free drinking water for all students and staff. Concurrently, German hospitals are requesting additional funding to retrofit clinics with air conditioning to protect vulnerable patients and staff from the effects of climate change. The calls for action highlight the growing challenges public institutions face in adapting to increasingly extreme weather conditions.</p>

          <p>Panelists at CNBC's East Tech West conference emphasized the importance for emerging economies to develop "sovereign AI"‚Äîthe ability to control their own AI technologies, data, and infrastructure. They argued that current prominent AI models are predominantly English-based, creating a need for systems tailored to specific languages and cultures. The experts suggested that using open-source AI models and leveraging cloud computing services can democratize access to the technology. This approach would allow nations, particularly in digitally savvy regions like Southeast Asia, to build their own AI ecosystems and ensure strategic autonomy.</p>

          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers showed unexpected growth in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI. The index rose to 50.4, rebounding from a contraction in May and beating analyst expectations, largely supported by an expansion in production. This result diverges from China's official PMI report, which showed a third consecutive month of contraction, a difference attributed to survey timing and company coverage. Despite the upbeat reading, new export orders declined and business optimism weakened due to fierce market competition and an uncertain external environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law two major bills aimed at accelerating housing construction by reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The legislation, which exempts most urban housing projects from lengthy environmental reviews, was pushed through the legislature after Newsom tied it to the state budget. This move sidestepped opposition from some labor unions and environmental groups, demonstrating the governor's determination to address the state's housing crisis. Development experts believe these are the most significant reforms to CEQA in its 55-year history and could quickly spur new construction.</p>

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some California National Guard troops from their controversial deployment in Los Angeles to help fight wildfires. Gen. Gregory Guillot suggested moving 200 of the 4,000 Guard members to wildfire duty as the state braces for an active fire season. The initial deployment to Los Angeles to handle immigration-related protests was ordered by President Trump over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom.

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Discover How Long-Term Exercise May Slow the Aging Process</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 21:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified a key mechanism explaining how long-term exercise can slow down aging. Their research, published in the journal Cell, found that a naturally occurring compound called betaine, produced in the kidneys during exercise, plays a crucial role. Betaine was shown to prevent inflammation and the aging of multiple organs by inhibiting a specific enzyme. These findings not only provide a deeper understanding of the anti-aging benefits of physical activity but also suggest potential therapeutic strategies that could simulate the effects of exercise.</p>
