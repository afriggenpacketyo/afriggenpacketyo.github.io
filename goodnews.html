          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, has arrived in New Jersey following a federal judge's order for his release from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention in Louisiana. Khalil, a green card holder, was in ICE custody for over 100 days as the Trump administration sought his deportation for his role in Columbia campus protests against Israel. He vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights, stating his speech should be celebrated rather than punished. New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned his detainment as a violation of his First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling struck down a policy change that could have stripped universities of millions of dollars in research funding, which the universities argued threatened critical work in various technology fields. The judge deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The issue revolved around "indirect" costs, such as building maintenance and computer systems, which the Trump administration sought to cap at 15% of direct research costs.</p>

          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type in a woman from Guadeloupe, named "Gwada negative." The discovery was made after researchers received a blood sample from the patient undergoing routine tests. The woman is the only known carrier of this blood type, which was officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion. Scientists hope to find other people with the same blood group, as discovering new blood groups improves care for patients with rare blood types.</p>
