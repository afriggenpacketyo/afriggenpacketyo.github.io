        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative backed by President Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski. The election revealed deep divisions within Poland, a country on the eastern flank of NATO and the EU. Nawrocki's victory suggests Poland will likely take a more populist and nationalist direction, potentially complicating Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to reverse laws that politicized the court system and fulfill promises to the EU. Trump welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago, and the conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland to give Nawrocki a boost, suggesting closer ties between Poland and the Trump administration. </p>

          <p>The UK is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to redesign flight paths, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. The modernization plans, the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s, aim to allow planes to climb quicker during takeoff and descend more smoothly, reducing aviation's climate change impacts. With UKADS expected to be fully operational by the end of the year, the changes could pave the way for new technologies like flying taxis and a more sustainable future for the aviation industry. The current flight paths were decided around 70 years ago, and last year there were about 2.7 million flights in UK airspace.</p>

          <p>Princess Catherine Hilda Duleep Singh, daughter of the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, lived openly in a same-sex relationship in 1900s Germany and defied social norms by helping Jewish families escape Nazi persecution. Using her privilege and resources, she provided financial support, wrote letters of recommendation, and guaranteed immigration documents for Jewish individuals and families seeking refuge in Britain. Catherine's efforts included hosting refugees at her country home and advocating for those interned as "enemy aliens," showcasing her commitment to humanity during a time of widespread atrocities. Her story has resurfaced through the work of biographers and the accounts of those she saved, highlighting her courage and compassion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, *The Family Dynamic*, explores how sibling relationships, including birth order and individual achievements, affect a person's life. Studies suggest eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests, but sibling influence is powerful, with individuals consciously or subconsciously shaping themselves to resemble or differ from one another. Age gaps can complicate these effects, as younger siblings may draw influences from multiple older siblings. Siblings act as vivid mirrors, reflecting both the best and worst traits, and can challenge less lovable attributes, fostering self-awareness and understanding.</p>

          <p>Germany's former foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, is nominated to become the next president of the United Nations General Assembly for a one-year term starting in September. While primarily ceremonial, the position involves organizing plenary sessions and is considered a stepping stone for future roles. Baerbock's nomination faced some internal criticism, as Germany had initially planned to nominate diplomat Helga Schmid for the post. During her tenure as foreign minister, Baerbock maintained a commitment to value-based foreign policy and was outspoken on human rights issues, although her outspokenness sometimes led to diplomatic challenges.</p>
