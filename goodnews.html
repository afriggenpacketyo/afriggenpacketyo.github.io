          <p>Alibaba's navigation app, Amap, has successfully launched a new AI-driven ranking service called Amap Street Stars, attracting over 40 million users on its first day. The feature provides user-generated rankings and recommendations for destinations like restaurants and hotels, directly competing with Meituan's popular Dianping review service. This move is seen as a significant step in Alibaba's strategy to position Amap as a primary gateway for offline local services, similar to how Taobao functions for online commerce. The integration of ranking and navigation features has been well-received by users in mainland China.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), led by China, serves as a crucial stabilizing force in an international system weakened by unilateralism and trade conflicts. The author posits that the SCO provides a viable platform for cooperation among countries with diverse political systems, in contrast to a faltering Western-led order. The organization is presented as an embodiment of multilateral principles that can help prevent further global fragmentation. This perspective frames the SCO as a necessary salve for the ailments of the current global governance structure.</p>

        </div>

          <p>For parents struggling with children who are fussy eaters, a common developmental stage, a child nutritionist offers practical advice to make mealtimes less stressful. Key strategies include allowing children autonomy by letting them choose whether to eat a particular food and not forcing them to stay at the table. The expert also recommends avoiding labeling foods as "good" or "bad" to foster a healthier long-term relationship with food. Other tips include making mealtime a fun, engaging experience and getting children involved in food preparation to encourage familiarity and adventurousness.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 20:09:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, "Play," is presented as a response to a difficult period in his life, aiming to create joy by exploring different cultures. The article notes the incorporation of Asian and Middle Eastern instruments like the sitar and tabla, particularly on tracks like "Sapphire," a duet with Indian superstar Arjit Singh. However, the review suggests these global influences are often assimilated into Sheeran's familiar, frictionless pop style rather than defining the songs. While the album contains some raw and adventurous moments, it largely retreats to the safety of his established formula of love ballads and radio-friendly hits.</p>

          <p>Stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded higher, mirroring a rally on Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 all posted gains, fueled by growing investor sentiment. This optimism is largely driven by easing inflation pressures and widespread expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon implement interest rate cuts. The positive momentum reflects a belief that easier monetary policies from global central banks will continue to support equity markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is studying Denmark's successful transformation of its cancer care system as a potential blueprint for improving its own National Health Service. Twenty-five years ago, Denmark had poor cancer outcomes but has since dramatically improved survival rates through a series of national plans. Key elements of the Danish model include massive investment in diagnostic equipment like CT scanners, strict timelines for diagnosis and treatment, and a focus on the patient experience, including at-home chemotherapy options. This sustained, politically unified effort has moved Denmark's performance from lagging to leading among wealthy nations.</p>

The film reunites the original cast, including director Rob Reiner, and follows the band as they are contractually obligated to perform one last gig. The new mockumentary explores what the inept rockers have been doing for the past 15 years and features cameos from real-life music legends Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John. The movie revisits the band's infamous history of exploding drummers and amplifiers that go "up to 11."</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has struck down an apartheid-era law, ruling that husbands now have the right to take their wives' family names upon marriage. The court found the previous legislation, which only allowed women to change their surnames, was discriminatory on the basis of gender and a "colonial import." The ruling noted that in many traditional African cultures, women retained their birth names. The government has been given two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the landmark decision for gender equality.</p>

          <p>Recent significant gains in China's $12 trillion stock market are presenting a challenge for regulators in Beijing. The government aims to foster a stable, sustainable bull market that can increase household wealth and support consumer spending, avoiding the wild boom-and-bust cycles of the past. By guiding a more measured ascent, authorities hope to shift wealth from the property market and boost the broader economy. While recent volatility may be a concern, analysts believe the overall upward trend remains intact as China transitions toward a slower, more manageable bull market. (not investment advice)</p>
