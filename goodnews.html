        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fragments of West Nile virus have been detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The virus was found in two samples of Aedes vexans mosquitoes as part of a research program conducted by the UKHSA and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). While there have been no cases of West Nile virus acquired in the UK to date, health officials have indicated that the risk to the general public is very low. Experts suggest that the detection of the virus is related to climate change and the expansion of mosquito-borne diseases into new areas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that permission should be required. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public access for 'open-air recreation,' including camping. Campaigners and Dartmoor National Park officials celebrated the decision, emphasizing the importance of responsible access and the need for government support in managing the area. The judgment is expected to reignite discussions about expanding public access to land across England.</p>
