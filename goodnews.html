          <h2>US and Japan Finalize Major Trade Agreement Featuring 15% Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 20:35:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes a 15% tariff on Japanese exports. President Trump stated that Japan will also invest $550 billion into the United States and open its markets to American goods like cars, trucks, and agricultural products. Japanese officials confirmed the agreement, noting it could bolster Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's political standing following recent election setbacks. The deal, which lowers auto tariffs from 25% to 15%, comes as a relief to some economists who had anticipated even higher rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new trade agreements with both the Philippines and Indonesia, establishing a 19% tariff rate on goods imported from both nations. According to President Trump, the Philippines will eliminate its tariffs on U.S. goods, a detail not yet confirmed by the Philippine government. The deal with Indonesia will see it drop tariffs to zero for 99% of its trade with the U.S., opening its market to American industrial, tech, and agricultural products. These agreements were finalized ahead of an August 1 deadline for countries to reach trade deals or face higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Historic 1975 Photograph of Fatal Fire Escape Collapse Spurred Major Safety Reforms in Boston</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 20:20:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A powerful 1975 photograph taken by Stanley Forman captured the moment a fire escape collapsed during an apartment building fire in Boston, causing the death of a 19-year-old woman. The haunting image, which won a Pulitzer Prize, showed Diana Bryant and her 2-year-old goddaughter, Tiare Jones, falling from the fifth story. While Bryant was killed, the young girl survived by landing on her. The photo's widespread publication served as a major catalyst for change, prompting Boston to implement new city codes requiring fire escapes to be certified as safe every five years, a regulation that had a ripple effect on fire safety nationwide.</p>

          <p>Capital One's shares increased in after-hours trading despite reporting complex second-quarter results heavily impacted by its recent acquisition of Discover. While GAAP earnings showed a net loss due to accounting for the deal, adjusted earnings per share significantly beat estimates. CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized the rare strategic advantage of owning a payments network, a move that is expected to generate billions in synergies. Investors appear to be focusing on the long-term potential of the transformative deal, which management believes will create significant value despite higher-than-expected integration costs.

The shark, named Contender by the research group OCEARCH, is over 13 feet long and weighs an estimated 1,653 pounds. First tagged off the coast of Georgia in January, the adult male shark has been tracked on a journey up the East Coast. The data collected from Contender's tag over the next five years will help scientists better understand the migration patterns of the species.</p>

          <p>A major bill recently signed into law by President Trump has established a new income-driven student loan repayment option called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP). Set to be available by July 2026, RAP will calculate monthly payments as a percentage of a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10%, with a $10 minimum. The plan offers loan forgiveness after 30 years, a longer timeline than most existing plans. As other repayment options are phased out, RAP will become one of only two choices for new borrowers, alongside a standard fixed-payment plan. (not investment advice)</p>
