          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods announced its intent to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, aiming to broaden its consumer base, expand internationally, and gain a stronger foothold in the Nike sneaker market. The acquisition is expected to operate Foot Locker as a standalone business, preserving its brands, and will allow Dick's to tap into Foot Locker's urban, younger customer demographic. While the deal faces potential anti-competition concerns, both companies anticipate no regulatory hurdles with the Federal Trade Commission. Foot Locker's shares surged following the announcement, while Dick's shares experienced a decline as investors expressed concerns about the merger's potential impact on financial performance.

          <p>Oil prices experienced a drop on Thursday due to growing expectations of a potential agreement between the United States and Iran regarding Tehran's nuclear program. President Trump suggested that the U.S. was nearing a nuclear deal with Iran, which could lead to increased Iranian crude oil exports. This prospect is expected to have significant implications for oil markets, potentially adding up to 1 million barrels per day to the market.

          <p>Ford Motor is recalling nearly 275,000 Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition SUVs due to a potentially bent brake line that may lead to reduced brake function. The issue stems from faulty assembly during engine installation at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant, where a modification was made in November to prevent damage to the brake line. Drivers may experience increased pedal travel or a red brake warning light in the event of a brake fluid leak. Ford dealers will inspect and replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe at no cost to owners.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% at the start of the year, surpassing expectations and exhibiting the highest growth rate within the G7. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed this growth to strong spending on services such as retail, hospitality, and finance. Despite this positive start, experts predict that the UK's exports to the US may decline due to tariffs implemented by the US, potentially slowing future growth. The UK did a deal with the US last week which cut some tariffs, but it is unclear when this will take effect as the details are ironed out.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has expressed skepticism over a recent F1 swearing controversy, stating that it feels 'a bit suspect' due to a lack of communication with senior FIA officials. Other drivers, including Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, have also commented on the situation, with Hamilton describing it as 'a bit of a mess.' Russell also voiced support for rally legend Carlos Sainz Sr.'s potential bid in the upcoming FIA presidential election, dismissing concerns about a conflict of interest due to Sainz's son being a Formula 1 driver.</p>
