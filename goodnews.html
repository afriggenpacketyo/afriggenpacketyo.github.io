          <p>The UK government plans to purchase 12 new F-35 A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, bolstering its contribution to NATO's airborne nuclear mission. This move signifies the "biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation," according to Downing Street. While the jets can carry conventional weapons, their capability to be equipped with US-made nuclear bombs underscores the UK's commitment to nuclear deterrence. The decision, to be announced at the upcoming NATO summit, has been praised by NATO leadership and is expected to support thousands of jobs across the UK. The jets will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, and the investment shows the UK's resolve to meet new nuclear risks.</p>

          <p>California leaders have reached a tentative $321-billion budget agreement, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The budget addresses a $12-billion deficit through borrowing, state reserves, and funding shifts, reflecting resistance to Newsom's proposed cuts. Key elements include a housing caveat requiring CEQA exemptions, changes to Medi-Cal funding, and continued funding for film and television tax credits. The agreement anticipates future financial challenges, including potential federal funding reductions and ongoing economic uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a left-wing Democrat, defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary, marking a significant political upset.

Mamdani, a democratic socialist, gained support with his progressive platform, including free public buses and city-run grocery stores. His win represents a rejection of the establishment and a desire for enthusiastic and courageous leadership among New York Democrats.</p>
