          <p>Warren Buffett revealed to CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway is not looking to acquire another railroad, despite a recent meeting with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs. The discussion, held privately, centered on exploring greater operational cooperation between BNSF and CSX to achieve shared efficiencies and benefits, with Buffett explicitly stating no acquisition bid would be made. This news caused CSX shares to fall over 5%, as investors reacted to the clarified stance. The dialogue follows a recent joint announcement by BNSF and CSX regarding new coast-to-coast rail services, underscoring ongoing industry developments.</p>

          <p>Frustrated by the prevalence of "ghost jobs" after losing his employment, tech worker Eric Thompson is spearheading a movement to pass federal legislation known as the Truth in Job Advertising and Accountability Act (TJAAA). Ghost jobs are listings posted without a genuine intent to hire, often used for resume collection or to project growth. The proposed act aims to mandate transparency by requiring details like intended hire dates and previous posting frequency, with fines for non-compliance. Thompson's advocacy reflects a growing national and international effort to combat deceptive hiring practices.</p>

The 88-year-old former Providence Municipal Court judge, affectionately known as "the kindest judge in America," passed away last week after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He gained international fame through "Caught in Providence" and viral social media clips for his compassionate approach to justice. The family has expressed deep gratitude for the widespread outpouring of love and support received since his passing.</p>

          <p>A one-eyed goose named Billy became an unexpected and beloved mascot for a Baton Rouge, Louisiana, neighborhood over seven years. Unable to fly, Billy regularly visited homes for food, developed unique communication with residents, and even served as a caretaker for local ducks. Known as the neighborhood "Mother Goose," he fostered a strong sense of community and brought joy to many. Billy's recent death, likely from an alligator attack, prompted an outpouring of grief and shared memories, leading to a community memorial and a permanent tribute.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data indicates that great white sharks are spending more time in the colder waters off New England and Canada's Atlantic coast, with sightings increasing significantly in areas like Maine. Scientists attribute this trend to a greater availability of seals, the sharks' primary prey. While the presence of these predators, popularized by "Jaws," is growing, experts reassure the public that shark attacks remain exceedingly rare. Local authorities are using monitoring data to better understand shark distribution, and residents are learning to coexist with the species in these northern habitats.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a widespread "blind box" craze, where consumers purchase mystery items without knowing the exact variant until unboxed, fueling a surge in sales across various sectors. Pop Mart, known for its Labubu elf-like dolls, is at the forefront, generating massive profits through this format. The phenomenon, which gained traction during the pandemic, allows young consumers a budget-friendly splurge and the thrill of collecting rare editions. While popular with buyers like 23-year-old Ruan Yue, who spends $55 monthly, the Chinese government has issued warnings against "irrational consumption" and potential addiction, especially among minors.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is set to release its second-quarter earnings report, with expectations of an $8 billion impact on its bottom line due to the Trump administration's evolving policies on chip sales to China. While a previous ban was revoked, a new 15% fee on sales to China and a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports (from which Nvidia is likely exempt) present significant challenges. Despite these geopolitical headwinds, Nvidia's shares have risen considerably, and analysts project strong year-over-year growth in EPS and revenue, particularly driven by its data center segment. Investors will closely monitor commentary on its GB200 super chip and future China sales.</p>

Locking in current rates could be a strategic move, as economists anticipate potential Federal Reserve rate cuts by late 2025.

Following the deal, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to split its beverage and coffee units into two separate U.S.-listed companies, effectively unwinding its 2018 merger. This strategic restructuring seeks to create a "global coffee champion" and address declining U.S. coffee sales amid fierce competition.</p>

Meanwhile, Spurs countered Manchester City's high press by attacking down the flanks, notably City's left side, through smart player movements and strong passing. These matches highlight how teams are adapting their pressing and attacking patterns, suggesting a league-wide shift towards exploiting wide areas and challenging traditional defensive structures.</p>
