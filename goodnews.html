This expansion reflects the growing demand for women's professional basketball, evidenced by rising viewership, attendance, and a significantly increased expansion fee of $250 million per team.

This strategic move is part of Home Depot's effort to increase its market share among professional contractors, such as roofers and renovators, who represent a lucrative and steady customer base. The deal, expected to close by early 2026, also concludes a potential bidding war for GMS with another distributor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Speculation is growing that President Donald Trump may be invited to attend China's Victory Parade in Beijing on September 3, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. A recent report cited unnamed sources stating that China was planning to extend the invitation, though the Chinese foreign ministry has not confirmed this information. The possibility of a visit follows a recent phone call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, during which Trump mentioned a trip to China could happen "at a certain point." The potential visit is being watched closely amid ongoing trade tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been found guilty of the sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in Bristol in 1967, a case that remained unsolved for nearly 60 years. Mrs. Dunne was found strangled in her home, and despite initial investigations, no suspect was identified at the time. The case, believed to be the oldest cold case solved in the UK, was cracked after Avon and Somerset Police re-examined evidence decades later. Modern DNA testing on a semen swab from the original crime scene conclusively linked Headley, a previously convicted rapist, to the murder.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has decided not to hear an appeal from American Airlines regarding the dissolution of its partnership with JetBlue Airways. The Justice Department, along with several states, had successfully challenged the "Northeast Alliance" in lower courts, arguing that it harmed consumers by reducing competition in key markets. American Airlines had contended that the partnership actually benefited travelers in the congested Northeast and that there was no evidence of higher fares or reduced service. Since JetBlue terminated the agreement about two years ago, the Supreme Court's refusal to take the case effectively finalizes the lower courts' anti-competition ruling.</p>

Meanwhile, India's assistant coach indicated that star bowler Jasprit Bumrah is available but might be rested depending on conditions, as part of a plan to manage his workload throughout the five-Test series.

The reversal came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was "terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada" in response to the tax, which he called discriminatory against American firms. The 3% levy would have applied retroactively to revenues earned since 2022 by companies like Amazon, Google, and Meta. Canadian officials stated the move was made to support the resumption of trade negotiations and reinforce the economic relationship between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Gold remains a highly sought-after commodity, often viewed as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation, especially during periods of economic uncertainty.

The price is influenced by numerous factors, including basic supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation rates.

Speaking ahead of his 90th birthday, he told followers that a framework for its continuation could be discussed, a shift from previous statements where he suggested he might be the last. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama is reincarnated, but the process is politically sensitive due to China's claim of sovereignty over Tibet and its potential to name a successor.

This figure was lower than the 2.2% anticipated by analysts and provides positive news for the ECB's efforts to control price growth across the eurozone. While the data suggests that disinflation is on track, some economists remain cautious, pointing to persistently high service inflation and the volatility of external factors like energy prices.

          <p>British tennis player Oliver Tarvet, ranked 733rd in the world, secured a remarkable victory in his Wimbledon main draw debut, defeating Switzerland's Leandro Riedi in straight sets. The 21-year-old had to win three rounds of qualifying just to enter the tournament, becoming the first British man to do so since 2017. His impressive performance on a crowded court four earned him a spot in the second round, where he could potentially face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz. Tarvet described the win as a "dream come true" and a culmination of years of hard work, capturing the classic underdog story of the tournament.</p>

          <h2>New UK-US Tariff Reduction Deal Takes Effect, but Steel and Aluminum Remain Unresolved</h2>

          <p>A trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States that reduces import tariffs has officially come into force, benefiting British car and aerospace manufacturers. The agreement allows UK carmakers to sell up to 100,000 vehicles annually to the U.S. at a lower tariff rate, while tariffs on aerospace exports are eliminated. However, the deal does not resolve the issue of U.S. tariffs on British steel and aluminum, which remain at 25% and could double if a separate agreement is not reached by a July 9 deadline. This uncertainty is causing significant concern for the UK steel industry.</p>

          <p>Prominent Wall Street strategist Tom Lee has been appointed chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies, a small bitcoin mining company that is pivoting to make ether its primary treasury reserve asset. The company announced a $250 million private placement to fund an ether acquisition strategy, aiming to become the "MicroStrategy of Ethereum." Lee stated that the growth of stablecoins, most of which transact on the Ethereum blockchain, should drive up the value of ETH. The move reflects a growing trend of publicly traded companies looking beyond bitcoin for their crypto treasury strategies, diversifying into other major digital assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Men's National Team, playing with an experimental and depleted squad, has advanced to the Gold Cup semi-finals after a tense quarter-final victory over Costa Rica. The team won 4-3 in a penalty shootout following a 2-2 draw, showing resilience after overcoming an early deficit and a missed penalty during the match. While the tournament lacks top-tier opposition, the performance is seen as a positive step in rebuilding the team's culture and confidence, which had been lacking. The squad demonstrated a new level of intensity and character, suggesting that the experience gained could be more valuable than the trophy itself.</p>
