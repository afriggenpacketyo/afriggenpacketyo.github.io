        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Government data released on Friday revealed that Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, driven by rising rice prices, marking the highest level since January 2023. The core inflation figure, which excludes fresh food prices, exceeded economists' expectations of 3.4%. Headline inflation rose to 3.6% year-over-year, remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. The Bank of Japan Governor has signaled his intention to raise rates while closely monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs. </p>

          <p>A White House report, spearheaded by President Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., attributes the rise in chronic diseases among children to factors like ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, stress, and excessive prescription drug use. The report calls for a shift in research focus towards understanding and preventing diseases, rather than solely treating them. It criticizes the influence of the food and chemical industries on federal policymaking, likening their tactics to those used by the tobacco industry. While some experts praised the report's focus on toxic chemicals, others criticized it for misrepresenting scientific consensus on issues like vaccine safety.</p>

          <p>Judith Hope Blau, a painter who accidentally became known as the 'Bagel Lady' due to her bagel art necklaces, napkin rings, wreaths, and candleholders, passed away at 87. Starting as a hobby, Blau's bagel creations gained popularity after her daughter brought a bagel necklace to school, leading to orders from Bloomingdale's. This accidental career led to a children‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúThe Bagel Baker of Mulliner Lane,‚Äù and toy designs, including Sweetie Pops and Baby All Gone. Despite her initial plans, Blau's creative detour transformed her into a successful author, illustrator, and toy designer.</p>

Approximately 82% of shareholders voted against the proposal, which was submitted alongside seven others at Amazon's annual meeting. The proposal aimed to codify the split structure, similar to most S&P 500 companies, allowing the board to focus on governance while the CEO focuses on business. Amazon urged shareholders to vote against the proposal, arguing the current policy enables the board to determine the right leadership for the company.</p>
