          <p>Following pressure from the White House, Apple has committed to increasing its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total domestic pledge to $600 billion. The announcement, celebrated by President Trump, is seen as a move by Apple to avoid potential tariffs that would raise costs on its internationally sourced components. CEO Tim Cook stated the investment includes expanding work with 10 U.S. companies that produce components for Apple products. This development occurs as the administration intensifies its trade-war tactics, including recently doubling tariffs on India for its trade with Russia.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he may meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, potentially as soon as next week, following what he called "highly productive" talks between his envoy and Putin in Moscow. The White House confirmed that Russia expressed a desire for a meeting and that Trump is open to engaging both leaders to end the war. This development comes as a Friday deadline approaches, which Trump had set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face severe secondary sanctions. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy stated he supports a lasting peace but emphasized that Russia must not deceive them in the details.</p>

          <p>A record number of 18-year-old students in the UK are likely to secure their first-choice university placement this year, even if they narrowly miss their offered grades, according to the head of the admissions service Ucas. This increased flexibility from universities is reportedly driven by uncertainty surrounding international student enrollment, making domestic undergraduates a more stable source of income for institutions' financial planning. With UK tuition fees rising for the first time since 2017, universities are keen to fill their courses. As a result, fewer places are expected to be available through the 'clearing' process for students without offers.</p>

          <h2>Bank of England Poised to Cut Interest Rates to Two-Year Low</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 19:02:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut on Thursday, lowering the benchmark rate from 4.25% to 4.0%. This would be the fifth reduction since last August and would bring borrowing costs to their lowest point since March 2023. The move is anticipated despite UK inflation rising to 3.6%, above the Bank's 2% target. A cooling labor market, with falling payroll numbers and slowing wage growth, is believed to be a key factor influencing the decision. While the cut will provide relief for some mortgage holders, it will also result in lower returns for savers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Archaeologists Find Evidence of Post-Eruption Settlement in Pompeii's Ruins</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 18:39:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological research suggests that people returned to live in Pompeii after the city was devastated by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Evidence indicates that some survivors, possibly unable to relocate, established a precarious settlement among the ruins, living in the upper floors of buried homes. This informal community, which may have also attracted others seeking shelter, appears to have persisted until the 5th century. According to the site's director, this discovery challenges the traditional narrative of complete abandonment, revealing a period of reoccupation where people lived amidst the ash-covered remains of the once-thriving Roman city.</p>

The offering raised $868 million and gives the Texas-based company a valuation of approximately $6.3 billion.

Firefly, which develops rockets and lunar landers, has secured major contracts with NASA and defense contractors, and successfully landed its Blue Ghost lander on the moon earlier this year, positioning it as a key player in the commercial space industry.

          <p>England all-rounder Chris Woakes revealed he "never considered not batting" despite suffering a suspected dislocated shoulder during the final Test match against India. With England needing 17 runs to win, Woakes emerged at number 11 with his arm in a sling, attempting to help his team secure a victory. Although he did not face a ball, he managed to run four times before his partner was bowled, resulting in a narrow six-run loss for England. Woakes, who had to practice batting left-handed to protect his injury, said he felt a duty to his team and has been widely praised for his courage.</p>
