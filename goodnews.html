          <p>The FBI has successfully returned a 500-year-old manuscript page, signed by Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés in 1527, to Mexico. This historically significant document details early payment structures for spice land discoveries and had been missing from Mexico's national archives since 1993. Federal investigators located and seized the page in the U.S. in 2024, determining it had changed hands multiple times, which precluded prosecution for the theft. This repatriation underscores the United States' commitment to combating the trafficking of cultural property and supporting its foreign partners in preserving historical artifacts, a vital step for cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin achieved a new record high of $124,496, while Ether climbed close to its all-time peak of $4,866.01, initially driven by optimism from a cooler-than-expected July inflation report. However, both cryptocurrencies experienced a decline after July's wholesale inflation data came in much hotter than anticipated, causing a market pullback. Despite the recent dip, Ether has seen substantial gains since June due to heavy institutional buying, tightening supply, and a more favorable regulatory environment. Experts suggest the rally may continue, indicating a shift from speculative mania to broader institutional adoption and real-world integration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is projected to strengthen into the Atlantic season's first hurricane by Saturday morning and escalate into a major Category 3 hurricane by Sunday morning, passing north of Puerto Rico. While Puerto Rico can expect rain, rough surf, and rip currents from its outer bands, Erin is currently not expected to pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland. Meteorological models largely predict the storm will remain over the ocean between Bermuda and the East Coast, though slight deviations could lead to significant impacts. The National Hurricane Center anticipates an above-normal hurricane season, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a 12-year-old Glasgow school pupil, has been named one of Time magazine's "Girls of the Year" for inventing a solar-powered blanket designed to help homeless people stay warm. Her innovative idea, which won a UK Primary Engineer competition, was brought to life as a working prototype by engineering firm Thales, with 35 units already provided to Homeless Project Scotland. Rebecca expressed shock and honor at the recognition, which also included being turned into a Lego mini-figure. Her achievement highlights the profound impact young minds can have on addressing significant social issues and inspiring others in STEM fields globally.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador Xiao Qian stated that China and Australia are prepared to move beyond merely stabilizing relations and aim for "more productive" economic cooperation. Speaking at a trade expo, Xiao emphasized potential for "closer alignment" between Australia's mining and China's manufacturing sectors through joint exploration, technology sharing, and capacity enhancement. He highlighted the "highly compatible" development strategies of both nations, envisioning collaborative efforts to build green, secure, and sustainable industrial chains. This signals a positive shift after ties soured between 2019 and 2020, which saw Chinese export curbs on Australian goods.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled its first domestically developed e-beam lithography tool for commercial use, named Xizhi, marking a significant milestone in its chipmaking capabilities. Developed by Zhejiang University, this machine uses a focused electron beam to "write" chip circuits onto silicon wafers. This advancement is a direct response to U.S. export restrictions on high-tech equipment, strengthening China's research and development efforts in advanced chip manufacturing. The delivery of Xizhi is expected to help China overcome current impasses in semiconductor production, furthering its national push for technological innovation and self-reliance in a critical global industry.</p>

          <p>General Motors' Cadillac brand has unveiled the 'Elevated Velocity,' a new electric crossover concept car designed to expand its luxury EV portfolio. The concept features a "lifted yet elegant design" with 24-inch wheels and multiple driving modes, including an autonomous "elevate mode" that transforms the interior into a "recovery space" for occupants. While not intended for consumer sale, concept cars gauge interest and showcase future design direction. Cadillac aims to offer a full lineup of EVs and gas-powered cars, having recently seen its best first half in nearly 20 years and leading luxury EV sales in Q2 2025.</p>

          <p>Sky Sports is reportedly in advanced talks to secure a new six-year deal for exclusive UK live rights to golf's US Open, expecting to outbid competitors like Netflix. This extension would solidify Sky's dominant position in televised golf, as it currently holds rights for all men's and women's majors, the Ryder Cup, and both the PGA and DP World Tours. Netflix's credible offer reflects its growing interest in acquiring standalone sports content, aiming to attract new subscribers through high-profile events rather than year-round league coverage. This highlights the intensifying competition for premium sports broadcasting rights.</p>

          <p>UK-based electric motor specialist Helix has unveiled a new aircraft blueprint that promises a remarkable 90% reduction in fuel consumption, potentially lowering air travel costs. The design, detailed in a white paper, features lightweight high-density motors, a hybrid electric configuration, and ducted fan propulsion, cutting fuel burn to just 23.8 kilograms per flight. This innovation primarily targets short-haul routes under 250 nautical miles, a significant market segment. While not fully electric, the hybrid approach addresses battery density limitations, offering substantial environmental benefits by reducing carbon dioxide pollution from air travel.</p>
