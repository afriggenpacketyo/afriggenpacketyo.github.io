        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pop Mart, a leading toy company, has launched a new line of gold jewelry under its Popop brand, featuring Baby Molly designs, to capitalize on its growing popularity. The jewelry, including beads, pendants, bars, and ornaments, is priced between $137 and $56,800 and is available in Beijing and Shanghai stores. This move follows Pop Mart's January foray into jewelry with silver items and has boosted the company's stock, which had been declining since late August. The company's valuation remains significantly higher than its rivals in the toy industry. The stock ended the day with a gain of 1.2 per cent at HK$276.80, leaving it with a year-to-date gain of more than 200 per cent. Optimism is relatively high due to the potential for growth in a new market. </p>

          <p>Colorado is taking steps to gain autonomy over vaccine policies due to concerns that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is undermining public trust in vaccines. The state legislature changed a law to consider scientific sources beyond the federal government when setting school vaccine requirements. Colorado is also working to ensure insurance plans cover certain vaccines, regardless of future CDC actions. These changes aim to protect Colorado from political upheaval and ensure continued access to vaccines. There is a push to keep vaccine availability constant. </p>
