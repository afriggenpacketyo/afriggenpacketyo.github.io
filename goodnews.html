          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has praised the "steady progress" in relations with China during a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. This diplomatic warming follows years of tension, including a deadly border clash in 2020. Modi is scheduled to visit China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, his first trip there in seven years, signaling a significant thaw. The improved ties are developing as both nations navigate trade friction with the United States under President Trump's aggressive tariff policies, potentially realigning strategic partnerships in Asia.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has announced that Intel will be required to give the U.S. government a non-voting equity stake in exchange for funds from the CHIPS Act. This marks a policy shift from the previous administration's grant-based approach, with Lutnick stating the Trump administration wants "a piece of the action" for the American people. The move comes as the White House reportedly discusses taking a 10% stake in the struggling chipmaker to bolster domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. This new strategy may also be applied to other recipients of CHIPS Act funding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shenghua Wen, a Chinese national living illegally in the U.S., has been sentenced to eight years in federal prison for conspiring to smuggle weapons and sensitive technology to North Korea. Wen admitted to acting as an illegal agent for the North Korean government, using approximately $2 million wired from officials to purchase guns, ammunition, and other contraband. He concealed the items in shipping containers falsely labeled as consumer goods. The case highlights ongoing efforts by foreign adversaries to illegally procure U.S. technology and military equipment for their own strategic purposes.</p>

          <p>After a two-year legal battle, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that a public university president in Texas cannot ban drag shows, affirming they are a form of expression protected by the First Amendment. The case arose after the president of West Texas A&M University canceled a student group's planned drag event, a decision initially upheld by controversial Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. While a victory for free speech advocates, critics note the lengthy delay in the justice system effectively denied students their constitutional rights for years, as many have since graduated, highlighting how judicial processes can be weaponized.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's potential transfer for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak remains in a stalemate, nearly three weeks after their initial £110 million bid was rejected. No new offers have been made, as any move is reportedly contingent on Newcastle first securing two replacement strikers, a task they have found challenging in the current market. Isak is currently training away from the first team amid the speculation, creating uncertainty for both clubs as the transfer deadline approaches. Newcastle publicly maintains the Swedish international is not for sale, but Liverpool is expected to increase its offer once the club's striker situation is resolved.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: What Form Could US-Backed Security Guarantees for Ukraine Take?</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent diplomatic talks, the prospect of U.S.-backed security guarantees for Ukraine is being explored as a cornerstone of a potential peace deal with Russia. While President Trump has ruled out deploying U.S. ground troops, he suggested American coordination and support for a European-led "reassurance force." Analysts believe credible deterrence will require more than just soldiers, suggesting options like U.S. airpower, intelligence sharing, and long-term military aid to strengthen Ukraine's own defense capabilities. The challenge lies in creating an "Article 5-like" commitment that provides robust, lasting protection without formal NATO membership, a key point of contention for Russia.</p>

          <p>Scientists using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope have discovered a new, tiny moon orbiting the planet Uranus. The moon, which is estimated to be only about six miles wide, was identified during observations in February. Its small size and faintness are likely why it remained undetected for so long, even evading the Voyager 2 spacecraft's flyby four decades ago. This discovery brings the total number of known moons orbiting the ice giant to 29. The newly found satellite has not yet been named, following the tradition of naming Uranian moons after characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.</p>

          <p>The U.S. senior living real estate market is facing a significant supply-demand imbalance as the baby boomer generation ages. With millions of boomers approaching their 80s, occupancy rates are rising rapidly, yet new inventory growth has fallen to its lowest level since 2006. High interest rates and construction costs are stifling new development, creating what experts call a brewing problem. This has created a strong investment environment for existing properties, with real estate investment trusts like Ventas acquiring billions in assets and investors seeing strong returns due to durable demand and rising rents.

          <p>The San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians has acquired a half-acre plot of ancestral land in San Gabriel, California, marking the first time the tribe has held ownership of its territory in centuries. The land, which includes a community center, was transferred for $0 from the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) in a historic land-back agreement. For the state-recognized but not federally-recognized tribe, this provides a permanent space for cultural ceremonies, community programs, and governance, ending their reliance on public parks. The move is seen as a significant step toward healing and rectifying historical injustices for the Gabrieleno Tongva people.</p>
