          <p>Golfer Hunter Mahan likened the Quail Hollow Club, host of this year's PGA Championship, to a Kardashian, describing it as modern, beautiful, and well-kept but lacking soul or character. Other golfers, like Dean Burmester, weighed in on the course's difficulty. The PGA Championship changes courses each year, but many golfers on the PGA Tour are familiar with Quail Hollow, which has hosted the Wells Fargo Championship and the 2022 Presidents Cup. Xander Schauffele won last year's PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club.</p>

She isolated strains of rhizobia and Azospirillum, which facilitate nitrogen fixation and root growth, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.

          <p>The FDA, under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., plans to remove prescription fluoride supplements for children from the market, citing concerns that ingested fluoride alters the gut microbiome. This decision contradicts recommendations from the CDC and professional medical associations, which support low-dose fluoride supplements for children in areas without fluoridated water. The FDA claims that research shows ingested fluoride changes the human microbiome in a concerning way, even though the research it cites is inconclusive. Critics argue that the move removes a valuable tool for dentists to prevent cavities in high-risk children.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April, slightly below economists' expectations but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing and energy costs were major drivers of inflation, while grocery prices saw a slight decrease. Economists are closely monitoring the impact of Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, although the April data is unlikely to reflect their full effect due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases.
