          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision marks a policy shift, providing older borrowers with additional time to address their debt and avoid reduced benefit checks. More than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers aged 62 and older are currently in default, potentially facing a reduction of up to 15% in their Social Security benefits. The pause offers a reprieve for retirees who rely on fixed incomes and could face significant financial hardship due to the resumed collections.
