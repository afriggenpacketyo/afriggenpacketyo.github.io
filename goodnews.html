        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally recommended that the Supreme Court reject an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. Maxwell's legal team argues her prosecution was barred by a non-prosecution agreement Epstein made in 2007, but the DOJ contends this agreement was limited to Florida and did not apply to her case in New York. The government's brief asserts that Maxwell was, at best, an incidental beneficiary of the deal and that federal prosecutors in Florida lacked the authority to bind other districts. Maxwell's attorneys maintain the government broke its promise, while victims' advocates insist she must remain imprisoned for her crimes.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, has made history by becoming the oldest person to complete the Badwater 135, widely known as "the world’s toughest foot race." The 135-mile ultramarathon starts below sea level in Death Valley, where temperatures can exceed 120°F, and ascends to an elevation of over 8,300 feet. Becker finished the race with about three hours to spare, successfully settling a "score" with the course after failing to meet the 48-hour cutoff time in a previous attempt. Having run ultramarathons for two decades, Becker credits his dedicated crew and coaches for his remarkable achievement, demonstrating that age is not a limiting factor.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning NWA 16788, the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, with an estimated value of up to $4 million. The meteorite, weighing over 54 pounds, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It was likely ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact and traveled 140 million miles before landing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Martian meteorites are exceedingly rare, comprising less than 1% of all meteorites found on Earth. Auction house experts describe the find as not just a miraculous object but also a massive dataset for scientists studying the red planet.</p>

          <h2>One Year After Devastating Midwest Floods, Farmers Reflect on Recovery and Future Risks</h2>

          <p>A year after historic flooding wiped out farms and homes in the Midwest, families are still navigating the path to recovery while facing new weather-related uncertainties. One South Dakota family, the Obergs, lost their lifelong home and had to sell off a third of their farmland to afford to rebuild on higher ground. The extreme weather event, which saw nearly a year's worth of rain fall in two months, was followed by a severe drought, highlighting what meteorologists call "whiplash weather" driven by climate change. While this summer's weather has been more favorable, farmers remain acutely aware of the financial and emotional toll of last year's disaster and the ongoing threat of unpredictable conditions.</p>

          <p>Paraguay's President, Santiago Peña, has affirmed his country's unwavering commitment to its 68-year diplomatic relationship with Taiwan, describing it as a strategic alliance based on shared democratic values. Speaking at a business forum, Peña stated that Paraguay would defend the partnership "with all its strength," reinforcing its sovereign foreign policy. The declaration comes after a previous incident where a Beijing-based envoy allegedly attempted to persuade Paraguayan opposition lawmakers to switch diplomatic recognition to China. Paraguay remains one of the few countries globally that formally recognizes Taiwan, and Peña's statement underscores the nation's intent to maintain this long-standing tie despite external pressures.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly recognized as a "biotech supermarket" for its cost efficiency and accelerated drug development timelines, according to a report from investment bank Jefferies. At the world's largest cancer research conference, nearly a third of the drug candidate presentations involved Chinese companies, a dramatic increase from just one a decade ago. The report notes that major multinational pharmaceutical firms are now actively "shopping" for Chinese innovations. These deals typically involve acquiring exclusive rights to develop and market promising new drugs in global markets, while the original Chinese firms often retain rights for their domestic market, showcasing a major shift in the global pharmaceutical landscape.</p>

          <p>A new Photo Booth Museum has opened in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, catering to a growing enthusiasm for analog photography among younger generations. Operated by the San Francisco-based company Photomatica, the venue features four restored vintage analog photo booths from as early as the 1950s, alongside one digital machine. While retrofitted to accept modern payments, the analog booths use original film processing technology, creating a unique, tangible souvenir. The museum aims to provide a nostalgic and interactive experience, tapping into the "analog magic" that has made these old-school machines popular in the age of the digital selfie.</p>

          <p>Shares of financial technology companies, including Block and PayPal, rallied on Monday after experiencing steep declines late last week. The rebound was fueled by analysts who downplayed the potential impact of a reported plan by JPMorgan Chase to charge data aggregators for access to customer financial information. Analysts from Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley suggested that any new fees would likely be "negligible" for large fintech firms and not a "business model-breaking" cost increase. The recovery was also supported by broader market momentum, including a record close for the Nasdaq and a rally in cryptocurrency prices. (not investment advice)</p>

The city of Los Angeles saw an even larger drop in its unsheltered population. Mayor Karen Bass and other officials attributed the progress to initiatives like encampment resolutions and increased funding for housing, declaring that reducing homelessness is now a "trend." Despite the positive news, advocates caution that the situation remains a humanitarian crisis, with people of color disproportionately affected, and have called for more sustained and compassionate action to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski has become a central, and controversial, topic at the MLB All-Star Game. His unexpected selection to the National League team, after only a month in the majors, drew criticism from some who felt more veteran players were snubbed. The 23-year-old's inclusion was largely propelled by a recent, electrifying performance where he struck out 12 batters against the formidable Los Angeles Dodgers. While acknowledging the backlash, NL manager Dave Roberts defended the decision, stating the young flamethrower's presence brings excitement and attention to the game, a sentiment that solidified after Misiorowski proved he could dominate one of baseball's best lineups.</p>

The PAC was formed specifically to unseat Massie after he voted against Trump's tax bill and questioned the president's authority on military action. Massie's significant campaign funds will be crucial in defending his seat in an expensive district, signaling a formidable fight against the president's political operation.</p>

          <p>Scotland's Shetland Islands are advancing plans to replace their aging ferry fleet with a network of undersea tunnels, drawing inspiration from a similar, successful infrastructure project in the Faroe Islands. The Shetland Islands Council is studying the feasibility of building tunnels to connect four outlying isles, including the UK's most northerly inhabited island, Unst. Proponents argue the tunnels would be "transformational," boosting the local economy, which includes a major fishing industry and the UK's only spaceport. The multi-million pound project would likely be funded through borrowing and paid back with tolls, a model that could provide a new transport solution for other Scottish islands.</p>

          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, including the possibility of transforming it into a mutual organization owned by its postmasters. The move is part of an effort to create a "fresh vision" and rebuild trust following the devastating Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. While the government does not plan to reduce the number of branches, it is seeking a national debate on the Post Office's future structure and services, particularly its role in banking. A change in ownership is unlikely before 2030, pending the replacement of the Horizon system and recommendations from the public inquiry.</p>
