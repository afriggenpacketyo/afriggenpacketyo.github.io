          <p>Shares for UnitedHealth Group experienced their most significant single-day jump since 2008, rising over 14% after regulatory filings revealed new investments from prominent financial figures. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new stake of 5 million shares, valued at approximately $1.6 billion. This move, along with sizable investments from Michael Burry and David Tepper, has been interpreted as a major vote of confidence in the health insurer, which has faced public criticism and a Justice Department investigation. The investment provided a significant boost, adding over 200 points to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and potentially signaling a turning point for the struggling company.

          <p>Liverpool has officially signed 18-year-old Italian defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma in a deal valued at £26 million, plus potential add-ons. The promising center-back, who is a member of the Italy Under-19s national team, has agreed to a long-term contract with the Premier League club that extends until 2031. Leoni made 17 appearances in Serie A last season, drawing interest from major clubs before choosing to move to Anfield. The signing addresses Liverpool's need for defensive reinforcements following the recent sale of Jarell Quansah to Bayer Leverkusen, with the transfer now pending international clearance and a work permit.</p>

          <p>Despite global economic challenges, U.S. shoppers are fueling a continued surge in jewelry sales, providing a bright spot for international brands like Pandora. The Danish company reported an 8% rise in U.S. sales for the second quarter, noting that the American market remains a strong outlier compared to weaker performance in Europe and China. This trend is also reflected in the luxury sector, with Cartier-owner Richemont posting a 17% sales jump in the Americas. However, jewelry brands face headwinds from potential tariffs, a weakening dollar, and rising costs of precious metals like silver and gold, which could eventually impact strong U.S. consumer demand.</p>

The departure follows a period of intense pressure from investors, including hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois, who publicly called for new leadership. Wheeler, who became CEO in 2022, stated her decision was to allow the company to focus on its future without external distractions. Opendoor, which has struggled with rising interest rates, has named its technology chief as interim leader while a search for a permanent CEO is conducted. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While traveling to a high-stakes summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Trump indicated he would adopt a tougher negotiating position regarding a ceasefire in Ukraine. He warned of "economically severe" consequences if the talks fail to produce progress and emphasized that any decisions about ceding territory must be made by Ukraine alone. Trump also expressed support for U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, short of full NATO membership, in a future peace deal. This firmer stance may reassure European allies who were concerned about potential concessions to Moscow, as the meeting aims to bring both sides to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>A new Zillow analysis shows that while the median price for a mansion in the U.S. is now $1.4 million, there are still a few metropolitan areas where homes over 5,000 square feet can be bought for less than $1 million. Cities like Buffalo, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; Cleveland, Ohio; and Memphis, Tennessee, offer these large properties at more affordable prices, contrasting sharply with coastal markets like San Jose, where the median mansion costs $6.5 million. Just a few years ago, nearly half of all U.S. mansions were valued below the million-dollar mark, but today only three in ten fall into that category, reflecting rising home prices nationwide.</p>

          <p>Krish Kandiah, a charity director, has publicly offered an "olive branch" to UK Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick following a heated controversy. Kandiah had accused Jenrick of "xenophobia" during a BBC radio segment, referencing an article where Jenrick expressed concerns about illegal migrants in his children's neighborhood. The BBC later apologized and edited the segment. In a social media message, Kandiah expressed a desire to work with Jenrick to de-escalate tensions, focusing on shared concerns like housing and jobs rather than anti-immigrant sentiment, and recalled their past positive collaboration on welcoming Hong Kong refugees.</p>

It is approved for individuals aged 2 to 49, with a caregiver recommended for administration to children. According to the ordering platform, the cost of FluMist is covered by most commercial insurance plans, though a shipping and processing fee applies, increasing accessibility for seasonal flu prevention.</p>

This shift benefited stocks like UnitedHealth, which had its best day in years after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed a major investment in the company. In contrast, momentum-driven technology stocks experienced some pressure. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan's latest data indicated a decline in consumer sentiment for August, with ongoing concerns about future inflation and unemployment.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.21 trillion, understanding monthly obligations is crucial for households managing their finances. For a $3,000 credit card balance, the minimum payment typically ranges from $55 to $85, depending on the issuer's calculation method, which could be a flat percentage or a formula including interest and fees. Merely paying the minimum can trap consumers in a long-term debt cycle, costing thousands in interest over many years. To escape this, the article suggests strategies such as paying more than the minimum, utilizing balance transfer offers, or considering debt consolidation loans to reduce interest accumulation.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a government stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described the intervention as "essential" for U.S. national security. The move aims to revive the struggling American chipmaker and reduce the nation's dependence on foreign manufacturers like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor for critical technology. While government ownership of private enterprise is typically avoided, the analyst argues that ensuring domestic production of advanced semiconductors is a vital security issue, akin to controlling the manufacturing of military hardware. Intel's stock rose over 4% on the news of the potential government investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two years after the deadliest U.S. wildfire in over a century killed more than 100 people and destroyed much of the town, the community of Lahaina, Maui, is still on a long path to recovery.

Mayor Richard Bissen acknowledges the slow pace but emphasizes the county's commitment to expediting permits and supporting residents through the arduous process. Despite initial criticism of the disaster response, community leaders and residents express a sense of resilience and determination to move forward, acknowledging they are in it for the "long haul."</p>

          <p>A loud sonic boom was heard and felt across parts of eastern and southeastern England, including London, Essex, and Kent. The Royal Air Force confirmed that three Typhoon fighter jets were launched from RAF Coningsby to intercept and escort a civilian aircraft that had lost communication with air traffic control. Communications were successfully re-established, and the plane was safely escorted to Stansted Airport. A sonic boom is created when an aircraft travels faster than the speed of sound, generating shockwaves that produce an explosive noise, which in this case caused houses to shake and startled residents.</p>

The decision is a significant show of faith in the young all-rounder, whose leadership qualities have impressed selectors despite his limited playing time this summer.
