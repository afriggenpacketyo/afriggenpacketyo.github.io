          <p>Many U.S. universities, often divided by internal conflicts, have found common ground in opposing the Trump administration's efforts to defund research, increase endowment taxes, and dictate admissions and faculty appointments. The administration's actions, including banning diversity programs and imposing demands on universities like Columbia and Harvard, have been criticized as heavy-handed federal intervention. While some initially supported government pressure to address issues like antisemitism, the administration's tactics are now seen as overly punitive and a threat to academic freedom.

          <p>A political science paper titled "The Republicans Should Pray for Rain" has long been an axiom in American elections, suggesting that lower turnout benefits Republicans due to their affluent electorate's ability to vote despite inconveniences. However, recent trends indicate that stricter voting laws may no longer provide the same advantage to the Republican party. This article examines the changing dynamics of voter turnout and the evolving strategies of political parties in response to demographic and societal shifts. It suggests that traditional assumptions about voter behavior may need to be reevaluated in the current political climate.</p>
