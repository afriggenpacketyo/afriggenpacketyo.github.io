The photo revealed contacts including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Rubio. This occurred after Waltz faced scrutiny for inadvertently inviting a journalist to a Signal group chat discussing sensitive military plans. Despite the administration's defense of Signal as an approved app, the Pentagon's watchdog previously criticized its use for official business, and an investigation into Hegseth's use of Signal is underway.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio, the former senator from Florida, now holds multiple positions in the Trump administration, including Secretary of State, acting administrator of U.S.A.I.D., acting archivist for the National Archives, and interim national security adviser. This accumulation of roles raises questions about his capacity to effectively manage all responsibilities, especially with Steve Witkoff handling sensitive diplomacy. The move highlights the trust placed in Rubio by Trump and his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, though it also raises practical concerns about delegation and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

Authorities said hot and dry conditions, with strong winds, made controlling the fires more challenging, and a senior official warned they could flare up again.</p>

Proponents framed the tax as a battle against the American Beverage Assn., while opponents argue it unfairly burdens working families.
