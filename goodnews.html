        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) at the upcoming summit in The Hague, driven by pressure from the U.S. and ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The 5% target includes 3.5% for "pure" defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure, though some members are hesitant to meet this goal. While some countries like the UK, Poland, and Germany have expressed intentions to increase spending, others like Spain and Italy are seen as major holdouts. European aerospace and defense companies emphasize the need for long-term commitments to enable them to scale up production capacity. The optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is hoping to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year as an alternative treatment for severe depression. This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that offers ketamine-assisted therapy to clients with treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, while illegal on the streets, is being explored for its potential to make patients more receptive to psychotherapy, with some individuals reporting positive experiences. Concerns remain regarding the potential for misuse and side effects, but proponents hope that the treatment will become more widely available through the NHS. The optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, a system that allows voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference.

          <p>Manchester City defeated Al Ain 6-0 in a Club World Cup match, but failed to score the seventh goal needed to guarantee a draw in their next game against Juventus. Ilkay G√ºndoƒüan scored the first goal, followed by Claudio Echeverri and Erling Haaland. Despite the win, Manchester City's coach Pep Guardiola expressed some dissatisfaction. Oscar Bobb and Rayan Cherki also scored, but Phil Foden missed a point-blank shot that could have changed the outcome. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani showcased his two-way talent, pitching a shutout inning and driving in five runs with a home run as the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Washington Nationals. Ohtani's pitching performance marked a step forward in his comeback from elbow surgery, while his offensive contributions included a bases-clearing triple and a two-run home run. He expressed confidence in his progress and aims to continue improving gradually. Seiya Suzuki also had a strong performance, hitting two home runs for the Chicago Cubs. The optimism score is 85.</p>
