          <p>Lakers center Jaxson Hayes sustained a "light sprain" on his right wrist after a hard fall in a preseason game, but expects to be ready for the regular-season opener. He and Luka Doncic are building strong on-court chemistry, with Hayes even working to obtain a Slovenian passport to potentially join Doncic on the national team. Coach JJ Redick observed that the team missed several assist opportunities due to misfired or overly complicated passes, highlighting the ongoing adjustment period for new players like Deandre Ayton to Doncic's distinctive passing style. This developing synergy is crucial as the Lakers refine their play ahead of the new season.</p>

          <p>England is set to introduce new V-level vocational courses for 16-year-olds, aiming to simplify the "confusing landscape" of post-GCSE qualifications. These V-levels will replace Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, focusing on practical skills leading to employment. The government also plans an alternative qualification for maths and English resits, addressing the demoralizing cycle of exam failures. While designed to build on the strengths of BTecs, concerns from the Sixth Form Colleges Association suggest the new V-levels might not fully bridge the gap, highlighting the importance of their effective implementation and subject scope.</p>

          <p>Liu Qian, founder of Wusawa Advisory and a prominent advocate for gender equality, offered insights into Chinese innovation, the US-China rivalry, and women's critical role in policymaking. She argued that the economic impact of global trade protectionism on China is exaggerated, with US exports constituting only about 2.8% of China's GDP. Qian emphasized that the rivalry extends beyond trade into technology and ideologies, stressing that continued unhealthy competition harms both nations and the world. The article highlights her perspective on the distinct characteristics of Chinese innovation and the importance of diverse voices in shaping policy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered X and xAI's antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI to remain in Fort Worth, Texas, despite the companies having "at best minimal connections" to the geographic area. Judge Mark Pittman, in a sharply ironic order, encouraged the tech giants to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth, even providing a city website link for the process. This ruling implicitly criticized the practice of "forum-shopping," where plaintiffs strategically file lawsuits in specific judicial districts. The lawsuit, initiated by Elon Musk's companies, alleges an anticompetitive scheme by Apple and OpenAI in the artificial intelligence market.</p>

          <p>This opinion article questions whether contemporary great powers can emulate the "managed accommodation" exemplified by Richard Nixon and Zhou Enlai in navigating hegemonic transitions. It posits that a multipolar world is already established by economic realities, urging statecraft over confrontation to avert catastrophic miscalculation. The article identifies two critical distinctions from past transitions: the irrationality of total war due to nuclear proliferation and the unprecedented costs of systemic rupture caused by technological interdependence. These dynamics, it argues, create powerful incentives for major economies to avoid breakdown and manage competition through patient diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered what many are calling the greatest individual performance in baseball history, propelling the Dodgers into the World Series. In a National League Championship Series game against the Milwaukee Brewers, Ohtani pitched a two-hit, 10-strikeout gem over six scoreless innings while simultaneously hitting three monstrous home runs, including one that cleared Dodger Stadium. This unprecedented display makes him the only player in MLB history to achieve a 10-strikeout, three-home-run game, showcasing his unparalleled dual-threat ability. Beyond his athletic prowess, Ohtani is widely lauded for his impeccable manners and humble demeanor, embodying both athletic and moral excellence.</p>

          <p>Millions participated in "No Kings" demonstrations across the U.S., protesting President Trump's policies and perceived overreach of presidential authority. These peaceful rallies, held in major cities and hundreds of smaller towns, demonstrated significant public opposition to Trump. While Republicans dismissed their importance, the substantial turnout and Trump's net negative approval rating hint at a Democratic opportunity to rebound from recent electoral defeats. However, the party faces internal divisions on effectively opposing Trump while in the minority, especially amidst an ongoing government shutdown tied to healthcare subsidies, which is causing increasing financial hardship for federal workers and low-income families.</p>

          <p>Manchester United secured a significant 2-1 victory against Liverpool at Anfield, marking their first win there in nine years and their first successive Premier League victories under manager Ruben Amorim. This statement win comes after a challenging 11 months for Amorim, who had publicly expressed doubts about his team and his own position. The team demonstrated remarkable resilience, scoring a late winner through Harry Maguire after Liverpool's equalizer, providing a much-needed morale boost and a foundation for Amorim to build upon. Despite the euphoria, caution prevails, with upcoming fixtures posing further tests for the team's consistency and future trajectory.</p>

Kaiser officials contend their employees already earn 16% more than industry peers and had offered a 21.5% wage increase.

The incident highlights the ongoing strained relations between the two Koreas, even as South Korea's liberal President Lee Jae Myung seeks reconciliation.
