          <p>British heavyweight boxer David Allen, affectionately known as 'White Rhino,' experienced a unanimous points defeat against Russia's Arslanbek Makhmudov in a headline fight at a fervent Sheffield Arena. Despite the enthusiastic support of a 9,000-strong home crowd and Allen's determined performance, the judges decisively scored the fight in Makhmudov's favor. Allen, who had notably returned to the sport after a five-year retirement, expressed immense pride in the atmosphere generated by his fans and emphatically declared that he is "not finished" with boxing. This defeat represents another challenge in his career, but he remains resolute in his intention to rebuild.</p>

          <p>The clocks in the United Kingdom are scheduled to go back by one hour on the last Sunday of October, signaling the conclusion of British Summer Time (BST) and the return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual adjustment, often remembered by the mnemonic "spring forward, fall back," grants an extra hour of daylight in the mornings but results in earlier sunsets. The practice, originally implemented during World War One to conserve fuel, continues to generate debate regarding its potential economic benefits and implications for road safety, particularly concerning darker winter mornings in regions like Scotland.</p>

          <p>Luka Doncic's participation in Sunday's preseason game against the Golden State Warriors is currently listed as "to be determined," despite the star guard being a full participant in Saturday's practice, according to Lakers coach JJ Redick. Doncic, however, anticipates playing in two preseason games before the regular season commences on October 21. His usual running mate, LeBron James, will be sidelined for approximately three to four weeks due to a sciatica nerve issue, necessitating a "next man up" mentality for the Lakers. Coach Redick acknowledges the need for flexible game planning in light of James's absence.</p>

          <p>Former NBA star Paul Pierce was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor driving under the influence (DUI) after he was discovered asleep behind the wheel of his vehicle on the 101 Freeway in Los Angeles. California Highway Patrol officers located Pierce's Range Rover SUV stopped in traffic lanes following their investigation of an unrelated multi-car crash. Pierce later addressed the incident on social media, explaining that he had fallen asleep due to being stuck in standstill traffic for an extended period. The case will now be presented to the LA County District Attorney's Office for further review and potential charges.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen recounts her initial shock and eventual profound understanding upon learning that her 86-year-old mother, Patsy, intends to donate her body to medical science after her passing. Patsy, driven by gratitude for past medical care, firmly believes this act will significantly help future doctors gain invaluable practical experience. Owen's subsequent documentary delved into Cardiff University's anatomy center, revealing the meticulous process of how donated bodies are utilized for teaching and how students develop a deep connection with their 'silent teachers.' The process also allows grieving families to hold funerals at a later stage, with costs fully covered by the university.</p>

          <p>Britain is currently experiencing a notable surge in various respiratory illnesses, including common colds, influenza, and COVID-19, leading to widespread sickness across the nation. Health experts attribute this increase to typical seasonal factors, such as children returning to school and people spending more time indoors as cooler weather arrives, creating ideal conditions for viral transmission. While Rhinovirus is presently the most prevalent, both flu and RSV are also showing signs of increasing activity, though overall illness levels are not considered exceptionally high. Public health officials recommend vaccinations for eligible individuals and consistent hygiene practices to protect vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>As China begins drafting its 15th five-year plan, there is considerable anticipation that this blueprint will fundamentally redefine the nation's infrastructure investment strategy. While previous plans successfully spurred massive economic growth through extensive public works, they also contributed to significant local government debt burdens. The forthcoming plan is expected to pivot towards more technologically advanced and people-centric projects, moving beyond simply connecting populations and overcoming geographic challenges. Economists remain largely optimistic about the scale of future infrastructure spending, emphasizing its continued strategic value despite acknowledging past financial pressures.
