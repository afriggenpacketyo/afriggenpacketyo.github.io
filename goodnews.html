          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates a reduction in the company's corporate workforce in the coming years due to the increasing use of AI agents in the workplace. Jassy stated that as generative AI tools are implemented, fewer people will be needed to perform certain jobs, leading to efficiency gains across the company. Amazon is investing heavily in AI technology, with plans to develop numerous AI agents to automate tasks and free up human workers for more creative roles. However, some Amazon software engineers have expressed concerns that the intensified focus on AI is making their jobs more routine and faster-paced.</p>

          <p>James Gunn, co-head of DC Studios, shared his perspective on the struggles of the movie industry, attributing them to incomplete screenplays and Hollywood's pressure to increase output. He contrasted this with DC Studios' approach, emphasizing quality over quantity and prioritizing finished scripts before production. Gunn also addressed rumors about the cancellation of Matt Reeves' "The Batman" sequel, confirming that the film is still in development but has been delayed. He reflected on his past scandal and how it influenced his approach to filmmaking, shifting his focus from pleasing others to creating authentic work.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the biggest change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The law will prevent women who terminate their pregnancies outside of the current legal framework from being prosecuted, although anyone assisting a woman in getting an abortion outside the legal framework will still be penalized. The amendment was put forward by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi and won support from 379 MPs. While the new clause will not change any law regarding the provision of abortion services within a healthcare setting, campaigners welcomed the decision, while the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children said it was "horrified" by the vote.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for murdering her husband in 2001 has been overturned after she spent two decades in prison fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and foreign DNA, leading to doubts about the original verdict. Dorotik maintained her innocence throughout, working with the Loyola Project for the Innocent to re-examine the evidence. Although the case was dismissed without prejudice, Dorotik is now working to rebuild her life and advocate for other incarcerated women.</p>

Bass, a Democrat, stated that the curfew had been successful in preventing crime and protecting businesses and residents.

          <p>The Senate tax bill includes a "newborn pilot program" that would deposit $1,000 into "Trump accounts" for children born between January 1, 2024, and December 31, 2028. The money, funded by the Department of the Treasury, would be available to U.S. citizens at birth, provided both parents have Social Security numbers. The accounts would allow tax-deferred growth, and qualified withdrawals would be taxed as long-term capital gains. While proponents say the accounts will introduce more Americans to wealth-building opportunities, some experts argue they are overly complicated and may not effectively reach lower-income families.
