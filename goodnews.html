          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones addressed former player Micah Parsons' public comments regarding Jones' failure to contact him after Parsons' trade to the Green Bay Packers. Jones clarified that he ceased making calls to Parsons because the player had explicitly asked him to remove his number from his phone. This exchange occurred after a high-scoring 40-40 tie between the Cowboys and Packers, where Parsons, playing for his new team, recorded a sack against his former quarterback. Jones indicated he felt good about the trade, suggesting the game affirmed the decision. The ultimate impact of the blockbuster trade, involving two first-round picks and Kenny Clark for Parsons, will unfold over time.</p>

          <p>A 54-year-old man undertaking a challenging 20-plus mile marathon swim from Santa Catalina Island to San Pedro was bitten by a 3-to-4-foot shark. Authorities characterized the incident as a "rare attack," resulting in non-life-threatening injuries to the swimmer's leg and foot. Emergency responders quickly reached the man, who was conscious and conversing, transporting him to a medical facility. The swimmer had departed Catalina at midnight, aiming to avoid busy shipping lanes. This event is considered highly unusual, with a Los Angeles Fire Department captain noting its unprecedented nature in his extensive career. The swimmer's mild distress and survival contribute to a relatively positive outcome for such an incident.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its robotics industry, installing nearly 300,000 new robots last year—more than the rest of the world combined—as a direct path to achieving independence in core artificial intelligence technologies. The country's strategy, characterized by public-private collaboration across the industry ecosystem, prioritizes embodied intelligence and aims to embed robotics into various sectors from manufacturing to agriculture. This approach creates massive domestic demand for advanced AI capabilities, fostering a built-in market for China's own AI chips. Companies like Huawei are open-sourcing their AI computing toolkits and large language models, aiming to accelerate ecosystem adoption and establish global standards for AI infrastructure.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Considers Raising Minimum Wage for Residential Construction Workers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 17:11:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of Los Angeles is exploring a proposal to raise the minimum wage for residential construction workers to over $32 an hour, plus an additional $7.65 per hour for healthcare. This initiative aims to attract workers to the struggling home construction industry, particularly as the city needs to rebuild units lost in the Palisades fire. Proponents argue that higher wages and benefits are crucial to protect non-union, often foreign-born, workers vulnerable to wage theft and exploitation, and to combat worker shortages partly fueled by fears of immigration raids. A study on the economic effects of this wage increase is currently being commissioned.</p>

          <p>Nike reported a surprise 1% sales growth in its fiscal first quarter, surpassing expectations for a decline, yet its profits decreased by 31% and gross margin dropped. This mixed performance signals that while the company is making strides, its comprehensive turnaround efforts, especially regarding clearing stale inventory, are still in progress. CEO Elliott Hill noted positive momentum in wholesale, running, and North America sales, but conceded that other business segments, including Nike Direct and China, where revenue fell 9%, continue to face challenges. The company is actively restructuring its corporate framework, emphasizing innovation, and expanding its female customer base through initiatives like the Skims partnership.</p>

          <h2>Meatless Burgers: A Closer Look at Health and Environmental Claims</h2>

          <p>While plant-based burgers are often perceived as healthier and more environmentally friendly than beef, research from Harvard University indicates that highly processed meatless imitations may not always be superior. These alternatives, like Impossible and Beyond Burgers, can contain similar or higher levels of saturated fat and sodium compared to lean beef. While they contribute to a reduction in agricultural greenhouse gases, they can lack essential nutrients like Vitamin B12 and iron found in unprocessed meats, though many are fortified. The article suggests that whole-food plant-based options like legumes offer more fiber and micronutrients, recommending a balanced, plant-focused diet with occasional meat.</p>

Ek stated his new focus will be on Spotify's "long arc," including global growth opportunities in regions like Asia and Africa, and exploring new technologies like artificial intelligence. Despite a 5% dip in shares post-announcement, Spotify has seen significant growth, boasting over 700 million subscribers.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 53, the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act, into law, requiring developers of powerful AI models to publish safety and security reports. This pioneering state legislation focuses on preventing "catastrophic risks" such as AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages. The law mandates safety frameworks, reporting of "critical safety incidents" to the California Office of Emergency Services, and whistleblower protections. While a single state law may not prevent all disasters, it aims to regulate fast-moving AI technology proactively, setting a precedent for potential federal legislation amidst ongoing debates over AI safety and ethics.</p>

The rankings considered average net price after financial aid and the value added to graduate earnings, calculated against high school-only earners in the state.
