          <p>The governor of the People’s Bank of China, Pan Gongsheng, stated that the country's monetary policy adjustments are self-determined and based on evolving macroeconomic data. He assured that a comprehensive range of policy tools will be used to maintain ample liquidity. The statement was made at a conference that highlighted China's financial sector achievements over the past five years, which has reportedly increased the attractiveness of Chinese assets for overseas investors. This approach emphasizes stability and responsiveness to internal economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved a £2.2 billion plan for a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move the government says will create thousands of jobs and boost economic growth. The project involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While proponents champion the investment and increased travel options, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups like Greenpeace and the Green Party, who have condemned it as a "disaster for the climate crisis" due to increased emissions and noise pollution.</p>

          <p>Build-A-Bear Workshop is experiencing significant success, with its stock up roughly 60% year-to-date, by strategically marketing to adults who grew up with the brand. The company has leaned into the "kidulting" trend, where adults embrace nostalgic childhood activities, leading to record-breaking revenue in the first half of fiscal 2025. CEO Sharon Price John attributes the growth to forward-looking strategies, diversification beyond traditional malls, and tapping into the current cultural zeitgeist of personalization and comfort. This approach has allowed the retailer to flourish despite broader economic headwinds and dwindling mall traffic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, influential climate author and activist Bill McKibben expressed significant optimism about the future of clean energy. He argues that the rapid, global proliferation of cheap solar and wind power has created a powerful economic momentum that can withstand political opposition, such as that from a potential Trump administration. McKibben points to the fact that renewables are now the world's cheapest energy sources, highlighting how states like Texas are installing them faster than California due to their tangible local benefits. He believes this economic reality is fundamentally changing the politics of energy, creating a plausible path to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed implementing mandatory, cigarette-style health warnings on social media apps to protect children's mental health from "addictive algorithms." The plan, announced at the party's autumn conference, also includes a two-hour daily cap on accessing short-form video content for users under 18. Citing research linking excessive social media use to anxiety and sleep disruption, the party argues that these platforms pose well-documented risks similar to tobacco and alcohol. The proposal aims to ensure young users are fully aware of the potential mental health impacts before engaging with the apps.</p>

          <p>A Romanian tourist on holiday in Italy was mistakenly arrested and spent nearly a month in prison because he shares a name with a wanted criminal. The tourist, identified as Ovidiu A., was arrested at his hotel near Venice on August 24 after his name triggered an alert. His lawyer struggled to gather evidence to prove the mistaken identity due to fragmented communication between different Italian law enforcement and judicial computer systems. After his release, the man and his family reportedly plan to continue their vacation before returning home.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has indicated a willingness to resume negotiations with the United States, but only if Washington abandons its demand for complete denuclearization. Speaking to the Supreme People's Assembly, Kim stated that North Korea's nuclear status is irreversible and constitutionally protected, citing the fates of Iraq and Libya as reasons not to disarm. While leaving the door open for dialogue with President Trump, for whom he said he holds "good memories," Kim simultaneously hardened his stance against South Korea, calling inter-Korean unification "unnecessary" and severing communications.</p>

          <p>According to China's General Administration of Customs, the country's exports to Africa have surged, totaling $140.8 billion. This represents a growth rate that is two to four times faster than its exports to other major regions like Europe and Asia. An analyst from the AustChina Institute suggests that this significant increase is likely a direct result of pressures from the ongoing tariff disputes with the United States. As U.S. tariffs impact Chinese goods, manufacturers may be redirecting their exports to burgeoning markets like Africa to maintain production levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved an experimental device that treats rheumatoid arthritis by stimulating the vagus nerve. The implant, made by SetPoint Medical, is for patients whose symptoms are not controlled by medication. It works by sending electrical pulses to the vagus nerve for one minute each day, which signals the brain to instruct the spleen to reduce the production of inflammatory proteins. A clinical trial showed that 35% of patients in a difficult-to-treat group saw meaningful improvement, offering a new therapeutic option for this debilitating autoimmune disease.</p>

          <p>Patricia Lockwood's new autofiction novel, "Will There Ever Be Another You," explores the lingering, mind-altering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic through its protagonist, a writer struggling with long COVID. The book uses an expressionistic and associative style to depict the main character's experience with brain fog, intrusive thoughts, and hallucinations while quarantining in Savannah, Georgia. The review notes that while the narrative can feel disjointed and self-indulgent at times, it also contains moments of startling beauty and effectively illuminates the disorienting reality of long COVID. The novel is described as a mixed bag, offering an experimental portrait of a personal health crisis.</p>

          <p>A retrospective exhibition at USC’s Fisher Museum of Art showcases the work of Los Angeles artist Ken Gonzales-Day, who uses the conceptual act of erasure to explore social identity and historical brutality. A prominent series features altered historical photographs of lynchings in the American West, from which the artist has digitally removed the victims and the ropes. This act of obliteration shifts the focus from the victim to the mob and the surrounding context, forcing the viewer to confront the societal dynamics of such atrocities. The review praises the work for its pressing relevance and its power to transform identity from an answer into a question.</p>
