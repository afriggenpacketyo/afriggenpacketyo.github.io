          <p>WNBA player Paige Bueckers expressed her surprise and belief that 'God makes no mistakes' after the Dallas Mavericks unexpectedly secured the top pick in the NBA Draft lottery. Bueckers, who was the first player selected in the WNBA Draft, suggested that there was a reason for the Mavericks' good fortune. The NBA lottery odds have been flattened in recent years, making it more difficult for teams who are rebuilding to land a top-three selection. Duke standout Cooper Flagg is widely projected as the top prospect in this year's NBA Draft.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with legislation to enact President Trump's domestic agenda, including tax cuts, Medicaid adjustments, and food assistance modifications, despite facing opposition from Democrats and internal dissent. The legislation aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts while offsetting costs through cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. The plan faces challenges in the Senate, with some Republicans expressing concerns about its fiscal responsibility and proposed Medicaid cuts. Democrats are primarily criticizing the bill's health care provisions, estimating that millions of Americans could lose insurance coverage if it becomes law.</p>

          <p>Indebted property developer China Vanke has secured a 1.55 billion yuan (US$215.4 million) loan from state-owned Shenzhen Metro Group, its largest shareholder, to alleviate financial pressures and meet debt obligations. The loan, with a 36-month term and a below-market annual interest rate of 2.34%, aims to support interest and principal repayments. This financial support follows government intervention in February, where Shenzhen authorities tightened control over Vanke by appointing new executives. Despite this, Fitch Ratings downgraded Vanke's bonds further into junk territory, reflecting ongoing concerns in the financial markets.</p>

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife evaluated two dead birds and found no evidence of electrocution, but noted signs of trauma potentially caused by a pellet gun, BB gun, or slingshot. PG&E stated that their equipment is compliant with avian safe guidance. Fish and Wildlife officials are continuing to investigate the cause of the bird deaths.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to permit foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines, reversing a previous ban. This change follows a takeover bid of the Telegraph and the Spectator by RedBird IMI, backed by the Abu Dhabi ruling family. The government believes this move will help cash-strapped publishers raise vital funding while still protecting media plurality. The new law sets the threshold for State-Owned Investors (SOIs) at 15% of shares or voting rights in a newspaper or news magazine.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced his support for two bills aimed at streamlining housing development in urban areas by easing the permitting process. Newsom's revised state budget proposal will also include provisions to reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and remove other impediments to new housing construction. The governor praised Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and state Sen. Scott Wiener for sponsoring bills designed to expedite the development of infill projects. The proposal looks to force permit deadlines on the Coastal Commission, allow housing development projects over $100 million to use CEQA streamlining usually available to smaller projects, and create a fund, paid for by developers, to finance affordable housing near public transit.</p>

The fix addresses the accumulation of propellant residue in the backup thrusters, which could have led to their failure. The mission team had to take a risk by switching Voyager 1 to its primary roll thrusters and turning them on before attempting to fix and restart the heaters. This involved the possibility of an explosion if the thrusters were activated before the heaters were ready.</p>

The report reveals that at least 274 people's deaths have been investigated internally by the DWP since April 2015, and that the process of engaging with the DWP too often leads to mental distress. The MPs recommend introducing a statutory duty to safeguard vulnerable claimants and including the views of people with lived experience in DWP policy.</p>
