          <p>The Trump administration proactively informed several U.S. allies in the Middle East about Israel's impending strikes on Iran.  Secretary of State Marco Rubio personally contacted these allies. The key message emphasized that the strikes were solely Israel's operation, not involving U.S. assets, and that the U.S. favored diplomacy over military action.  This preemptive notification aimed to distance the U.S. from potential repercussions, particularly concerning allies hosting U.S. forces.</p>

The arrests occurred on the eve of the Army's 250th-anniversary parade in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco issued an order preventing Secretary of State Marco Rubio from carrying out planned State Department downsizing. This action is in accordance with a previous injunction prohibiting the Trump administration from implementing significant reorganizations and personnel cuts without Congressional approval. The State Department's attempt to circumvent the injunction by claiming independent action was unsuccessful. The judge's order underscores the ongoing legal battle surrounding the administration's actions.</p>
