          <p>Former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama have jointly addressed and dismissed persistent rumors about their marriage being in trouble. Appearing on a podcast hosted by Michelle Obama and her brother, Craig Robinson, the couple used humor to counter the speculation. Michelle Obama explained that her recent absence from some public events stems from a newfound freedom to make her own choices, not marital discord. She reaffirmed her commitment to their long-standing marriage, emphasizing that they have overcome challenges together and she has become a better person through their partnership.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry walked through a demined area in Angola, echoing a famous visit by his mother, Princess Diana, 28 years ago. Working with the HALO Trust, the same organization Diana supported, the Duke of Sussex highlighted the ongoing danger posed by landmines left from the country's 27-year civil war. He emphasized that remnants of the conflict still threaten the lives of children and families daily. Princess Diana's advocacy in 1997 was instrumental in mobilizing global support for a land mine ban treaty, and her son's visit continues to draw attention to the charity's work, which has destroyed over 120,000 landmines in Angola since 1994.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar for its cola products sold in the United States. In a social media post, Trump stated he had spoken with the company and praised the decision, calling it a "very good move." While Coca-Cola did not explicitly confirm the change, a spokesperson acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and said details on new product innovations would be shared soon. The move aligns with a campaign by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to remove certain ingredients like corn syrup from American food products due to health concerns.</p>

          <p>Germany is set to pass new legislation by the end of the year to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants across the English Channel to the UK. The new law, announced during the German chancellor's visit to the UK, will make it illegal to facilitate migration to a non-EU country like Britain. This change aims to help German authorities target warehouses and storage facilities used by smugglers to hide small boats. The agreement is part of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's efforts to address the rising number of Channel crossings, which have increased by 56% compared to the same period last year.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have captured the earliest stages of planet formation around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315, located 1,300 light-years away. Using data from the Webb Space Telescope and the Alma observatory, scientists detected the mineral silicon monoxide, a key building block of planets that forms at very high temperatures near a star. This discovery provides a direct look at a process similar to how our own solar system began, offering unprecedented insights into the dawn of planetary creation. Researchers believe this finding will help them identify other budding solar systems and better understand the origins of Earth.</p>

          <p>United Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates and issued a positive outlook for the remainder of 2025. CEO Scott Kirby noted that the world is "less uncertain" and that travel demand is strengthening after a weaker-than-expected start to the year, particularly for domestic flights. While quarterly revenue of $15.24 billion was slightly below expectations, the airline now projects full-year adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share. The report indicates a stabilizing travel market, with premium cabin revenue showing robust growth even as overall unit revenue saw a slight decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking UK study has demonstrated that creating embryos with DNA from three people can successfully prevent the transmission of devastating mitochondrial disorders. Researchers used the technique, known as mitochondrial donation, to help families have eight healthy children who are now free from the rare but often fatal genetic conditions that plagued their families for generations. The process involves transferring the nuclear DNA from the parents' fertilized egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria. While the results are hailed as a major advance, some critics raise ethical concerns about the long-term safety and the potential for genetic manipulation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he believes China is making significant progress in its efforts to control the flow of fentanyl into the United States. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump's positive assessment marks a shift in tone from his previous statements, where he has often used the fentanyl crisis as a justification for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. The comments come as high-level trade negotiations continue between the two countries. The president made the remarks before signing the HALT Fentanyl Act, a bill that permanently classifies fentanyl-related substances as highly controlled drugs under U.S. law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. Proponents describe stablecoins as "digital dollars" that could enable faster, lower-cost transactions outside of traditional banking hours. The proposed legislation would create consumer protections and clear rules for issuers like banks and fintech companies. While designed to be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins still carry risks, such as becoming "depegged" from their underlying asset, which has happened during past market stress.
