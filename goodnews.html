        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that former President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The court found the order invalid because it directly contradicts the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration had argued that the amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected. This ruling marks a significant legal setback for the policy, which has been on hold amid numerous legal challenges since its announcement.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after a contraction in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a surge in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products. However, analysts express caution about the future, citing concerns that slowing global trade and potential U.S. tariffs could pressure the country's export-dependent economy. Despite a turnaround in domestic demand, experts predict that the current pace of growth is unlikely to be sustained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade deals with Indonesia and the Philippines, which will see a 19% tariff on imports from those nations while U.S. exports will face no duties. Analysts suggest these agreements are an indirect strategy to counter China's economic influence by reshaping regional supply chains and securing access to rare earth minerals. However, some experts believe the impact on China may be limited, as Chinese companies have increasingly localized their production within Southeast Asia over the past five years, reducing their reliance on transshipments that would be affected by such deals.

As a key supplier to AI leader Nvidia, the company expects its dominance in the HBM market to continue, projecting that its full-year HBM sales will double compared to 2024. The company plans to increase capital expenditure to meet future demand from its HBM customers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While still considered a seller's market, the U.S. housing market is showing early signs of a shift that could benefit homebuyers. An increase in housing inventory, with 34% more sellers than buyers nationally in May, is a key driver of this change. However, record-high median sale prices persist, fueled by homeowners with low-interest mortgages who are hesitant to sell. Real estate experts advise that market conditions vary significantly by location, with some cities in Texas and Florida becoming more buyer-friendly. For prospective buyers, experts recommend targeting homes that have been on the market longer or looking for properties that require renovation. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite Spain's dominance in possession, the game was deadlocked until Bonmatí's skillful goal in the 115th minute. Her performance has been praised as a demonstration of world-class talent and mental fortitude, solidifying her hero status after a challenging start to the competition.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice has issued a landmark advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal duty to prevent environmental harm from greenhouse gas emissions. In a unanimous decision, the U.N.'s highest court affirmed that existing international laws compel nations to protect the climate and provide "full reparations" for wrongful acts that cause damage. The opinion came in response to a campaign led by the island nation of Vanuatu, which suffers disproportionately from climate change impacts. While not legally binding, the ruling sets a powerful legal precedent that could influence climate litigation worldwide.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the twin TRACERS satellites, designed to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. This interaction creates "space weather," which can disrupt satellites, power grids, and GPS communications. The identical spacecraft will fly in tandem, allowing researchers to precisely measure how energy from the sun couples with our planet's magnetosphere. Data from the mission will improve understanding and eventually help predict space weather events, enhancing the safety of critical infrastructure on Earth and astronauts in space. The launch also included five other small research satellites.</p>

The team boasts a mix of veteran talent like quarterback Matthew Stafford and young stars such as Puka Nacua and Jared Verse. However, issues to watch include Stafford's back soreness, the offensive line's health following left tackle Alaric Jackson's blood-clot issues, and depth at the cornerback position. Additionally, the team is still in contract negotiations with star running back Kyren Williams, whose future with the team beyond this season remains uncertain.</p>

The Dodgers' bullpen has struggled recently, and its high usage is a growing concern for the team. The game also saw Shohei Ohtani hit a home run for the fifth consecutive game, tying a franchise record and bringing his season total to 37.</p>
