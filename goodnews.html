          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indexes both closed at record highs on Thursday, continuing a multi-session winning streak. This performance contrasted with a mixed trading day across the broader Asia-Pacific region, which did not follow Wall Street's recent downturn in tech stocks like Nvidia. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index saw gains, partly driven by a successful market debut for automaker Chery and a surge in Xiaomi shares following new product announcements. Conversely, markets in South Korea and Taiwan experienced slight retreats, with investors closely watching corporate developments and the potential influence of U.S. economic data on global monetary policy.

          <p>Dan Pembroke, a two-time Paralympic and world champion in the F13 javelin, has found a unique way to visualize his athletic goals: brewing beer. Before his gold-medal victory in Paris, he created a home brew called 'Paris Gold' as a form of manifestation, a practice encouraged by his coach. This hobby has now grown into a commercial venture with a craft brewery. Pembroke, who came to Para-sport after an injury ended his Olympic dream and his eyesight deteriorated, recently broke the world record in his event. Now, as he prepares to defend his world title, he is also brewing a new beer to inspire British athletes at the upcoming Winter Paralympics and looking forward to becoming a father.</p>

          <p>After more than 20 years, a woman whose body was discovered in Spain has been identified as 31-year-old Russian citizen Liudmila Zavada. Her identification is the third successful case from Operation Identify Me, an international initiative led by Interpol to name deceased women in unsolved cases across Europe. Ms. Zavada's body was found by a road in Barcelona in 2005, and police considered her death suspicious. The breakthrough came after her fingerprints, shared through the campaign, were matched by Turkish police to a national database, and a DNA match was later confirmed with a relative in Russia. The investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death is ongoing.</p>

After a difficult season at Bayern Munich, he was acquired by Liverpool and has since thrived, particularly under new manager Arne Slot. Slot has utilized Gravenberch in a holding midfield role but has also granted him more attacking freedom, leading to a significant increase in his goal contributions and overall influence on the team's perfect start to the season. This article analyzes his statistical improvements and includes commentary from experts who credit manager Slot's trust and tactical adjustments for unlocking the player's exceptional talent.</p>

The company is advancing its experimental weight-loss injection, CT-388, into a phase III trial, the final stage before seeking regulatory approval. This move signals a serious challenge to the current market dominance of Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Roche, which currently has no approved obesity treatments, has been rapidly building its pipeline through acquisitions and partnerships, including a closely watched drug candidate called Petrelintide. The company aims to launch its suite of obesity treatments by 2030.</p>

          <p>A group of Chinese state-owned entities, known as the "national team," held a combined US$553.1 billion in domestic stocks as of the end of June. This significant holding, which surpasses that of all foreign investors, is part of a concerted government effort to ensure financial stability and bolster the stock market. The state buying has been credited with helping a key stock benchmark reach a decade high last month. This strategy aims to present the stock market as a reliable place for household wealth preservation, especially as the nation's property market experiences a downturn, and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.

          <p>China has vowed to speed up the global expansion of its homegrown satellite navigation system, BeiDou, positioning it as a key rival to the US-operated GPS. At a recent summit, Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang stated that after 31 years of development, the system has entered a new phase of global service with improved performance. BeiDou has already achieved over 70% market share within China, powering a wide range of consumer products from smartphones to shared mobility services. The government is now focused on enlarging its "circle of international friends" by promoting BeiDou as a critical piece of infrastructure for users around the world, enhancing its geopolitical and technological influence.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 5-4 extra-innings victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks, bringing them to the brink of another NL West division title. The win was highlighted by an unconventional but effective strategy of using starting pitchers as relievers to support a struggling bullpen. Roki Sasaki, in his first appearance since May, pitched a scoreless seventh inning with impressive velocity, while veteran Clayton Kershaw made his first relief appearance since 2019 to handle the ninth. Despite the bullpen blowing a three-run lead in the eighth, the team showed resilience, with Tommy Edman driving in the winning run in the 11th inning.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that it is unconstitutional for the Trump administration to require states to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement as a condition for receiving certain FEMA grants. The ruling is a victory for 20 states that sued the administration, arguing that critical emergency preparedness funding was being held hostage to advance a political agenda. The states, many of which have "sanctuary" policies limiting local police cooperation with ICE, claimed the policy was illegal and jeopardized public safety. The judge sided with the states, calling the administration's policy "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," and preventing the withholding of these vital disaster relief funds.</p>

The farm's owners have been engaged in a protracted legal battle to save their flock, arguing against the necessity of the cull, a case which has garnered international attention. The court's decision halts the culling process while it decides whether to hear the owners' full appeal, and it has ordered the CFIA to maintain custody and care of the birds in the interim.</p>

The up to $100 billion deal is structured to be paid out as new AI supercomputing facilities become operational. While this financial structure is cost-effective for OpenAI, it has prompted concerns among some analysts about the "circular" nature of funding in the AI industry, where capital is raised only to be immediately spent with the investing partner.</p>

A new study from Oxford Economics shows that the continent imported a record 9,516 megawatts worth of Chinese-made panels in the first seven months of this year, a significant increase from the previous year. This boom is fueled by falling technology costs and the development of large-scale energy plants by Chinese firms, such as PowerChina's major project in South Africa.
