          <h2>Experts Suggest Potential Mental Health Benefits of Gossiping</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 05:00:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychology experts suggest that gossiping, often viewed negatively, can offer benefits to mental health. It can help individuals process feelings, gain validation, and reframe social experiences, acting as a form of venting or emotional regulation. Additionally, gossiping fosters a sense of bonding and connection through shared information, although experts caution against jumping to conclusions. However, excessive negative gossiping can cause stress and impact mental well-being, and in the workplace, it can erode trust and create a toxic environment, so the intention behind the gossip is important to consider.

          <p>Lucy Powell, a Labour minister, has apologized for describing grooming gangs as a "dog whistle" issue during a BBC radio debate, which sparked backlash from political opponents. Powell clarified that she regards child exploitation and grooming with utmost seriousness and was challenging the political point-scoring around the issue, not the issue itself. Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended Powell, saying politicians sometimes misspeak in the heat of debate, and she is mortified that her comments undermined those who campaigned against or were victims of these crimes. Powell had been responding to a question about a Channel 4 documentary on sexual assault gangs. Optimism score: 70</p>
