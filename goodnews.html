          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto has formed in the central tropical Atlantic and is projected to move northwest, potentially impacting the Southeast U.S. coast. The National Hurricane Center forecasts significant strengthening, with Humberto expected to become a hurricane and potentially a major hurricane this weekend. While there are no coastal watches or warnings currently in effect, the storm's path is being closely monitored. Another storm system is also brewing over the northeast Caribbean, likely to bring heavy rains to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic before potentially strengthening near the Bahamas.

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has publicly admitted that the Labour Party previously avoided addressing concerns surrounding illegal immigration, emphasizing the need to tackle every aspect of the issue. He noted the increasing popularity of Reform UK as a challenge for both Labour and the Conservatives. The prime minister is expected to announce plans for a compulsory UK-wide digital ID scheme to address illegal immigration. This announcement is part of Labour's strategy to tackle the electoral threat posed by Reform UK and will include funding for overlooked communities.

          <p>A California bill, sparked by a waking baby, seeks to regulate loud commercials on streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video. The bill aims to close a loophole in the federal CALM Act, which already prohibits loud commercials on regular TV broadcasts. If passed, the bill would likely impact streaming services nationwide, as companies often create uniform policies rather than tailoring them to individual states. The bill is now on Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk for consideration. Optimism score is not included in the summary.</p>
