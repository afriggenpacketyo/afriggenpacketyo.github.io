          <p>President Trump addressed West Point graduates, praising their achievements and declaring a "golden age" for the U.S. military. He emphasized his administration's commitment to national security, border protection, and building in America, while also criticizing his predecessors for involving the military in nation-building missions. Trump touted the removal of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs from military academies, stating there would be no more critical race theory or transgender policies imposed on service members. The speech reflects the administration's agenda to reshape military academies and focus on traditional values. </p>

          <p>President Trump used his West Point commencement address to congratulate cadets and take credit for the United States' military power. He detailed a shift in U.S. foreign policy, accusing past leaders of involving soldiers in "nation-building crusades." Trump also touted the end of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at military academies, focusing the military on crushing adversaries and defending the American flag. While claiming a new peacetime recruiting record, CBS News found that military records show enlistments began rebounding before Election Day, likely due to recruitment reforms introduced during the previous administration. </p>

          <p>During his commencement speech at West Point, President Trump reiterated his stance that biological men should not compete in women's sports. He highlighted an executive order prohibiting such participation and criticized states that have defied the order, resulting in federal Title IX investigations. This statement aligns with Trump's broader efforts to restrict transgender rights and reflects a growing debate over fairness and inclusion in athletics. The article also cites a survey indicating that the majority of Americans, including a significant portion of Democrats, oppose transgender athletes competing in women's sports. </p>
