          <h2>Hotel Tycoon Proposes Alternative Heathrow Runway Expansion Plan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 20:59:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora's Arora Group has unveiled a competing proposal for Heathrow Airport's expansion, presenting an alternative to the airport owners' existing plan. Their "Heathrow West" initiative suggests a shorter 2,800-meter third runway, which critically avoids the expensive and disruptive need to divert the M25 motorway. The Arora Group claims its plan, developed with Bechtel, could be fully operational by 2035 at an estimated cost under £25 billion, a figure notably lower than Heathrow's own escalating projections. This development, prompted by the government's invitation for competitive bids, aims to enhance the UK's global connectivity, despite concerns from groups like the No 3rd Runway Coalition regarding rehoming thousands.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump declared a "Full and Complete" trade deal with South Korea, implementing a 15% tariff on the nation's exports to the U.S., a reduction from the previously threatened 25%. Under the agreement, Trump stated South Korea would commit $350 billion for U.S.-controlled investments and purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products. South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, however, interpreted the $350 billion fund as a means to facilitate Korean companies' entry into U.S. industries like shipbuilding and semiconductors, emphasizing mutual benefit. The article underscores the differing interpretations of the investment's utilization while noting the deal's broader aim to strengthen industrial cooperation and the bilateral alliance.

          <p>Robinhood announced a robust second-quarter performance, exceeding Wall Street estimates with revenue climbing 45% year-over-year to $989 million and net income more than doubling to $386 million. The financial services platform saw its funded customer base grow by 2.3 million to 26.5 million, while total platform assets nearly doubled to $279 billion due to strong net deposits and rising valuations. Robinhood is actively expanding beyond retail trading into wealth management, notably through its TradePMR acquisition, and is preparing to launch Robinhood Banking this fall. Despite these positive results, shares experienced a slight dip following a warning about increased costs for 2025 due to the Bitstamp acquisition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains the key factors that contribute to the formation of tsunamis, particularly focusing on strong earthquakes. Geophysicists note that an earthquake generally needs to be at least magnitude 6.5 to 7 and cause significant vertical motion on the ocean floor to generate a tsunami. Underwater earthquakes or those near shore, especially in areas like the Ring of Fire, increase the likelihood. The article clarifies that tsunamis differ from regular waves, traveling as fast as airplanes in deep ocean with low height, but slowing down and gaining dangerous height in shallow waters. It emphasizes the importance of taking tsunami warnings seriously due to their immense power and potential for debris.</p>

          <h2>Thriving Communities of Extreme Life Discovered in Deep Ocean Trenches</h2>

          <p>An expedition to the deepest parts of the northwest Pacific Ocean has revealed "thriving communities" of strange, extreme life, observed, filmed, and photographed at depths exceeding 9 kilometers. Using the submersible Fendouzhe, a Chinese-led research team documented beds of clams, bacterial mats, and fields of tube worms, pushing the boundaries of known deep-sea life. These creatures, living in pitch darkness under immense pressure, are fueled by chemicals seeping from the ocean floor. The findings challenge long-held assumptions about life's potential at such extreme depths and suggest these chemosynthetic communities are more widespread than previously thought, inspiring future studies into their adaptation mechanisms.</p>

          <p>The article explores the complex and often debated effects of screen time on children's brains, challenging widespread concerns that it inherently causes negative outcomes like depression or behavioral problems. Psychology professors Pete Etchells and Andrew Przybylski argue that concrete scientific evidence for significant downsides is often lacking or flawed, with many studies relying on self-reporting and failing to account for other factors like loneliness. While acknowledging the risks of online harms like grooming, the article suggests that the term "screen time" is too broad, as different types of engagement yield varied experiences. Some research even indicates potential benefits for well-being.</p>

          <p>A powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, one of the largest ever recorded, resulted in surprisingly minimal tsunami damage to populated areas despite widespread alerts. Scientists explain that the tsunami's energy was primarily directed into the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to weaken before reaching more populated coastlines. While local areas near the epicenter saw damage, distant regions like California experienced much smaller waves than feared. The article highlights improved tsunami warning systems and the importance of location and directionality in determining a tsunami's impact, underscoring that not all large quakes lead to catastrophe.</p>
