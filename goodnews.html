          <p>China has taken a significant step in its advanced nuclear energy program by completing the conceptual design for a commercial-scale, fourth-generation fast neutron reactor. The CFR-1000 is a gigawatt-level facility that aims to be more fuel-efficient and is part of a global race to develop more advanced nuclear power sources. The design's completion was announced at an event attended by top officials from China's national energy and atomic authorities. Awaiting final approval, the reactor is projected to become operational after 2030, positioning China as a key player in the future of nuclear technology.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. After a period of low scoring, the team has now scored five or more runs in seven of its last ten games. Teoscar Hernández was a key contributor, hitting a crucial two-run homer in the eighth inning to provide insurance runs. Andy Pages also continued his recent hot streak with multiple key hits. The improved offensive output supported a solid start from pitcher Emmet Sheehan and a scoreless performance from the bullpen, giving the team a positive start to their road trip.</p>

          <h2>China's Quantitative Hedge Funds Recruit Top Talent Amid US University Funding and Visa Issues</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 22:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese quantitative hedge funds are capitalizing on challenges faced by foreign PhD students in the United States, such as funding cuts and stricter visa policies, to recruit top talent. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to attract scientists and engineers who might have otherwise stayed in the US. This brain drain is helping fuel the expansion of China's rapidly growing quant sector, which is leveraging artificial intelligence to manage investments in the country's $11 trillion market. The trend reflects a shift in the global competition for top-tier financial and technical expertise, benefiting China's domestic financial industry.</p>

          <h2>Taiwan Holds High-Stakes Recall Election Targeting Opposition Lawmakers</h2>

          <p>Voters in Taiwan are participating in a historic mass recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The referendum could potentially shift the balance of power in parliament, giving President Lai Ching-te's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) a majority. The recall effort was initiated by civic groups after the KMT, in alliance with the Taiwan People's Party, obstructed the president's agenda and passed controversial reforms. Critics accuse the KMT of being beholden to China, which has loomed large over the vote amid warnings of interference from Beijing. The outcome depends on turnout and a majority vote in favor of recalling.</p>

          <p>A Leicester salon owner is preparing for a pivotal hearing in her three-year legal battle with cosmetics giant L'Oréal over a trademark dispute. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of the 'nkd' salon, found her trademark renewal opposed by L'Oréal, which owns the 'Naked' makeup brand and claims consumer confusion. Dowdeswell, who has spent over £30,000 in legal fees, argues there has been no evidence of confusion in her 15 years of business. The case, which was delayed due to a backlog at the UK's Intellectual Property Office, highlights the challenges small businesses face when confronting large corporations over intellectual property rights.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom experienced its warmest and sunniest spring on record, leading to a noticeable boom in certain insect populations like ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm weather created ideal conditions for aphids, a primary food source, and allowed butterflies to emerge weeks earlier than average, resulting in a strong year after a poor 2024. However, the associated lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying out wetland habitats and affecting egg-laying. While a welcome sight for many, the boom is set against a longer-term trend of declining flying insect populations across the UK.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against Chicago's sanctuary city policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents. The judge ruled that the city's policies do not illegally obstruct federal operations and are protected by the Tenth Amendment. The lawsuit, filed in February, was part of a broader administration effort to challenge sanctuary laws in various cities across the country. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both praised the ruling, affirming their commitment to policies they argue enhance public safety by allowing police to focus on local community needs.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the story of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in the late 1940s amid investigations by the House Un-American Activities Committee into alleged Communist influence in the film industry. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were jailed and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. It details how the anti-Communist fervor expanded, ruining the careers of hundreds of creatives, and how some, like screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, continued to work under pseudonyms. The exhibit raises enduring questions about free speech, privacy, and democracy.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a critical mission to save the state's dwindling bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease over the last five years. In a rescue effort, dozens of healthy sheep, including pregnant ewes, were captured from the last disease-free herd and airlifted over 200 miles to an isolated mountain range. The goal is to establish a new, protected colony away from the diseases spread by non-native animals. A recent follow-up visit revealed the relocated herd is surviving and has already produced new lambs, offering a hopeful sign for the species' recovery in the state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article examines common health and wellness targets, questioning whether strict adherence to numbers like drinking eight glasses of water or getting eight hours of sleep is necessary for a healthy life. Experts suggest that while these benchmarks provide useful guidance, individual needs vary greatly. For instance, a kidney specialist argues that for most healthy people, thirst is a reliable guide for hydration. While getting sufficient sleep is deemed critical with little room for compromise, experts advise a more flexible approach to exercise and mindfulness, emphasizing consistency over hitting precise targets. The overall message is to incorporate healthy habits without becoming overly fixated on achieving perfect numbers.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, with researchers now focusing on the unique ways elite sport affects the female body, moving away from a 'mini-men' approach. This includes studying breast biomechanics and the performance impact of sports bras, the effects of the menstrual cycle on performance and injury risk, and why female athletes have a higher susceptibility to certain injuries like ACL tears. The article highlights how open discussions about periods, proper equipment, and tailored training are not only improving performance at the elite level but also helping to reduce the number of young girls who drop out of sports.</p>

The national debt currently stands at over $36 trillion and has been growing annually for more than two decades under both political parties. Since 1996, voluntary public contributions have totaled around $67.3 million, a small fraction of the government's daily spending, but the new option offers a more accessible way for citizens to contribute.
