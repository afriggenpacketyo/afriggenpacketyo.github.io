        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced that maintenance grants will be reintroduced for some university students in England by 2029, a decade after they were abolished. The grants, which do not need to be repaid, will be targeted at tens of thousands of students from lower-income households who are enrolled in courses deemed essential to the national industrial strategy. The policy will be funded by a new levy on international student fees. While the move has been welcomed by student groups as a step toward addressing the rising cost of living, some critics have raised concerns about taxing international students to fund domestic ones.</p>

          <p>Luxury brand Coach is opening a series of coffee shops attached to its retail stores as a strategy to enhance customer experience and strengthen its connection with younger shoppers, particularly Gen Z. These cafes offer specialty drinks and branded pastries, providing a more accessible entry point to the Coach brand than its high-end leather goods. The company plans to open 12 to 15 new locations globally each year, building on the success of initial test locations that have reportedly driven significant increases in foot traffic and overall store sales. This move is part of Coach's broader effort to become a $10 billion brand.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is strengthening in the Atlantic and is forecast to become a hurricane on Tuesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is currently bringing heavy rain to the northwestern Bahamas, but its projected path shows it turning away from the southeastern U.S. and moving toward Bermuda later in the week. While direct impact on the U.S. mainland is not expected, swells generated by Imelda, along with Hurricane Humberto, will affect the Bahamas and much of the U.S. East Coast, creating dangerous surf and rip current conditions.</p>

          <h2>Trump to Attend Unprecedented Meeting of Top U.S. Military Commanders</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to attend an extraordinary meeting of nearly every top U.S. military commander at Quantico, Virginia. The summons has fueled widespread speculation about its purpose, with some suggesting it could precede mass cuts to the general officer corps, a stated goal of War Secretary Pete Hegseth. Trump, however, described the gathering as a celebratory event focused on military success and "esprit de corps." The meeting represents a major logistical challenge, concentrating hundreds of generals and admirals in one location, and has prompted questions from lawmakers about its cost and necessity.</p>

          <p>Moldova's ruling pro-European Action and Solidarity (PAS) party has secured a clear victory in the country's parliamentary election, defying polls to retain its absolute majority. The party garnered over 50% of the vote, dealing a significant blow to the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc, which received only 24%. The result is being interpreted as a strong rejection of Russian influence and an affirmation of Moldova's path toward the European Union. PAS leader Igor Grosu celebrated the outcome as a win for the Moldovan people against a campaign of misinformation and illegal financing allegedly backed by Moscow.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 10:49:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the housing market shifts, experts suggest that this fall could present a unique opportunity for homebuyers, though potential drawbacks exist. Advantages include less competition compared to the peak spring and summer seasons and the possibility of lenders offering year-end incentives. However, the trade-off is often a lower inventory of homes for sale. While mortgage rates have recently declined following a Federal Reserve rate cut, there is a chance they could drop further, meaning buyers who act now might miss out on even lower rates later, though waiting also carries risks.

          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing careers in skilled trades like plumbing and electrical work over traditional four-year college degrees. This shift is driven by concerns over high tuition costs, student loan debt, and the increasing threat of artificial intelligence automating white-collar, entry-level jobs. According to a recent survey, 77% of Gen Z members consider it important that their future job is difficult to automate. As a result, professions that require hands-on skills are losing their former stigma and are now seen as providing greater job security and viable paths to entrepreneurship.</p>

          <p>The $55 billion acquisition of Electronic Arts by a group including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) marks a significant expansion of the kingdom's presence in the global gaming industry.

Critics worry this debt could pressure EA to prioritize cash flow for repayments, potentially limiting investment in new game development and possibly leading to operational cuts.

          <p>A Chinese military journal has provided new details on the Liaoyuan-1 (LY-1) shipborne laser weapon, which was unveiled at a recent military parade. According to the publication, the LY-1 is designed to serve as a "last line of defence" for naval vessels, tasked with intercepting close-range threats like incoming missiles and drones. The article claims the system's power output and overall structure, including its lens aperture, are superior to comparable American laser weapons such as the Helios system. The LY-1 is expected to be integrated into a layered air-defense network alongside existing missile systems on Chinese warships.</p>
