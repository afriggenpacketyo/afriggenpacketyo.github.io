        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane. Baldoni accused them of civil extortion and defamation after Lively filed a complaint alleging sexual harassment and retaliation, which Baldoni denied. A defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which initially reported Lively's complaint, was also dismissed. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete victory, while Baldoni's representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment, with Baldoni having the option to amend some claims by June 23.</p>

          <p>Savers could earn between $216 and $880 with a $20,000 short-term certificate of deposit (CD) opened this June, depending on the term length and interest rate. Short-term CDs, ranging from three to twelve months, offer higher rates than long-term CDs currently, providing an opportunity for a sizable return with less risk of sacrificing access to funds. While high-yield savings accounts offer similar flexibility, their rates are variable and subject to change, making CDs a more stable option. Opening a short-term CD can protect savings against market volatility while ensuring growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll shows a record divergence between men and women on their support for abortion rights, three years after the overturn of Roe v Wade. Sixty-one percent of women identify as "pro-choice," compared to only 41% of men, marking the largest gap in decades of polling. This shift is attributed more to increased support among women since Roe's collapse than to changes in men's attitudes. The poll also reveals a record disagreement over the morality of abortion, with 57% of women and 40% of men viewing it as moral.</p>

One company will focus on streaming and studios, while the other, Global Networks, will house legacy cable networks and TNT Sports. The decision leaves the fate of live sports rights held by TNT uncertain, as U.S. sports have not been a major driver of HBO Max sign-ups. TNT Sports could be licensed to the Streaming and Studios business, merged with another entity, or monetized differently, with potential tax implications to consider.</p>
