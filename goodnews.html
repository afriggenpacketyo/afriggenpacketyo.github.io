          <p>With campaigning beginning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, Tokyo police are enhancing security measures to prevent lone-wolf attacks.  This heightened alert follows several attacks targeting politicians in recent years, including the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  The police are monitoring social media, collaborating with real estate groups, and increasing patrols to deter potential threats. The election is considered a key indicator for the upcoming national House of Councillors election.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco issued an order halting Secretary of State Marco Rubio's plans to downsize the State Department, citing a previous injunction.  The judge ruled that the administration's actions violated the injunction, which prohibits significant reorganization and personnel cuts without Congressional approval. The State Department had argued that its recent reorganization was independent of the president's directive. The judge's order requires the State Department to seek court approval before taking any further actions.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's review of the Aukus security pact has raised questions about the future of the agreement and the U.S.'s broader Indo-Pacific strategy. While some see this as a potential shift away from the agreement, analysts suggest that the U.S.'s focus on countering China is unlikely to change significantly. The review is seen as a potential adjustment to the U.S.'s approach in the region, rather than a complete abandonment of the pact.</p>
