          <p>In a rare television interview, Prince William has described 2024 as the "hardest year" of his life. This difficult period for the royal family included cancer diagnoses and treatments for both his wife, Catherine, Princess of Wales, and his father, King Charles. The Prince of Wales shared his reflections during a conversation with actor Eugene Levy for the Apple TV+ series "The Reluctant Traveler." He emphasized the importance of overcoming life's tests, stating they are what ultimately shape a person's character.</p>

          <p>West Ham United has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach following the dismissal of Graham Potter. The decision came after a poor start to the season, with the club positioned 19th in the Premier League table after securing only three points from their first five matches. Potter's eight-month tenure ended due to results and performances failing to meet the club's expectations. Nuno, formerly the manager of Nottingham Forest, is expected to take charge before the team's upcoming match against Everton.</p>

          <p>A six-year-old girl from Miami, Imani Dell, was diagnosed with a medulloblastoma, a fast-growing brain tumor, after her family noticed her eyes were crossed. What was initially thought to be a minor issue led to an emergency room visit and a CT scan that revealed a golf-ball sized mass in her brain. Following a successful surgery to remove the tumor, Imani underwent 30 rounds of radiation and nine cycles of chemotherapy over the course of a year. Having completed her treatment in August 2025, she is now recovering, returning to school, and showing positive signs in her follow-up scans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aerospace company Honeywell is testing a new cockpit alert system, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), designed to give pilots more time to react to potential runway collisions. The technology was demonstrated by recreating recent near-disasters, showing how automated warnings could have provided pilots with crucial extra seconds to avoid accidents. This development comes amid rising concerns over serious runway incursions at U.S. airports, which reached a decade high in 2023. While not yet required by regulators, the system is expected to be certified next year and is being adopted by some airlines like Southwest and American Airlines.</p>

          <p>The "dirty soda" trend, which involves adding flavored syrups and cream to carbonated drinks, is experiencing a surge in popularity across the United States. Originating from the Utah-based chain Swig in 2010, the concept has been embraced by major corporations including PepsiCo, McDonald's, and Taco Bell, who are introducing their own versions. This innovation is revitalizing the soda category, which has seen decades of declining consumption, by attracting younger consumers and offering a new form of customizable beverage. The trend's success is seen as an affordable and accessible treat for consumers and a simple menu addition for restaurants.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Reflects on First Amendment Principles Through the Lens of the 1977 Skokie March Case</h2>

          <p>This opinion article revisits the 1977 legal battle where the ACLU defended a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, a community with many Holocaust survivors. The case raised fundamental questions about whether the First Amendment protects offensive and hateful speech. The author interviews David Goldberger, the Jewish ACLU lawyer who argued the case, who reflects on the personal pain it caused but reaffirms the core principle of free speech. Goldberger argues that if speech can be denied because it is offensive, then any speech can be suppressed, emphasizing that the right must apply even when we disagree with the content.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Nexstar and Sinclair's Boycott of Jimmy Kimmel's Show Reveals Limits of Their Power Against ABC</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major broadcast groups Nexstar and Sinclair recently boycotted "Jimmy Kimmel Live" after ABC reinstated the host, but they quickly reversed their decision. This article analyzes the standoff as a failed power play, arguing that while these consolidated station groups have significant influence, the network ultimately holds more leverage. The boycott was more costly for the local affiliates, who lost viewers and ad revenue by replacing the popular show with local programming. ABC's ultimate threat would have been to withhold highly valuable content like college football, demonstrating that the network still controls the most critical programming assets.</p>

          <p>"The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, with its legacy kept alive by dedicated fan groups and "shadowcast" performers around the world. These groups, like the Michigan Rocky Horror Preservation Society, stage live performances in theaters while the film plays, engaging in call-and-response with the screen and meticulously recreating costumes. For decades, the film has served as a cultural touchstone and a safe space, particularly for the LGBTQ+ community, celebrating non-conformity and queer representation. Fans say the interactive experience fosters a unique sense of community that continues to thrive.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is promoting an "ambitious" youth migration agreement with the European Union, hoping it will improve the country's economic outlook ahead of the autumn Budget. The proposed scheme would allow young people aged 18-30 to live and work in the UK or EU for a set period, similar to existing agreements with countries like Australia and New Zealand. Reeves is urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential positive economic impact of such a deal into its official forecasts. The goal is to stimulate growth and potentially reduce the need for future tax increases or spending cuts.</p>

          <p>This opinion column discusses the importance of authenticity in Hollywood, sparked by recent stories from Leonardo DiCaprio and Benicio del Toro about early-career pressure to adopt less "ethnic" stage names. DiCaprio was reportedly advised to become "Lenny Williams," while Del Toro was pushed toward "Benny Del." The author uses a fictional fable about an aspiring actor who constantly changes his appearance to fit in, only to be told by a "Mystic Taco" vendor that the key to success is to be himself. The piece celebrates the fact that both actors rejected the advice and succeeded on their own terms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A simple self-check known as the "thumb test" could offer a clue about a person's risk for an aortic aneurysm. The test involves placing the thumb across the palm; if the thumb extends beyond the edge of the palm, it can indicate joint hypermobility associated with connective tissue diseases like Marfan syndrome. These conditions can weaken blood vessel walls, increasing aneurysm risk. However, cardiologists caution that the test is not a diagnostic tool, as most people with an aneurysm will have a negative result, and a positive result does not confirm an aneurysm is present. They advise anyone with a positive test to discuss it with their doctor.</p>
