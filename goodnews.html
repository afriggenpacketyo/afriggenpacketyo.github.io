          <p>Sir Ed Davey of the Liberal Democrats proposes offering new army recruits a ¬£10,000 bonus after completing training and serving for two years, along with a ¬£20,000 payment for former armed services personnel who return for two additional years. The proposal aims to increase the number of trained soldiers in response to global uncertainties, including concerns about Russia and the United States. The Liberal Democrats also advocate for a public awareness campaign to prepare British homes for potential conflicts or cyber-attacks. The plan anticipates raising defense spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027, funded by an increase in the Digital Services Tax.</p>

          <p>Japan has returned the remains of 10 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, marking the country's first such repatriation. The remains, taken in the 19th and 20th centuries, were held by Japanese research institutions and handed over in a ceremony at the Australian Embassy in Tokyo. This action is part of a global movement to return indigenous remains taken abroad for research or collection, and Australia has been working with institutions worldwide to secure the return of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander remains for over 30 years. The return of these remains is considered a step towards healing past injustices.</p>

He accused the White House of attempting to dehumanize anyone who disagrees with the administration.
