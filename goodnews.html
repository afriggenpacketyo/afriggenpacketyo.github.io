          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and his ministers are holding a cabinet retreat in Berlin to address pressing national issues and improve coalition unity after a difficult start. The main agenda focuses on boosting Germany's economic competitiveness by cutting bureaucratic red tape and reducing the size of the federal workforce. This meeting comes as public satisfaction with the ruling conservative-Social Democrat coalition has reached a record low. The government aims to adopt a modernization agenda to quickly deliver results for struggling German companies.</p>

          <p>A Chinese woman, Zhimin Qian, has been convicted in London for her central role in a massive money laundering operation involving over £5 billion in Bitcoin. She pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring the cryptocurrency, which was stolen from more than 128,000 victims in China between 2014 and 2017. After fleeing China, she attempted to launder the funds in the UK by purchasing property. The conviction follows a complex, seven-year investigation by London's Metropolitan Police, highlighting the increasing use of cryptocurrency in organized crime.</p>

The proposal includes a pathway to a Palestinian state, the immediate release of all hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and the removal of Hamas from power. It also outlines a transitional governance structure for Gaza, an economic development plan, and security guarantees enforced by the US and regional powers.

          <p>A Chinese court has sentenced 11 members of the Ming crime family to death for running extensive scam and gambling operations in Laukkaing, Myanmar. Dozens of other family members received lengthy prison sentences for crimes including telecommunications fraud, drug trafficking, and murder. The family was a key player in the region's "scamdemic," which lured and trapped tens of thousands of foreign nationals into forced labor. The harsh sentences signal Beijing's determination to crack down on cross-border criminal enterprises that have victimized Chinese citizens.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce a plan to launch an "NHS Online" hospital service in England by 2027, aimed at modernizing the health system and reducing patient waiting times. The digital service will feature dedicated doctors conducting assessments, consultations, and follow-up appointments virtually through the NHS app. Officials hope this initiative will deliver millions of appointments in its first few years, focusing on conditions that may not require inpatient treatment. The plan aims to increase efficiency and free up capacity for face-to-face care.</p>

          <p>Shares of Zijin Gold, the overseas mining unit of China's Zijin Mining, surged more than 60% during their first day of trading in Hong Kong. The company raised approximately $3.2 billion in its initial public offering, making it the world's second-largest IPO this year. The successful debut comes amid record-high gold prices, driven by global economic uncertainty and expectations of interest rate cuts. This strong performance signals a resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market, which has seen a dramatic year-over-year increase in funds raised. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued an injunction to halt a large-scale reduction in force at Voice of America and its parent agency, USAGM. In a sharply worded ruling, Judge Royce Lamberth criticized USAGM head Kari Lake, stating her actions showed a "brazen disinterest" in the agency's legal obligations to provide reliable news. The judge noted that mandated language services had been shut down and warned that the proposed cuts would cement these failures. The ruling keeps the workforce in place and requires the agency to present a plan to restore legally required programming.</p>

          <p>The 20-point peace plan for Gaza, unveiled by US President Donald Trump, has drawn reactions from leaders across the globe, with many welcoming the effort to end the conflict. European and Arab nations have urged all parties to consider the proposal, which is now being reviewed by Hamas negotiators. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called it the "best chance" for peace, while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan commended Trump's leadership.

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed that the Trump administration is urging Taiwan to help the U.S. manufacture half of its required semiconductors domestically. This "50-50" proposal aims to reduce America's heavy reliance on Taiwan, which currently produces over 90% of the world's most advanced chips. Lutnick argued that a more balanced production arrangement would enhance both nations' security, countering the "Silicon Shield" theory that Taiwan's chip dominance deters a Chinese invasion. The administration hopes to reach 40% domestic production by the end of the current presidential term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia's central bank has decided to keep its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 3.6%, citing concerns that inflation may be higher than previously expected. The move was widely anticipated by economists and follows recent data showing the country's headline inflation rate at a one-year high of 3%. In its statement, the Reserve Bank of Australia noted that while private demand is recovering, persistent inflation in some sectors remains a risk. The bank has already cut rates by 75 basis points this year to combat rising prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major grocery chains in China, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are revamping their stores to emulate the successful model of discount retailers like Aldi. They are reducing clutter and focusing on developing their own private-label brands to offer quality products at lower prices. This strategic shift is a response to a change in consumer behavior, as a slowing economy has made shoppers more frugal and value-oriented.
