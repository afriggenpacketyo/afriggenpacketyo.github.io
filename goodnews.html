          <p>The offshore yuan strengthened, breaking past the 7.2 level against the US dollar, driven by expectations that the US and China will begin negotiating a rollback of tariffs. President Trump indicated he might lower tariffs to facilitate business with China. Despite this optimism, analysts caution that negotiations will be lengthy and uncertain, potentially causing volatility in the exchange rate. While there is renewed interest in Chinese assets, global investors remain cautious and need tangible signs of China's ability to withstand Washington's challenges before increasing their investments.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim that "Shi's Star Catalogue," an astronomical list of celestial bodies, is the world‚Äôs oldest star log, dating back to around 335BC. This claim challenges the current recognition of the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece as the oldest. Researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming the approximate years of observations. Experts believe that astronomers from both China and Greece began studying the night sky in detail around the same time.</p>
