          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, turning day into night and creating dangerous conditions on major highways, according to this New York Times article. Visibility dropped to near-zero, prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings for the first time ever in Chicago. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Ill., was fueled by strong winds up to 70 mph lifting dust from exceptionally dry soil. This phenomenon, known as a haboob, is more common in the Middle East and hasn't significantly affected Chicago since the Dust Bowl era. The article highlights the unusual weather conditions and their impact on the region.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw made his season debut for the Dodgers after recovering from a bone spur, but struggled in the first inning, giving up three runs, as detailed in this Los Angeles Times article. Despite recovering to pitch three more innings, the Angels ultimately won the game 11-9, highlighted by Logan O‚ÄôHoppe‚Äôs career-high five RBIs. Kershaw's return is crucial for the Dodgers, who are missing three starters due to injury. The article also notes Shohei Ohtani's progress in his recovery from elbow surgery.

          <p>Dan Richards' guest essay in The New York Times compares the contrasting approaches to rail travel in Europe and the United States, noting Europe's revitalization of sleeper train networks and high-speed rail. The author argues that while Europe embraces rail as a climate-friendly alternative to short-haul flights, the United States is sleepwalking into a transport dead end by slashing funding for public infrastructure. Richards criticizes America's car-centric culture and its tendency to invest in unproven transportation projects rather than reliable rail systems. He advocates for revitalized railways as a means to connect communities, reduce car dependence, and rediscover the American dream.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who had been living in eastern Congo since the 1994 genocide, returned home on Saturday, facilitated by the U.N. refugee agency after Rwandan-backed rebels seized key parts of the region, according to NPR. The majority of the refugees were women and children, and the repatriation aims to resettle 2,000 individuals. These refugees were among the hundreds of thousands of Hutus who fled Rwanda after the genocide, with many expressing a deep connection to a homeland they had never known. The return is based on a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR, with over 101,000 refugees already repatriated.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a "groundbreaking" fiber-optic gyroscope that maintains stability across a wide temperature range, potentially improving navigation for aircraft, ships, and oil rigs, according to the South China Morning Post. These gyroscopes sense orientation and turning rates, playing a vital role in inertial navigation systems that operate without external signals. The article emphasizes the importance of these systems for military and security applications due to their immunity to interference. The new gyroscope could replace traditional mechanical gyroscopes with a simpler and more reliable alternative.</p>

          <p>In an emotional and widely shared moment, President Donald J. Trump spoke directly with Edan Alexander, the 21-year-old American-Israeli soldier who was recently freed from Hamas captivity, during a phone call captured on camera and released by the White House, according to Fox News. Alexander said "You‚Äôre the only reason I‚Äôm here. You saved my life." Trump greeted Alexander with a bit of humor and humility, saying "I'm very nervous talking to you, Edan, because you're a much bigger celebrity than I am." This phone conversation came just days after his dramatic release from Gaza, where he was held hostage for over 580 days following his abduction by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023.</p>
