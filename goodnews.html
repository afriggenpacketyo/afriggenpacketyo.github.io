          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is alerting social media users about fraudulent advertisements offering discounted vehicle registration renewals. These deceptive ads request personal information and payments through unofficial channels like Cash App, which the DMV never uses. The DMV advises residents to renew their vehicle registration only through the official DMV website, at a DMV kiosk, or by making an appointment at a DMV office. State law prohibits the DMV from offering discounted vehicle registration renewals, and the safest way to renew is directly through the official DMV website.</p>

          <p>Shari Redstone, chairwoman and controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, has been diagnosed with thyroid cancer and is undergoing treatment while continuing her professional and philanthropic activities. The news comes as Redstone navigates a turbulent sales process for Paramount, including a government review of the Skydance Media sale complicated by President Trump's lawsuit against Paramount and CBS. Redstone told the New York Times that she had surgery to remove her thyroid gland, but the cancer had spread to her vocal cords and she continues to receive radiation treatment. The Redstone family controls 77% of the voting shares of Paramount, and the company faces pressures from consumers' shift to streaming, impacting revenue from cable channels.</p>

          <p>This article reviews three new film releases: "Ballerina," a spin-off of the John Wick saga starring Ana de Armas, praised for its action sequences despite a weak plot; "Dangerous Animals," a suspenseful thriller about a psychopathic tour guide, noted for its compelling performances and restraint in gore; and "The Ritual," a horror film featuring Al Pacino as a priest involved in a 1928 exorcism, criticized for its uninspired direction and reliance on jump scares. "Ballerina" offers entertainment through impressive fight choreography, while "Dangerous Animals" generates unease with its suspenseful atmosphere, and "The Ritual" may appeal to those fascinated by exorcism themes, despite its shortcomings. The reviewer notes the summer season approaches as studios release their most commercially viable creations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Handwritten notes have revealed Winston Churchill's concern and frustration over the slow progress of securing penicillin supplies in time for D-Day. Despite penicillin being a British discovery by Professor Alexander Fleming in 1928, the UK lagged behind the US in large-scale production, and Churchill expressed disappointment that Britain couldn't produce more. Early in 1944, he complained to his ministers about Britain's inability to produce penicillin at scale, and shortly before D-Day, health officials reported that sufficient supplies had been obtained, mostly from the US, but only for battle casualties. The first true antibiotic would not be fully available to the general public until 1946.</p>

          <p>Beyonc√© launched her London residency of the Cowboy Carter tour at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, delivering a nearly three-hour spectacle featuring songs from her new country album. The performance included elaborate costumes, seamless transitions, and homages to black performers segregated from the country scene. Despite the show's quality, slow ticket sales and high prices have been a major topic, with promoters slashing prices before the shows. The setlist heavily featured tracks from the Grammy-winning Cowboy Carter album, blending them with some of her biggest hits, while Beyonc√©'s daughter Blue Ivy made several appearances during the show.</p>

          <p>The Labour government in England is set to mandate that most new build homes must be fitted with solar panels under changes to be published this year. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated that this move is "just common sense" and will save the typical household ¬£500 a year on their energy bills. The regulations will require developers to add panels unless the buildings fall under certain exemptions such as being covered by shade, and the government says it will be published in autumn but there will be a transitional period for developers to adjust to the regulation changes. The Home Builders Federation supports fitting more panels but cautions against introducing burdensome paperwork that could hinder efforts to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029.</p>
