          <p>Todd Blanche, a high-ranking official in the Department of Justice, is scheduled to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell in Tallahassee, where she is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. The meeting's purpose is to discuss the case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, for whom Maxwell was a key associate. Blanche stated that the DOJ is reaching out to Maxwell to determine what she knows, emphasizing that "no one is above the law" and "no lead is off-limits." This development follows his announcement that he intended to meet with her at the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p>

          <p>Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley is reportedly preparing to run for the U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina being vacated by Republican Thom Tillis. His potential candidacy is said to have the endorsement of the White House. On the Democratic side, former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is also expected to announce his bid for the seat next week. The developments come after President Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, announced she would not be running, setting the stage for a high-profile battleground contest in the 2026 election cycle.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is set to test a new lineup of beverages, including cold brews, refreshers, and flavored sodas, in more than 500 restaurants in Wisconsin, Colorado, and nearby areas. The move aims to attract younger consumers and capitalize on the trend of customizable, flavorful cold drinks, a market where competitors like Dutch Bros. have found success. This test follows the company's decision to close its beverage-focused spinoff, CosMc's, and instead integrate similar drink concepts into its main restaurants. The initiative could help boost the chain's recent lackluster sales by driving more customer traffic.</p>

          <p>A pair of runaway wallabies prompted a multi-day, cross-border pursuit after escaping from their owner's property in Mouscron, Belgium. The marsupials were spotted hopping through urban areas, with footage of their journey going viral online. Firefighters in Wattrelos, France, successfully captured one of the wallabies in a residential garden and returned it to its enclosure in Belgium. However, the second wallaby remains at large, and authorities are relying on public sightings to locate it, adding a peculiar chapter to recent instances of fugitive marsupials in populated areas.</p>

          <p>An Indonesian court has spared three British nationals the death penalty for smuggling nearly a kilogram of cocaine into Bali. Lisa Stocker, Jon Collyer, and Phineas Float were arrested in February after the drugs were discovered hidden in packets of a powdered dessert mix. Instead of facing execution, which is a possible punishment for drug trafficking under Indonesian law, the judge sentenced them to a 12-month prison term. After accounting for time already served, the three could be eligible for release by early 2026, a lenient outcome in a country known for its severe drug laws.</p>

          <p>Tanya Simon, a 25-year veteran of "60 Minutes" and daughter of late correspondent Bob Simon, has been appointed as the newsmagazine's new executive producer.

Her appointment has been met with relief by the program's staff, who had urged parent company Paramount to choose an internal candidate. Simon takes the helm during a challenging period, following a controversial $16 million settlement paid to President Trump, which has raised concerns about the program's future editorial independence.</p>

          <p>Utility company Southern California Edison (SCE) has announced it will establish a compensation fund for victims of the deadly Eaton wildfire from January, even before investigators have officially determined the fire's cause. The voluntary program was developed with the administrators of the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund to offer an expedited process for resolving claims without lengthy litigation. While the cause is still under investigation, a leading theory suggests that SCE's aging equipment may have sparked the blaze. The move comes as dozens of lawsuits have been filed against the utility by affected families and the city of Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Following widespread protests and concern from Western partners, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced a new draft law to guarantee the independence of the country's anti-corruption agencies. This move reverses a recently passed law that had placed the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) under the control of the president-appointed prosecutor general. The initial legislation sparked Ukraine's largest protests since the 2022 invasion, with critics fearing it would undermine the fight against corruption, a key requirement for the country's potential EU membership.</p>
