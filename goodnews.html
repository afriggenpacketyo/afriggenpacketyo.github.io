          <p>Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese downplayed a heated moment during the Indiana Fever's 93-58 victory over the Chicago Sky after Clark committed a flagrant foul on Reese. Both players characterized the incident as a routine "basketball play," despite the on-court tension and their history of rivalry dating back to their college careers. The game, which featured a sold-out crowd, saw Clark achieve a triple-double, while Reese led the Sky with 17 rebounds, with crew chief Roy Gulbeyan saying that the foul met the criteria for flagrant foul 1.</p>

Liu, who had voluntarily signed up and was assigned to an armed police force, repeatedly requested to leave the army. As a result, he is now banned from working for the government or state-owned enterprises, faces a fine of 38,000 yuan (US$5,300), and is restricted from traveling abroad, studying, opening a business, or enjoying preferential loan policies for two years.

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs on increased prices, asserting that the company should "eat the tariffs" instead of passing the costs onto consumers. This followed Walmart's warning that tariffs could lead to higher prices on various goods. Trump suggested that Walmart, which made billions in profits, should sacrifice its earnings to support his economic agenda, while a Walmart spokesperson responded that they would keep prices as low as possible given small retail margins, with this reflecting the tension between the administration's trade policies and the concerns of major American companies.</p>

This aligns with SNP leader John Swinney's view that "demonstrable support" is necessary for another vote. Gove emphasized the importance of continually demonstrating the benefits of the UK union and warned against complacency. While Gove acknowledged potential disagreements with the Scottish government, he also suggested that the SNP's ability to improve public services could influence the likelihood of a second referendum.</p>
