          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return to pitching, throwing two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he recorded the fastest pitch of his MLB career at 101.7 mph but was unable to contribute offensively, going hitless in four at-bats with three strikeouts. Despite his strong performance on the mound, the Dodgers' five-game winning streak was snapped in a 9-5 loss. The game also featured a career-high 22nd home run for Chicago Cubs hitter Seiya Suzuki in a separate matchup.</p>

          <p>President Trump's major domestic policy and spending package cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate, advancing after a dramatic late-night vote. The motion passed 51-49 after several Republican holdouts eventually voted in favor, narrowly avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The contentious 940-page bill now moves to a final vote, which is expected early next week. However, its passage remains uncertain as it must also be approved again by the House, where some Republicans have already voiced opposition to the Senate's version.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to encourage customers to make healthier food purchases. Under the voluntary plan, retailers will decide on strategies such as offering promotions on healthy items, adjusting loyalty point systems, or changing store layouts to make nutritious options more accessible. The initiative, which includes retailers reporting on healthy food sales to increase accountability, is part of a broader government strategy to tackle rising obesity rates and reduce pressure on the National Health Service. Critics note the success of past voluntary programs has been mixed.</p>

          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new strategy to improve results for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Athletes are now living together in a "virtual athletes' village" during competitions to simulate the Olympic environment and build resilience to unfamiliar conditions. The initiative aims to help swimmers, especially younger ones, adapt to challenges like travel delays without it affecting their performance. The communal living arrangement is also credited with boosting team morale and motivation ahead of the upcoming world championships.</p>

          <p>China's decision to halt rare earth exports is accelerating efforts to establish alternative production capabilities in other countries, though the process is expected to be costly and challenging. American firm REalloys announced plans for a US$50 million facility to produce high-performance magnet materials, sourcing ore from Brazil and processing it in Canada. Analysts suggest that building a non-Chinese supply chain will be a protracted endeavor due to technical hurdles. It may also require government subsidies and tariffs to compete with China's long-standing dominance in the global rare earths market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, UK, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, which is planned for a nationwide rollout by 2026, educates students on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen correctly. Health experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, the program aims to instill lifelong habits and empower the next generation to protect themselves from harmful UV exposure.</p>

The H2A series, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, has achieved a 98% success rate over its long service.

The large turnout was seen as a direct response to government efforts to ban the event, citing a controversial "Child Protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, celebrated the march as a peaceful show of defiance against a "hateful power." The event drew a diverse crowd, including many who were motivated to attend specifically because of the government's attempted ban.</p>
