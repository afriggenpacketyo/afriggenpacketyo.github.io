          <p>The Society of Radiographers is cautioning patients against filming their medical treatments for platforms like TikTok and Instagram, citing risks to both themselves and NHS staff. Concerns include staff distraction, discomfort, and the potential exposure of private medical data of other individuals in the hospital environment. One radiographer described an incident where a patient's relative began filming during treatment setup, while another recounted a patient covertly recording staff for a cancer blog. The union is advocating for clearer NHS policies to address this emerging issue and protect patient privacy and staff well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focusing on the global arms export market, driven by security concerns and a desire to deepen ties with allies. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani has expressed interest in promoting Japan's defense exports, signaling a shift in policy previously restricted to domestic needs. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's attendance at a defense exhibition further underscores this change. This move aims to improve interoperability with partner nations and bolster Japan's defense industrial base, which has faced challenges due to reliance on U.S. weapons imports. The country hopes to achieve economies of scale and make domestic production more viable.</p>

          <p>A Detroit Police sergeant, Shannon Jones, inspired by photographs of missing loved ones, initiated Operation UNITED to exhume unidentified crime victims buried in paupers' graves and use DNA analysis to identify them. Partnering with FBI Special Agent Leslie Larsen, they located approximately 200 cold cases dating back to 1959. To date, Operation UNITED has successfully identified 33 individuals, providing closure to anguished families, including Kristina Morris, whose father's remains were identified after disappearing in 1995. The project has garnered national attention, with other cities seeking to implement similar initiatives to resolve their own cold cases.</p>

          <p>Singer Nezza performed a Spanish version of "The Star-Spangled Banner," also known as "El Pend√≥n Estrellado," at Dodger Stadium, after being advised to sing it in English. Nezza's decision was in response to ongoing immigration sweeps throughout Los Angeles. The performance has sparked discussions about Clotilde Arias, the composer who created the Spanish translation in 1945 at the request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Arias' version, "El Pend√≥n Estrellado," was accepted as the only official Spanish translation of the national anthem, but her contribution remained largely unknown until 2006.</p>
