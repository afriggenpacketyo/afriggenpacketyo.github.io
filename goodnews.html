          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch's stock price jumped 25% despite the retailer reducing its profit forecast because of expected $50 million hit from tariffs. While the company anticipates full-year earnings per share to fall between $9.50 and $10.50, down from the previous $10.40 to $11.40 range, it raised its revenue outlook. The company now projects net sales growth of 3% to 6%, an increase from the earlier 3% to 5% estimate, however, its operating margin forecast was also reduced. The first-quarter results exceeded Wall Street expectations, with earnings per share at $1.59 versus the expected $1.39, and revenue reaching $1.10 billion against the anticipated $1.07 billion (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) is suing North Carolina and its State Board of Elections for allegedly failing to maintain accurate voter lists, violating the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). The lawsuit claims the state's voter registration form did not clearly require applicants to provide either a driver's license number or the last four digits of their social security number. The DOJ seeks a court order requiring North Carolina to develop a plan to contact voters with incomplete records and obtain the necessary identifying information within 30 days. The state election board acknowledges the issue, with the new board indicating a willingness to comply with federal law.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as the automotive industry faces regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030. This expansion comes amid potential changes to emissions regulations, including President Trump's expected elimination of California's Advanced Clean Cars II rule. Toyota's focus on PHEVs reflects a strategy to offer consumers a stepping stone to full electrification while addressing concerns about range and charging infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to a sensitive Treasury Department system that controls trillions of dollars in federal payments. Judge Jeannette Vargas permitted four DOGE employees to access the Bureau of the Fiscal Service after the Trump administration established a system to train employees to prevent improper disclosures. This ruling marks a victory for DOGE, which faced legal challenges in February when it initially sought access to the Treasury Department's payment systems. The attorneys general did not object to allowing DOGE‚Äôs access if the employees were properly trained.</p>
