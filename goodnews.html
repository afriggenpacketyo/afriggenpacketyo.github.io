          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, has upheld a Texas law requiring pornography websites to verify the age of their visitors. The ruling affirms that states have the authority to implement such measures to prevent minors from accessing sexually explicit material. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, stated the law does not unconstitutionally burden adults' First Amendment rights. The dissenting justices argued that the law should be subject to stricter judicial review as it impedes adult access to constitutionally protected speech.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. stock indexes, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, opened at record highs, driven by investor optimism about potential trade deals and an anticipated interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.

This market rally reflects easing concerns over tariff policies and a strong performance in technology stocks.

          <p>A large, bright meteorite, described as a fireball, was observed across Georgia and South Carolina before exploding over Georgia with the force of approximately 20 tons of TNT. NASA reported the meteor was about three feet in diameter and weighed over a ton, creating a pressure wave that caused sonic booms heard by local residents. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the event, which occurred during daylight hours. Experts suggest the fireball may have been part of the Beta Taurid meteor shower, noting that such daylight sightings are rare phenomena.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has stated that the team is in discussions with reigning world champion Max Verstappen about a potential move for the 2026 Formula 1 season. Verstappen is currently contracted with Red Bull until 2028, but his deal is believed to contain exit clauses. Russell's comments suggest his own contract negotiations with Mercedes may be influenced by the team's pursuit of Verstappen. The potential move is significant given Red Bull's recent performance dip and Mercedes' progress, particularly as new engine regulations are set to be introduced in 2026.</p>

          <p>With auto insurance rates continuing to climb, experts suggest several key moments when consumers should consider switching providers. While prices are rising industry-wide due to factors like repair costs and severe weather, shopping around is advised if your current insurer doesn't offer the specific coverage you need. Other reasons to switch include seeking better customer service, wanting more policy choices than a captive agent can provide, or simply looking for better overall value. Experts recommend getting at least three quotes to compare prices, coverage options, and the claims reputation of different companies.</p>
