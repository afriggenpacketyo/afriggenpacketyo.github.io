          <p>Week two of the NFL season delivered several key matchups and significant developments across the league. The Philadelphia Eagles triumphed over the Kansas City Chiefs 20-17 in a Super Bowl rematch, extending their impressive winning streak. In a less fortunate turn, the Cincinnati Bengals secured a 31-27 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, but their win was overshadowed by a serious toe injury to star quarterback Joe Burrow, who is now expected to miss several weeks. Other notable results included the Dallas Cowboys beating the New York Giants in a thrilling overtime duel, and the Detroit Lions dominating the Chicago Bears.</p>

          <p>Midtown Atlanta's 10th Street NE and Piedmont Avenue NE will experience significant, round-the-clock closures for several weeks, beginning with intermittent lane closures on September 15 and full closures from September 17. The Department of Watershed Management is undertaking these extensive repairs to remove and replace existing sewer mains, aiming to address defects and enhance the overall capacity of the sewer system. Motorists are strongly advised to exercise caution, follow posted detours, and avoid the area if possible, with the work expected to conclude by mid to late October, weather permitting. Essential services will maintain access for local residents and businesses throughout the repair period.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a decisive 10-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants, winning their three-game series and maintaining a 2.5-game lead in the National League West standings. This offensive outburst showcased a renewed strategic approach, emphasizing fundamental hitting, shortening swings, and capitalizing on situational opportunities with runners on base, rather than an over-reliance on home runs. Pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance, settling down after early command issues to pitch 6.2 innings with only one run allowed. This consistent run manufacturing and pitching stability signals a promising shift for the team's playoff aspirations.</p>

The "XL" version of the unpiloted spacecraft is packed with spare parts, research materials, and even holiday treats for the orbiting crew, including specialized foods like clams and smoked salmon. This mission marks the third of at least four SpaceX flights contracted by Northrop Grumman while the company develops its own booster. The Falcon 9's first stage achieved a spectacular landing back at Cape Canaveral, and the Cygnus is expected to reach the ISS early Wednesday.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister has heralded a "golden age" of nuclear power as British and US companies announce five new commercial deals, strategically timed ahead of President Trump's state visit. These ambitious plans include a new 960MW advanced modular reactor plant in Hartlepool and data centers in Nottinghamshire powered by mini-reactors. The initiatives aim to significantly boost energy security, meet rapidly rising electricity demand, and fuel the burgeoning AI revolution, with both governments hoping a new Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy will streamline project development by cutting red tape. The article also notes the political backdrop of the Lord Mandelson scandal, which the visit aims to overshadow.</p>

          <p>Jim Edgar, a highly respected two-term Republican governor of Illinois, has died at the age of 79 from complications related to pancreatic cancer. Edgar is widely credited with guiding the state into a period of greater financial stability during the 1990s, notably by pushing legislators to cut the state budget and making a temporary income tax surcharge permanent to ensure stable funding for public schools. A moderate Republican, he later became a vocal critic of his party's shift to the right, even supporting Kamala Harris's presidential bid last year. Edgar's legacy is remembered for his integrity, pragmatism, and significant contributions to Illinois state government.</p>

          <p>Scholar Zheng Yongnian argues that China must proactively develop its own distinct knowledge system for artificial intelligence, moving beyond what he terms "intellectual colonialism" rooted in Western-centric frameworks. He expresses concerns that current Western social science theories, based on Western practices and experiences, are inadequate for explaining diverse civilizations like Confucian, Islamic, and Indian societies. Zheng emphasizes the critical importance of embracing China's unique secular civilization to foster an AI development path that is culturally relevant and allows the nation to play a proper, independent role in the evolving international order. This perspective highlights a strategic push for self-reliance in tech and academia.</p>
