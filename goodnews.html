          <p>Two key organizers of the 2022 "Freedom Convoy" protests in Canada, Tamara Lich and Chris Barber, have received conditional sentences, allowing them to avoid more time in prison. Found guilty of mischief, they will serve their 18-month sentences with a combination of home confinement and a curfew, plus community service. The protests, initially against a vaccine mandate for truckers, paralyzed the capital city of Ottawa for three weeks, prompting the government to invoke the Emergencies Act for the first time. A separate hearing will determine the potential seizure of a truck used in the demonstration.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, U.S. President Donald Trump described trade negotiations as "complicated" but predicted Canada will ultimately be "very happy" with the outcome. The tone of the meeting was notably more cordial than previous interactions with former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump acknowledged the "natural business conflict" between the neighboring countries, particularly in industries like automotive and steel, but emphasized a strong underlying relationship. Trade talks have continued past their initial deadline, with Canada being the only G7 nation yet to secure a new trade agreement with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The price of gold reached a record high on Tuesday, crossing the $4,000 per ounce threshold for the first time. This surge, which represents a nearly 94% increase since January 2024, is a boon for existing investors but presents a high barrier for new ones. The article suggests that factors like inflation and geopolitical instability are likely to drive prices even higher. For those looking to enter the market, it outlines more affordable strategies such as purchasing fractional gold, employing dollar-cost averaging, or exploring gold-backed financial products like ETFs and IRAs.

          <p>Undrafted rookie Myles Price has made a significant impact as the Minnesota Vikings' kick and punt returner just five games into his NFL career. Price, who earned his spot after an impressive training camp, expresses confidence that he is on the verge of returning a kick for a touchdown every time he touches the ball. He details his preparation process, which involves studying opposing punters and focusing on fundamentals to track and secure the ball. Despite his success in college as a receiver, Price never scored on a return, a milestone he is now actively pursuing at the professional level.</p>

          <h2>Moroccan Gen Z Protests Organized Anonymously and Democratically via Discord Platform</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 13:12:00 EDT</div>

          <p>A youth-led protest movement in Morocco, known as Gen Z 212, is using the online platform Discord to organize the country's largest anti-government demonstrations in years. The group, which began with just four members and has grown to nearly 250,000, maintains anonymity for its organizers while using Discord's features to hold votes on strategy and share protest locations just before they begin. The movement was sparked by anger over conditions at a hospital but has since expanded to demand broad reforms in education, healthcare, and the judiciary. The decentralized, digital nature of the protests presents a new challenge for Moroccan authorities.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team maintained its winning start to the Women's World Cup with an unconvincing four-wicket victory over Bangladesh. Chasing a modest target of 179, England struggled against spin and slumped to 103-6 before a resilient, unbeaten partnership between captain Heather Knight (79) and Charlie Dean (27) guided them to the win. Knight's crucial innings came after she was given a reprieve by the third umpire on a contentious catch when she was on 13. The match highlighted England's ongoing difficulties against spin bowling, turning what should have been a straightforward win into a tense contest.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 12:46:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a compensation scheme for millions of drivers impacted by the mis-selling of car finance, with average payouts estimated at around £700 per person. The issue stems from discretionary commission arrangements where dealers were incentivized to charge higher interest rates, as well as other unfair contract terms. The total compensation payout from lenders could reach £8.2 billion, affecting 14 million finance agreements made between 2007 and 2024. The FCA stated it is time for customers to get fair compensation for these widespread practices.</p>

          <h2>Explainer Details Reasons for High US Prescription Drug Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 12:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States consistently has the highest prescription drug prices in the world, a reality shaped by a unique and complex healthcare system. Unlike countries with national health insurance that negotiate prices for their entire population, the U.S. market is fragmented among Medicare, Medicaid, and numerous private insurers, weakening its collective bargaining power. Furthermore, U.S. policy prioritizes broad access to all available drugs, limiting the ability to refuse coverage for a drug if a manufacturer's price is deemed too high. This system allows pharmaceutical companies to set prices much higher than in other developed nations.</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center has announced the formation of Tropical Storm Jerry over the central Atlantic Ocean, making it the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season.

Forecasters expect Jerry to steadily strengthen over the coming days, likely becoming a hurricane by the end of the week. While no direct landfall is currently predicted, the storm is expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents for the islands as it passes to the north.</p>
