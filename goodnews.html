          <p>Across the globe, cities have hosted vibrant Pride Month events throughout June, celebrating the LGBTQ community while also highlighting the ongoing struggle for equal rights and inclusion. These celebrations trace their origins to the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York City, a pivotal moment that catalyzed the modern LGBTQ rights movement. Since then, annual marches have become a tradition, gaining federal recognition in the U.S. in 1999. This year's events, from Kathmandu to Washington D.C., saw large crowds gather for parades and festivals, continuing the legacy of advocacy and community.</p>

          <p>Neysun Mahboubi, an expert on Chinese law and US-China relations at the University of Pennsylvania, suggests that the current strained relationship between the two nations has historical parallels and is likely to survive. Drawing a comparison to the period after the 1989 Tiananmen Square events, he notes that American students and scholars are once again beginning to return to China after the disruptions of the pandemic, acting as pioneers in re-establishing connections. Mahboubi, who recently led a student trip to China, observed a warm and welcoming reception, indicating a desire for renewed engagement despite the high-level political friction between the governments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Justin Wrobleski delivered a standout performance, pitching six scoreless innings to secure a 5-1 victory over the Kansas City Royals. This outing marks a significant turnaround for the 24-year-old left-hander, who struggled earlier in the season but has shown remarkable improvement in June. Wrobleski's recent success is attributed to mechanical adjustments and an increase in his fastball velocity, which has consistently reached the upper 90s. His strong performance as a bulk relief pitcher is providing the Dodgers with valuable depth and solidifying his position as an impactful arm for the team.</p>

          <p>A proposal to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from a major Republican spending bill following significant bipartisan backlash. The provision, championed by Senator Mike Lee of Utah, was intended to increase housing affordability but drew fierce opposition from conservation groups, recreation advocates, and several Republican lawmakers. Senator Lee withdrew the measure, stating he could not secure guarantees that the land would be sold only to American families and not to foreign interests or large corporations. Conservationists hailed the move as a victory but remain vigilant against future threats to public lands.</p>

          <p>England's national football team received a significant boost as star forward Lauren James made a successful return from a three-month hamstring injury. In a 7-0 victory over Jamaica, the 23-year-old Chelsea player made an immediate impact, providing an assist just eight minutes after coming on as a substitute. Her return comes just days before England's Euro 2025 opening match against France, where the Lionesses will defend their European title. While manager Sarina Wiegman emphasized the need to build up her match fitness, James's creativity and talent provide a crucial offensive weapon for the team's campaign.</p>

Other red flags mentioned include breast discharge, heavy or irregular periods, and clubbed fingernails. The professionals emphasize the importance of regular check-ups and blood work, even when feeling well, as these can lead to early detection of conditions like acute leukemia, diabetes, and cancer, significantly improving outcomes.</p>

While he showed flashes of his renowned skill during the match, his team was decisively outplayed by the European champions.
