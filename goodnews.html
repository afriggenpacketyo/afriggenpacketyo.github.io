          <p>Essex seamer Sam Cook is set to make his England Test debut, balancing his cricketing career with his passion for Manchester United. A long-time United season-ticket holder, Cook often splits driving duties with his brother Jack to attend games at Old Trafford. On the eve of his debut, Cook may find himself watching United's Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur with fellow England seamer and fan Josh Tongue. Cook's call-up comes after amassing 227 County Championship wickets, the most by any seamer in the past five years, with an impressive first-class average of 19.85.</p>

          <p>Smartex, a sustainable fashion startup, is using cameras, vision software, and artificial intelligence to detect defects in textiles during production, aiming to reduce waste in the fashion industry. Gilberto Loureiro, the co-founder, was inspired by his experience working in a textile factory. The company claims to have prevented 1 million kilograms of fabric from going to waste in the past three years. Smartex has attracted investment from H&M Group and Amazon due to its potential to digitalize and improve efficiency in the complex apparel production process, which contributes significantly to global water pollution.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles, whose numbers have declined by 90% in the past 30 years. Nature Conservation Cymru is feeding the voles glitter-covered apples to track their movements via their droppings, with different colors of glitter used to identify different families. The glitter is biodegradable and veterinary-approved to ensure it is harmless to the animals. By tracking the voles, conservationists hope to adjust the environment to help the species disperse and survive, such as removing invasive conifers or fencing off riverbanks.</p>

          <p>Palaeontologists in Alberta, Canada, are working to solve the mystery of a mass grave containing thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus dinosaurs at Pipestone Creek, nicknamed the "River of Death." The team believes the dinosaurs, relatives of the Triceratops, were migrating in a large herd when a catastrophic flash flood wiped them out. The site is one of the largest bone beds in North America, offering a unique opportunity to study a single community of a single species from a specific moment in time. Researchers are also studying Edmontosaurus bones found nearby to understand the broader ancient ecosystem.</p>

This move is intended to mitigate the impact of trade tensions and tariffs, while also reducing reliance on Chinese factories. While India presents a significant opportunity, challenges remain, including cost competitiveness, labor market rigidities, and infrastructure needs. Analysts emphasize the need for strategic investments in infrastructure, skills, and technology to transform India into a truly independent manufacturing hub.</p>
