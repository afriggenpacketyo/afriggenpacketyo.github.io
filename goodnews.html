        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has stated there will be no relaxation of visa rules for India, despite a recent trade agreement aimed at boosting economic ties. During a visit to India with a large business delegation, Starmer emphasized that the focus is on leveraging the new trade deal, which reduces tariffs on goods like cars and whisky. While the UK seeks to attract "top talent," he confirmed that expanding visa routes for Indian workers or students is not part of the current plan, aligning with his government's broader goal of reducing immigration levels.</p>

          <p>The New York Yankees avoided elimination in the AL Division Series by overcoming a five-run deficit to defeat the Toronto Blue Jays 9-6 in Game 3. Aaron Judge was pivotal in the comeback, hitting a tying three-run home run and driving in four runs total in a strong offensive performance. The victory was the largest comeback in an elimination game in Yankees history, fueled by key Toronto errors and effective relief pitching that held the Blue Jays scoreless for over six innings. The final score reflected a dramatic turn of events for the New York team.</p>

          <p>A report from the career site Indeed indicates that generative AI is poised to "radically transform" about 26% of jobs, primarily affecting white-collar roles that rely on cognitive reasoning skills, such as those in technology and finance. In contrast, jobs requiring physical labor or significant human interaction, like nursing and construction, are considered more insulated from disruption for now. The analysis suggests that while full automation of skills is currently limited, many occupations will likely evolve into a hybrid model where AI assists with routine tasks under human supervision.</p>

          <p>A new trend known as "locking in" has gained popularity among Gen Z on social media, involving periods of intense focus on self-improvement goals related to health, finance, or personal projects. This phenomenon is seen as a reaction against the constant distractions of digital life and a coping mechanism for economic anxiety in the face of AI and political instability. While some critics view it as a performance of productivity, others see it as a way for young people to reclaim a sense of control and actively work on themselves in an uncertain world.</p>

          <h2>European Parliament Votes to Prohibit Meat-Related Terms for Plant-Based Foods</h2>

          <p>The European Parliament has approved a measure that would ban the use of names like "burger," "sausage," or "schnitzel" for plant-based food products, a move supported by farming groups and some conservative politicians. Proponents argue that using these terms for vegetarian and vegan alternatives is misleading to consumers and harms Europe's culinary traditions. However, the proposal faced opposition from Green party members, consumer organizations, and major food retailers, who contend that such labels provide clarity and that a ban would stifle innovation in the growing plant-based market.</p>

          <p>Watford Football Club has fired head coach Paulo Pezzolano after only 10 games and announced the return of former manager Javi Gracia. Pezzolano was the club's 12th manager since Gracia's first tenure ended in 2019, reflecting a period of significant instability. Gracia's initial 20-month spell was the longest of any Watford boss in the last 14 years, during which he led the team to its best-ever Premier League finish and an FA Cup final, and the club hopes his return will bring stability and momentum.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a mathematics professor who was diagnosed with autism in his 30s argues against the framing of autism as a tragedy or a problem to be solved. He recounts how his autistic traits, such as pattern recognition and logical thinking, have been assets in his career, and draws parallels to historical figures whose neurodivergent behaviors likely contributed to their genius. The author contends that conversations about "eliminating" autism echo the dangerous logic of eugenics and that the world is a better place for embracing different ways of thinking.</p>

          <h2>The Economic Importance of Preorders for Authors and Book Publishers Explained</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article from NPR's Planet Money explains why preordering a book is a critically important way to support an author, going beyond just the initial sale. High preorder numbers signal strong interest to booksellers, influencing decisions on stocking levels and prominent in-store or online placement. Furthermore, all preorders are counted as first-day sales, which significantly increases a book's chances of debuting on a bestseller list. This early success can create a snowball effect, generating more visibility and subsequent sales for the title.</p>

          <p>Wharton professor Ethan Mollick, a leading expert on AI, cautions against trusting definitive predictions about the technology's impact on the job market, stating that "no one knows anything," including top AI research labs.

Mollick argues that the current corporate culture must shift to one that values curiosity, experimentation, and the ability to ask brilliant questions. (not investment advice)</p>
