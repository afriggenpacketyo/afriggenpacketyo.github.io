          <h2>Operation Babylift's Enduring Legacy 50 Years Later</h2>

          <p>This article reflects on Operation Babylift, which evacuated over 2,500 children from Vietnam to the United States during the final days of the Vietnam War in April 1975. The operation aimed to rescue children fathered by U.S. servicemen amid fears of potential harm after the North's invasion of Saigon, yet faced criticism due to some children not being orphans and some being evacuated without parental consent. One evacuee, Thuy Williams, recounts her experience, including being pulled from the flight that crashed, and her subsequent adoption and successful life in the U.S. Steve Ford, son of then-President Gerald Ford, defends the mission, acknowledging its imperfections but emphasizing the moral imperative to save the children. The article also touches on the lasting impact on those who were airlifted, such as Williams who went on to excel in sports and serve in the Army.</p>

          <p>A small marble sculpture, initially believed to be a copy of Auguste Rodin's work, has been authenticated as a genuine Rodin piece and sold for nearly $1 million at an auction in France. The sculpture, titled "Despair," had disappeared after being sold at an auction in 1906 and was later confirmed as authentic by the Comite Rodin after a six-week probe. This unexpected discovery transformed the owners' despair into delight. French auctioneer Aymeric Rouillac described the find as extremely rare.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear plant project, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed it as a "landmark decision" for economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband envisioned a "golden age of clean energy abundance." The project, however, faces opposition from groups like Stop Sizewell C, who believe the investment is a costly mistake that will increase consumer bills. The government insists nuclear power is crucial for low-carbon energy security, but the project is expected to take at least a decade to complete.</p>

          <p>China's electric car industry is rapidly expanding, with companies like BYD becoming major players in global markets, sparking concerns among established manufacturers and governments. Chinese firms benefit from low labor costs, government subsidies, and a well-established supply chain, leading to competitive pricing. However, concerns have been raised about potential security risks, spyware, and hacking vulnerabilities in internet-enabled vehicles. While the US has imposed high tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, European manufacturers are racing to develop their own affordable electric cars. </p>
