          <p>Experts anticipate that home equity loan and HELOC rates will likely remain stable in June, despite a slight decrease in inflation. While the Federal Reserve is considering potential rate cuts, economic uncertainties, including tariffs, may prevent any immediate changes. Home equity loans offer fixed rates, while HELOC rates adjust monthly based on the prime rate, and for June, both are expected to remain consistent. Borrowers should still compare rates and terms from various lenders, and be comfortable with the total borrowing amount and monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Astronomers searching for the elusive "Planet Nine" have instead discovered a new dwarf planet, named 2017 OF201, in the outer reaches of the solar system. The object, about 430 miles across, is located three times farther from Earth than Neptune and has an extremely elongated orbit that takes 25,000 years to complete. The discovery challenges the Planet Nine theory, as the dwarf planet's orbit does not follow the clustered trend of other objects in the Kuiper Belt. While the Vera Rubin Observatory is expected to shed more light on the mystery, the discovery highlights the potential for open science and the use of archival data in making significant astronomical findings.</p>

Despite ongoing tit-for-tat tariffs, Boeing remains a top U.S. exporter and is managing the impact of tariffs on imported components. Ortberg noted that the company is paying tariffs on imported components from Italy and Japan for its wide-body Dreamliner planes but can recoup much of it when the planes are exported again.

          <p>The Trump administration has backtracked on its decision to revoke Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, issuing a letter giving the school 30 days to challenge the revocation. This notice comes after Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced the termination of Harvard's SEVP certification due to the school's alleged failure to comply with requests for information about international students and perpetuation of an unsafe campus environment. A U.S. District Judge plans to issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's SEVP certification without following legal procedure. Harvard alleges that the administration's actions are part of a campaign to coerce the university into surrendering its First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump pardoned reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who had been incarcerated since 2022 for bank and tax fraud. The couple was convicted in 2019 on charges including conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30 million and conspiring to defraud the IRS. According to the Chrisley's law firm, the couple sought a presidential pardon earlier this year by alleging "serious misconduct by the government, including an illegal raid, reliance on tainted evidence and a trial that featured false testimony from a key government witness." The couple's daughter, Savannah Chrisley, was a speaker at the 2024 Republican National Convention.</p>

The photos were part of a collection commissioned by a Harvard professor to promote white supremacist theories.

The new model features "major improvements in inference and hallucination reduction."

          <p>With the Federal Reserve maintaining the current federal funds rate, experts are weighing the benefits of short- versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) this June. Short-term CDs are currently offering higher interest rates compared to longer terms, making them an attractive option for maximizing returns. While long-term CDs provide fixed rates, they may not be as advantageous in the current uncertain environment. Experts recommend considering a CD ladder strategy to lock in above-average yields across various CD terms, and to carefully assess personal financial goals and liquidity needs before making a decision.

The judge found that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious, violating federal administrative law.
