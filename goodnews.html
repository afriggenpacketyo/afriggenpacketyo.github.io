          <p>Reddit is suing AI startup Anthropic for allegedly breaching their contract and engaging in unfair business practices. The lawsuit claims Anthropic trained its AI models using Reddit user data without consent, violating Reddit's user agreement. Reddit asserts that Anthropic disregarded its rules and commercialized user-generated content without providing anything in return to Reddit or its users, unlike companies such as OpenAI and Google, which have formal partnerships with Reddit. Reddit seeks damages for the unauthorized use of its platform and data. The social media company believes that other AI companies understand and respect Reddit's data usage rules, which is why it has partnerships with OpenAI and Google, the former of which has a CEO who used to be a major shareholder in Reddit. Optimism surrounding this article is based on the fact that legal boundaries are being set for the AI industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump is meeting with Senate Finance Committee Republicans at the White House to garner support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a legislative package advancing his agenda. The Finance Committee is crucial as it handles the bill's tax policy aspects, including extending the 2017 tax cuts. The House-passed bill includes increased military and border security spending, alongside cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, potentially adding $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Trump aims to sway senators with concerns about the bill, as its passage in the Senate requires near-unanimous GOP support amidst criticism from figures like Elon Musk.

          <p>The author of this opinion piece argues that the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) successfully delivered 7 million meals to Gazans without incident, but faced a disinformation campaign from Hamas. The author claims that Hamas falsely alleged 31 Gazans died at a GHF distribution site, a claim refuted by CCTV footage. The author criticizes the international press for readily accepting Hamas's claims and accuses the UN of complicity in perpetuating suffering in Gaza. The author advocates for a new model of humanitarian aid based on transparency, accountability, and realism, contrasting it with what they claim is the current system's failures and corruption. The author's tone is assertive and critical of the existing humanitarian system.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential for HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) interest rates to fluctuate following the Federal Reserve's June meeting. While a rate cut in June is deemed unlikely, comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell could influence HELOC rates. If Powell indicates imminent rate reductions, lenders might preemptively lower HELOC rates. The article also notes that home equity loan rates are currently slightly higher than HELOC rates, but offer the stability of a fixed interest rate. The article offers advice on how to keep home equity borrowing costs low, highlighting the importance of shopping for the best rates and terms. (not investment advice)</p>
