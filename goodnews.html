          <p>NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning provided amusement for PGA Championship winner Scottie Scheffler at the 2025 Memorial Tournament Pro-Am.

          <p>Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif must undergo a newly mandated genetic sex test before competing again, according to World Boxing. The organization will introduce mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers. Khelif's testing comes after concerns arose from her potential participation in the upcoming Eindhoven Box Cup, partially due to controversy after she won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics. World Boxing said athletes need to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genetic test to determine their sex at birth and their eligibility to compete.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Corporate buzzwords are criticized for impeding trust and creating insecurity, especially among Gen Z employees who may cling to them as corporate lifelines. Studies show that lower-status employees tend to use more jargon, and new buzzwords are constantly emerging. The article suggests that buzzwords are often used to distract from the primary goal of making money and encourages people to use real, human language. The author suggests people should read poetry instead of using metaphors in the workplace.</p>

Norris made errors in his final run, allowing Piastri to secure the top spot, while Verstappen acknowledged that his car was not fast enough.</p>
