          <p>China's economy demonstrated considerable resilience during a turbulent first half of 2025, navigating US trade policies while maintaining steady growth toward its 5% annual GDP target. However, experts warn that significant challenges are expected in the latter half of the year. Analysts predict that export growth will likely slow to zero or even contract due to factors like a payback from front-loaded orders and a projected decline in U.S. consumer spending.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant move to address its housing crisis, California has passed sweeping reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the new legislation exempts most urban infill housing projects from the lengthy and often litigious CEQA review process. This change is intended to remove a major barrier to construction, as the law was frequently used by opponents to delay or halt development, and signals a major shift in the state's approach to homebuilding.</p>

          <p>Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic secured his spot in the second round of Wimbledon, but not without facing physical challenges during his match against Alexandre Muller.
