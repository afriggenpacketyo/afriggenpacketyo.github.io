          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" had a successful debut, earning $118 million domestically and $218 million globally, marking a return to form for the studio. This performance exceeded expectations and is seen as a significant relief for Disney and Marvel, which have faced recent box office struggles with other superhero films. The movie, the first "Fantastic Four" film under Disney's ownership, received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. The success follows that of "Deadpool & Wolverine," suggesting Disney is effectively leveraging intellectual properties acquired from 21st Century Fox.</p>

          <p>English golfer Lottie Woad, 21, achieved a remarkable victory at the Women's Scottish Open in what was her professional debut. She entered the final round with a two-shot lead and finished with a four-under-par 68, securing the win by three strokes. Woad, a former world number one amateur, had previously won the Irish Open as an amateur. This victory earned her £220,000 in prize money and positions her as a strong contender for the upcoming Women's Open at Royal Porthcawl. Her performance demonstrated composure as she held off a challenge from seven-time LPGA winner Hyo Joo Kim.</p>

          <h2>U.S. and China Expected to Extend Tariff Truce by 90 Days at Stockholm Talks</h2>

          <p>According to sources, the United States and China are anticipated to agree to another 90-day extension of their tariff truce during trade negotiations in Stockholm. The current suspension of most tariffs, agreed upon in May, is set to expire on August 12. While the extension will prevent an immediate escalation of the trade war, insiders do not expect significant breakthroughs on major issues like China's industrial overcapacity. The Chinese delegation is also expected to press the U.S. for more clarity on the conditions required to ease the 20% tariffs related to fentanyl, which were imposed by the Trump administration in March.

          <p>A one-year-old boy in the Indian state of Bihar is reported to have killed a cobra by biting it after the snake coiled around his hands while he was playing. The infant, named Govinda, fainted after the incident and was rushed to a local hospital. Doctors stated that the venom's effects were mild and that timely treatment saved the child's life; he is now in stable condition and under observation. India is home to many highly venomous snakes, including the Indian cobra, and the country recorded over a million snakebite deaths between 2000 and 2019, making the child's survival particularly remarkable.</p>

          <h2>Financial Columnist Critiques New 'Trump IRA' for Children, Suggesting Better Savings Options</h2>

          <p>A financial advice columnist analyzes the newly established "Trump IRA," a savings account for children under 18 that includes a one-time $1,000 government contribution for those born between 2025 and 2028. While acknowledging the free money is a benefit, the author argues it's more of a political giveaway than an effective long-term savings tool. The article suggests that parents have better options for their children's future, such as 529 education savings plans and custodial Roth IRAs, which offer greater growth potential and flexibility. It also advocates for purchasing whole life insurance policies for children to lock in low premiums. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests a Four-Day Workweek Boosts Happiness by Increasing Effectiveness</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek reveal that the resulting boost in employee happiness comes not just from having more free time, but also from feeling more effective at work. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, when faced with less time, workers and teams become more efficient by eliminating busywork and focusing on important tasks. This increased sense of productivity and feeling on top of their work contributes significantly to overall well-being. The shift also signals a new level of trust from employers and can strengthen team spirit as colleagues collaborate to work smarter.</p>

The advice columnist cautions against the woman providing a private loan or buying a share in his house, as it could create a power imbalance and complicate their relationship. Instead of pushing him to take on debt like a reverse mortgage to fund a lavish lifestyle, the columnist suggests the couple find activities that fit both their financial comfort levels and advises him to preserve his financial independence.
