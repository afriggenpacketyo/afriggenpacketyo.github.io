          <p>Japan's animation industry is increasingly adopting AI technology to address labor shortages and streamline production, despite concerns over copyright infringement.

Studios are using AI to assist with tasks like coloring and background generation, significantly reducing production time, however, many artists are worried about losing their jobs to AI.</p>

McLaren's strength lies in tracks where rear-tire degradation is a significant factor, and corners are slower. Red Bull has introduced upgrades in recent races, while McLaren has not, which could shift the balance again, as the two teams battle for dominance in the 2025 Formula 1 season.</p>
