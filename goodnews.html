          <p>The Dalai Lama has announced that the centuries-old institution will continue after his death, confirming that a successor will be chosen through reincarnation. The 90-year-old spiritual leader stated that the process of identifying his 15th reincarnation should follow past Buddhist traditions and be handled by his Gaden Phodrang Trust. This decision ends years of speculation that he might be the last to hold the title. The announcement carries significant political weight, as it implicitly warns China, which claims the authority to approve the next leader, to not interfere in the succession process.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese luxury jeweler Laopu Gold surged by 15% after a lock-up period expired, allowing pre-listing investors to sell their holdings. Instead of a sell-off, investors showed strong confidence, buying up the newly available 69 million shares. The company has seen its stock increase over 1,300% since its debut in June 2024, driven by strong branding, pricing power, and significant growth in both in-store and online sales.

          <p>In a surprising free agency move, longtime Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner has agreed to a four-year, $107 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. To facilitate the acquisition, the Bucks waived nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard, who will now become a free agent. The decision is influenced by significant Achilles tendon injuries to key players on both teams, with Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton and Lillard both expected to miss most or all of the upcoming season. Lillard's agent stated the move allows him to focus on rehabilitation while still being paid his full contract.</p>

          <p>The latest version of President Trump's domestic policy bill, recently passed by the Senate, includes a provision to increase tax credits for semiconductor manufacturing from 25% to 35%. This measure is designed to further incentivize companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron to build and expand advanced chip facilities in the United States. The move expands upon the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, reflecting a continued bipartisan push to onshore the semiconductor supply chain and reduce reliance on Asia. The bill must still pass the House before the expanded credits can become law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The ruling blocks a plan by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to revoke the status in September, well before its previously scheduled expiration in February 2026. The judge determined that the DHS secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, which provides a temporary reprieve for Haitian migrants who faced the loss of legal status and work permits.</p>
