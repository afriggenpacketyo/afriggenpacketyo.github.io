          <p>Geoff Duncan, the former Republican Lieutenant Governor of Georgia, has announced he is switching to the Democratic Party and is considering a future run for higher office. Duncan, a vocal critic of Donald Trump, cited his struggle to "love my neighbor, as a Republican" and pointed to policy disagreements on issues like healthcare, gun safety, and immigration as reasons for his departure. The move was met with derision from Trump and praise from Democrats, setting the stage for a potential 2026 gubernatorial campaign in a key battleground state.</p>

          <p>Rupert Lowe, an independent Member of Parliament in the UK, has apologized after mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers as "illegal migrants" in a social media post. Lowe shared a picture of the crew's boat near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, and alerted authorities before discovering they were rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease research. The crew, which includes a former Royal Marine, found the incident humorous. In a subsequent post, Lowe pledged a £1,000 donation to their charity.</p>

          <p>In a segment for NPR's StoryCorps, a woman named Melanie Harrison and her father, Jim Miles, shared memories of her grandfather, Rayford Junior Miles. Rayford, a World War II veteran from Alabama, was remembered as having a tough exterior but a soft heart and a unique, comical way of communicating with his family. The conversation highlights the personal and tender memories that exist behind the stoic facade of many veterans. The segment focuses on the enduring nature of family love and remembrance through personal anecdotes.</p>

          <p>Despite an ongoing diplomatic dispute over Taiwan, Beijing is deepening its economic relationship with eSwatini, the last African nation to maintain official ties with Taipei. A Chinese state-owned enterprise, Sinohydro, has been awarded a contract for the US$146 million Mpakeni Dam project in the country. This project, part of a larger water initiative funded by the African Development Bank, marks a significant step for Chinese enterprise in eSwatini. The move showcases China's strategy of using economic partnerships to expand its influence, even with nations that have historically been aligned with Taiwan.</p>

          <p>Firefighters have successfully brought a massive wildfire in the Aude department of southern France under control after it burned for several days. The blaze, the largest in the region for decades, consumed over 17,000 hectares of land, resulted in one fatality, and injured 13 people. While the immediate threat is contained, around 2,000 firefighters remain on site to manage hotspots and prevent flare-ups, as the fire will not be declared fully extinguished for several more days. The region is bracing for another heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 41 degrees Celsius.</p>

          <p>Scientists are studying a unique group of individuals known as "SuperAgers" to unlock the secrets of resisting age-related cognitive decline. These are people aged 80 and older who possess the memory capabilities of individuals 20 to 30 years younger, with their brains shrinking at a much slower rate than their peers. Research from Northwestern University's SuperAging Program, summarized in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, is delving into the biological and lifestyle factors that contribute to this remarkable resilience. The findings could provide valuable insights into preventing dementia and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

          <p>After a period of dormancy, the market for traditional Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in the space sector appears to be reviving, with several companies like Karman Holdings and Firefly Aerospace making successful debuts. This marks a shift from the recent trend of space firms going public via SPAC mergers. Analysts suggest that despite geopolitical volatility, factors like strong government contracts and investor enthusiasm for long-term strategic infrastructure are fueling this resurgence. The sector's growth potential and alignment with national innovation priorities make it an attractive, albeit competitive, area for investment. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge condemned Russell's racist ideology, stating he was the intellectual driver of the plot. This was not Russell's first conviction, as he previously pleaded guilty to explosives charges in 2017 after a double homicide at his apartment.</p>
