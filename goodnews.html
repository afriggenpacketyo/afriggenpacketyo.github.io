          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reportedly allowed a rule requiring passengers in standard security lines to remove their shoes to expire at several U.S. airports. While the change is being phased in, travelers at airports including BWI, LAX, and LaGuardia have reported not having to remove footwear. Previously, only passengers with TSA PreCheck were exempt from this requirement. The TSA stated it is always exploring ways to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining strong security.</p>

          <p>The California Institute of Technology (CalTech) is severing ties with e-learning company Simplilearn after a class-action lawsuit alleged the partnership was misleading. The suit claimed a jointly offered cybersecurity boot camp was misrepresented as having close ties to the prestigious university when the connection was minimal. As part of the settlement, CalTech and Simplilearn will not misrepresent student access to university services and will refund $2.4 million in tuition to 263 students. The university also announced it will create a faculty oversight committee for its other professional education programs.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to conduct a large-scale reduction-in-force (RIF) that could have cut tens of thousands of jobs. The VA now states it is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a hiring freeze, making the mass layoffs unnecessary. The initial plan was part of a Trump administration push to shrink the federal workforce to pre-Biden administration levels. Critics argue the high attrition rate is due to a "toxic work environment" and will still negatively impact veteran care.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and that no "client list" or evidence of blackmailing prominent individuals was found. The findings, detailed in a memo, aim to quell long-standing conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's death and his connections. Investigators confirmed that video footage showed no one entered his cell tier at the time of his death. The memo stated that while Epstein harmed over 1,000 victims, the review did not uncover evidence to support investigations against uncharged third parties.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was named to his 11th All-Star team, this time as a "Legend Pick" by Commissioner Rob Manfred, an honor recognizing his career accomplishments. The 37-year-old pitcher, who has only made nine starts this season after returning from surgery, was surprised by the selection, stating he didn't feel he deserved it based on his 2025 performance. Despite the surprise, Kershaw expressed his gratitude for the "tremendous honor," saying he plans to enjoy the experience regardless of whether he pitches in the game in Atlanta.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion follow-on purchase of 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly influenced by the demonstrated vulnerability of such aircraft to modern air defenses and drones in the war in Ukraine, as well as a significant price increase from the initial order. A South Korean lawmaker stated that the country must invest in future-oriented capabilities like drones and smart systems rather than expensive legacy platforms. The funds will likely be redirected to developing these newer, more relevant defense technologies for the modern battlefield.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have decided not to press charges against participants of the city's recent Pride parade, which took place despite being officially banned by the government. The decision provides relief to attendees who faced potential fines and organizers, including Budapest's mayor, who faced possible prison time. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, created by the mayor declaring it an official municipal event, as the reason for not prosecuting. The march, held in defiance of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-LGBTQ+ policies, attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 people.</p>

          <p>Dr. Serhii Baksheiev, a 53-year-old Ukrainian gynecologist, travels to front-line and occupied villages in a mobile clinic to provide free medical care to women. Many of his patients have not seen a doctor since the war began, as over 1,900 health facilities have been attacked, crippling the nation's healthcare system. In his specially equipped "Feminine Shuttle," Dr. Baksheiev performs examinations and minor surgeries, finding higher-than-average rates of malignant tumors. Despite his own cancer diagnosis, he continues his humanitarian mission, serving as both a doctor and a therapist for women impacted by the war.</p>

          <p>The public inquiry into the UK's Post Office scandal is set to release the first part of its final report, focusing on compensation for the victims and the human impact of the crisis. Thousands of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for financial shortfalls caused by the faulty Horizon IT system. While this initial report will make recommendations on redress, the second part, which will assign blame, is not expected until at least 2026. Victims hope the findings will pressure the government and Post Office to deliver on promises of full and fair compensation.</p>

          <p>King Charles III is playing a central role in the first UK state visit by a French president since 2008, a trip aimed at strengthening post-Brexit ties between the two nations. The visit by Emmanuel Macron involves significant royal pageantry and is seen as a key "soft power" opportunity to reinforce cooperation on defense, trade, and migration. Having already established a warm rapport with the Macrons during a 2023 visit to France, the King's involvement is considered crucial for diplomacy. The trip is hoped to reset a relationship that had become strained in recent years.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Suggests Trump's Latest Tariff Announcements Are a Negotiating Tactic</h2>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to overreact to the Trump administration's latest round of tariff announcements, suggesting they are likely a starting point for negotiations rather than a final policy. Following a market dip after President Trump set an August 1 deadline for new tariffs on 14 countries, Cramer argued that the administration has a history of postponing or reducing such levies. He believes the ultimate goal is not to reshore manufacturing but to increase U.S. exports by pressuring trade partners into more favorable deals for American goods. (not investment advice)</p>
