          <p>The NJ Transit strike has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a deal, but full train service will resume on Tuesday, May 20th. The agreement, hailed as fair and fiscally responsible by Governor Phil Murphy, concludes a three-day strike that disrupted commutes for over 100,000 riders. NJ Transit will continue its contingency plan on Monday to allow time for safety checks, equipment prepositioning, and commuters are encouraged to work from home if possible. The BLET had been seeking pay parity with neighboring transit agencies, and the deal includes work rule concessions to offset wage increases. </p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill advanced in the House after conservatives initially blocked it over insufficient spending cuts. After weekend negotiations, four conservative holdouts voted present, allowing the bill to move forward, though some modifications are expected. The bill extends Trump-era tax cuts, ends taxes on tips and overtime, and increases spending on military and border security, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. However, the legislation faces potential challenges from conservatives seeking stricter Medicaid work requirements and an end to clean energy subsidies, as well as from moderates concerned about state and local tax deductions. </p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, has won the Romanian presidency after defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion had a strong first-round victory, fueled by anger over the annulled presidential race due to Russian interference claims. Dan secured 54% of the vote, with strong support from Romanians who want change, while Simion was more successful among diaspora voters. Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv. </p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analysts' expectations, indicating that consumption remains a concern for the economy. Industrial output grew 6.1% year-on-year, stronger than expected, while fixed-asset investment rose 4.0%. The urban unemployment rate eased to 5.1% in April, even as trade war concerns led to warnings about job losses. A trade truce with the U.S. has led to some optimism, with global investment banks raising forecasts for China's economic growth. </p>
