          <p>China's retail market is undergoing a rapid transformation driven by the fierce "instant commerce" war between giants like Alibaba and Meituan. This battle has led to significant consumer subsidies, with items like coffee or multi-course meals being delivered in under 30 minutes for less than a dollar. The competition has expanded beyond food delivery to include high-value goods like the latest iPhones, signaling a fundamental shift in consumer expectations and logistics. This evolution is reshaping both online and brick-and-mortar retail across the country.</p>

Crawford, moving up two weight classes, appeared in formidable physical condition, matching the undisputed champion's weight and silencing doubts about his size. The bout is being framed as a legacy-defining clash, pitting Crawford's undefeated record and technical skill against Álvarez's power and experience at the higher weight class.

          <p>Stargazers can look forward to several notable celestial events this autumn as the nights grow longer following the equinox on September 22. Just before the equinox, Saturn will be at its brightest and closest to Earth, making it easily visible to the naked eye. In October, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will peak under ideal viewing conditions due to a new moon. These events offer opportunities for both amateur and experienced astronomers to observe the night sky during the fall season.</p>

          <p>Three Austrian nuns in their 80s have defied church authorities by fleeing a care home and returning to their lifelong home at the Kloster Goldenstein convent near Salzburg. Sisters Bernadette, Regina, and Rita, the last remaining nuns of their order, say they were moved against their will after their community was dissolved. With the help of former students and a locksmith, they re-entered the convent, where they had been granted lifelong residency. Despite the lack of amenities and disapproval from church officials, the nuns express joy at being "home."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California state legislature has approved SB 79, a significant housing bill designed to address the state's housing shortage by overriding local zoning laws. The bill, which now goes to the governor, allows for the construction of taller, denser apartment buildings—up to nine stories—near major transit corridors like train stations and bus routes. Proponents argue the measure is a necessary step to create much-needed housing in existing communities, while critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, contend it is a "one-size-fits-all" mandate that strips local control over development. A late-stage deal with construction unions helped secure its passage.</p>

          <p>The White House's search for the next Federal Reserve chair has expanded to include Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income. Rieder recently interviewed with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the selection process for the Trump administration. The search includes other candidates like former Fed governors Kevin Warsh and Lawrence Lindsey. Rieder's consideration signals a potential preference for a leader with deep market experience rather than a traditional academic economics background, as the administration seeks new leadership and structural changes at the central bank.
