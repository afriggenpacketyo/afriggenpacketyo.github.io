          <p>England's rugby team achieved a decisive 40-5 victory against the United States in a Test match in Washington D.C. that was significantly disrupted by weather. The game experienced nearly two hours of delays due to lightning strikes in the area, with the kick-off postponed and play halted again in the first half. Despite the interruptions, England delivered a strong performance, scoring six tries to complete their tour with an undefeated record. The USA managed to score a single try late in the game, but England's dominance was clear throughout the match.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following last year's tragic attack in Southport, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law to target individuals preparing for mass violence, even without a specific ideological motive. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects who research targets or plan attacks, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws. This move addresses concerns about lone attackers radicalized online who may not fit the traditional definition of a terrorist. The goal is to empower law enforcement to prevent atrocities before they can be carried out.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry handled a technical issue with professionalism during her concert in San Francisco when a stage prop malfunctioned mid-air. While performing her hit song "Roar" on a large mechanical butterfly suspended above the audience, the prop suddenly dropped a few feet, startling the singer. Perry quickly regained her composure and continued with the performance without missing a beat, later joking about the incident. The event highlights the inherent risks of complex stage productions, but Perry's swift recovery ensured the show went on smoothly for her fans.</p>

          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over the possibility of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday and redistributing the time off throughout the year. Proponents argue it could help prevent learning loss, ease the burden of childcare and food costs for low-income families, and potentially lower holiday prices by spreading out demand. However, opponents, including many teachers, argue the long break is essential for rest and preparation, and a shorter summer could intensify the rush for vacation time. The discussion reflects a broader re-evaluation of traditional school calendars in response to modern societal and economic pressures.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has stated that savers are missing out on potential financial growth by favoring low-interest cash accounts over stocks and shares investments. The government is proposing new initiatives, including sending investment information to savers and a new ad campaign, to shift this trend and encourage a culture of investing. A controversial idea to reduce the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to push people toward investment ISAs has been met with resistance. Experts note that a significant gender gap exists in investing, and any policy changes must be handled carefully. (not investment advice)</p>

Unlike the rigid, legacy-based clubs of the past, these new venues emphasize networking, creativity, and a more relaxed atmosphere, reflecting India's dynamic economic and social changes. While still highly exclusive and expensive, their membership is based more on accomplishment than on family pedigree.</p>
