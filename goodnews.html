          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 05:15:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists predict that the UK could experience a surge in the populations of endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters as these species adapt to rising ocean temperatures. Researchers at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science have mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas, noting that many could find new habitats in the North Sea. While mobile species are expected to adapt well, static creatures like the ocean quahog clam may struggle, potentially impacting marine ecosystems and food chains. The analysis is intended to guide government planning for Marine Protected Areas, ensuring they continue to safeguard species as habitats shift.</p>

The number of Chinese companies participating has more than doubled compared to 2023, with many making their first appearance as they seek opportunities in the European market. These companies are vying for a place in the European market, with domestic profits plateauing amid a broader economic slowdown and cutthroat rivalries between firms.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady as policymakers assess the impact of tariffs and geopolitical tensions on the U.S. economy. Despite pressure from President Trump to cut rates, the Fed has maintained a cautious approach, waiting to see how economic factors unfold. Investors widely anticipate that the central bank will keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, with markets closely watching for updates to the Fed's economic forecast. The Fed is also monitoring the effects of Trump's policies on taxes, regulation, and immigration, which could influence inflation and labor market conditions (not investment advice).</p>

He noted that the aerospace supply chain is global, requiring collaboration, and highlighted existing U.S. legislation that restricts reliance on countries like China for critical materials in the aerospace and defense industries. The U.S. has had legislation in place since 1973 requiring that the aerospace industry in particular, ‚Äúbut defence as a whole, cannot be reliant on countries like China‚Äù for materials that are deemed critical.</p>

Modi emphasized that India has consistently opposed third-party mediation on matters concerning Kashmir. The call was the first conversation between the two leaders since April 22, when Trump called Modi to express condolences for the 26 civilians killed in the Pahalgam attack in Indian-Administered Kashmir. Modi also conveyed that India views cross-border terrorism as an act of war, not a proxy war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the imposition of duties by the U.S. government, businesses are increasingly resorting to "tariff engineering" to reduce their duty liabilities. This practice involves altering an item's materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower tariff rates. Examples include bundling steel and aluminum elements or adding cubic zirconia to products to change their classification. While strategic design choices are legal, companies must avoid fraudulently misrepresenting product classifications (not investment advice).</p>
