          <h2>Author Explores How Reading Aloud to Infants Fosters Deeper Parental Connection and Understanding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay reflects on the practice of reading aloud to a newborn, not just for the child's development but for the parent's ability to connect and interpret their baby's responses. The author discusses how this shared activity helps build a world of meaning for the child and deepens the parent's bond by learning to 'read' their child's expressions. The piece notes a recent survey suggesting a decline in this practice, arguing that parents who don't read to their kids are missing a profound opportunity.</p>

          <p>The article argues that artificial intelligence should be designed to collaborate with human experts, not to prematurely automate entire jobs where it is still imperfect. Using examples from radiology and aviation, it explains that flawed automation can undermine human expertise and lead to poor outcomes. The piece suggests that AI's true potential lies in augmenting human skills, creating a partnership that leverages the complementary strengths of both humans and machines for better results.</p>

          <p>A new book proposes a novel climate solution: creating community-based carbon banks that would treat sequestered carbon with the same reverence as the nation's gold reserves. The system would involve converting organic waste into biochar, a stable form of carbon, and rewarding depositors with a local digital currency. This grassroots approach aims to make carbon sequestration valuable and desirable, bypassing political gridlock to address climate change from the ground up.</p>
