          <p>Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain platform, has announced that he is the leading holder of the $TRUMP meme token, which has earned him an invitation to a dinner with President Donald Trump. Sun currently holds $18.6 million worth of the Trump-themed meme token, in addition to the $75 million he previously invested in World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture that directs 75% of its revenue to Trump-owned entities. This brings Sun's total investment in the Trump family's crypto ventures to over $93 million. Sun, who faces civil fraud charges from the SEC, will attend a gala dinner with Trump for the top 220 $TRUMP holders.</p>

          <p>Walmart has shifted its tone on the impact of tariffs, warning that higher duties on imports would soon lead to increased prices for consumers, a move that drew criticism from President Trump. CFO John David Rainey stated that the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb, while Walmart reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining low prices. This situation illustrates the challenges businesses face in navigating trade policies and managing relationships with the White House. Other companies like Microsoft and Subaru have also warned of price increases related to tariffs, while Home Depot plans to maintain current pricing levels.</p>

          <p>The European Union has decided to lift its economic sanctions on Syria following the overthrow of former dictator Bashar Assad by an Islamist rebel group in December. Kaja Kallas, the bloc's foreign policy chief, announced the decision, stating that the EU aims to help the Syrian people rebuild a new, inclusive, and peaceful Syria.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has facilitated the opening of the first U.S. mine for antimony, a critical mineral used in defense and technology, aiming to reduce reliance on China, which controls about half of global production. The Idaho-based operation will extract and smelt antimony, essential for military tools like night-vision goggles and ammunition, as well as semiconductors and infrared technology. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued the mine's 404 permit to Perpetua Resources, and the project is expected to create 550 jobs. The mine is also expected to produce over 400,000 ounces of gold annually over the next four years and is projected to cut foreign reliance on antimony by one-third.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A $25,000 annuity can provide a small, guaranteed monthly income stream, but its worth depends on individual financial goals and circumstances. Immediate annuities for a $25,000 investment can generate monthly payments ranging from approximately $92 to $180, depending on age and gender. While this supplemental income could cover some expenses, it may not keep pace with inflation or offer flexibility. Factors such as deferred payments, fixed or variable rates, and additional guarantees can influence payout amounts. For those seeking safety and predictable income, a small annuity may be a helpful component of a broader retirement strategy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Home Depot does not plan to raise prices broadly as a result of new tariffs, but some product options may disappear from store shelves if extra import costs make them not worth it.

This contrasts with Walmart, which warned that tariffs would lead to price increases.
