          <p>University of Colorado head football coach Deion Sanders has revealed he was diagnosed with bladder cancer, which led to the surgical removal of his bladder. At a press conference with his medical team, doctors confirmed the tumor was high-grade but had not spread, and that Sanders is now considered cancer-free. An emotional Sanders stated he never questioned "God, why me?" and intends to remain in his coaching position, using his experience to encourage others to get regular health checkups. His doctors confirmed a new bladder was constructed for him using his own intestines.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona has rapidly intensified to become the first hurricane of the season in the central Pacific Ocean. Currently a Category 1 hurricane, Iona is located several hundred miles south-southeast of Honolulu, Hawaii.

The projected path shows the hurricane moving westward over the next few days, and officials state with high confidence that it will remain well south of the Hawaiian Islands.</p>

          <p>China's aviation authority is surveying its airlines about their future needs for Boeing commercial jets, signaling a potential improvement in trade relations between Beijing and Washington. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) specifically asked carriers about their fleet plans for 2025 and beyond, including any overdue orders for Boeing aircraft. This development, along with a recent meeting between the CAAC director and a senior Boeing executive, suggests that the American aerospace giant could benefit significantly if broader trade tensions between the two countries ease.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Lakers superstar Luka Doncic has revealed a transformed physique, which he attributes to significant changes in his diet and fitness routine during the offseason in Croatia. In a feature for "Men's Health," Doncic described his new regimen, which includes two daily 90-minute workouts and a gluten-free, low-sugar, high-protein diet with intermittent fasting. This renewed focus on conditioning comes after his trade from the Dallas Mavericks, which was reportedly influenced by frustrations over his discipline. Doncic stated that this summer marks a "huge step" and that he intends to maintain his new habits.</p>

          <h2>Explaining the 4% Rule and Its Relevance to Annuities for Retirees</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "4% rule" is a long-standing guideline for retirees, suggesting that withdrawing 4% of a retirement portfolio annually, adjusted for inflation, will likely make the funds last for 30 years. When applied to annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income stream from an annuity against what a traditional portfolio could safely provide. While an annuity might offer a higher initial payout rate, retirees must consider that many fixed annuities don't adjust for inflation. Financial experts suggest a hybrid approach can balance the security of an annuity with the flexibility of portfolio withdrawals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has presented a new, European-led peace plan for Gaza to U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in Scotland. The proposal was developed following discussions with French and German leaders after U.S.-brokered peace talks collapsed. Downing Street indicated the plan aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and create a sustainable path toward a two-state solution. The UK cabinet is set to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the plan, which comes amid increasing domestic pressure on the government to formally recognize Palestinian statehood.</p>
