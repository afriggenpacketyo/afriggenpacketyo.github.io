          <p>Elon Musk's personal fortune is now primarily derived from his private companies, SpaceX and xAI Holdings, rather than his stake in Tesla. A recent Tesla proxy filing revealed that a majority of his wealth, estimated between $385 billion and $436 billion, now comes from these other ventures, prompting Tesla to propose a massive new pay package to retain his focus. SpaceX's valuation is nearing $400 billion, and xAI's could reach $200 billion, with Musk holding significant voting control in both. This shift highlights the competing demands on Musk's attention and the complex financial dynamics influencing his various enterprises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services has surged, with many Americans using them for necessities, leading to missed payments for nearly half of users. With FICO soon incorporating BNPL data into credit scores, managing this debt is crucial to avoid negative credit impacts. This article outlines strategies such as consolidating debt with a personal loan, transferring balances to a 0% APR credit card, or utilizing debt management plans. It also warns against the illusion of affordability and accumulating late fees, emphasizing that BNPL can mask underlying financial problems if used as a crutch rather than a convenience.

          <p>The Labour Party's deputy leadership contest is set for a showdown between Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and former Commons leader Lucy Powell, after another candidate failed to secure enough MP nominations. The winner, who will be chosen by a ballot of members after securing support from local parties or affiliated groups, will not become deputy prime minister but will hold a powerful, unsackable position linking the membership to the party leadership. This contest, triggered by Angela Rayner's resignation, provides an opportunity for internal party dynamics to play out ahead of the party conference, potentially influencing future election campaigns.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have experienced their most significant weekly drop in a year, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage falling to 6.35%—its lowest since last October. This decline has spurred a notable surge in borrower demand, with both home purchase and refinance applications increasing weekly and annually. The decrease in rates is attributed to weakening labor market data, which has influenced Treasury yields. This positive trend offers relief to homebuyers and those looking to refinance, potentially boosting activity in the housing market after a period of higher borrowing costs.

          <p>A federal judge has extended restrictions on federal agents' use of "less-lethal" crowd control weapons against journalists and peaceful protesters during demonstrations in Los Angeles. U.S. District Judge Hernán D. Vera criticized federal officers for indiscriminately using such weapons, stating that the First Amendment "deserves better." The ruling specifically prohibits the use of hard-foam projectiles, tear gas, stun grenades, and batons on or near members of the press, legal observers, and non-threatening protesters. This decision marks a significant victory for press rights organizations, aiming to curb excessive force and protect the public's right to information and assembly during chaotic events.</p>

          <p>Millions of Social Security beneficiaries could see a 2.7% to 2.8% increase in their monthly checks in 2026, according to new estimates based on August inflation data.

          <p>The upcoming Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final between England and Scotland is poised to reignite a historic rivalry, despite Scotland's last victory against England occurring over a quarter-century ago. The article delves into the historical context, including an 8-5 win in 1998 and a 15-13 victory in 1999, highlighting the significant gap that has since developed due to differences in structure, investment, and player numbers. While England has dominated recent encounters, Scotland has shown recent improvement, and there's hope that increased investment and competitions like the Celtic Challenge can help narrow the gap and foster a more competitive future for Scottish rugby.</p>
