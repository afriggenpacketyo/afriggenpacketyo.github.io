          <p>Jannik Sinner defeated Novak Djokovic in the French Open 2025, marking a potential shift in the tennis hierarchy. Djokovic, aiming to become the oldest Grand Slam champion, was unable to overcome Sinner's consistent pressure and varied tactics. Sinner's ability to save set points and maintain control in the tie-break ultimately secured his victory. This sets up a highly anticipated final match against Carlos Alcaraz, signaling a new generation of tennis stars. The article highlights Djokovic's efforts to adapt his game, including baseline duels and serve-and-volley attempts, but Sinner's resilience proved too strong. Optimism is tempered by the acknowledgement of Djokovic's aging and the shift in dominance.</p>
