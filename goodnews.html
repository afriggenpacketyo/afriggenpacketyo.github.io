          <p>Panelists at a technology conference emphasized the importance for nations to develop their own "sovereign AI" to ensure strategic autonomy and reflect local cultures and languages. They argued that relying on English-centric models from major tech companies is insufficient and that countries should take ownership of their AI systems. The experts suggested that open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services are key tools that can democratize the technology and empower emerging economies to build these custom capabilities.</p>

The euro zone's key interest rate has been cut from its peak, and markets anticipate further modest reductions by the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Ministers and campaigners state the current system, largely unreformed for decades, is confusing, ungenerous compared to other European nations, and underutilized, with many fathers unable to afford taking leave. The 18-month review aims to modernize the policies to better support the needs of contemporary working families across the country.</p>

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices recorded their most significant monthly decline since February 2023, falling by 0.8% in June. This drop is thought to reflect a temporary weakening of demand following changes to stamp duty tax thresholds that came into effect in April. Despite the monthly fall, annual price growth remains positive at 2.1%, and economists anticipate that market activity will pick up in the coming months, supported by a stable job market.

However, she laments that such films are still marginalized by mainstream French film institutions, even as they find success with audiences who appear ready to confront this history.</p>
