          <p>AstroAI has issued a recall for approximately 249,100 mini-fridges due to the risk of fire and burns caused by a potential short circuit in the electrical switch. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) reported at least 70 incidents involving the mini-fridges emitting smoke, burning, melting, or catching fire, with two fires resulting in over $360,000 in property damage. Consumers are advised to immediately cease using the recalled mini-fridges and contact AstroAI for a replacement product. The recalled models were sold online between June 2019 and June 2022. </p>

          <p>The UK government is expanding the Warm Home Discount scheme to include millions more households on benefits, providing ¬£150 off energy bills this winter. The changes will scrap the property size and energy score qualifications, allowing an additional 2.7 million homes to receive the discount. While energy companies will fund the expansion, there is a possibility of a slight increase in bills for all customers to cover the costs. Debt charities and energy groups have generally welcomed the move, though some express concern that the scheme still leaves out some of those most at risk. </p>
