          <p>A new genetic test has been developed that significantly reduces the time it takes to diagnose brain tumors, from weeks to hours. The method, developed at the University of Nottingham, has shown a 100% success rate in diagnosing tumor types during 50 operations. This "ultra-rapid" method allows surgeons to make more informed decisions during surgery, potentially reducing the need for multiple operations and allowing patients to start treatment sooner. The technology is being adopted by other NHS hospitals. </p>
