          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed reports of urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a prostate nodule. While the cancer is aggressive, it is reportedly hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management, and Biden is reviewing treatment options with his physicians. Biden's health has been under scrutiny since before he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, giving way to then-Vice President Kamala Harris to top the Democratic presidential ticket.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick revealed that he once spent $5,000 on special milk to appease Antonio Brown and maintain his relationship with Tom Brady during Brown's brief stint with the New England Patriots. Brown had ordered the milk for Brady, who is very nutrition-oriented, but it spoiled before it could be used. Belichick approved the expense to avoid ruining the relationship between Brown and Brady, who later won a Super Bowl together with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Belichick is now head football coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
