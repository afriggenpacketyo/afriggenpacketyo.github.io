          <p>With the rise of MLS, the upcoming Club World Cup and World Cup, and the enduring stature of the US women's national team, the question of how much professional soccer America can handle is being asked. Several organizations are betting that the answer to that question is ‚Äúno,‚Äù as evidenced by the emergence of rival leagues at both first and second division levels, as well as the potential for up to 50 women's professional soccer teams in the US by 2030. While the US market presents a massive opportunity for soccer, the history of America‚Äôs sporting experience points in a slightly less bullish direction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners in states prone to extreme weather events are finding ways to save on insurance by upgrading their houses to withstand disasters. Programs like Alabama's FORTIFIED Roof standard offer discounts to homeowners who strengthen their homes against hurricanes. While these programs are expanding, some homeowners are still struggling to retain insurance coverage altogether. Experts emphasize the importance of community-wide retrofitting and urge insurance companies to account for home improvements when determining coverage. By investing in up-front protection, homeowners can reduce the risk of damage and potentially lower insurance costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seattle is grappling with balancing the need for increased housing density and the preservation of trees, which are crucial for addressing climate change. A new state law mandates more housing density, but not necessarily more trees, leading to tension between development and environmental concerns. The Bryant Heights development serves as an example of building density while preserving existing trees, cooling buildings, filtering carbon emissions, and providing gathering spaces for residents. The city is also updating its tree protection ordinance and planting more trees in public areas to reach a canopy coverage goal of 30% by 2037.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has suspended its loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts across the border to North Korea as part of a bid to "restore trust" between the two countries. The move comes a week after the country elected its new president Lee Jae-myung, who had campaigned on improving inter-Korean ties. Pyongyang considers the loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts an act of war and has threatened to blow them up in the past. Organizations advocating to improve the human rights of North Koreans have criticized the suspension.</p>
