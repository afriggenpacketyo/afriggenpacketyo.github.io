          <p>Keir Starmer has announced a reversal on cuts to winter fuel payments, responding to significant political pressure after over 10 million pensioners lost eligibility due to means-testing. The change aims to allow more pensioners to qualify, although specifics remain unclear, with the new policy expected to be detailed in the autumn Budget. The move follows criticism from unions, charities, and even Labour MPs who attributed recent election losses to the unpopular cuts. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown praised the reconsideration, emphasizing fairness for pensioners.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees seeking financial flexibility, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) presents a relatively inexpensive option, particularly with average home equity amounts exceeding $300,000. HELOC interest rates have seen a steady decline since early 2024, offering retirees a variable rate structure that can benefit them in a cooling rate environment. HELOCs can serve as useful emergency funds, requiring borrowers to pay only the interest on the amount borrowed during the draw period, making them more attractive than credit cards, personal loans, and home equity loans.

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record from January, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers and easing U.S.-China trade tensions. Cumulative inflows into exchange-traded funds tracking Bitcoin's price have exceeded $40 billion, reflecting strong investor interest. On-chain data indicates reduced selling pressure, with increased liquidity in the crypto market, while regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments are expected to further boost Bitcoin prices. The Senate's move to advance legislation creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins also contributed to the positive sentiment.</p>

          <p>Canada Goose's shares rose sharply after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, despite withdrawing its fiscal 2026 outlook due to "macroeconomic uncertainty."

The company noted that the majority of its products are not directly impacted by tariffs, but the "indirect effect of these actions on the global economy and changing landscape create greater uncertainty for us."

          <p>For individuals struggling with credit card debt, credit card debt forgiveness could offer a solution, potentially wiping out 30% to 50% of the debt load. Before applying, it's crucial to explore alternative debt relief options, such as credit counseling, debt management programs, and debt consolidation loans. Applicants should also assess their qualifications, including having a substantial debt load, being delinquent on payments, and demonstrating financial hardship. Gathering necessary documentation, such as medical bills or proof of job loss, is also essential to improve the chances of success. (not investment advice)</p>
