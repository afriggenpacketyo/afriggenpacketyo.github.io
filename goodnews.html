          <p>During his first major foreign trip, President Trump affirmed that the U.S. has "no stronger partner" than Saudi Arabia, announcing a $142 billion arms deal and other investments potentially worth $1 trillion. Speaking in Riyadh, Trump also declared the U.S. would lift sanctions on Syria to provide the country "a chance at greatness". The visit comes as Trump continues to try woo foreign investors to the US to boost the US economy, a key focus of his administration in the nearly four months of his second term. Trump lauded the U.S.-Saudi relationship as "more powerful than ever before" at a U.S.-Saudi investment forum.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria during a state visit to Saudi Arabia, marking a significant policy shift for the war-torn country. Trump said the decision was influenced by discussions with the Saudi crown prince and the new Syrian president, Ahmed al-Shara, leader of the rebel alliance that ousted President Bashar al-Assad in December, expressing hope for stability and peace under the new government. The move aims to stimulate economic recovery in Syria, which has been devastated by years of civil war, with Trump also seeking to bolster Saudi investment in the United States.</p>

While Clearsprings and Mears have stated their intent to repay funds, Serco reported that they did not generate sufficient profit to warrant a payback, even though profits at the three companies are expected to rise overall due to an increased amount of hotels being used to house asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>Vaccine experts are expressing confusion over the Trump administration's $500 million project to develop a universal flu vaccine, called Generation Gold Standard, particularly its reliance on an antiquated whole killed virus approach. Experts argue that this method, which involves injecting people with a chemically inactivated flu virus, is outdated and likely to produce more side effects than newer technologies. Concerns have also been raised about the project's high cost, the selection of the technology without independent review, and the anti-vaccine stance of some health officials within the administration.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball has lifted the lifetime bans on Pete Rose and 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, making both players eligible for potential induction into the Hall of Fame. Commissioner Rob Manfred made the decision after the Rose family applied to change the policy following Rose's death, concluding that permanent ineligibility should end upon the passing of the disciplined individual. While this move opens the door for their consideration, neither player will be immediately inducted, and Rose's case will be reviewed by the Classic Baseball Era Committee in December 2027 for potential induction in 2028.</p>
