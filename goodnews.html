          <h2>UK Experiences Third Major Heatwave of the Year with Temperatures Expected to Reach 34C</h2>

          <p>The United Kingdom is facing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures predicted to peak at 34°C on Saturday, particularly in the Midlands and south Wales. Amber heat health alerts are active for several regions, and wildfire warnings have been issued in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The prolonged warm, dry weather has led to hosepipe bans affecting over seven million people in Yorkshire, Kent, and Sussex. The heat has also impacted events like the Wimbledon tennis championships, which have implemented special rules to protect players from the extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Clippers player Kobe Brown showcased his skills during a Summer League game against the Houston Rockets before exiting with a right ankle contusion. Brown, who is entering his third season, scored 14 points in 20 minutes, impressing coaches with his defense and offensive reads before the injury occurred. Team officials described the move to pull him from the game as precautionary, stating his ankle is fine. The game also highlighted strong performances from teammates Jordan Miller, who had 23 points and 11 rebounds, and rookie Yanic Konan Niederhauser.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor secured a victory over Amanda Serrano for the third time, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship in a majority decision at Madison Square Garden. The bout, described as more of a tactical "chess match" than their previous encounters, saw two judges scoring it 97-93 for Taylor, with one card a 95-95 draw. The fight concluded the historic trilogy between the two pioneers of women's boxing. Following the win, the 39-year-old Taylor remained non-committal about her future in the sport, suggesting the Serrano saga is now complete.</p>

          <p>Poland has finalized a deal for a second batch of 180 South Korean K2 tanks, part of a larger 2022 agreement to acquire nearly 1,000 units. This highlights Poland's efforts to become a major European military power and South Korea's rise as a key arms supplier, particularly as US stockpiles are depleted by conflicts in Ukraine and elsewhere. The acquisitions are driven by heightened security concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Poland's defense spending projected to reach 4.7% of its GDP by 2025. This strategic partnership underscores a shift in global defense dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D employees, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. The agreement involves licensing fees for some of Windsurf's technology and compensation for the new hires, but Google is not investing in or acquiring the startup itself. This move intensifies the "talent war" in the artificial intelligence sector, following similar high-profile hires by companies like Meta and Microsoft. Windsurf will continue to operate under a new interim CEO and is known for its popular "vibe coding" tools.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing controversy over a sandal design. Critics in India argued that a sandal showcased at Milan Men's Fashion Week closely resembled the traditional, handcrafted Kolhapuri chappals without proper attribution. Following a social media outcry and a call to action from the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Prada engaged in talks to discuss future collaborations. The Chamber hailed the initiative as a potential model for respectful engagement between global fashion brands and traditional communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists allege their voices were cloned and used without permission after they were hired for what they were told was internal, academic work. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to the voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the use of their voices in training data will proceed. The case is one of many recent legal challenges by artists against AI companies.</p>
