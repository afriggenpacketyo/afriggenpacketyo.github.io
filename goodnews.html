          <p>Manchester United's manager, Ruben Amorim, has clarified that his recent comments suggesting he might quit were a result of an emotional reaction following a surprising EFL Cup loss to Grimsby. Amorim stated that his remarks about hating his players or wanting to leave are part of his passionate nature and that he needs to improve his handling of such situations. Despite the controversy and the team's winless start to the season, he reportedly maintains the backing of the club's ownership. The manager affirmed his commitment to his authentic, emotional style, even if it invites speculation about his future at the club.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has proposed expanding its list of critical minerals to include 51 additional commodities such as copper, lead, and silicon. This strategic update aims to strengthen domestic supply chains for key industries like semiconductors, automotive manufacturing, and solar energy, thereby reducing reliance on foreign sources, particularly China. The list guides government investment, tax incentives, and permitting decisions for mining and material recovery projects. By identifying minerals vulnerable to supply disruptions from geopolitical events, the U.S. government seeks to enhance national security and economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Max Levchin expressed confidence in the company's performance and its ability to manage loan repayments effectively, despite increased competition from rivals like Klarna.

          <p>Gold remains a popular investment commodity, often sought as a safe-haven asset during periods of economic instability and as a hedge against inflation. As of August 28, 2025, the price of gold was approximately $3,398.79 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant change. The value of gold is influenced by a variety of factors, including global supply and demand, prevailing economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Additionally, movements in currency values, particularly the U.S. dollar, and the policies of central banks can significantly impact the precious metal's market price. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, savers seeking high returns on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) may need to be more strategic. While rates above 6% are no longer common, it is still possible to find CDs with interest rates around 4.50%. To secure these higher yields, savers should consider online banks, which typically offer better rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions due to lower overhead costs. Using online marketplace sites can help compare offers efficiently, and focusing on short-term CDs of one year or less is currently the best approach for finding the highest available rates.

          <p>German striker Nick Woltemade, 23, has completed a high-profile transfer from Stuttgart to a Premier League club for a reported record fee of €85 million. The move comes after a breakout season where he scored 17 goals and played a key role in Stuttgart's German Cup victory. Known for his rare combination of size and technical skill, Woltemade also attracted strong interest from Bayern Munich, who reportedly had two bids rejected. His transfer is part of a larger trend of top Bundesliga talent moving to the Premier League, and it is seen as a significant step for his development and potential role in Germany's national team.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed stock saw a significant premarket increase after the company reported better-than-expected profits for its fiscal first quarter, largely driven by its cloud computing division. Revenue from the cloud unit grew 26% year-over-year, fueled by strong demand for artificial intelligence products, which the company stated saw triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. While overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, the robust performance of the cloud business and a revival in e-commerce have bolstered investor confidence. The company is strategically investing in AI and instant commerce to maintain its competitive edge in China's challenging market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Book Review Explores the Rise and Legacy of 2000s Indie Rock</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 09:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Chris DeVille's new book, "Such Great Heights," chronicles the evolution of indie rock during the 2000s, a period when bands like Grizzly Bear and Modest Mouse blurred the lines between niche music and the mainstream. The book argues that the internet, through platforms like Napster and blogs like Pitchfork, was instrumental in transforming indie from a local scene into a global cultural phenomenon. While the term 'indie' eventually became a lifestyle brand, its core ethos—valuing artistic exploration and authenticity over commercial polish—left a lasting impact. This idealistic approach to music ultimately influenced mainstream pop, as seen in the work of major artists today.</p>

          <h2>India's Economy Expands at 7.8% in June Quarter, Exceeding Expectations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 08:33:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's economy grew by an annual rate of 7.8% in the April-June quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts, driven by strong performance in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. Despite the robust real GDP figure, nominal GDP growth, which is not adjusted for inflation, slowed, suggesting that lower inflation helped boost the final number. Economists note that while corporate earnings have been strong, the recent implementation of 50% U.S. tariffs on Indian imports is expected to soften growth in the coming quarters. The World Bank and IMF project India's economy will grow around 6.3% for the full fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>
