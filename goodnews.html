          <h2>Contemporary Christian Music Achieves Mainstream Success on Billboard Charts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rise of Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) on the Billboard Hot 100 is being explored as an industry phenomenon rather than a simple genre trend. The article examines the economic ecosystem behind the music, including the role of megachurches and licensing firms that help smaller churches replicate a large-scale worship experience. It also touches on the cultural implications, noting the music's connection to a specific brand of masculinity, country music, and conservative politics, questioning what its growing popularity signifies in the current cultural moment.</p>

          <p>Amid rising US-China tensions, Chinese students are still seeking American university degrees but are becoming more discerning in their choices. Applicants are now placing a greater emphasis on a school's reputation, specific program rankings, and the availability of financial aid. While concerns about political instability and personal safety in the U.S. exist for both students and their parents, the appeal of academic freedom and the quality of top institutions continues to draw them. This reflects a shift towards a more calculated, value-driven approach to studying abroad in the current geopolitical climate.</p>

          <p>Kelsey Pittman, a 33-year-old woman who had been missing for months, has been found alive and safe in Colorado, according to the Inyo County Sheriff's Office. Her family had reported her missing in November, and concern grew after her abandoned car was discovered near Slab City, California, in February. This discovery prompted a large-scale search involving multiple agencies in the harsh desert environment, where she was feared to have perished. Authorities have not released further details about her circumstances, respecting the family's privacy, but confirmed the positive outcome of the monthslong search.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the Fire and Rescue Services Association (FRSA), more than 10,000 former on-call firefighters across the UK may be missing out on significant pension payments. Recent legal rulings have entitled retained firefighters who served between 2000 and 2006 to a pension for their entire career, a benefit they were previously denied. While an estimated 16,000 have already claimed payments, which can range from thousands to over £100,000, many more are believed to be eligible. The union is urging former firefighters to contact their old employers to inquire about their eligibility and begin the claims process. (not investment advice)</p>
