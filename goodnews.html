          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged former Department of Justice employee Sean Charles Dunn with a misdemeanor for allegedly throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer in Washington, D.C. The charge was reduced after a grand jury declined to indict him on a more serious felony assault charge. This marks the second recent case where the D.C. U.S. Attorney's office has failed to secure a felony indictment for an alleged assault on a federal officer. The incident occurred while federal authorities were deployed in the capital to address what President Trump has described as a major crime problem.</p>

He praised the Hong Kong government for showing a clear intent to embrace Web3 technologies but suggested immediate changes are needed. Specifically, he advocated for expanding the limited range of cryptocurrencies currently permitted for trading on licensed exchanges to foster growth and innovation.</p>

Despite a recent dip in its stock price following an earnings report, Cramer expressed confidence in the chipmaker's future, citing its dominance in the artificial intelligence sector. He argued that generative AI is still in its early stages and that Nvidia's products are uniquely positioned to revolutionize industries and "reinvent the very concept of work." Cramer suggested that trading in and out of such stocks causes investors to miss out on significant long-term gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka has advanced to the third round of the US Open after a convincing 6-3, 6-1 victory over Hailey Baptiste, continuing her recent return to top form. The win comes just weeks after a difficult experience in Montreal, where a loss in the final and a controversial runner-up speech overshadowed her progress. Having now won eight of her last nine matches, Osaka appears to have regained momentum and is aiming for her first fourth-round appearance at a major since 2021. After her match, she also commented on the controversy surrounding Jelena Ostapenko's recent remarks, providing context on their racial implications in tennis.</p>

          <h2>Expiring Tax Credit Makes Labor Day a Prime Time to Lease Electric Vehicles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 18:25:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to auto research firm Edmunds, the upcoming Labor Day weekend presents a significant opportunity for consumers to find deals on electric vehicle leases. A $7,500 federal tax credit for new EV leases is set to expire on September 30, making this a critical time to act. Leasing has become the dominant way consumers acquire EVs, accounting for 70% of transactions in July, as it allows them to test the technology without committing to a purchase. The IRS has also provided flexibility, allowing consumers to claim the credit if they sign a contract before the deadline, even if the vehicle is delivered later.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 18:10:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot legally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America, without the backing of a congressionally mandated advisory panel. U.S. Senior District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth stated that the law requires this oversight to insulate the international broadcaster from political pressure. Since President Trump has not filled the vacant positions on the panel, Lake lacks the authority to remove Abramowitz. The ruling is a significant setback for Lake's efforts to overhaul the agency, which have included drastic cuts to its workforce and language services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eighty years after the end of World War II, the relationship between China and Japan is characterized by a complex "love-hate" dynamic. This paradox is highlighted by the recent box office success in China of a film depicting Japanese wartime atrocities, which has reignited historical trauma. Simultaneously, Chinese tourism to Japan is surging, with China becoming Japan's top source of inbound visitors. This duality reflects a relationship shaped by deep historical wounds and geopolitical tensions on one hand, and strong economic interdependence and cultural appreciation on the other, creating a unique and often contradictory bond.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss a long-running lawsuit brought by the families of 9/11 victims, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit seeks to hold the kingdom liable for allegedly providing material support to some of the al Qaeda hijackers. U.S. District Judge George Daniels ruled that the plaintiffs have provided reasonable evidence regarding the roles of Saudi officials in assisting two of the hijackers. He stated that Saudi Arabia's attempts to offer innocent explanations were insufficient to overcome the evidence presented, paving the way for the critical issues to be examined at trial.</p>

          <p>All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons has been traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers following a lengthy and public contract dispute. As part of the deal, Parsons agreed to a record-breaking four-year, $188 million contract with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. The Cowboys will receive two first-round draft picks and veteran defensive tackle Kenny Clark in return. The dispute stemmed from Cowboys owner Jerry Jones' refusal to negotiate with Parsons' agent, leading Parsons to formally request a trade and end his highly successful four-year tenure in Dallas.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced an expansion of special California Highway Patrol (CHP) crime suppression teams to major cities across the state, including Los Angeles, San Diego, and the Bay Area. While touting that overall crime numbers are down, Newsom acknowledged that public perception is key and that more work is needed. The announcement is seen as a counterpoint to President Trump's narrative about rampant crime in blue states and his use of military forces in cities. Newsom emphasized that his approach involves collaboration with local law enforcement, contrasting it with what he described as the president's confrontational tactics.</p>
