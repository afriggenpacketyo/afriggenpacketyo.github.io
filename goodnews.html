          <p>Ukraine is increasingly relying on cheap, locally produced interceptor drones to defend against waves of Russian explosive drones, a strategy that is reshaping aerial warfare. Initially considered unfeasible, these "hit-to-kill" quadcopters have become a critical and cost-effective component of Ukraine's air defense, saving more expensive surface-to-air missiles for higher-priority threats. Ukrainian manufacturers, supported by innovation hubs and crowdfunding, are now aiming to produce 1,000 interceptors per day. This tactical evolution is drawing attention from NATO, which sees the technology as a promising solution for defending against mass drone attacks in future conflicts.</p>

          <p>US podcaster Johnathan Walton has expressed disappointment after Marianne Smyth, a serial fraudster he helped bring to justice, was sentenced to only four years in prison in Northern Ireland. Smyth was convicted of defrauding mortgage clients of over $155,000, but this represents just a fraction of her deceptive activities, which Walton chronicled in his "Queen of the Con" podcast after she scammed him personally. Walton's reporting led to a tip that resulted in her arrest in Maine in 2024. He stated that Smyth is an "inveterate con woman" who deserves to be confined for life to protect the public from future scams.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the Galleri blood test can successfully detect more than 50 different types of cancer, potentially revolutionizing early diagnosis and screening. The trial, conducted in North America with 25,000 adults, found that the test identified cancer in nearly one percent of participants, with cancer later confirmed in 62% of those positive cases. Significantly, more than half of the cancers were found at an early stage, and three-quarters were types that currently lack any routine screening program. While promising, researchers await results from a larger NHS trial in England to confirm if the test translates into reduced cancer mortality.</p>

          <p>Chen Ning Yang, a highly influential physicist and Nobel laureate, has passed away at the age of 103. In 1957, Yang and his colleague Lee Tsung-Dao were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their groundbreaking work on parity laws, which led to significant discoveries about elementary particles. Born in China, Yang spent much of his prolific career in the United States before returning to China, where he was a professor at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University. He was celebrated for his contributions across many areas of physics, particularly in statistical mechanics and symmetry principles.</p>

          <p>Nashville SC's English striker, Sam Surridge, finds himself in an unexpected competition for the Major League Soccer (MLS) Golden Boot, vying with global superstar Lionel Messi. Surridge has scored 23 league goals this season, placing him third in the scoring charts just behind Messi and LAFC's Denis Bouanga. His prolific goalscoring has been a key factor in Nashville's success, including their victory in the US Open Cup final. The article highlights Surridge's journey from lower-league loans in England to becoming a star in a city more known for country music than for soccer.</p>

          <p>As the global resale market for luxury goods expands at a rate three times faster than the primary market, robust authentication has become the key differentiator for credible platforms.

This focus on building trust has boosted business, as consumers are willing to pay a premium for the assurance that their pre-owned designer items are genuine. The market is projected to reach $360 billion by 2030, driven by affordability and access to rare items. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old woman from Newport, Charlotte Morjaria, discovered she had a large, cancerous kidney tumor following a minor accident during a weekend trip to Butlin's. After being playfully picked up by a friend, she experienced persistent pain and went to the hospital suspecting a broken rib. A precautionary CT scan to check for internal damage instead revealed a 7cm tumor on her left kidney, which she had been unaware of as its symptoms were masked by other factors. The chance discovery led to a diagnosis of a rare form of kidney cancer and subsequent surgery to remove the kidney, ultimately leaving her cancer-free.</p>

Speaking ahead of the Trump-Zelenskyy White House meeting, Stubb suggested that a "stick" is needed more than a "carrot" to bring Russia to peace talks, and that Trump is the one who can wield it effectively. Stubb expressed optimism about Trump's approach, believing more progress has been made toward negotiations in the last eight months than in the previous three years. He also affirmed that Finland would never recognize Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territories.</p>

The decade-long investigation that followed led Easton to trace looted artworks and properties, uncovering a legacy devastated by the Holocaust.
