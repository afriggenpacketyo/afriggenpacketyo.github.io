          <p>Prince William was visibly touched during a conversation with Rhian Mannings, who shared her experience of losing her husband to suicide after the death of their one-year-old son. Mannings has since established a bereavement charity, which will receive £1 million from Prince William's Royal Foundation to develop a National Suicide Prevention Network. The network aims to understand the root causes of suicide and provide support to those affected, addressing the stigma surrounding suicide and encouraging open conversation about mental health struggles. Prince William emphasized the importance of a unified national response to prevent suicide, acknowledging the profound impact of loss and the need for accessible support. The conversation highlighted the importance of speaking out and seeking help in times of despair, with Mannings expressing the wish that her husband had felt able to confide in her. </p>

          <p>Wayne Rooney defended his England team, the so-called golden generation, against recent criticism suggesting they lacked the right attitude, arguing they simply "didn't quite manage to get over the line." This comes after Steven Gerrard attributed their lack of success to key players being "egotistical losers" who "weren't a team." Rooney acknowledged the presence of big characters in the dressing room but maintained that the players worked hard. He noted the difference in the current generation, where players from rival teams train together and have better relationships with the media, creating a more positive atmosphere. Rooney emphasized that his team always believed they could win, despite ultimately falling short of expectations. </p>

          <p>Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth announced that his party is ready to replace Welsh Labour at the next Senedd election, promising a "new government, with new energy and new ideas". He positioned Plaid Cymru as the leading anti-Reform party, urging voters to back them to prevent Nigel Farage's Reform UK from winning. Ap Iorwerth aims to broaden the party's appeal beyond its traditional base in Welsh-speaking areas, emphasizing a government for all of Wales. Despite being pro-independence, the party is unlikely to prioritize the issue in the upcoming election, focusing instead on offering radical policies and addressing child poverty. The party faces competition from Reform UK, which has significant financial resources and media coverage. </p>

Measures to prevent rough sleeping will receive £28.4m, while £7.1m will help families with children in temporary accommodation, and £960,000 will go towards drug and alcohol treatment. London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan welcomed the investment, emphasizing the importance of preventing homelessness and supporting those in need. Homelessness charity Crisis called the funding "very welcome" but emphasized the need for a longer-term strategy. </p>

          <p>A judge dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's song "Not Like Us." Judge Jeannette Vargas ruled that Lamar's lyrics, accusing Drake and his associates of being "certified paedophiles", were "nonactionable opinion" and not defamatory. Drake filed the lawsuit in January, alleging that UMG spread a "false and malicious narrative" by allowing the song to be published. Drake's spokesperson stated that he plans to appeal the ruling, while UMG expressed satisfaction with the outcome. The song, widely seen as a decisive blow in a rap battle between the two artists, has become a major hit for Lamar. </p>

          <p>A US federal judge ordered a temporary halt to President Trump's deployment of National Guard soldiers in Illinois, including Chicago. The Trump administration had ordered the troops to protect federal officials and facilities from violent protesters. Judge April Perry said allowing Guard troops would only "add fuel to the fire," siding with Chicago and Illinois, who sued to stop the deployment. The judge expressed doubt over the federal government's claims of violence during protests, stating that the Department of Homeland Security's narrative was unreliable. The order will be in effect for two weeks, with the Trump administration planning to appeal. </p>
