          <p>Bitcoin's price surged on Friday, coming within 1% of its record high as investors increasingly view it as a safe-haven asset during the U.S. government shutdown. The cryptocurrency gained 12% this week alone, driven by investor uncertainty after lawmakers failed to secure federal funding. Analysts from Standard Chartered noted that Bitcoin is now trading in response to 'US government risks,' a shift from its behavior during previous shutdowns. The bank predicts the digital asset will soon surpass its all-time high and could eventually reach a price of $135,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative, as its new leader, making her the likely first female prime minister in the country's history. A protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hard-line conservative views and hawkish stance on China. Her election is seen as an effort by the LDP to regain public support after recent election losses, though her regular visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine could strain relations with neighboring Asian countries and create diplomatic challenges.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the first-ever rock samples returned from the far side of the moon by China's Chang'e-6 mission reveals a significant temperature difference between the moon's two hemispheres. A team of scientists from China and Britain found that minerals from the far side appear to have formed in lava that was about 100 degrees Celsius cooler than on the near side. This discovery provides new insights into the moon's thermal asymmetry and its formation, helping to explain long-observed differences in topography and volcanic activity between the two sides.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column pushes back against conservative criticism of Bad Bunny being selected as the Super Bowl halftime performer, which labeled him as "un-American." The author points out the flawed logic of the criticism, reminding readers that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and that the NFL has a long history of featuring non-American acts to grow its global brand. The article argues that objections to Bad Bunny singing in Spanish are counterproductive and ignore the multicultural reality of the United States and the global music landscape, which has long embraced non-English hits.</p>

          <p>Michele Mulroney, the newly elected president of the Writers Guild of America West, is taking leadership as the industry faces major challenges like production consolidation and the rise of AI. Following a recent victory where writer protests helped reinstate "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," Mulroney plans to build on gains from the 2023 strike, particularly regarding AI protections. A key focus for upcoming contract negotiations will be securing increased studio contributions to the WGA's health plan, which has been strained by the recent industry contraction and a pullback in production.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Italian researchers proposes that the iconic bronze Lion of St. Mark in Venice was originally a tomb guardian statue from China's Tang dynasty (618–907). The theory is based on stylistic similarities to mythical zhenmushou beasts and lead isotope analysis indicating the copper came from China's Lower Yangtze River basin. The researchers speculate the 2.8-tonne statue may have been transported to Venice by the family of explorer Marco Polo before being altered into its current form, though some Chinese scholars are disputing the claim.</p>
