          <p>President Donald Trump and several CEOs are promoting savings plans for newborns, with Dell Technologies pledging $1,000 for so-called Trump accounts for new children of its employees. The savings account plan is part of a Republican-backed budget bill moving through Congress. The program would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. Once the bill is signed into law, "Goldman Sachs would be excited to further support" the initiative, said Solomon, without providing details.

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur may replace Ange Postecoglou with Thomas Frank, who has managed Brentford since 2018. Frank has been described as the opposite of Postecoglou for his adaptability. Frank has spent ¬£254m on players and received ¬£183m in sales - a net spend of ¬£71m. There's much more pressure at Tottenham than there is at Brentford, because of the expectation - and the manager has to handle that expectation. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>Rugby league legend Billy Boston is set to receive a knighthood at Buckingham Palace, marking the sport's first such honor in 130 years. The award is being presented early due to concerns over Boston's health. Boston, 90, was a star player for Wigan and Great Britain in the 1950s and 1960s. The knighthood follows frustration over the lack of top honors for rugby league figures. The optimism score for this article is 85.</p>

          <p>Lennon Miller, an 18-year-old midfielder, impressed in his first start for Scotland against Liechtenstein, providing an assist and demonstrating maturity. Miller's performance was a highlight of the friendly win, showcasing his passing ability and composure. Former Scotland captain Scott Brown praised Miller's exceptional passing and understanding of the game. To come in and show belief in himself, it shows you nothing really fazes him and that's the best thing about football, especially being a young kid, go out and, as the manager said, do what you do at Motherwell.

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively. The suit stemmed from Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on set and Baldoni's alleged retaliation.
