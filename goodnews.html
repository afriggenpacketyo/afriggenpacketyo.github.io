          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's largest creditor for the first time in 34 years, now ranking second behind Germany, according to the Finance Ministry. While Japan's gross external assets rose to a record 533.05 trillion yen, Germany's assets totaled 569.65 trillion yen. The yen's depreciation increased the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. Japan's net external credit increased for the seventh consecutive year, driven by direct investment in the United States by domestic financial institutions and trading houses.

The price of the Seagull hatchback was reduced by 20%, while the Seal dual-motor hybrid sedan saw a 34% price cut. Analysts anticipate that BYD's price reductions will lead to a surge in dealership store visits, but they do not foresee it significantly impacting competitors' market share.

          <p>Official data indicates that China's industrial profits rose at a faster pace in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms increased by 3% compared to the previous year, accelerating from 2.6% in March. The improved profitability is attributed to the industrial sectors' resilience and ability to withstand shocks, with the high-tech manufacturing industry experiencing notable growth. However, statisticians caution that constraints such as insufficient demand and declining prices still persist, alongside uncertainty in the external environment. (not investment advice)</p>

The legislation would allow owners to deduct only half the value of their team‚Äôs ‚Äúintangible assets‚Äù over 15 years, which could raise nearly $1 billion over a decade. While the provision would only affect future owners, it could cool demand for teams and hurt current owners by slowing the growth of their investments.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has been released from the hospital after being treated for an inflammation of the inner ear, which caused him to experience vertigo. The 79-year-old president underwent imaging and blood tests, which all came back normal, and is now resting at the official presidential residence. This health scare follows a history of medical issues for Lula, including a fall, brain bleed, high blood pressure, and throat cancer. Lula is currently serving his third term as Brazil's president.</p>
