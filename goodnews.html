          <p>Actress Kristin Scott Thomas has directed her first film, "My Mother's Wedding," drawing inspiration from profound personal losses in her childhood. In a recent interview, she discusses how the deaths of her father and stepfather, both Royal Navy pilots, shaped her creative process and led her to write a story about a family she never had. The film, starring Scarlett Johansson and Sienna Miller, explores themes of grief and family dynamics as three daughters reunite for their mother's third wedding. Thomas also reflects on her acclaimed acting career, from her early shyness to roles in "The English Patient" and "Slow Horses."</p>

          <p>The art of Louise Nevelson, a pioneering 20th-century sculptor, is being celebrated in new exhibitions at the Whitney Museum in New York and the Columbus Museum of Art. Known for her massive, monochromatic sculptures created from found wooden objects, Nevelson drew inspiration from the streets of New York City but took decades to gain recognition. The article explores her life, from her immigration from Ukraine to Maine, to her unconventional methods and fierce dedication to her craft. Her granddaughter, Maria Nevelson, reflects on the artist's intimidating yet inspiring personality and her enduring legacy of pursuing one's passion without limitations.</p>

          <p>A mysterious 12-foot-tall sculpture of Elon Musk's head has been appearing in iconic U.S. national parks like Yosemite and Mt. Rainier. The installation, which features the slogan "MAKE AMERICA WAIT AGAIN" and references longer lines due to "DOGE Cuts," is a form of protest art against recent layoffs and budget reductions at the National Park Service. The anonymous organizer, speaking exclusively to Fox News Digital, stated the project aims to highlight the negative impact of the cuts, which were associated with Musk's role as a former government policy advisor. The organizer claims no political affiliation, intending the spectacle to spark a nonpartisan conversation about protecting shared national treasures.</p>

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of a turnaround under CEO Kelly Ortberg, who came out of retirement to lead the company. The manufacturer's stock is up over 30% this year, with aircraft production and deliveries increasing. Ortberg has focused on changing the company culture, cutting costs, and improving quality control, which has been praised by airline customers like Ryanair's CEO. However, significant challenges remain, including an FAA cap on 737 Max production and delays in certifying new aircraft models, but analysts are growing more optimistic about the company's future financial performance.

          <p>Top officials from the U.S. and the European Union have converged on Donald Trump's Turnberry golf resort in Scotland for critical talks aimed at preventing a trade war. The EU delegation, led by President Ursula von der Leyen, is hoping to secure a framework agreement to avoid Trump's threatened 30% tariffs on all EU imports. An agreement in principle is reportedly centered on a baseline tariff of 15% on EU goods, a compromise seen as a painful but necessary price for stability. With global financial markets watching closely, the hastily arranged meeting is considered a pivotal moment for transatlantic trade relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former rugby player Matt Dawson argues that for the current British and Irish Lions team to achieve legendary status, they must win the third and final Test match to complete a 3-0 series whitewash against Australia. While celebrating the series victory is important, Dawson contends that a clean sweep would elevate this squad to a level not seen in a century. He contrasts this with his own 1997 Lions team, which won the series 2-0 but lost the final test, admitting there was less focus on a whitewash amid the euphoria. He praises the current team's public ambition and suggests a few strategic team changes to maintain freshness and intensity.</p>

          <p>In the hot, dry jungles of northern Guatemala, conservation groups have set up artificial watering holes to help wildlife cope with extreme heat and drought. Motion-activated cameras placed nearby have captured incredible footage of a diverse array of animals using these water sources. The videos show rarely seen species like jaguars and tapirs, as well as spider monkeys, drinking and cooling off. The project highlights a simple yet vital way humans can help animals adapt to the increasingly unpredictable environmental conditions caused by climate change. These 'thirst traps' provide both a lifeline for wildlife and valuable insight into their behavior.</p>

The column also includes a diverse range of personal favorites, from the music of Chappell Roan and Courtney Barnett to the television show "The Bear."

          <p>This article profiles Texas Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett, who has gained national attention for her sharp, combative style and viral clapbacks against Republicans. Crockett argues that the Democratic Party needs fiercer communicators to energize its base, a theory she tested in a recent, unsuccessful bid for a leadership role on the House Oversight Committee. While her supporters see her as a much-needed fighter in the Trump era, some colleagues worry her coarse rhetoric could alienate moderate voters. The profile explores her background as a lawyer and her rapid rise, examining whether her confrontational approach is an effective political strategy or a liability.</p>
