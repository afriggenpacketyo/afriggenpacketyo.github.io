          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 01:20:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new anti-poaching initiative in South Africa, named the Rhisotope Project, involves injecting rhino horns with harmless radioactive isotopes. Led by the University of the Witwatersrand, the project aims to make the horns easily detectable by radiation scanners at borders and airports, thereby disrupting trafficking networks. Researchers have confirmed the process is safe for the animals but effective in triggering security alarms, even when horns are hidden in large shipping containers. This innovative strategy hopes to protect the country's dwindling rhino population, which is heavily targeted for the illegal horn trade.</p>

Despite a challenging season in the MLS, the Galaxy showcased a strong offensive performance with goals from Matheus Nascimento, Gabriel Pec, Marco Reus, and a brace from Joseph Paintsil. The Ghanaian forward was a standout player, also recovering from a missed penalty to lead his team's attack.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A trend analysis suggests the focus of the international space industry is increasingly shifting from the Moon to Mars, viewing lunar missions as a "stepping stone" rather than a final destination. While NASA's Artemis program continues to advance lunar exploration, with plans for a sustainable human presence, the long-term strategic goal for nations like the U.S. and China is Mars. The article notes that private companies are filling the gap in lunar logistics through programs like NASA's CLPS. This pivot marks a new phase in the space race, with Mars seen as the ultimate prize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China and Kuwait have pledged to deepen their military relationship as they prepare to inaugurate a joint ammunition factory. The plant, which will reportedly produce light and medium ammunition, is described as a "milestone" in their cooperation by Kuwait's deputy minister of defence. The two nations also plan to expand their joint military training programs, which have been ongoing since 2019. This partnership underscores China's increasing diplomatic and military engagement in the Gulf region, building on a military cooperation agreement first signed with Kuwait, a key U.S. ally, in 1995.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance in the NFL's preseason-opening Hall of Fame game, leading the Los Angeles Chargers to a 34-7 victory over the Detroit Lions. Lance, competing for a backup role, threw for 120 yards and two touchdowns, showcasing the potential that made him a former No. 3 overall draft pick. The game began with a moment of silence for the victims of a recent shooting that targeted the league's headquarters in New York. Most star players from both teams, including Justin Herbert and Jared Goff, did not participate in the contest.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals, postponing the planned terminations until at least November 18. In her decision, Judge Trina Thompson stated the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the administration's actions were "preordained" and potentially motivated by racial animus. The administration has sought to curtail the TPS program, arguing it has been extended beyond its original temporary intent.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has defended the court's management of its emergency docket, which has seen a surge in appeals from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh argued that as presidents increasingly use executive orders, more legal challenges are inevitable, requiring the court's intervention. He noted that the court has tried to improve its process for these time-sensitive cases, sometimes scheduling emergency oral arguments. Kavanaugh described the collegiality among the justices as "very strong," stating that they view each other as patriots even when they express differing views in fierce dissents.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), announced an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion and slightly surpassing analysts' expectations. While AWS remains the market leader, it faces growing competition from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, both of which reported higher growth rates in the same period. The division continues to be a major profit driver for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income. CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the company's focus on security and noted that supply constraints, particularly for power, remain a challenge amid rising AI demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to construct a new, 90,000-square-foot ballroom at the White House, with a projected cost of $200 million. President Trump stated the new facility, which will replace the current East Wing, is needed to host large-scale events that currently require tents on the South Lawn. Funding for the project will reportedly come from Trump himself and other "patriot donors," with the president calling it "his gift to the country." This marks the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948.</p>
