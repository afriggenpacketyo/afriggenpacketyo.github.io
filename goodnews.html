          <p>The United States is gearing up for its Semiquincentennial, the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 2026. Planning is being handled by multiple national and state-level groups, including a congressional commission and a White House task force. Events planned include nationwide parades, a traveling tech expo, the creation of a National Garden of American Heroes, and a time capsule burial in Philadelphia. These initiatives aim to both celebrate the nation's history and look toward its future, echoing the large-scale commemorations of the 1876 Centennial and the 1976 Bicentennial celebrations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A small business owner in Oklahoma has resorted to an unconventional method to cope with rising U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Robert Keeley, owner of Keeley Electronics, used over 1.8 million American Express reward points to pay an $11,000 bill that included tariff charges for a critical guitar pedal component he can only source from China. The tariffs on this part have surged to 55% under the Trump administration, creating significant financial pressure on his 33-person company. Keeley's situation highlights the creative and sometimes difficult measures smaller enterprises are taking to absorb the impact of ongoing trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The tradition of barbecue, a staple of American holidays like the Fourth of July, has its origins with the Indigenous Ta√≠no people of the Caribbean. The term itself is derived from the Ta√≠no word "barabicu," which described the wooden frames they used for cooking meat over an open fire. Spanish explorers encountered this method in the 15th century and adapted the word into "barbacoa," first documented in print in 1526. This cooking style and its name spread and evolved, influenced by various immigrant cultures across the U.S. to create the diverse regional barbecue traditions known today.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest version of a sweeping domestic policy bill backed by President Trump includes more generous tax credits for semiconductor manufacturers building facilities in the United States. The legislation, which passed the Senate, would increase the investment tax credit for eligible chip firms from 25% to 35%, expanding on incentives from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. This move is part of Washington's ongoing effort to onshore the advanced semiconductor supply chain and reduce reliance on Asia. Companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron could benefit if they expand their U.S. operations before a 2026 deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool FC has turned down a formal approach from German club Bayern Munich for their Colombian forward, Luis Diaz. According to reports, Bayern's director of sport was informed that Liverpool has no intention of selling the 28-year-old attacker and will not engage in any discussions. This follows a similar rebuff by the Premier League champions to an approach from Barcelona earlier in the summer. Liverpool considers Diaz, who scored 22 goals for his club and country last season, a key part of their squad and is adamant he is not for sale at any price.</p>

          <p>The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has announced that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that he might be the last. In a statement ahead of his 90th birthday, he confirmed that his reincarnation should be found according to traditional Tibetan Buddhist practices. This decision is politically significant, as it directly challenges China's repeated claims that it has the sole authority to approve the next spiritual leader. The Dalai Lama emphasized that the process lies solely with a trust he established, signaling that his successor would likely be identified outside of Chinese control.</p>

          <p>Shares of Beijing-based luxury jeweller Laopu Gold surged 15% to a record high, defying expectations of a pullback after a major lock-up period expired. The end of the lock-up freed 69 million shares, a 40% stake, allowing pre-listing investors to sell their holdings for the first time since the company's 2024 debut. Instead of a sell-off, investors rushed to buy the stock, which has risen over 1,300% since its initial public offering. Analysts attribute the strong performance to the company's powerful branding, strong pricing power, and potential for overseas growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a surprising start to NBA free agency, longtime Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner has agreed to a four-year, $107 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. To facilitate the move, the Bucks waived nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon and will now be free to sign with any team. The move signals a significant roster shake-up for both the Bucks, who recently lost center Brook Lopez, and the Pacers, who are facing a season without their own injured star, Tyrese Haliburton.
