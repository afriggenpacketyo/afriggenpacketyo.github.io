          <h2>Trump Announces Coca-Cola to Switch to Cane Sugar from Corn Syrup</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has announced that Coca-Cola agreed to replace high-fructose corn syrup with "REAL Cane Sugar" in its U.S. products, a move he promoted on Truth Social. The announcement aligns with some health advocates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has criticized corn syrup, though the company has not officially confirmed the specifics of the deal. Health experts, however, note that cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup have nearly identical metabolic effects, making the change largely symbolic from a public health perspective. The move is seen by some as a political strategy to score an easy win with his base.</p>

          <h2>Homeland Security Secretary Suggests Potential Changes to TSA Liquid Restrictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:34:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is reviewing its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on baggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning all current TSA procedures and that the rules on liquid sizes might be the next major policy to change. This follows the recent elimination of the requirement for passengers to remove shoes during security screening. The current 3.4-ounce liquid rule was implemented in 2006 after a foiled terrorist plot involving liquid explosives, and any changes would be facilitated by new CT scanning technology being deployed at airports.</p>

          <h2>Bipartisan Congressional Women's Softball Game Raises Funds for Breast Cancer Charity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:31:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game brought together female members of Congress from both parties to compete against a team of journalists, setting aside political divisions for a charitable cause. The event, co-founded by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz after her own diagnosis, raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, which supports young adults with breast cancer. Unlike the partisan men's baseball game, this tradition emphasizes unity and has raised nearly $5 million since its inception in 2009. The game serves as a powerful symbol of collaboration and provides a personal connection for many participants affected by the disease.</p>

          <p>This month's cinema releases include a diverse slate of films with notable Latin-American involvement. Among them is a new sequel to "I Know What You Did Last Summer," which attempts a self-aware, meta-humor approach but offers mixed results compared to its 1997 predecessor. Also featured is Ari Aster's "Eddington," a neo-western set during the 2020 pandemic starring Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal, which explores political and social tensions through a dark, realist lens. Other releases reviewed are the controversial bullfighting documentary "Tardes de soledad" and two distinct LGBTQ+ dramas, "Before We Forget" and "Unicorns," each exploring unique, personal stories of love and identity.</p>

          <h2>Scientists to Analyze 1.5-Million-Year-Old Ice Core to Uncover Climate History</h2>

          <p>An ice core, potentially the oldest ever recovered at 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey for analysis. Scientists will melt the ice, drilled from deep within Antarctica, to study trapped materials like ancient dust and volcanic ash. This research aims to unlock vital information about Earth's climate history from a period known as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, when glacial cycles mysteriously changed. The findings could revolutionize understanding of climate change by providing data on past atmospheric conditions, potentially helping to predict our planet's future response to rising greenhouse gas levels.</p>

        </div>

          <p>New UK regulations taking effect next July will require 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is implementing the rules to prevent consumers from accumulating excessive debt, meaning some users may be denied credit. The currently unregulated sector has seen explosive growth, particularly among young adults, raising concerns from debt charities. These new protections will bring BNPL services in line with other forms of credit, ensuring clearer terms and giving consumers the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman.

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after experiencing swelling in his legs. According to his physician, the condition is benign, common in older adults, and occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart. The announcement followed public speculation prompted by photographs showing bruising on the president's hand and swollen legs. The physician's note stated the bruising was consistent with tissue damage from frequent handshaking while taking aspirin and affirmed that Trump is in "excellent health" with no evidence of more serious conditions.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings receiver Jordan Addison will avoid jail time after pleading no contest to a reduced charge of "wet reckless driving" stemming from a 2024 DUI citation.

Addison was sentenced to 12 months' probation and must pay a fine and complete online courses, allowing him to put the incident behind him and focus on his NFL career, though he may still face a league suspension.</p>

Slovakia had been holding up the unanimous approval required from all 27 member states due to concerns about a separate EU plan to halt Russian gas imports by 2028. Fico stated that Slovakia received guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade. The new sanctions target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including measures to further isolate Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system.</p>

          <p>Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), the condition President Trump was recently diagnosed with, is a common circulatory issue affecting up to 40% of the U.S. population. It occurs when valves in the leg veins are damaged, causing blood to pool and leading to symptoms like varicose veins, leg swelling, and skin discoloration. According to vascular surgeons, the condition is typically not serious and is often managed with non-surgical treatments like compression stockings and lifestyle changes such as regular walking. While genetics and aging are risk factors, the condition itself is considered benign and treatable for most patients.</p>
