          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 07:48:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to address its ongoing demographic crisis, China has launched its first nationwide childcare subsidy program. The government will provide an annual payment of 3,600 yuan for every child born on or after January 1, 2025, until they reach the age of three. This policy marks a significant shift towards direct financial support for households to encourage more births and mitigate the long-term economic impact of a declining population. However, some economists suggest the subsidy amount is too small to significantly influence birth rates or consumption in the near term.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has preliminarily found that the Chinese online shopping platform Temu is in breach of the Digital Services Act (DSA). The EU alleges that Temu, which has nearly 94 million monthly users in the bloc, is not doing enough to prevent the sale of illegal products that fail to meet EU safety standards. The commission also cited concerns over fake discounts, insufficient vendor information, and addictive app design. If the violations are confirmed, Temu could face a fine of up to 6% of its global annual turnover, signaling a significant regulatory challenge.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 07:36:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following five days of intense fighting that resulted in at least 33 deaths and displaced over 260,000 people, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. The agreement was announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who mediated the talks after pressure from the United States. The conflict, rooted in a long-standing border dispute, had escalated significantly, with both sides exchanging heavy fire. While this is a crucial first step towards de-escalation, challenges remain in verifying troop withdrawal and rebuilding trust between the two nations.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Psychology of Emotional Sensitivity and Rejection</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines why some individuals are more emotionally sensitive than others, often feeling deeply hurt by minor slights or comments. Psychologists suggest this can be rooted in both genetic predispositions and past experiences like neglect or trauma, leading to a heightened fear of rejection. This sensitivity isn't inherently negative, as it can mean feeling the world more intensely, but it can disrupt relationships if not managed. The article discusses coping strategies, such as reality-checking negative assumptions and being more discerning about whose opinions matter, to help individuals better navigate their emotional responses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To combat an acute shortage of affordable housing and exploding rents, Germany's government is planning a "Bau-Turbo" (construction turbo) law. This legislation aims to fast-track building approvals by allowing municipalities to bypass complex planning laws for new residential projects. The goal is to stimulate construction, which has been hit by rising costs and interest rates, and address the need for an estimated 320,000 new homes annually. While the construction industry welcomes the plan, some economists are skeptical it will be effective without further economic stimulus, and environmentalists worry about the loss of green spaces.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg outlines his vision for the future of the Democratic party. He argues that Democrats have been overly attached to a status quo that is no longer working for many Americans and that a simple restoration of pre-Trump institutions is not a sufficient goal. Instead, Buttigieg suggests the party needs to develop a new strategy and message for future elections, moving beyond the framework of the 2021-2025 term. His comments reflect a broader conversation within the party about how to adapt and connect with voters in a changing political landscape.</p>

This marks the first time the company has led the market since early 2024, signaling a strong comeback from U.S. sanctions. Meanwhile, Apple also saw a positive turn, with its shipments in China growing by 4% year-on-year, its first increase since late 2023. Apple's rebound is attributed to strategic price adjustments and trade-in offers for its iPhone 16 series, providing a welcome sign for investors concerned about the company's performance in the competitive Chinese market.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the nature of difficult life decisions, drawing on the work of philosopher Ruth Chang. It argues that hard choices, such as between a high-paying corporate job and morally fulfilling nonprofit work, are not difficult because one option is secretly better. Instead, the options are "on a par"—they are in the same league of value but are valuable in very different ways. In these situations, external reasons run out, and individuals must exercise their own agency to create reasons for themselves by deciding what they stand for. Making the choice is an act of defining one's own identity.</p>

          <p>Astronomers are advising sky-watchers to look for meteors this week, as two lesser-known showers—the Southern Delta Aquariids and the Alpha Capricornids—are set to peak. This year's famous Perseid meteor shower in August will be largely washed out by a bright, nearly full moon. In contrast, the moon will be only about 25% full for this week's events, providing darker skies for better viewing. While these showers are less active than the Perseids, they can still produce 20-30 meteors per hour, with the Alpha Capricornids known for occasional slow, bright fireballs, offering a better viewing opportunity this summer.</p>

The funds were distributed through a USDA emergency assistance program, with payments expected to increase as more claims are processed.
