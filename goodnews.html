        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken multiple times in 2025, signaling significant financial growth in the sport, particularly in leagues in England and the USA. While rising fees indicate increased investment and marketability, experts warn of a growing financial gap between elite clubs and the rest of the world. Leagues like Germany's Bundesliga are struggling to compete with the broadcast and sponsorship revenues of their English and American counterparts. This trend highlights a pivotal moment for the sport, balancing commercial expansion with the risk of creating a permanent financial elite.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region displayed a mixed reaction following the news of the U.S. government shutdown, suggesting investors were not overly alarmed by the political gridlock. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 continued its losing streak despite a business sentiment survey showing sustained optimism among non-manufacturers. Meanwhile, markets in South Korea and Taiwan saw gains, with chipmaker TSMC rising after Nvidia reached a new market capitalization milestone. Markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were closed for a holiday, and spot gold prices reached a new record high amid the uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Despite not being considered favorites, New Zealand's women's cricket team is entering the 50-over World Cup with confidence, according to all-rounder Melie Kerr. The team, known as the White Ferns, are the surprise reigning T20 World Cup champions and believe their current squad has the potential to be a dominant force over the next decade. Head coach Ben Sawyer acknowledges that Australia, India, and England are the top contenders but embraces the underdog status, stating the team believes it can defeat anyone on its day.

          <p>India's central bank has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, aligning with economists' expectations. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is pausing to evaluate the economic effects of a significant 50-basis-point rate cut made in June. Governor Sanjay Malhotra noted that while inflation has moderated, growth could slow in the latter half of the fiscal year due to global trade uncertainties, including U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. The RBI projects the economy will grow by 6.8% in fiscal year 2026, with recent domestic tax cuts intended to spur demand and mitigate external pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>James Slipper, the most-capped player in the history of the Australian national rugby team, will retire from international duty following this weekend's test match against New Zealand. The 36-year-old prop recently earned his 150th cap for the Wallabies, a first for any player. Over his distinguished 16-year career, Slipper represented Australia in four World Cups and served as captain on 15 occasions. He described representing his country as the "single proudest achievement" of his career, a dream he has lived since childhood.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca is moving to a full listing on the New York Stock Exchange, converting its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) into standard shares. This strategic move is designed to attract a wider range of U.S. investors and improve access to America's larger capital pools, potentially leading to inclusion in the S&P 500. While the company insists its headquarters and primary listing will remain in the U.K., the decision follows a trend of major firms shifting away from the London Stock Exchange. Some analysts see it as a step that could ease a future full switch to a U.S. listing. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting this week, supermarkets and other large retailers in England are banned from offering multibuy promotions, such as "buy one, get one free," on food and drink products high in fat, salt, or sugar. The measure, which has been delayed due to cost-of-living concerns, is a government initiative aimed at tackling the nation's rising obesity rates. Public health officials have welcomed the long-overdue step, arguing that such deals do not save consumers money and instead encourage over-consumption. The ban follows earlier restrictions on placing unhealthy products in prominent store locations like checkouts.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant milestone in its energy infrastructure, with its network of subsea pipelines now extending over 10,000 kilometers. This was accomplished with the final installation of a deep-sea pipeline in Bohai Bay, one of the country's largest offshore oil production bases. The expanding network is crucial for China's efforts to enhance its energy security by tapping into offshore resources. Looking ahead, the pipelines are also being designed to transport green fuels like hydrogen, supporting the nation's long-term energy transition goals, with plans to reach 13,000 kilometers by 2030.</p>

          <p>Mark Rutte's first year as NATO's Secretary General has been defined by the challenge of managing the alliance's relationship with a re-elected U.S. President Donald Trump. Assuming the role in October 2024, Rutte focused on reaffirming the U.S. commitment to NATO, a task that required significant diplomatic maneuvering. He successfully lobbied member states to increase defense spending to meet Trump's demands, securing U.S. participation in a key summit. While experts rate his performance positively for maintaining alliance unity, they note that the long-term durability of these diplomatic successes remains uncertain amid growing external pressures from Russia.</p>

          <p>As of today, all general practitioner practices in England are mandated to provide online appointment booking services throughout the entire workday, from 8:00 AM to 6:30 PM. This government initiative aims to end the "8am scramble" where patients struggle to get through on busy phone lines. Patients will be able to request non-urgent appointments, ask questions, and describe symptoms online for a callback. Despite some concerns from the British Medical Association about potential risks, ministers have proceeded with the plan, framing it as a key step in modernizing the NHS and improving patient access.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers began their postseason campaign with a decisive 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the first game of their wild-card series. The Dodgers' offense was explosive, tying a club postseason record with five home runs, including two each from stars Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. Starting pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong performance, striking out nine batters over seven innings. However, the team's bullpen showed signs of weakness, allowing three runs in the eighth inning before securing the win, highlighting a potential vulnerability for the team as they advance.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing skilled trades over traditional four-year college degrees, driven by concerns over high tuition costs and the threat of AI automating white-collar jobs. Occupations like electricians, plumbers, and welders are seen as more secure from automation compared to entry-level roles in fields like data analytics or accounting. This trend marks a shift in perception, where trade jobs are increasingly viewed as a smart career path rather than a less desirable alternative. For many, the trades offer a route to financial independence and entrepreneurship without the burden of student loan debt.</p>

          <p>The 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks during the government shutdown, as the program's funding is mandatory and not subject to annual appropriation. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is affected, which will lead to service disruptions. With nearly 90% of its workforce deemed essential, key functions like benefit payments will continue. Non-critical services, such as benefit verifications, replacing Medicare cards, and processing overpayments, will be halted, potentially causing delays and inconvenience for many beneficiaries.</p>
