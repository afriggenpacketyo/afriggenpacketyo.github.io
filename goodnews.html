          <p>A new tropical storm, named Kiko, has formed in the eastern Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,000 miles off the coast of Mexico. According to the U.S. National Hurricane Center, the storm currently poses no immediate threat to land. Forecasters predict that Kiko will gradually strengthen over the next few days, likely reaching hurricane status by Tuesday. With maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, the storm is moving westward and is the eleventh named storm in the Eastern North Pacific this season, highlighting an active period for tropical weather systems.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge issued an emergency order to block the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala without formal deportation proceedings. The ruling by Judge Sparkle Sooknanan came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following a lawsuit alleging the effort would bypass legal protections for these minors. The Justice Department argued it was repatriating children at their families' request, a claim disputed by lawyers who stated the children could face abuse and persecution if returned.</p>

          <p>Famed chef Gordon Ramsay has revealed he was diagnosed with skin cancer and recently underwent surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from his face. He shared photos of his post-surgery bandage and stitches on Instagram, using the experience to urge his followers to wear sunscreen. Ramsay, known for his directness, humorously noted that the procedure was not a facelift. This is not the first time he has used a personal health scare to promote public safety, having previously advocated for wearing helmets after a serious bicycle accident.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has confirmed that Europe is formulating detailed plans for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees. In an interview with the Financial Times, she stated that these plans would be backed by U.S. capabilities, including intelligence and command systems, an arrangement reportedly affirmed by President Trump. The deployment could involve tens of thousands of European-led troops, with further high-level discussions on the matter scheduled to take place in Paris.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates, marking the UK's largest-ever warship export deal by value. The deal is expected to support 4,000 jobs in the UK, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership will create a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates, significantly bolstering NATO's defensive capabilities in the North Atlantic against potential threats from Russian submarines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At an informal meeting in Copenhagen, European Union foreign ministers discussed new ways to bolster support for Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. Key ideas floated included the possibility of imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" production sites for Ukrainian arms companies on EU soil. Ministers also revisited the contentious debate over seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Ukraine's reconstruction. Another proposal involved shifting the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops into Ukraine itself once a ceasefire is achieved.</p>

          <p>One of the world's largest kelp restoration projects has successfully revived a vital marine ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. Over the past 13 years, a team led by The Bay Foundation has removed nearly 5.8 million invasive purple sea urchins from an 80-acre area. These voracious urchins had created barren underwater landscapes by devouring the kelp. By culling the urchins, divers have allowed the "sequoias of the sea" to regrow, restoring critical habitat for hundreds of marine species and demonstrating a successful model for marine conservation.</p>
