          <p>President Trump withdrew Dr. Janette Nesheiwat's nomination for U.S. Surgeon General and announced his intent to nominate Dr. Casey Means, an entrepreneur and wellness influencer favored by allies of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Nesheiwat's withdrawal followed scrutiny of her credentials and social media posts. Trump stated Nesheiwat would work with Kennedy in another capacity, while Means, co-author of 'Good Energy,' is expected to advance the 'Make America Healthy Again' agenda. Means earned degrees from Stanford before leaving her surgery residency and co-founded Levels, a digital health company focused on metabolic health.</p>

          <p>A federal judge appointed by former President Biden ordered the Trump administration to immediately resettle approximately 12,000 refugees into the U.S., partially blocking President Trump's executive order to halt refugee admissions. The judge, Jamal Whitehead, criticized the administration's attempt to reinterpret a judicial order and insisted on compliance with statutory and constitutional law. This ruling follows the Trump administration's argument that it should only process 160 refugees and its intent to appeal any order requiring the admission of thousands. The article also covers other political news including US-Iran nuclear talks, congressional actions on air traffic controller crisis, and an FBI child sex operation.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, including Jeff Merkley, Brian Schatz, and Lisa Murkowski, sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., expressing concerns that budget cuts to the agency could negatively affect the Indian Health Service (IHS). The senators highlighted that American Indians and Alaska Natives already face significant health disparities and rely on IHS for care. They urged Kennedy to ensure that IHS programs have adequate resources and staffing, especially given existing shortages in critical roles. The senators also emphasized the need for tribal consultation before implementing any actions that could impact healthcare delivery in Native communities.</p>

          <p>CBS co-Chief Executive George Cheeks addressed concerns surrounding Paramount Global's potential sale and a $20 billion lawsuit filed by President Trump over CBS News' coverage. Cheeks emphasized his commitment to supporting the CBS team during this challenging period.

Cheeks declined to comment on potential settlements with Trump, but reaffirmed support for CBS News.

          <p>As of Wednesday, May 7th, U.S. travelers are required to present a Real ID at airport checkpoints for domestic flights, a security measure that has been delayed for over two decades. While some airports reported smooth operations, others advised arriving three hours early, especially without a Real ID. The TSA is using secondary processes to verify the identity of travelers lacking compliant identification. Despite the new requirement, travelers can still apply for a Real ID or use alternative forms of identification like passports. The Better Business Bureau warns of potential scams related to Real ID applications, advising in-person DMV visits only.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget includes cutting funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) and replacing it with 'MAHA food boxes' for low-income seniors, sourced directly from farmers. The USDA suggests these boxes could eventually replace or complement other USDA programs. The CSFP currently assists 730,000 seniors annually with a $389 million budget. Concerns are raised about the logistics of distributing perishable food and whether the boxes will meet seniors' needs for shelf-stable items. The USDA claims MAHA boxes will offer more wholesome foods and eliminate administrative middlemen.</p>
