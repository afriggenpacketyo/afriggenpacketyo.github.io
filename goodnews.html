          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US and China have made 'substantial progress' in de-escalating the trade war after closed-door discussions in Geneva, Switzerland. Bessent and China's vice-premier He Lifeng engaged in these discussions following steep tariffs levied by the US in January. Details of the agreement are expected to be announced on Monday, with President Trump updated on the developments, who praised the talks for engendering a 'total reset' on the relationship between the two countries. The trade war has seen the US impose tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, with China retaliating with levies of 125% on some US goods.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are defending their actions at an ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, asserting that the Trump administration is 'weaponizing law enforcement.' Representatives LaMonica McIver, Bonnie Watson Coleman, and Rob Menendez claim they were justified in 'storming' the facility, alleging that ICE officials were instructed to lock up the mayor of Newark. They also deny accusations of assault and argue that ICE officers failed to de-escalate the situation. Despite their objections to ICE detentions, the lawmakers acknowledged that inmates appeared to be well-treated within the facility.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made 'substantial progress' in trade talks held in Geneva. While details remain sparse, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested a 'deal' had been struck addressing national security concerns related to China's trade practices. The agreement aims to ease tensions from the ongoing trade war, which has seen both countries impose steep tariffs on each other's imports, disrupting global supply chains and raising fears of economic slowdown. The two sides met in historically neutral territory, Geneva, for marathon negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has banned chess indefinitely, citing concerns that the game promotes gambling and violates Islamic law. According to officials, the ban will remain in place until the game's compatibility with Sharia law is determined. This restriction is the latest in a series of measures imposed by the Taliban, particularly affecting sports and activities for women. One cafe owner in Kabul expressed that while he would respect the decision, he also noted that the ban would negatively impact his business, as many young people enjoyed playing chess there.</p>
