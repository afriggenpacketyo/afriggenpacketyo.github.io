          <p>CVS Health announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading to a rise in its stock price. The company raised its adjusted profit forecast for fiscal 2025, citing significant improvements in its retail pharmacy and Aetna insurance divisions. CEO David Joyner highlighted the success of a multiyear recovery effort at Aetna and operational efficiencies in the retail pharmacy business. These gains helped offset a decline in the company's health services segment, as CVS continues its broader turnaround plan which includes cost-cutting measures.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly reported that its diabetes drug Mounjaro showed significant heart health benefits in a late-stage trial, comparing favorably to its older drug, Trulicity. While the primary goal was to prove it was not inferior, Mounjaro also demonstrated a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and better kidney protection. This data strengthens Mounjaro's position as a leading treatment for Type 2 diabetes, especially as Trulicity's patent nears expiration. The findings are expected to be submitted to regulators, potentially expanding insurance coverage for the drug in the future.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 90-day extension of the current tariff agreement with Mexico, postponing a threatened increase to allow more time for trade negotiations. The decision came after a conversation with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. Under the extension, the 25% tariff on non-USMCA compliant goods and higher tariffs on metals will remain in place. Trump also stated that Mexico agreed to terminate its non-tariff trade barriers, with the goal of reaching a more comprehensive trade deal within the next three months. (not investment advice)</p>

This article from The Atlantic delves into the psychology behind the phenomenon, noting its prevalence among perfectionists, introverts, and those in high-trust professions. While some argue it can motivate improvement, it often leads to anxiety and burnout.

          <p>A recent episode of "South Park" is being analyzed not for its direct mockery of Donald Trump, but for how it uses the president as a vehicle to critique its parent company, Paramount. The article suggests the show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, pivoted from direct political satire to a more layered approach. The episode's plot, involving a lawsuit against the town, is seen as a thinly veiled reference to Paramount's recent legal settlement with Trump and the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." This strategy allows the show to make a pointed, industry-focused critique while using a high-profile figure to attract a broader audience.</p>
