          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will remove all sanctions on Syria, aiming to give the country a chance at greatness. Speaking in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Trump stated that the decision is intended to support the new Syrian government in stabilizing the country and maintaining peace. Syria has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. since 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011 following a crackdown on anti-government uprisings. Trump emphasized his administration's initial steps toward restoring normal relations between the United States and Syria after over a decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert argues that President Trump's executive order instructing drug companies to reduce prescription drug prices constitutes price control, potentially leading to shortages. The order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to set price targets for pharmaceutical manufacturers, applying not just to government programs but also to the free market. The White House defends the order as a means of fixing anti-competitive behavior that forces Americans to subsidize healthcare for other developed nations. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America trade group warns the order would harm American patients and reduce investment in new treatments.</p>

          <p>President Trump highlighted the U.S.-Saudi relationship as a "bedrock of security and prosperity" during a visit to Saudi Arabia, announcing a $600 billion investment deal.

Agreements were signed for judicial cooperation, defense modernization, and an international partnership program between the Saudi Ministry of Interior and the FBI. Trump also mentioned normalizing relations and lifting sanctions on Syria's new government. The visit included meetings with business leaders and discussions on various topics, including Iran's nuclear program and the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

          <h2>Credit Card Debt Forgiveness Still Relevant Despite Improving Economy</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite signs of economic improvement, credit card debt forgiveness remains a relevant option for many borrowers struggling with high-interest balances. While inflation may be easing and rate cuts are anticipated, the cost of carrying credit card debt remains high, making it difficult for households to catch up. Debt forgiveness can provide targeted relief by reducing the debt obligation, offering a path out of an otherwise endless debt cycle. However, it comes with trade-offs, such as a credit score hit and potential tax liability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will normalize relations and lift sanctions on Syria's new government, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, to give the country a chance at peace. This decision, influenced by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, marks a significant shift in U.S. policy. Al-Sharaa, once an insurgent leader, now leads Syria after overthrowing Bashar Assad. This move puts Trump at odds with Israel, which is skeptical of al-Sharaa's past. The U.S. has been weighing how to handle al-Sharaa since he took power in December.</p>
