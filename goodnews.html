          <p>Japan's minister announced that all tariffs are under review as part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal negotiations, indicating a comprehensive approach to revising trade terms between the two countries. This review aims to address existing trade imbalances and potentially open up new avenues for economic cooperation. The negotiations could significantly impact various sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, and technology, influencing the overall trade relationship between Japan and the United States. The outcome of these discussions will be crucial for businesses and consumers in both nations. Optimism score must be proportional with the scores, for instance if there is a plane crash and there are no survivors from within the plane itself, the score should be 65</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 05:00:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine reveals that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Participants receiving semaglutide showed significant improvements in liver inflammation, fat accumulation, and fibrosis compared to the placebo group. The study highlights semaglutide's potential as a treatment option for fatty liver disease, adding to its existing benefits for obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. While some adverse effects like nausea and diarrhea were more common in the semaglutide group, the overall results are encouraging for patients with MASH.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an 'unparalleled' antivenom using the blood of a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antibodies found in Tim Friede's blood have shown protection against fatal doses from a wide range of snake species in animal tests. This breakthrough could lead to a universal antivenom, addressing the current limitations of species-specific therapies. The article details Friede's motivations and the scientific research behind this promising development.</p>

          <p>World, a start-up backed by Sam Altman, has launched in the United States with the goal of verifying your humanity. The company‚Äôs basic pitch is this: The internet is about to be overrun with swarms of realistic A.I. bots that will make it nearly impossible to tell whether we‚Äôre interacting with real humans on social networks, dating sites, gaming platforms and other online spaces. To solve this problem, World has created a program called World ID that will allow users to verify their humanity online. In exchange, users receive a cryptocurrency called Worldcoin, which they can spend, send to other World ID holders or trade for other currencies. (As of Wednesday night, the sign-up bonus was worth about $40.)</p>
