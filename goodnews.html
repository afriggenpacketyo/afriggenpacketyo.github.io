          <p>US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have announced a new 20-point peace plan for Gaza, calling on Hamas to accept it or face continued Israeli military action. The proposal includes an immediate cessation of military operations, the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for detained Gazans, and a future without Hamas governance. The plan also outlines an economic development initiative and leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state. International leaders, including the UK and French prime ministers, have welcomed the initiative as a potential path to peace.</p>

          <p>Global music sensation Bad Bunny has been announced as the Super Bowl LX halftime show headliner, a decision that has ignited a "meltdown" among some conservative commentators. Critics are leveraging the Puerto Rican artist's predominantly Spanish-language music, past political endorsements, and immigration stances to fuel arguments that "woke culture" is permeating American institutions. Despite the backlash, the NFL's selection aligns with its strategy of featuring top-selling artists, as Bad Bunny is Spotify's most-streamed male artist. The article suggests these complaints are a recurring theme, often boosting the popularity of the targeted artists.</p>

          <p>A Florida-based multi-agency task force, Joint Inter-Agency Task Force – South (JIATF-S), has announced a record seizure of one million pounds of cocaine during fiscal year 2025. This massive haul, equivalent to 378 million lethal doses, represents an estimated $11.34 billion in revenue denied to cartels and narco-terrorists. Operating across 42 million square miles, the task force aims to disrupt illicit drug flows and weaken transnational criminal organizations. The Trump administration has intensified counter-narcotics efforts, including designating groups like the Sinaloa Cartel as foreign terrorist organizations.</p>

Despite turning 41 in December, James continues to perform at a high level, averaging 24.4 points last season. He exercised his player option for this season, making him a free agent in 2026 if he doesn't retire or sign an extension. James emphasized his love for the game and the training process, but indicated his ultimate decision would be a personal one with his family.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Predicts Limited Market Impact from Government Shutdown, Citing Historical Trends</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes a looming government shutdown will not significantly impact the stock market, citing historical data where stocks performed well after past shutdowns. He differentiates a shutdown from a debt ceiling default, noting the U.S. can still pay bondholders. Cramer's primary concern is the potential delay in releasing vital economic data, which could complicate the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. While acknowledging the hardship for furloughed federal workers and potential GDP reduction, he suggests delayed data is a minor worry compared to a debt default. (not investment advice)</p>
