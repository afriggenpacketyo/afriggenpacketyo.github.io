Altman noted that Meta considers OpenAI its biggest competitor, as its AI efforts have not been as successful as hoped. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is personally building a top AI team for its "superintelligence" AI lab and investing heavily in AI research. This comes after Meta delayed the release of its latest AI model due to capability concerns, with Zuckerberg reportedly willing to invest billions in top talent. </p>

          <p>Hong Kong will serve as a launchpad for mainland Chinese companies' global expansion through a new agreement with Shanghai. The action plan aims to connect the two financial hubs, expanding the connect program linking their stock markets with more equities, bonds, ETFs, and gold. The cities will also collaborate on cross-border settlements and the use of the digital yuan. This agreement is the first since the annual Lujiazui Forum began in 2008 and is seen as a measure to deepen connectivity and support mainland companies' global drive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a policy requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose the gender they identify with, including selecting "X" on passport applications. The judge deemed the policy discriminatory against transgender Americans. The White House criticized the ruling as an attempt to thwart President Trump's agenda, while the Justice Department has appealed the decision. </p>
