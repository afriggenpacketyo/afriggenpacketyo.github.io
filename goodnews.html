          <p>New photographs of China's Chengdu J-36 and Shenyang J-50 sixth-generation fighter jets reveal potential capabilities, including drone control and supersonic cruising. The images show the J-36 on the ground at Chengdu Aircraft Corporation's facility and in high-definition test flights. Defense experts note the J-36's three weapons bays and dorsal intake for a third engine, suggesting supersonic cruising capabilities. This third engine likely provides the additional thrust needed for sustained supersonic flight, enhancing the fighter's operational range and combat effectiveness. Optimism surrounding the advancement of military technology is tempered by the need for global stability.</p>
