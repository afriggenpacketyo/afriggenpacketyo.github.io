        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has pledged ¬£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear project, aiming to create 10,000 jobs and enhance energy security, although the prime minister stated he is "not writing a blank cheque" for the project. The development, expected to take over a decade, has faced opposition due to potential costs and environmental impact. The government insists that nuclear power can lower household energy bills and reduce reliance on other countries, while critics argue that ministers are not being transparent about the project's total cost. The project is expected to generate enough power for six million homes.</p>

          <p>The UK government has partially reversed its decision to withdraw winter fuel payments from most pensioners, now extending the payment to nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less. This decision follows pressure from charities, unions, and MPs, with the government citing better-than-expected economic growth as the reason for the change. The government previously announced the removal of payments from over 10 million pensioners to address a ¬£22 billion financial deficit. Critics argue that the reversal creates new complexity in the tax system, while the government maintains that the change will not lead to permanent additional borrowing.</p>

This standoff follows Trump's previous executive order targeting "anti-American ideology" at the Smithsonian and his criticism of Sajet's Democratic political donations and rejection of a pro-Trump painting. The board has directed the secretary to ensure museum content remains unbiased while maintaining the Smithsonian as a welcoming place for all Americans.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) can help individuals save money in an economy with persistent inflation by offering returns that exceed the inflation rate. CDs provide a secure investment option with FDIC or NCUA insurance, allowing savers to lock in high rates for the term of the CD. Online banks often offer more competitive CD rates due to lower overhead costs, and short-term CDs can provide better rates compared to longer terms due to the inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs by purchasing various terms can help savers take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>
