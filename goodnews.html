        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, suggested that Japan's purchases of U.S. defense equipment could potentially help reduce the trade deficit between the two countries, which could serve as a bargaining point in upcoming tariff talks. Akazawa met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to discuss strategies before the fourth round of tariff negotiations. While Akazawa acknowledged the potential link between defense spending and trade imbalances, he also cautioned against directly mixing security matters with tariff negotiations due to their differing logic and standards. This comes as Japan recently lost its status as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years, adding pressure to address trade imbalances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Araceli, a Salvadorian immigrant, along with her partner and two daughters, made three attempts to cross the Rainbow Bridge into Canada, seeking asylum from potential deportations under President Trump's policies. The family had been living illegally in the U.S. for over a decade, and after facing difficulties with their asylum application process, they sought refuge in Canada, where Araceli's siblings reside. However, due to the "safe third country agreement" between Canada and the U.S., asylum seekers must apply in the first country they land, with exceptions for those with close relatives in Canada. Despite initial setbacks, the family eventually succeeded in their third attempt, highlighting the increasing number of asylum seekers fleeing the U.S. due to stricter immigration policies.</p>

          <p>China has extended the strike range of its Type 055 destroyer by integrating it with an airborne early warning system, according to state broadcaster CCTV. This enhancement allows the destroyer, Lhasa, to precisely strike beyond visual-range targets without solely relying on its own radars. The system mirrors technology used by Pakistan's Air Force in the Kashmir conflict. The integration represents a significant advancement in operational coordination, enabling complete interoperability and seamless information sharing across domains, with shipborne helicopters and sensors feeding data into the combat center for simultaneous sea-and-air engagements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is expediting two major reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire to bolster England's water supplies, designating them as "nationally significant." This designation allows the projects to bypass local objections and accelerate through the planning process, though completion is still over a decade away. The move aims to enhance resilience against future droughts in a dry region with high water demand, particularly in light of climate change and a growing population. However, some experts caution that managing water usage and reducing waste should take precedence, alongside concerns about the impact on local communities and potential increases in water bills.</p>

          <p>Golden eagles are venturing back into England from southern Scotland, raising hopes they might nest in the area. The resurgence is attributed to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which has successfully translocated juveniles and sub-adults from the Scottish Highlands. One such eagle, Talla, was spotted in Northumberland, marking a significant milestone. The birds have also been seen in the North Pennines, Lake District, and as far south as Lancashire and Yorkshire, suggesting a potential expansion of their territory after being wiped out in England and Wales by the mid-19th century.</p>

The programs at the center of the order rely on a legal immigration authority known as parole, which allows the federal government to temporarily admit foreigners on humanitarian or public interest grounds.</p>

The growing integration of AI into everyday life further reinforces this trend. Consequently, the firm is raising its price target to $170 from $165, while maintaining a hold-equivalent rating.
