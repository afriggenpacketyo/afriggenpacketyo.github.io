          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares experienced a nearly 5% drop following Warren Buffett's announcement of stepping down as CEO and Greg Abel's appointment as his successor, marking the end of Buffett's 60-year tenure.

The board unanimously voted for Abel to assume the role on January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain as chairman, indicating a structured leadership change.

          <p>President Trump is planning two crypto-focused fundraising events this month, one targeting wealthy political donors and another aimed at memecoin millionaires, potentially generating millions for his political activities. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate dinner, is hosted by MAGA Inc. and features David Sacks, who is influential in shaping crypto and AI regulations. The second event, at Trump National, will grant access to Trump's inner circle to holders of the $TRUMP token, decided by a blockchain-based contest. The article highlights Trump's strategic engagement with the crypto community amid evolving regulatory landscapes, and the super PAC is constitutionally barred from using the funds directly for Trump's campaign for a third term.</p>

          <p>The United States' top public health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, has falsely claimed that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine contains "aborted fetus debris" and "DNA particles," contributing to vaccine hesitancy. While the rubella component of the MMR vaccine is grown in human cell lines originally derived from fetal tissue, these cells are not part of the final product. Trace amounts of DNA fragments may remain, but they are biologically inert and pose no health risk.
