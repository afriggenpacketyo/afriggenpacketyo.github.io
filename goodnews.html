          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plans to restructure government agencies and lay off federal workers, siding with unions and local governments who argued the overhaul lacked congressional authorization. Judge Illston issued a 14-day pause, emphasizing that while the President can seek changes, they must be lawful and involve legislative cooperation, referencing previous presidential requests for such cooperation. The ruling impacts agencies working with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), pausing large-scale reductions in force while a hearing for a longer injunction is scheduled for May 22. The plaintiffs argued the reorganization has caused chaos and disrupted critical services, and the judge agreed they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, citing exceeded authority and violations of administrative law.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani propelled the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 14-11 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks with a tie-breaking three-run home run in the ninth inning.

The game was a back-and-forth affair, with multiple lead changes and home runs from both sides, including a grand slam by Arizona's Lourdes Gurriel Jr. Roki Sasaki, aiming for his second MLB win, had a shaky start, giving up five runs before being pulled in the fifth inning, but Ohtani's late heroics sealed the win for the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>Arab countries are focusing on strengthening economic ties with the US, hoping for significant business deals during President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, despite ongoing regional tensions. Saudi Arabia seeks foreign direct investment to meet its Vision 2030 targets, while the UAE plans to invest heavily in the US, particularly in AI and semiconductors. Discussions are expected to sideline the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with emphasis on defense, AI, and advanced weaponry deals. Analysts suggest Trump's "big announcement" could relate to Hamas hostages, a potential US-Iran nuclear deal, or the situation in Yemen, all serving US business interests.</p>

Although he showed no symptoms, the Imperial Household Agency stated that he will require careful follow-up care. The 91-year-old was admitted after an earlier checkup revealed signs of the heart condition, and he previously received treatment for heart failure in 2022.

          <p>A robotic Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched towards Venus in March 1972 but stranded in Earth orbit due to a rocket malfunction, is predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur on Friday or Saturday, but the exact location remains unknown due to the spacecraft's high speed. While the spacecraft, weighing roughly 1,050 pounds and designed with a heat shield for Venusian atmosphere, may partially survive re-entry, the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low. If any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia, as it is considered the registered owner.</p>

          <p>The trade war with the United States is causing Chinese companies to relocate manufacturing operations to Vietnam to avoid high tariffs. Factories producing goods ranging from jeans to Christmas wreaths are rapidly moving to Vietnam, with e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and Shein facilitating the transition. While Vietnam presents a viable alternative due to its shared border and young workforce, it faces challenges in managing the influx of Chinese businesses and navigating trade agreements with the US. The shift underscores the significant impact of Trump's tariffs on global supply chains and trade patterns.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California issued an emergency ruling temporarily barring the Trump administration from carrying out sweeping cuts and layoffs at over a dozen government agencies, as part of a massive federal cost-cutting drive led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Judge Susan Illston ruled the plaintiffs — a group of federal employee unions — are likely to show that the Trump administration's attempts to reorganize and downsize the federal government exceed its legal authority. The order will remain in effect for at least 14 days while the judge considers the case.</p>
