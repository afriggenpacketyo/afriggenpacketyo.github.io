          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. Despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, Bitcoin's price rise reflects investors seeking alternative stores of value. Macro concerns, including Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have further fueled Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Recent pro-crypto developments in the U.S. regulatory landscape, along with JPMorgan's decision to allow clients to buy Bitcoin, have contributed to the market's bullish sentiment (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Shares in Xpeng, a Chinese electric-vehicle maker, are experiencing a significant rally, driven by upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, fueled by robust sales, and its net loss narrowed compared to the previous year. Analysts expect Xpeng to turn profitable in the fourth quarter, attributing this to strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models. The brokerage maintains a buy rating on the stock with a target price significantly higher than its current trading value.</p>

          <p>An IndiGo passenger jet made a safe landing in Srinagar despite encountering a hailstorm that caused significant damage to the plane. The flight, traveling from New Delhi, experienced severe turbulence, leading to panic among passengers. Despite a large hole in the nose of the aircraft, the flight crew followed established protocol, and the pilot was able to land safely. Transportation analysts noted that while hail can cause damage, planes can often land safely if the pilot manually flies the plane.</p>
