          <p>PayPal has announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading the company to raise its full-year outlook for both transaction margin dollars and earnings per share. The report highlighted significant growth in its Venmo platform, with revenue increasing by over 20% and total payment volume growing at its fastest rate in three years. Despite the positive financial performance and optimistic forecast, which implies a strong fourth quarter, the company's stock experienced a slight decline following the announcement. CEO Alex Chriss emphasized that the profitable growth was driven by strategic initiatives across the company's branded experiences and payment services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UCLA football is entering its training camp with several critical questions to address, including the integration of new quarterback Nico Iamaleava and the performance of its offensive line. Coach DeShaun Foster has boldly guaranteed that fan attendance at the Rose Bowl will significantly increase this season, banking on the team's performance. The team must also find replacements for key defensive players lost to the NFL draft and build cohesion with many new transfers. The decision to hold training camp away from campus in Costa Mesa is seen as an opportunity to foster team unity among the many new faces on the roster.</p>

          <h2>Landon Donovan Urges US Soccer Not to Waste 2026 World Cup Opportunity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former US soccer star Landon Donovan emphasizes the massive opportunity the 2026 World Cup presents for growing the sport in America, drawing from his own childhood experience of being inspired by the 1994 tournament. He recently clarified his criticism of current players like Christian Pulisic for skipping the Gold Cup, stating his concern was about prioritizing the national team's growth ahead of the home World Cup. Donovan believes the tournament can inspire millions of young players and help close the developmental gap with other nations. He argues that with the US soccer landscape far more advanced than in 1994, it is crucial not to squander this chance to build momentum.</p>

          <p>A fierce competition for top artificial intelligence talent is underway, with tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, and Google offering massive pay packages to lure experts from smaller startups. Meta has reportedly been particularly aggressive, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally involved in recruiting and offering compensation potentially reaching $100 million. This trend of "cherry-picking" key individuals, rather than acquiring entire companies, is causing a cultural shift in Silicon Valley and making it difficult for startups like OpenAI to retain their engineers. While the demand for experienced AI engineers soars, the need for traditional programmers is declining as generative AI becomes more capable of writing code.</p>

          <p>President Trump concluded a five-day trip to Scotland by officially opening a new golf course bearing his name in Balmedie, on the country's northern coast. The visit was largely centered around promoting his family's properties and included several rounds of golf at his other Scottish resorts. During the trip, Trump also met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, where they reached a framework for a major trade deal concerning tariffs between the U.S. and the European Union. The president used the visit to praise his late Scottish mother's homeland and also to criticize wind farms, calling them "ugly monsters" that kill birds.</p>

          <p>A meticulously restored de Havilland Comet, the world's first passenger jetliner, is now on display at the de Havilland Aircraft Museum in the UK, offering a unique look at early jet travel. The Comet, which first flew commercially in 1952, ushered in a new era of speed and comfort but was plagued by a series of catastrophic accidents due to design flaws, leading to its grounding. A team of volunteers has painstakingly recreated the fuselage's luxurious 1950s interior, from the spacious seating to the separate male and female bathrooms. The restoration serves as a tribute to a pioneering aircraft whose failures ultimately led to crucial safety advancements in aviation.</p>

Salgado and his wife, Emilie, have opened a new restaurant named La Sirena in Ephraim, Door County, a move that has surprised the culinary world. The new venture will continue Taco María's ethos of a prix fixe menu, local sourcing, and handmade blue corn tortillas, but in a vastly different setting.

The company's robot, Poseidon, performs the humane killing technique, which improves the fish's flavor, texture, and shelf life by preventing the buildup of stress hormones. By automating this labor-intensive process, Shinkei aims to make this higher-quality fish more widely available and affordable in the U.S. market. The company, which recently raised $22 million in funding, provides its machines to fishing boats and then sells the premium-processed fish to high-end restaurants and retailers.</p>

          <p>To combat a growing shortage of skilled watch repair technicians in the U.S., luxury watch brand Rolex has opened a new watchmaking school in Dallas. The 18-month, tuition-free program focuses specifically on training students to service Rolex timepieces, with graduates likely to work for Rolex-affiliated jewelers or the company itself. The initiative comes as interest in mechanical watches is resurgent, while the number of watchmakers has declined significantly, creating a workforce crisis. While independent schools train watchmakers for a variety of brands, the Rolex school's specialized approach aims to directly meet the high demand for servicing its own products.</p>

          <p>While the Federal Reserve has held its benchmark interest rate steady throughout 2025, consumer borrowing costs have seen very little movement. Average rates for credit card balances have hovered just above 20% for the first half of the year, showing only a slight nudge downward from their peak last fall. Similarly, auto loan rates have been largely static, and 30-year fixed mortgage rates have remained in a relatively narrow band between 6.6% and 7.1%. Although the Fed's rate influences many consumer products, experts note that a future rate cut would not guarantee lower borrowing costs for all Americans, especially for mortgages.
