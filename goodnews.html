          <h2>Trump Criticizes Fed Chair Powell as a 'Fool' After Interest Rates Remain Unchanged</h2>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has once again publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, following the central bank's decision to maintain interest rates. Trump conveyed his frustration via a Truth Social post, labeling Powell a 'fool' for not lowering rates amidst low inflation and decreasing energy costs. The Fed's decision to hold steady is based on uncertainties arising from Trump's trade policies and a desire to avoid fueling inflation. Powell has stated that Trump's criticisms will not influence the Fed's decisions, which will remain focused on economic data and stability.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the potential impacts of an expected trade deal between the United States and Britain. The agreement, spurred by President Trump's desire to reshape global trade, aims to protect the British economy from recent tariff increases. While the deal is expected to support key sectors like the auto industry and boost consumer and business sentiment, its overall impact on the British economy may be limited. The article notes that Britain's economic growth is more significantly influenced by domestic factors and broader global economic stability.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from dismantling three federal agencies that provide assistance to public resources, minority businesses, and mediation services. Judge John McConnell sided with nearly two dozen Democratic-led states, ruling that the closings violated the separation of powers. The judge affirmed that Congress makes laws and appropriates funds, while the Executive branch implements the laws and spends the funds. McConnell had previously blocked the administration from implementing a nationwide freeze on federal grants.</p>
