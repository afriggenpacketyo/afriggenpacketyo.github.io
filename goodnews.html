          <p>Following high-level discussions in London, representatives from the U.S. and China announced an agreement on a trade framework, aiming to implement the Geneva consensus and stabilize their relationship after recent tensions and accusations of trade agreement violations. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the agreement includes resolving Chinese restrictions on rare-earth exports to the U.S. in exchange for rolling back U.S. restrictions on advanced tech sales to China. The framework requires approval from both President Trump and President Xi Jinping before implementation, with Chinese state media initially remaining silent before acknowledging the talks' positive step toward increased trust. This agreement signals a potential de-escalation in trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.</p>

Zuckerberg hopes Wang can improve Meta's AI ambitions following the lukewarm reception of the company's Llama AI models. By taking a large stake in Scale AI rather than acquiring it outright, Meta is employing a similar strategy to Google and Microsoft, and also avoiding antitrust concerns.</p>

The report calls for a national Play Strategy for England, recommending updates to planning policies, government guidance protecting playtime in schools, and opening school playgrounds to the community.
