          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 04:41:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.K. state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next April, based on the latest wage growth data from the Office for National Statistics. Under the "triple lock" system, the pension rises annually by the highest of 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth. This increase would add over £500 a year to the new state pension, but it also pushes the total pension amount closer to the frozen personal tax allowance threshold of £12,570. Experts and pensioners express concern that this will drag more retirees into paying income tax, effectively giving with one hand while taking away with the other. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Asian markets rallied, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index closing above the 45,000 mark for the first time, driven by optimism over U.S.-China trade negotiations. The positive sentiment followed statements from President Donald Trump indicating that the talks in Spain were progressing well, alongside news of a framework deal for the divestment of TikTok. South Korea's Kospi also reached a new record high after the government reversed a planned capital gains tax hike on stocks. In contrast, markets in Hong Kong and mainland China saw minor retreats, while U.S. markets had closed higher overnight in anticipation of the trade discussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K. will feature a detailed itinerary of royal ceremony and high-level political meetings. The visit begins with a stay at Windsor Castle, followed by a formal greeting from King Charles and a carriage procession. Key events include a white-tie state banquet and a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers. The agenda is expected to focus on strengthening investment and technology partnerships, including deals on AI and nuclear energy. Other critical discussion topics will include the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as potential points of friction like migration and free speech issues.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K. is seen as a crucial opportunity for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose government is facing significant domestic challenges. Amid low approval ratings and recent high-profile resignations, the pomp and ceremony of the visit offer a welcome distraction and a chance to announce positive news, particularly on trade and investment. The U.K. is hoping to secure new deals on technology and energy, and finalize reduced tariffs on steel and aluminum. This article suggests that despite political differences, Trump's apparent personal affinity for the U.K. and its Prime Minister could provide a much-needed boost for the struggling government.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Baker Mayfield orchestrated a dramatic game-winning drive, culminating in a two-yard touchdown run by Rachaad White with just six seconds remaining, to give the Tampa Bay Buccaneers a 20-19 victory over the Houston Texans. Mayfield threw for 215 yards and two touchdowns, and a crucial 15-yard scramble on a fourth-and-10 kept the final 80-yard drive alive. The victory was a reversal of fortune from the teams' 2023 meeting, where the Texans won in the final seconds. This marks the second consecutive week Mayfield has led a game-winning drive in the final minute, as the Buccaneers start their season with a 2-0 record.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government is set to introduce the landmark "Hillsborough Law," which will legally require public officials to be truthful and cooperative during investigations into major disasters. The bill includes a new "duty of candour," making it a criminal offense for officials to conceal information or mislead inquiries, aiming to end a culture of cover-ups. Championed for years by the families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster, the legislation is also intended to apply to other tragedies like the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office scandal. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the law will change the "balance of power" between the state and the public.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish Parliament is debating a significant justice reform bill that proposes to eliminate the controversial "not proven" verdict from its unique three-verdict legal system. This verdict, which results in acquittal similar to "not guilty," has been criticized for causing confusion and failing to provide closure for victims. To balance this change, the reforms also propose raising the jury majority required for a guilty verdict from a simple majority to two-thirds. The bill also includes plans for a specialized sexual offenses court and a new victims and witnesses commissioner, aiming to create a more trauma-informed and responsive justice system.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has emphasized the need to accelerate the development of a unified national market, stating it is crucial for China to gain an advantage in global competition and achieve its development targets. In a recently published article, Xi outlined key tasks, including cracking down on excessive and damaging price competition among domestic firms. The directive calls on industry associations to guide companies toward prioritizing product quality over low prices. This policy push aligns with earlier calls from China's Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission to phase out obsolete industrial capacity and foster healthier internal market dynamics.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached a "framework" agreement concerning the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations, potentially paving the way for American ownership and resolving a major national security dispute. The breakthrough occurred during trade negotiations in Madrid, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announcing that the commercial terms have been settled. This development comes ahead of a looming deadline for TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. division or face a ban. While details remain sparse, the deal is a significant step in ongoing trade talks, though Chinese officials maintain they will not compromise their firms' interests.</p>

Liberatore, who will oversee OpenAI's substantial infrastructure spending, begins his role immediately, reporting to CFO Sarah Friar. This high-profile hire marks the latest development in the escalating rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but have since had a public falling out. The move comes as OpenAI continues to expand its compute commitments and navigates a transition to a for-profit entity, a shift Musk has legally challenged.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are primarily planning to use Shohei Ohtani as a starting pitcher in the playoffs, but the team has not ruled out deploying him from the bullpen in certain high-leverage situations. Team executives acknowledged that unforeseen circumstances in October could create opportunities for Ohtani to pitch in relief between his starts, similar to how other star pitchers have been used in past postseasons. However, MLB's two-way player rules present a complication: if Ohtani enters as a reliever and is later removed, the Dodgers would lose his bat as the designated hitter. This technicality may limit his potential bullpen appearances to late-game, high-stakes moments.</p>
