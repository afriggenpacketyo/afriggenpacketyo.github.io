          <h2>University of Tokyo Considers Accepting Harvard Foreign Students if Barred by U.S.</h2>

          <p>The University of Tokyo is considering a program to temporarily host international students from Harvard University if the U.S. government moves to bar them from studying at the American institution. This action is inspired by a similar program launched in 2022 to support researchers and students affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, providing research labs and accommodations free of charge. The U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has sought to end Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, but a temporary injunction issued by a U.S. federal district court has allowed international students to remain enrolled while the legality of the administration's decision is reviewed. The Japanese university is still exploring the details of the potential program.</p>

          <p>LEVA, an autonomous delivery robot developed by ETH Zurich, is designed to navigate complex environments and autonomously lift and carry heavy cargo. Combining wheels and legs, LEVA can roll on smooth surfaces and walk or climb over obstacles like stairs and curbs. Equipped with GPS, lidar sensors, and cameras, LEVA can perceive its surroundings, avoid obstacles, and align itself for cargo pick-up and drop-off. LEVA can lift and carry boxes weighing up to 187 pounds, making it suitable for various applications, including package delivery, farm supply transport, construction site material handling, and emergency response, which means faster, more reliable deliveries, especially in urban areas. The team is working to improve LEVA's energy efficiency, stair-climbing ability, and autonomous operation for real-world deployment.</p>

          <p>The author, Steve Grove, shares his experience as a state government official in Minnesota during the COVID-19 pandemic, where he encountered an issue of unemployment insurance payments mistakenly sent to high school students. Grove details how a coalition of students, a Republican senator, and his agency worked together to change state law and allow the students to keep the payments. He argues that this story illustrates how positive change is more achievable at the local level, where there is less polarization and more accountability. Grove advocates for a resurgence of investment in local institutions to rebuild trust in government and other organizations, emphasizing that local action can drive change at the federal level.</p>
