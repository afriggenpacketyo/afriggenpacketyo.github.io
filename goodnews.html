        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is considering the Trump administration's effort to narrow lower court orders blocking the president from ending birthright citizenship. The arguments focus on whether district court judges have the authority to issue sweeping injunctions that extend beyond the parties involved in the litigation. The administration argues that injunctions should only apply to the plaintiffs, while the ACLU contends that such restrictions would make it harder to challenge illegal government actions. The court's decision could significantly impact the scope of judicial power and the ability to challenge executive policies.</p>

          <p>Walmart cautioned that even with softer tariffs on China, the company may soon need to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that President Trump's trade levies are hindering the retailer's ability to maintain low prices. While Walmart will try to absorb some cost pressures, higher tariffs will likely result in increased prices for consumers. The company is also navigating global economic uncertainty, leading to a pulled quarterly profit outlook. Despite these challenges, Walmart aims to grow profit faster than sales.</p>
