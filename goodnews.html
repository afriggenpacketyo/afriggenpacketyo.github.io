          <p>President Trump suggested he might reduce tariffs on China to 80% before trade talks in Switzerland, a move that could signal a shift in his approach to the trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators to discuss potential agreements. The U.S. currently has tariffs of 145% on imports from China, while China has retaliated with a 125% levy on American goods. Trump's comments come after announcing a trade deal with the United Kingdom, raising hopes for progress with other major trading partners.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates plans to give away most of his fortune by 2045 through his foundation, which has already given $100 billion towards health and development projects. He expects the foundation to spend another $200 billion, depending on markets and inflation, over the next two decades. Gates cited Andrew Carnegie's argument that wealthy people have a duty to return their fortunes to society. He also criticized the US, UK, and France for cutting their foreign aid budgets.</p>

          <p>Keen, a U.S. footwear company, vows not to hike its prices despite new U.S. tariffs on imports, unlike many other companies planning to absorb higher costs by increasing prices for customers. Keen has been preparing for this for over a decade by diversifying its supply chain well beyond China. Today, Keen operates plants in Shepherdsville, Kentucky; the Dominican Republic; and Thailand, where it handles a third of the company's global production.</p>

          <p>The government on Friday urged caution after a small Japanese civilian plane was spotted near uninhabited islets in the East China Sea, around the same time a Chinese helicopter violated Japanese airspace in the vicinity last week. While Japanese aircraft operating in the country's airspace pose no legal issue, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said contingencies stemming from such flights should be avoided amid tensions with China over the Senkaku Islands.</p>
