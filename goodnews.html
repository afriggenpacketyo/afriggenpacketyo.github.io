          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on destructive bottom trawling in English waters, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2. This proposal aims to protect rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats, following warnings from figures like Sir David Attenborough about the damage caused by this fishing method. The plan is subject to a 12-week consultation with the marine and fishing industry. Pressure is also mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty to protect ocean areas. </p>
