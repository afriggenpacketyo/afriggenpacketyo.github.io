          <p>A federal judge has extended the block on the Trump administration's plans to cut jobs and reorganize federal agencies under the DOGE initiative, led by Elon Musk. The preliminary injunction pauses further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit, arguing that agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates. Judge Illston emphasized that Congress creates, funds, and assigns duties to federal agencies, and a President cannot initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress. The Trump administration has appealed the decision.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, Harvard professor Steven Pinker defends the university against what he describes as unhinged invective, including accusations of being a "national disgrace" and an "Islamist outpost." Pinker acknowledges Harvard's ailments, such as the erosion of academic freedom and a lack of viewpoint diversity, but argues against the Trump administration's punitive measures, including defunding and barring foreign students. He emphasizes the need for a balanced perspective, stating that Harvard, despite its flaws, remains a vital institution for discovering and transmitting knowledge and that the appropriate treatment is to diagnose and remedy specific issues rather than inflict crippling damage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article reports on a study published in The Lancet, finding that contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue compared to ultrasound. While MRI is more effective at detecting tumors, CEM is more cost-effective and can find smaller tumors than standard mammography. The study suggests that CEM should become a standard of care for women with dense breasts at high risk of breast cancer, potentially averting tragedies through early detection. However, CEM is not yet widely used for screening in the United States and has not been approved by the FDA for breast cancer screening.</p>

Failure to seize the moment could lead to a resurgence of the conflict, as happened in 2015. The PKK is expecting political concessions, including amnesty and recognition of Kurdish political and cultural rights.</p>
