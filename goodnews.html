        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of consumers in the UK may be eligible to receive approximately ¬£70 each due to a court ruling that found Mastercard charged unfair fees over a 15-year period from 1992 to 2008. The legal case was initiated by Walter Merricks, a former financial ombudsman, who argued that these fees led to inflated prices for shoppers. While the fees were paid by retailers, Merricks contended that the costs were passed on to consumers. A ¬£200 million settlement has been reached, and individuals do not need to have owned a Mastercard to claim a share.</p>
