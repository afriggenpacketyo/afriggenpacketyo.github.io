          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused widespread destruction in western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their critical role in the aftermath. With roads washed out and communications down, helicopter and plane pilots were among the first to witness the devastation, conducting rescue missions and delivering essential supplies like medicine and food. These volunteers, supported by organizations like the United Cajun Navy, performed hundreds of missions, rescuing stranded residents and providing a vital link to the outside world. The efforts highlight the immense community and aviation response that supported official operations by the National Guard.</p>

          <p>Entrepreneurs are sharing their experiences of navigating the emotional and professional challenges of failed startups, a common reality in the high-pressure world of business. Founders describe the pain of disappointing investors, laying off employees, and losing their personal identity, which is often deeply intertwined with their companies. Some who return to corporate life face a stigma, though many argue their experience makes them highly capable employees with a broad understanding of business operations. The article emphasizes the importance of reframing failure as a learning experience and finding a deeper sense of purpose to build resilience for future ventures.</p>

          <p>To encourage more foreign visitors and stimulate its tourism sector, China has been progressively relaxing its entry requirements, offering several ways to visit the mainland without a visa. These options include a 10-day transit stay for passport holders from 55 nations, including the United States and Australia, who pass through designated international airports. Beijing has also been expanding its list of countries whose citizens can stay for up to 30 days without a visa, with Russia being the latest addition to this policy. The changes aim to lower the bureaucratic and financial hurdles that have traditionally been associated with obtaining a Chinese visa.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada highlights a significant financial gap and differing approaches to professionalism in the sport. England's team is the best-funded in the world, with fully professional, contracted players and a robust domestic league, contributing to their dominant record. In stark contrast, Canada's players are largely amateur, and the national team relied on a million-dollar fundraising campaign to finance its World Cup preparations. A potential victory for Canada could be seen by some as proof that success is possible without massive investment, a narrative that could impact the future of professional women's rugby globally.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Women's Rugby World Cup final, the diverse professional backgrounds of England's players underscore the sport's recent transition to professionalism. Hooker Amy Cokayne, for instance, serves as a police officer in the Royal Air Force, while veteran Marlie Packer, part of the 2014 amateur World Cup-winning squad, worked as a plumber. Other players recall past jobs as teachers and painters, highlighting the financial realities they faced before the introduction of full-time contracts six years ago. These stories illustrate the personal sacrifices made by the athletes and the profound changes that have reshaped the landscape of women's rugby in England.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is actively promoting an ambitious youth migration agreement with the European Union, hoping it will improve the country's economic outlook ahead of the autumn Budget. The proposed scheme would allow young people aged 18 to 30 to live and work in the UK for a limited time, which Reeves argues would stimulate growth and benefit businesses. The Chancellor has urged the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to incorporate the potential positive economic effects of such a deal into its official forecasts. This could potentially reduce the need for significant spending cuts or tax increases to address a looming fiscal gap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Director Emerald Fennell aims to capture the "primal, sexual" feeling she experienced when first reading "Wuthering Heights" as a teenager in her upcoming film adaptation. Speaking at a festival in author Emily Brontë's hometown, the Oscar-winning director of "Promising Young Woman" and "Saltburn" discussed her deeply personal connection to the classic novel. The film, starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, is already generating buzz for its erotically charged trailer, which reflects Fennell's stylized and unsettling gothic vision. She explained that her adaptation is an emotional response to the book's singular, devastating, and complex nature.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies like Huawei and AI start-up DeepSeek are making significant strides in developing domestic technology to reduce reliance on U.S. chips, particularly those from Nvidia. Huawei recently showcased its advanced Ascend AI chips and hardware, presenting a viable alternative for the powerful processors needed for AI development. Meanwhile, DeepSeek, known for its world-class AI models, is shifting to support these home-grown chips. This push for self-sufficiency, spurred by U.S. export restrictions, signals China's growing capability to innovate and compete in the critical high-tech sector despite trade pressures.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed the election technology company Smartmatic by repeatedly making false statements that its machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election. The judge found that no reasonable person could conclude Lindell's claims about Smartmatic's role in Los Angeles County were true. However, the court deferred a decision on whether Lindell acted with "actual malice," a standard Smartmatic must still prove to be awarded damages. Lindell has vowed to continue his fight against voting machine companies, calling the ruling bizarre.</p>
