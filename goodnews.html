          <p>Evelyn Palla has been named the new chief executive of Germany's state-owned rail operator, Deutsche Bahn (DB), succeeding Richard Lutz, who was dismissed due to mounting reliability and infrastructural issues. Palla, previously head of DB Regio, is the company's first female CEO, with her appointment welcomed by the train drivers' union and passenger advocacy groups. Despite persistent punctuality problems, public transportation use in Germany increased slightly in 2025, though the initial boom from the Deutschlandticket is waning as prices rise. The new CEO faces the challenge of improving DB's performance and regaining public trust.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a £2.2 billion privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth. The project involves moving the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters to bring it into regular use, increasing annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s. While welcomed by the government for job creation and investment, the expansion faces strong opposition from climate campaigners who label it a "disaster for the climate crisis." Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate local impact.</p>

The article highlights the game's ability to deeply understand and expand upon the series' core appeal, taking narrative risks with its 1960s Japan setting and protagonist Hinako. It explores themes of societal pressures, mental breakdown, and the uncertainty of reality, leaving players with compelling mysteries. Despite minor critiques regarding combat, the game's atmosphere, pacing, and art direction are lauded as triumphs, positioning it as a new fan favorite.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Complex Relationship Between Birth Control Pills and Women's Libido</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 02:14:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article investigates whether birth control pills reduce women's sex drive, a common concern among users. Many women report a decrease in libido and other side effects like vaginal dryness or mood swings, often without prior warning from doctors or packaging. Research suggests the pill can increase sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which binds to free testosterone, thereby reducing sexual desire. However, libido is influenced by multiple factors, and studies show varied experiences, with some women reporting no change or even an increase due to pregnancy prevention. Experts highlight the evolution of pill formulations and the ongoing stigma around women's health as contributing to confusion.</p>
