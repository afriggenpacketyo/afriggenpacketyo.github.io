          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its key interest rate to 20%, marking the first reduction since September 2022, a signal that inflation pressures are subsiding. The rate had been at 21% since October 2024, the highest since 2013, but April's inflation rate was 6.2%, down from 8.2% in the first quarter of 2025. The central bank indicated that while domestic demand still exceeds supply capabilities, the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path and will maintain a tight monetary policy to reach its 4% inflation target.

          <p>A security guard at Endeavor Health Evanston Hospital, near Chicago, was shot and wounded during a struggle in the emergency room. The incident began when a man, who appeared to be experiencing a mental health crisis, was brought to the hospital by the Crisis Alternative Response Evanston (C.A.R.E.) team. While in the ER, the man became agitated and lunged for his belongings, leading to a struggle with security during which a weapon was discharged. The hospital was briefly placed on lockdown, but officials confirmed there is no ongoing threat and praised the quick response of hospital personnel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Roads, railways, and bridges are facing challenges due to rising global temperatures, leading to increased maintenance and potential failures. Extreme heat can cause asphalt to melt, rail tracks to buckle, and bridge joints to expand, disrupting transportation and trade. Solutions include heat-reflective coatings for roads, lighter-colored pavements, and using more heat-resistant materials like concrete and martensite rail steel. Addressing these issues is crucial to ensure the resilience of infrastructure in a changing climate, especially as experts anticipate more record-breaking heat in the future.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a rebound in premarket trading after a significant drop fueled by escalating tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts pointed to a report suggesting Trump scheduled a call with Musk to mediate a truce, though independent verification is pending. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives noted that a reconciliation between Musk and Trump would be beneficial for Tesla shares, considering the recent overreaction in the market. The feud began following Musk's departure as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

          <p>Beijing's police authority plans to liquidate cryptocurrencies confiscated in criminal cases by selling them through licensed exchanges in Hong Kong. This move is expected to support Hong Kong's ambition to become a virtual asset hub. The Beijing Public Security Bureau has partnered with the China Beijing Equity Exchange (CBEX) to manage the sales through regulated platforms, converting the proceeds into yuan. This marks the first time a mainland agency has detailed a process for disposing of confiscated cryptoassets via Hong Kong's virtual asset regime, amidst China's strict ban on crypto trading.</p>

          <p>A military parade scheduled for June 14 in Washington, D.C., could disrupt flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). The FAA is expected to suspend airline operations to accommodate military aircraft and a fireworks show during the event, which marks the Army's 250th Anniversary. Airlines are revising flight schedules and shifting passengers to nearby airports to mitigate the impact. The event, which will feature over 100 vehicles, 50 helicopters, and thousands of soldiers, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered what is likely the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern United States, located in Michigan. Using drone technology, researchers mapped parallel rows of earthen mounds, revealing raised gardening beds used by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe. The scale of the agriculture is surprisingly vast, considering the relatively poor growing conditions and the presence of wild rice nearby. The discovery challenges previous understandings of the extent and sophistication of indigenous farming practices.</p>
