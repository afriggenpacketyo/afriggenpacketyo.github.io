          <p>Chinese officials and state media are portraying the recent trade agreement and tariff pause with the U.S. as a major win for China. They claim that Beijing's firm stance and countermeasures were instrumental in securing the deal with relatively few concessions. Chinese negotiators appear to have convinced the Trump administration to significantly roll back tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for China easing countertariffs on U.S. products. Social media in China is filled with celebratory posts touting the deal's benefits, emphasizing the reduction in import duties for both countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. tariff receipts hit a record $16.3 billion in April, driven by revenue from President Trump's trade policies. This influx of duties significantly reduced the budget deficit for the month, which totaled $258.4 billion, a 23% increase from the previous year. The rise in tariff revenue comes after Trump implemented 10% tariffs on U.S. imports starting April 2, adding to existing duties. Despite the surplus in April, the year-to-date budget deficit remains substantial at $1.05 trillion, with high interest rates posing a significant budgetary burden.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved three new "natural" food colorings for use in various products, including Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract, and calcium phosphate. These dyes are seen by some as safer alternatives to synthetic dyes, which have been linked to behavioral issues in some children. Experts emphasize that "natural" does not automatically equate to safer, but the FDA's vetting process for new color additives is typically rigorous. While research suggests these additives are safe in small amounts, some individuals with kidney stones may need to limit their calcium phosphate consumption.</p>

Bondi's approach is described as conspicuously performative, prioritizing loyalty to Trump over institutional independence. Her actions, such as the release of the "Epstein Files," have drawn criticism from both the right and left, while her close coordination with White House staff has raised questions about the Justice Department's autonomy. Despite facing scorn from some quarters, Bondi maintains Trump's favor through her unwavering support and public appearances on Fox News.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer's recent statements on immigration signal an acknowledgement of past policy failures and growing public concerns. His language, describing a risk of becoming "an island of strangers," reflects a shift towards addressing immigration issues more directly. This shift is also influenced by the rise of Reform UK and a recognition that many feel ignored by successive governments on this issue. Starmer's approach includes plans for legal and illegal migration, along with an anticipated deal with the EU involving youth mobility, all aimed at delivering a sustained downward trend in net migration numbers.</p>

          <h2>Trade Truce With China Hailed, But Shortages Could Still Occur</h2>

          <p>China and the United States have agreed to reduce tariffs for the next 90 days, providing relief for investors and retailers. The provisional agreement will see the United States lower tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, and China reduce its import duties on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%, starting Wednesday. Supply shortages and price increases on Chinese products may still hit American consumers in the coming weeks, a lingering effect of weeks of uncertainty. Experts warn that the 90-day deadline for a more lasting trade deal could fuel further market volatility.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is defending the White House plan to receive a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar to be used as America's Air Force One presidential plane. Trump said that the US had helped the other country a lot over the years in terms of security and safety. However, the potential value of the plane and its handling has raised legal and ethical questions among critics, notably Democratic lawmakers, citing the Emoluments Clause, which restricts what gifts US presidents can accept from foreign governments.</p>
