          <p>The animated musical "Kpop Demon Hunters" has become Netflix's most-viewed film ever, accumulating over 236 million watches since its June release and surpassing "Red Notice." This surprise global hit has also seen its soundtrack dominate online streaming, with the song "Golden" topping the Billboard Hot 100. Produced by Sony Pictures Animation, the film follows a fictional K-pop girl band using music and combat skills against demons. Its success is attributed to eye-catching animation, cultural depiction, and catchy K-pop songs crafted by industry veterans, leading to a sing-along version that also topped the US box office.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. has launched a "We the People DC" tourism campaign to counter negative perceptions, while approximately 110 National Guard troops, deployed under President Trump's crime emergency plan, are seen picking up trash. Although 800 Guard members were ordered into the city, only a fraction patrol with police, with others handling logistics and community projects like litter removal. The city's tourism leaders aim to build on a record 27.2 million visitors in 2024, despite a projected drop in international visitation for 2025. This backdrop highlights a political battle over the capital's image, with major renovations and museum openings planned for America's 250th anniversary in 2026.</p>

          <p>Third seed Coco Gauff secured a hard-fought victory against Ajla Tomljanović in the US Open first round, winning 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-5 in a nearly three-hour match. Despite a shaky serving performance, including 10 double faults and six breaks of serve, Gauff demonstrated resilience, breaking back immediately after faltering while serving for the match in the third set. Her serve remains a work in progress, but her ability to close out the match keeps her campaign alive. Gauff will now face Donna Vekić in the second round, with the possibility of achieving the world No. 1 ranking still within reach if she makes a deep run.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits declined by 1.5% year-on-year in July, marking the slowest pace of decline in five months and indicating a notable recovery. This improvement is attributed to Beijing's policy campaign against price wars, which has helped enhance companies' profit margins. For the first seven months of the year, profits at major industrial firms fell 1.7%. State-backed firms saw a larger drop of 7.5%, while businesses with foreign investments experienced a 1.8% increase. The manufacturing and utilities sectors saw profit improvements, contrasting with a significant plunge in the mining industry, reflecting the impact of government policies on various sectors.

          <p>Less than eight months after the Eaton and Palisades wildfires destroyed 16,000 buildings in Los Angeles County, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is finalizing debris removal from nearly 10,000 properties. This federal response is lauded as the fastest wildfire recovery in modern history, completing the work approximately four months ahead of its January 2026 goal. Federal contractors have cleared 2.5 million tons of debris, though some homeowners reported imperfect work. The achievement marks a significant transition to the rebuilding phase for affected communities, with many new homes already emerging from the ashes, symbolizing a foundation for healing and starting anew.</p>

          <p>A sophisticated retail crime ring, responsible for over 600 thefts and an estimated $10 million in stolen merchandise from Home Depot stores across Southern California, has been dismantled. Authorities announced 48 felony counts against nine alleged key players following "Operation Kill Switch," which led to 14 arrests. David Ahl is accused of leading the enterprise, directing "boosters" to steal high-value items and reselling them through his Tarzana electronics storefront. The investigation, which also implicated Ahl's brother-in-law and ex-wife in similar fencing operations, seized $3.7 million in stolen property and over $800,000 in illicit funds. New legislation allowing consolidation of multi-county retail crime charges aided the prosecution.</p>

          <p>Pop superstar Taylor Swift and NFL tight end Travis Kelce have announced their engagement, sharing intimate photos of the proposal set in a rose-filled garden. The couple, who began dating in 2023 after Kelce's public attempt to meet Swift, captioned their joint Instagram post "Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married," a nod to a fan-created nickname. Kelce's father revealed the engagement occurred two weeks prior, and Swift later joked on the "New Heights" podcast about the podcast being her "personal dating app." The engagement ring, an old mine brilliant cut diamond, was designed by Kindred Lubeck.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its 10th test flight, marking a critical success after a series of failures. The Starship upper stage reached its target suborbital trajectory, deployed eight Starlink satellite simulators, and performed an engine reignition test. Despite re-entry heating causing damage to a protective skirt and a control flap, the vehicle maintained control and executed a powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean as planned. The Super Heavy booster also performed its return-to-Gulf splashdown, simulating an engine failure. This flight is a crucial step for SpaceX's goals of Mars colonization and NASA's Artemis moon landing program, though significant technical hurdles remain for the latter.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship megarocket completed a successful 10th test flight, overcoming previous explosive failures and proving key aspects of its reusable design. The 403-foot-tall vehicle launched from Texas, with its upper half separating as planned and its Super Heavy booster targeting a Gulf of Mexico splashdown. The Starship successfully dispensed mock Starlink satellites and endured intense heat during atmospheric reentry, a crucial test for its new heat shield tiles. This achievement is vital for Elon Musk's vision of colonizing Mars and NASA's plans for returning astronauts to the moon, despite the capital-intensive "test-to-failure" development approach raising doubts after a string of mishaps this year.</p>

          <p>A German court has convicted a 16-year-old Syrian national, identified as Mohammad A., for supporting a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna last year. He received a suspended 18-month sentence for preparing a serious act of violence and supporting a terrorist act abroad. Prosecutors stated he supported the Islamic State group's ideology and communicated with an Austrian acquaintance who planned to use knives or explosives outside the stadium. The defendant made a "comprehensive confession," acknowledging sending bomb-building instructions and organizing contact with an IS member. Austrian authorities arrested two suspects in August 2024, preventing a potential attack on up to 95,000 fans.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have finalized their initial 53-man roster for the upcoming season, with Trey Lance winning the backup quarterback position behind Justin Herbert. This move signifies confidence in Lance's talent, which once made him a top-three draft pick. Notable cuts included veteran quarterback Taylor Heinicke and safety Tony Jefferson, while several players were placed on injured reserve. The team's offensive line remains a question mark due to injuries, but the running back group sees new additions with Omarion Hampton and Najee Harris expected to carry a heavy workload.

          <p>Cracker Barrel announced it will revert to its original "Old Timer" logo, less than a week after unveiling a controversial modern rebrand that sparked significant backlash and a stock value dip. The company stated it "listened" to guests' voices, including President Trump's public criticism. The new logo, which removed the iconic man leaning against a barrel, was part of an effort to update its image and celebrate diversity but was perceived by many as abandoning its nostalgic roots. The reversal comes after the company lost nearly $100 million in market value. This decision reflects a quick response to customer and public sentiment.</p>
