          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is showing encouraging signs of recovery after participating in his first extensive workout since being sidelined with a back injury. Coach Sean McVay reported that Stafford threw over 60 passes without limitations, covering short, intermediate, and deep routes, and felt good afterward. While the 37-year-old quarterback is not yet fully cleared for all team activities, this workout is considered a significant step toward his return to practice. The team remains hopeful for his swift return as he works through an aggravated disc issue.</p>

          <p>During the Dallas Cowboys' preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams, star receiver CeeDee Lamb was inadvertently leveled by a sprinting official on the sideline. Lamb, who was not playing in the game and was dressed in street clothes, was standing near the field when the official, focused on the play, ran into his back. The collision resulted in a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against the Cowboys for making contact with an official. Lamb appeared uninjured and was seen laughing about the unusual incident with his teammates.</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Rams' preseason victory over the Dallas Cowboys, running back Blake Corum demonstrated his readiness for a more significant role in the offense. The former Michigan star rushed for 32 yards and two touchdowns, showing he could help ease the workload of primary back Kyren Williams. Quarterback Stetson Bennett also had a solid performance, completing 16 of 24 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns, further solidifying his position. The game showcased the Rams' depth at the running back position, with other rookies also contributing effectively.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The luxury fashion industry is reportedly moving away from the understated "quiet luxury" trend and embracing more visible, statement-making "loud luxury" styles. This shift, led by new creative directors at major brands like Gucci and Chanel, aims to re-energize consumer interest amid a sector-wide downturn. Analysts suggest that after several years of minimalist aesthetics, the market is ready for novelty and more distinct branding. This change in creative direction is seen as a crucial strategy for brands to regain relevance and market share, especially as they navigate soft consumer sentiment and the after-effects of significant price hikes.

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last traditional newspaper hawker in France, is set to receive the National Order of Merit, one of the country's highest honors. For over 50 years, the 72-year-old has been a beloved figure in Paris's Left Bank, selling copies of Le Monde on the streets. Mr. Akbar has witnessed the dramatic decline of his trade due to the rise of digital media, with his daily sales dropping from 80 to around 30. Despite the changing times, he continues his work for the joy and independence it brings.</p>

          <p>A recent statement by singer Ed Sheeran describing himself as "culturally Irish" has ignited a social media debate about identity and heritage. Despite being born and raised in England, Sheeran, who has Irish grandparents and an Irish passport, defended his connection to the country where his musical tastes were formed. This article explores the complex and evolving nature of what it means to be Irish in 2025, touching on the experiences of the diaspora, the blended identities in Northern Ireland, and the cross-cultural influences that shape modern identity beyond simple definitions of birthplace or citizenship.</p>

          <h2>New 'War of the Worlds' Film's Poor Reviews Spark Discussion on the Appeal of 'Bad' Movies</h2>

          <p>The new adaptation of "War of the Worlds," starring Ice Cube, has been widely panned by critics, earning a 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes upon its release. However, the overwhelmingly negative reviews have paradoxically generated interest, sparking a conversation about why audiences are often drawn to films that are considered "so bad they're good." Film enthusiasts and cultural commentators suggest that truly terrible movies can be more entertaining and memorable than bland, forgettable blockbusters. They find charm in earnest failures and the visible struggle to overcome production issues, which can offer a unique and often humorous viewing experience.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding more than $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed a White House appearance by CEO Tim Cook, who announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts over the next four years. This move, which pleased President Trump, was seen by investors as a successful strategy to mitigate the financial risks of potential tariffs on imported components. The positive market reaction was also bolstered by Apple's strong quarterly earnings report from two weeks prior. (not investment advice)</p>
