He stated that the U.S. government is funding what he considers a genocide and that he will continue to speak up for Palestine and for immigrants left behind in detention. US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned Khalil's detention as a violation of the First Amendment.

          <p>Japan has repatriated the remains of 10 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, marking the first such repatriation between the two countries. The remains, taken in the 19th and 20th centuries for research purposes, were held by three Japanese research institutions and handed over in a ceremony at the Australian Embassy in Tokyo. This act aligns with a global movement to return indigenous remains taken abroad, with Australia having repatriated over 1,785 sets of remains from overseas collections in the past 30 years. The return of the remains signifies a step towards reconciliation and healing for Indigenous communities. The University of Tokyo acknowledged the need to address the historical practice of holding indigenous remains. </p>

This offer comes as Mexico seeks to enhance its energy security and reduce its reliance on natural gas imports from the United States. Mexico currently meets 72% of its natural gas demand through imports, primarily from the U.S. This development could potentially diversify Mexico's energy sources. </p>

The release came as US special envoy Keith Kellogg visited Minsk and met with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Tikhanovskaya expressed joy at her husband's release but emphasized that over 1,150 political prisoners remain behind bars.

          <p>A new study published in Science Advances confirms that humans arrived in the Americas much earlier than previously thought. Footprints discovered in a paleolake bed were analyzed, revealing that they were made between 20,700 and 22,400 years ago. This discovery predates the Clovis people, who were previously believed to be the oldest North American humans. The lack of artifacts suggests that the footprints were left by nomadic hunter-gatherers. </p>
