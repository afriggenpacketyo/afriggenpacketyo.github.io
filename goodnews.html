          <p>Colombian international winger Luis Diaz has officially moved from Liverpool to Bayern Munich in a deal valued at £65.5 million. The 28-year-old has signed a four-year contract with the German champions, ending his successful tenure at Anfield where he scored 41 goals in 148 appearances. Diaz was a key player for Liverpool, contributing significantly to their Premier League win last season and winning both the FA Cup and EFL Cup. His departure leaves a significant role to fill on Liverpool's left flank.</p>

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate fell to 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest point since March 2021 and within the central bank's target range. This slowdown in inflation has strengthened economists' expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia will implement another interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. While the RBA has been cautious, analysts believe the weaker inflation data, combined with a softer global growth outlook, provides sufficient evidence to support a move to stimulate the economy.
