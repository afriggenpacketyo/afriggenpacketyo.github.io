          <p>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem experienced aircraft trouble returning from Guatemala and secured a ride back to the U.S. on an ICE deportation flight. The flight was returning to Louisiana after deporting individuals with criminal convictions, including for drug trafficking and assault.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concerns, President Trump's recent tariffs have not yet led to a significant increase in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies pre-ordering goods to "front-load" inventory before tariffs took effect. Businesses have also been absorbing some costs and utilizing trade loopholes to delay duty payments amid uncertainty over trade policy. However, experts warn that these are temporary buffers and that price increases are still likely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For savers with $10,000, choosing between a high-yield savings account and a money market account currently yields very similar returns. With top rates around 4.30% for savings and 4.32% for money market accounts, the difference in earnings over a year is negligible, amounting to only about $2. Both account types offer significantly better returns than traditional savings accounts.

          <p>For Americans struggling with debt, forgiveness through negotiation can be a viable option, though its success varies by debt type. Unsecured debts like credit card balances and personal loans are often the most negotiable, as creditors prefer recovering a partial amount to risking a total loss. Medical bills can also be reduced through hospital assistance programs or lump-sum settlement negotiations. However, other debts like buy now, pay later plans and payday loans are generally more difficult to settle due to their structure and lender practices. (not investment advice)</p>
