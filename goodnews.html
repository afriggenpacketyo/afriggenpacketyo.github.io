          <p>Microsoft's digital crimes unit, in collaboration with global law enforcement, dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware project, which had infected over 394,000 Windows computers worldwide between March 16 and May 16. The Lumma malware was used by hackers to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, bank account credentials, and cryptocurrency wallets. Microsoft obtained a court order from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia to dismantle the web domains supporting Lumma's infrastructure, and the U.S. Department of Justice took control of Lumma's central command structure, effectively shutting down online marketplaces where the malware was sold.</p>

          <p>Canada Goose shares experienced a significant surge after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations, although it withdrew its fiscal 2026 outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainty. Despite the uncertainty, Canada Goose expressed confidence in its brand strength and financial position, citing its ability to adapt to changing conditions. The company's COO noted that a large portion of Canada Goose's units are made in Canada and comply with trade agreements, minimizing the impact of tariffs. Revenue increased by 7.4% year-over-year, and the company is expanding into non-winter categories and leveraging AI-powered virtual try-on tools for its eyewear collection (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Senate passed a surprise 'no tax on tips' bill, which could provide tax relief to tipped workers. During the 2024 presidential campaign, both Trump and Vice President Harris supported the idea of eliminating taxes on tips. If enacted, workers could deduct all 'qualified tips' from 2025 through 2028, but this could still change before the full House floor vote. While this policy could benefit moderate to middle-income workers, it may also create issues such as the introduction of tips in new occupations and misclassification of income as tips (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings in Minnesota determined the "tush push" play, popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles, will remain legal after a proposal to ban it failed to reach the required majority. The Green Bay Packers' proposal cited player safety and pace of play as reasons for the ban, though the NFL has previously stated that no injuries have been reported on the play. Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie defended the play, emphasizing the importance of health and safety but noting the lack of supporting data. The Eagles were highly successful using the "tush push" in the 2024 season, converting it into a first down or touchdown in 39 of 48 attempts.</p>

          <p>Former CIA chief of disguise Jonna Mendez confirmed that the mask technology used in "Mission: Impossible ‚Äì The Final Reckoning" has real-world parallels. Mendez stated that the CIA developed masks capable of changing an agent's apparent gender and ethnicity, and she personally demonstrated this technology to high-ranking officials. The masks were remarkably realistic and could be applied in as little as 10 seconds, even without mirrors. While she was more circumspect about self-destructing messages, Mendez acknowledged the reality behind the advanced espionage techniques depicted in the films.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments, reversing a policy that affected over 10 million pensioners. The policy change, which restricted eligibility for the payments, had drawn criticism from unions and pensioner charities, and it was blamed for the party's losses at local elections. Starmer stated that ministers would change the threshold to allow more pensioners to qualify again, with details to be confirmed at the autumn Budget. The winter fuel payment provides a lump-sum amount to pensioners to help with heating costs over the winter.</p>
