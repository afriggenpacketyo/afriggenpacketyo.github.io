          <p>Scottish First Minister John Swinney is working to stabilize the Scottish National Party (SNP) and focus on public services ahead of the party's annual conference. Despite internal debates on the strategy for achieving independence, Swinney's leadership has steadied the party after a period of turmoil. With Labour's popularity waning and the rise of Reform UK fragmenting the opposition, the SNP's position appears stronger as it prepares for the next Holyrood election. The conference will be a key opportunity for Swinney to outline his vision and consolidate his authority within the party.</p>

          <p>Former First Lady Melania Trump announced that an "open channel of communication" with Russian President Vladimir Putin has resulted in the reunification of eight Ukrainian children with their families. She stated that Putin responded to a "peace letter" she sent concerning children displaced by the war, which was delivered during his visit to Alaska. According to Mrs. Trump, the effort was facilitated by both Russia and Ukraine, and the identities and circumstances of each child were confirmed by the U.S. government. This marks a notable development in her "BE BEST" initiative focused on children's welfare.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland faces a significant challenge in their upcoming World Cup qualifier against Germany, as they will be without their star player, Conor Bradley. The Liverpool defender, who was described as the "best player on the pitch" in their recent 2-0 victory over Slovakia, is suspended after receiving a yellow card. Bradley's dynamic performance was crucial to the win, and his absence creates a tactical problem for manager Michael O'Neill. The team must now find a way to compensate for the loss of their talismanic captain in a pivotal match.</p>

          <p>FIFA is currently redrafting its regulations concerning domestic league matches being played in foreign countries and is seeking legal advice on whether a complete ban is feasible. The move comes after UEFA cited FIFA's existing framework in its decision to allow games like Villarreal vs. Barcelona in Miami. World football's governing body aims to create a more robust rulebook to prevent a global free-for-all of leagues hosting official matches overseas. This review of rules, last updated in 2014, reflects growing concerns about the commercialization and global expansion of domestic leagues.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has issued new guidelines for its local authorities, warning them against giving artificial intelligence models access to sensitive information or state secrets. The document outlines approved uses for AI, such as answering public queries, monitoring infrastructure, and assisting with administrative tasks. However, it mandates that a complete safety evaluation must be conducted before any AI models are deployed for government use. These rules are part of a broader effort by Beijing to improve government efficiency while maintaining strict control over state data.</p>

          <p>German lawmakers are debating whether to criminalize verbal sexual harassment, often referred to as catcalling, which is currently not a specific offense under the country's laws. The Social Democrats are pushing to close what they see as a legal loophole, arguing that such behavior is a form of violence that intimidates victims and restricts their freedom in public spaces. While other European countries like Belgium and France have already passed similar laws, the proposal faces opposition in Germany from critics who question its practicality. The debate reflects a growing movement to legally recognize and penalize non-physical forms of sexual harassment.</p>
