          <p>Best-selling author and illustrator Charlie Mackesy revealed his new book, "Always Remember," took six years to complete after his iPad, containing many initial drawings and writings, was stolen from his unlocked car. This significant setback, combined with personal grief over losing his mother and beloved dog, tested his artistic and personal resilience. Mackesy, famous for "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse," emphasizes finding purpose in connecting with others through his art and describes receiving thousands of emails from people whose lives were touched by his work. He now invests his earnings in rewilding efforts, planting thousands of trees, and plans future projects including a collaboration with the V&A Museum, while vowing to lock his car.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Zealand's central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points, bringing the policy rate to 2.5%, its lowest level since July 2022, to stimulate economic growth. This larger-than-anticipated reduction by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) was driven by concerns over weak economic activity in mid-2025 and confidence that inflation is moderating towards its 2% target by early next year. The RBNZ noted that slow growth in disposable incomes and house prices continues to weigh on the economy, with lower interest rates now intended to support a recovery in consumption. Growth forecasts for several of New Zealand's trading partners, particularly in Asia, have shown improvement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>VoteVets, a liberal veterans' advocacy group, is investing $1 million into the gubernatorial campaigns of Democratic candidates Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Rep. Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, with less than 30 days until Election Day. The group's aggressive ad campaigns feature veterans criticizing Republican opponents, Jack Ciattarelli and Winsome Earle-Sears, over their economic policies. These closely watched elections, held a year after the presidential race, often serve as crucial referenda on the newly elected president's administration. Both races have recently intensified with controversies, including a data breach of Sherrill's military records and Spanberger facing criticism over her Democratic attorney general nominee's inflammatory texts.</p>

This impressive listing contributes to a notable resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market, which has collectively raised about $14.1 billion in the first half of this year. The article also highlights mixed trading across broader Asia-Pacific markets, influenced by the World Bank's recently raised growth forecast for the region and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's unexpected interest rate cut.

This celestial phenomenon occurs when the moon reaches its perigee, the point in its orbit where it is closest to Earth. This specific supermoon is also known as the Hunter's Moon, a traditional name for the first full moon in October. The name historically references preparations for winter in the Northern Hemisphere, when people would hunt and preserve meats, connecting the astronomical event to ancient human practices and seasonal rhythms.</p>

          <p>Matt Van Epps, strongly endorsed by President Trump, secured a victory in a crowded Republican primary for Tennessee's special election for a House seat, and is now set to face Democrat Aftyn Behn in December. Van Epps, a Tennessee Army National Guard lieutenant colonel and Army Special Operations helicopter pilot, clinched the GOP nomination following Trump's endorsement, which came after in-person early voting concluded. This upcoming general election is widely viewed as a significant indicator of President Trump's second-term agenda popularity, particularly among Republican-leaning suburban voters in the Nashville area. The 7th Congressional District is considered a safely Republican seat, and a GOP hold would slightly expand their slim House majority.</p>

          <p>US scientist Dr. Fred Ramsdell, on the final day of a three-week off-grid hike in Montana's grizzly bear country with his wife and dogs, learned he won the Nobel Prize for medicine when his wife, Laura O'Neill, received a flurry of text messages. Ramsdell, whose phone was on airplane mode, initially disbelieved the news, which came 20 hours after the Nobel committee first attempted to contact him. He shares the prize with two other scientists for their groundbreaking research into how the immune system attacks hostile infections. The article humorously recounts the difficulty the Nobel Assembly had in reaching him, calling it their most challenging attempt since 2016.</p>

Walker, who previously ran unsuccessfully for a Georgia Senate seat in 2022, is the first Senate-confirmed ambassador to the Bahamas in over a decade. His confirmation, alongside more than 100 other Trump nominees, occurred through a rules change by Senate Republicans, allowing them to approve large groups of executive branch nominees en bloc.

With an extensive CV that includes numerous TV shows, a radio program, and documentaries, Ranganathan admits the "accusation has been levelled at me." He explains his decision-making process for new projects is based on whether he believes it will be good, something he'd watch, and if he can do a decent job, alongside needing a fee. While acknowledging the risk, he tries not to "overthink things," humorously suggesting he might work in a café if the public eventually tires of seeing him.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed minerals explorer Trilogy Metals surged over 200% after the White House announced it would acquire a 10% stake in the Canadian company through a $35.6 million investment. This partnership is part of a strategic push to unlock domestic supplies of critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, zinc, and lead, within Alaska's Ambler mining district. The decision reverses the Biden administration's previous rejection of the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal commitment to resource development. While the U.S. aims to counter China's dominance in critical mineral supply chains, opponents warn the project could harm local communities and wildlife. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article highlights how three families, featured on Stacey Solomon's popular show "Sort Your Life Out," achieved significant decluttering, profoundly transforming their homes and personal lives. Sheeny Aphabhai-Heer successfully broke a long-standing shopping habit to set a more positive example for her children, ultimately letting go of over 40% of her belongings. Widowed father Craig Bufton courageously overcame emotional attachment to his late wife's sentimental items, which enabled him to create a special reading room for his two daughters. Similarly, Sarah Clarke, an avid crafts enthusiast, realized she needed to prioritize quality time with her children over her numerous craft projects. Each family's success stemmed from a key realization about their relationship with their possessions and its impact on their lives.</p>

          <p>A rare interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, and only the third ever confirmed to enter our solar system, was recently photographed closely approaching Mars by two European Space Agency orbiters. The images, captured last week, reveal the bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet moving against a backdrop of distant stars, approximately 18.6 million miles away from Mars. Since its discovery in July, this comet has also been captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, and is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October, passing between the orbits of Mars and Earth. Scientists are continuing to analyze data from these unique observations.</p>

While many Indonesians express confidence in China's capacity to expand their national travel network across the archipelago, the article implicitly raises important questions about the potential debt implications of such extensive foreign investment.

Badenoch plans to accuse the current Labour government of risking the UK's financial stability with a "borrowing and tax doom loop," thereby attempting to reclaim the mantle of financial prudence.
