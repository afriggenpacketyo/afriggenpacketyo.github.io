        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk announced that its once-daily oral obesity pill demonstrated significant weight reduction in a late-stage trial, with results comparable to its popular Wegovy injection. The phase 3 trial showed an average weight loss of 16.6% after 64 weeks, boosting the company's shares by over 5%. This development positions the "Wegovy pill" as a major contender in the competitive market for oral obesity treatments, offering an alternative for patients averse to injections and strengthening Novo's portfolio against rivals like Eli Lilly.</p>

The 26-year-old World Player of the Year missed the quarter-final victory over Scotland but has passed all necessary medical protocols. Her return, along with prop Hannah Botterman, is expected to bolster England's squad for what is anticipated to be their most challenging match of the tournament. England is currently on a 16-game winning streak against France but faces a tough opponent in their bid to reach the final.</p>

          <p>A new conservative watchdog organization, the Safety and Prosperity Oversight Coalition, has launched with the goal of holding governmental and private institutions accountable. Led by veteran Republican political operative Chris Zeller, the group aims to be a leading voice for conservative values and effective governance. Its focus will be on scrutinizing government spending, addressing misconduct in both public and corporate sectors, and advocating for reforms through audits, legal challenges, and public education campaigns. The coalition intends to provide a conservative counterweight to accountability efforts from the left, promoting transparency and integrity across major American institutions.</p>

The winning bid, more than double the estimate, secured an evening that includes champagne and a private tour of Singapore's National Gallery. The auction was part of the museum's 10th-anniversary fundraising gala, which raised over SG$2.8 million to support its mission of making art accessible.

          <p>The U.K. government has announced £150 billion in new investment commitments from U.S. firms, a development coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. The investments, which are expected to create over 7,600 jobs, include major pledges from tech giants like Microsoft and Google, as well as a £90 billion commitment from private equity firm Blackstone. This announcement is part of a broader strategy to strengthen economic ties between the two nations. However, it comes as some domestic businesses slow their own investment and major pharmaceutical companies halt U.K. projects, citing an increasingly challenging business environment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second state visit to the U.K. involves a mix of royal pageantry and high-level political meetings. After being hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle for a state banquet, the president is scheduled to hold talks with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at his country estate, Chequers. This visit is historically unusual, as second-term U.S. presidents are not typically offered a full state visit. The agenda includes discussions on a U.K.-U.S. trade deal, while the visit itself has drawn protests in London and significant security measures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese tech giant Huawei has announced a new AI computing system, the "Atlas 950 SuperCluster," powered by its in-house Ascend chips, in a direct challenge to U.S. rival Nvidia. The company claims the new system, set to launch next year, will be the world's most powerful by computing power for several years. This move is part of China's strategy to achieve self-reliance in advanced semiconductors amid U.S. sanctions designed to cut off its access to top-tier AI technology. Huawei's approach involves grouping vast numbers of its homegrown chips to achieve competitive performance.</p>

          <p>Nscale, a London-based AI infrastructure startup that emerged from stealth only last year, has rapidly become a central player in the European AI market, securing major partnerships and funding. The company, which has roots in cryptocurrency mining infrastructure, recently received a $683 million equity investment from Nvidia and was named an infrastructure partner for Microsoft and OpenAI's U.K. expansion. Nscale is now at the forefront of Europe's push for "sovereign AI," developing hyperscale data centers to meet the soaring demand for AI computing power on the continent.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the University of Delaware have discovered how to synthetically produce a molecule found in the leaves and bark of the guava fruit plant that shows promise in fighting liver-related cancers. Using a process called natural product total synthesis, the research team created a chemical pathway to replicate the molecule, which could lead to more effective and accessible treatments. With liver cancer cases projected to rise, this breakthrough may open new avenues for developing medicines, as many clinically approved drugs are derived from natural products. The team is now collaborating with the National Cancer Institute to explore the molecule's potential against other cancers.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester City star Kevin de Bruyne is set for an emotional return to the Etihad Stadium as he leads his new club, Napoli, in a Champions League match. The Belgian midfielder, who won 16 trophies with City over a decade, left in June and will now face his old team for the first time. De Bruyne's arrival at Napoli has been compared to that of club legend Diego Maradona, and he has made an immediate impact with two goals in his first three games. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said it will be "nice to have him back."</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered his best performance of the season, pitching seven scoreless innings and striking out a season-high 12 batters in a 5-0 victory against the Philadelphia Phillies. In a key moment in the seventh inning with two runners on, manager Dave Roberts showed faith in Snell, allowing him to stay in the game and secure the final out of the frame. The dominant start provided a much-needed boost for the team and eased the pressure on its recently struggling bullpen. The win helps the Dodgers maintain their two-game lead in the National League West.</p>
