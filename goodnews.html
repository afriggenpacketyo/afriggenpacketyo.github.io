        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has proposed that publicly traded companies should switch from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a move he argues would save money and promote a greater focus on long-term corporate strategy. The suggestion, which would require approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, echoes concerns from business leaders like Warren Buffett about the market's unhealthy fixation on short-term profits. However, proponents of the current system argue that quarterly reporting provides crucial transparency and timely information for investors, and that less frequent updates could introduce more market uncertainty.</p>

Following the disclosure, Tesla's shares saw a significant jump of over 6%.

          <p>Despite gold prices reaching near-record highs of over $3,600 per ounce, some financial experts argue that it remains a worthwhile investment. They suggest that the precious metal still has room for growth, particularly with an anticipated interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which could make gold a more attractive asset. Furthermore, gold is seen as a reliable hedge against the depreciating value of the U.S. dollar and serves as a low-risk diversifier in an uncertain economic climate. The availability of fractional ownership makes it accessible even without substantial capital. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite geopolitical tensions and challenges like visa uncertainties, there are signs that younger Europeans are once again exploring career and educational opportunities in China.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychology and human behavior expert advises against using generic conversation starters like "How are you?" to build genuine connections, as they often lead to scripted and unmemorable interactions. To foster trust and rapport more effectively, the article suggests asking more engaging and specific questions, such as "What's the highlight of your week so far?" or inquiring about exciting plans. This approach encourages others to share positive stories and moves beyond social pleasantries. The expert also emphasizes the importance of open body language and practicing these techniques in low-stakes daily interactions.</p>

          <p>Following widespread protests that led to the resignation of Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli, former chief justice Sushila Karki has been appointed as Nepal's first female interim prime minister. The 73-year-old was chosen after days of negotiations involving the president and youth protest leaders, who were angered by corruption and economic hardship. Karki, known for her integrity and anti-corruption stance, now faces the challenge of guiding the nation toward stability, rebuilding public infrastructure, and conducting fresh elections scheduled for March 2026. Her appointment is seen as a reflection of growing trust in female leadership.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, mortgage experts are advising prospective homebuyers on how to strategically navigate the changing market. Key recommendations include getting a fresh pre-approval to reflect increased buying power, comparing offers from various lenders, and promptly locking in a favorable rate. Experts caution against assuming one's current lender will offer the best deal or trying to time the market by waiting for rates to fall further. They also stress the importance of not overextending one's budget, even if qualifying for a larger loan, to maintain financial stability.</p>

          <p>U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced their highest weekly inflows since mid-July, attracting approximately $2.3 billion in a single week. This surge in investment, led by major funds from BlackRock and Fidelity, suggests a significant renewal of investor confidence in the cryptocurrency. Analysts attribute this "clear demand impulse" to growing expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut and the increasing integration of Bitcoin into institutional investment portfolios. The strong performance has reinforced optimism for a potential uptrend in the digital asset market heading into the final quarter of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The watermelon has become a powerful symbol of Palestinian identity and protest, largely due to its colors mirroring the Palestinian flag: red, green, black, and white. Its use as a political statement dates back to the 1980s, when Israel banned the public display of the Palestinian flag in the occupied territories. Palestinian artists began using images of the watermelon to subtly represent national identity and circumvent the prohibition. In the current era, the symbol has gained global recognition, used by activists and on social media to express solidarity and navigate content moderation.</p>

          <p>Isadore Hall, a former state legislator with extensive experience in local politics, has announced his campaign to challenge incumbent Kenneth Mejia for the position of Los Angeles City Controller. Hall is positioning himself as a candidate of accountability and common sense, arguing that Mejia has focused more on "social media theatrics" than on his core duties. The race is expected to pit Hall's establishment Democratic support against Mejia's progressive, anti-establishment base, which propelled him to a surprise victory in 2022. This sets the stage for a significant political contest in the 2026 election.</p>
