          <p>Grocery delivery company Instacart reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations, with earnings per share at 41 cents against a predicted 38 cents. The company also issued a strong forecast for the current quarter, leading to a more than 6% rise in its stock during extended trading. This positive performance comes as CEO Fidji Simo prepares to step down, with business chief Chris Rogers set to take over. The company highlighted an 11% year-over-year increase in gross transaction value and attributed its success in part to leveraging artificial intelligence for improved personalization.

After restricting Fire to a modest total of 143-9, the Superchargers chased down the target with ease, thanks to a powerful 91-run opening partnership between Crawley and Dawid Malan. Despite a couple of dropped catches by the Fire, Crawley capitalized on the opportunity to secure his highest score in the tournament on his Superchargers debut, sealing the win with 11 balls remaining.</p>

          <p>Southern California grocery chain Stater Bros. has reached a tentative three-year contract agreement with the union representing 12,000 of its workers, successfully averting a potential strike. The deal, which followed months of tense negotiations and a strike authorization vote, reportedly includes higher wages, increased pension contributions, and improved healthcare and safety protections. The union had previously filed charges against the company for unfair labor practices, which Stater Bros. denied. This resolution aligns Stater Bros. with other major regional grocery chains that recently ratified similar contracts with their workers.</p>

During the announcement, Trump revealed Apple would be exempt from a new tariff on chips, suggesting Cook's gambit to showcase U.S. investment was successful in navigating political pressures.

          <p>Online betting giant Flutter reported second-quarter earnings that significantly exceeded Wall Street expectations, driven by the strong performance of its U.S. sportsbook, FanDuel. The company posted adjusted earnings of $2.95 per share, well above the estimated $2.08, and raised its full-year guidance. FanDuel's U.S. revenue and earnings were both higher than anticipated, with June delivering a record-high gross revenue margin. Despite the success, CEO Peter Jackson expressed concern that rising state taxes on sports betting could negatively impact casual users and potentially push them toward illegal offshore sportsbooks.

          <p>A coalition of conservation groups is celebrating a federal judge's decision to temporarily halt construction at the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades. The ruling stops new infrastructure work at the site, which opponents argue threatens fragile wetlands, protected species, and sacred tribal lands. The lawsuit claims the project violated the National Environmental Policy Act by proceeding without a proper environmental review. While the detention center can continue operating, the two-week pause is seen as a significant victory for environmental and tribal advocates fighting the facility's expansion.</p>

          <p>A recipe for the classic Roman pasta dish cacio e pepe, published by the UK's Good Food website, has caused fury among Italians for its deviation from tradition.

An Italian restaurant association was so incensed it contacted the British embassy in Rome to complain. The incident has been widely covered in Italian media, highlighting the deep cultural importance Italians place on culinary authenticity and tradition.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of environmental groups, allowing their lawsuit challenging the state's cuts to rooftop solar incentives to proceed. The decision overturns a lower court ruling that had deferred to the Public Utilities Commission's (PUC) interpretation of the law. The environmental groups argue the PUC acted unlawfully in 2022 when it drastically reduced the credits solar panel owners receive for sending excess power to the grid. This ruling is a significant victory for solar advocates, affirming that the PUC's decisions are subject to standard judicial review and are not above the law.</p>

The story struggles to give depth to its new characters, but Curtis and Lohan are praised for their confident and entertaining performances. Ultimately, the film is described as a disposable but delightful reunion that will likely please fans of the 2003 original.</p>
