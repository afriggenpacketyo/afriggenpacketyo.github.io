          <p>HSBC announced a "world-first" achievement in finance by successfully using quantum computing to enhance bond trading predictions. In a trial collaboration with IBM, the bank utilized a hybrid approach combining classical computers with IBM's Heron quantum processor. This method resulted in a 34% improvement in the accuracy of algorithmic bond price predictions, which could lead to increased margins and greater market liquidity. The successful trial provides the first empirical evidence that quantum computing can solve practical, complex problems in the financial services industry, signaling a new frontier in high-frequency trading technology.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has signed a $7 billion contract with state-owned manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) to acquire 97 domestically produced Tejas Mk-1A fighter jets. This major defense deal is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make in India" initiative, aimed at modernizing the armed forces and boosting the nation's domestic defense industry. The new aircraft are intended to replace the Indian Air Force's aging, Soviet-era MiG-21 fleet, which is being phased out. The procurement underscores India's strategic push towards self-reliance in military hardware amid regional security concerns.</p>

          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations that it tricked consumers into signing up for its Prime membership and intentionally complicated the cancellation process. The settlement includes a $1 billion civil penalty, the largest in any FTC rule violation case, and allocates $1.5 billion for customer refunds. Approximately 35 million Prime members who were affected by these "deceptive subscription traps" could be eligible for a payment of around $51 each. As part of the agreement, Amazon must also make its enrollment and cancellation processes more transparent and straightforward for users.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign off on a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, avoiding a full ban mandated by a recent law. The agreement establishes a joint venture with a consortium of American investors, including Oracle, which will host U.S. user data and review the app's code for security. Under the deal, ByteDance's algorithm will be copied and retrained using only U.S. user data, and the Chinese parent company will retain a minority stake of 19.9%. While the White House expresses confidence the deal complies with the law, some lawmakers worry it may not fully sever Chinese influence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the pathology of workaholism, suggesting it often stems from a mistaken belief that love and intrinsic happiness can be earned through extrinsic success and constant work. It posits that many high-achievers unconsciously try to buy affection with professional merit, a pattern often rooted in childhood experiences where parental love was conditional on performance. This compulsive behavior is ultimately destructive to personal well-being and incompatible with healthy relationships, which require time and emotional presence. The author suggests addressing the issue by understanding its origins, giving love unconditionally, and making concrete plans to change work habits.</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Amazon and Walmart are increasingly deploying robots in their fulfillment centers to handle the anticipated surge in online orders for the upcoming holiday season. At Amazon's most advanced facility, nearly 1,000 robots perform tasks like moving items from storage and lifting heavy packages, which the company says improves efficiency by 25% and enhances worker safety. While automation is replacing some manual labor, companies argue it is also creating new, higher-skilled jobs in areas like robotics maintenance and engineering.

The new regulations are part of the European Union's automated Entry/Exit System (EES), which will replace manual passport stamping for travelers entering the 29-country Schengen Area. The system aims to enhance security and more effectively track who enters and leaves the zone, including those who overstay their permitted 90-day visit.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Department for Education has proposed a plan to increase the fees that private schools pay for inspections conducted by the regulator Ofsted. Currently, these fees cover only a fraction of the actual inspection costs, with taxpayers subsidizing the remainder. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that private businesses should not be subsidized in this way and that the additional revenue would be used to improve state schools. The proposal, now under consultation, would phase in higher annual fees over the next five years for the roughly 1,150 independent schools, many of which are special schools, that Ofsted inspects.</p>

This represents a significant savings of about $240 per month compared to January 2025, when rates were above 7%.

After reaching the 8,849-meter peak, Bargiel successfully navigated the descent, a feat that required him to spend 16 hours in the "death zone" above 8,000 meters due to heavy snowfall. While a few ski descents of Everest have been completed with bottled oxygen, Bargiel's achievement is a groundbreaking milestone in the world of high-altitude ski mountaineering.

          <p>A new analysis by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggests that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, currently passing through our solar system, could be significantly more massive than scientists thought. By studying its trajectory and the rate at which it is shedding gas and dust, Loeb's team calculated its mass to be over 33 billion tons, implying a diameter larger than 3.1 miles. This would make it orders of magnitude larger than the two previously detected interstellar visitors, 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The object's unusual size, composition, and trajectory have fueled speculation, with Loeb suggesting a close-up observation is needed to determine its true nature.</p>
