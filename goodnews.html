          <p>England's cricket team is performing strongly in the World Cup, largely thanks to captain Nat Sciver-Brunt and spinner Sophie Ecclestone, who are delivering statement performances. Sciver-Brunt scored a record fifth World Cup century against Sri Lanka, while Ecclestone, the world number one, took 4-17 in the same match. England remains unbeaten, sitting atop the table, and is well-positioned for semi-finals before facing stronger opponents like India and Australia, showcasing a rejuvenated team under coach Charlotte Edwards.</p>

The Ibrox club continues its search for a new head coach after Russell Martin's recent dismissal, with the team currently struggling in the Scottish Premiership.</p>
