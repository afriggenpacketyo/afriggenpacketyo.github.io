          <p>BBC's Dr. Chris and Dr. Xand van Tulleken, hosts of "What's Up Docs," challenge the rigid notion of needing eight hours of sleep, advocating for a healthier range of six to ten hours to alleviate common anxieties. They share practical insights from their podcast, emphasizing the "power of the pause" for decision-making aligned with personal values and the benefits of mindful teeth brushing. The doctors stress that "willpower" is less about inherent strength and more about intelligently structuring one's environment to foster better habits. This article highlights that struggles with health and well-being are often not personal failures, but rather the result of external pressures and a lack of alignment with core values.</p>

          <p>The White House Family Theater, a private, 40-seat auditorium used by presidents for over 80 years, has begun demolition as part of a $300 million project to build a new ballroom in the East Wing. Converted by Franklin Roosevelt in 1942, the theater hosted numerous screenings for first families and guests, serving as a significant cultural landmark. Film buffs like Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter enjoyed its perks, while others like Lyndon B. Johnson reportedly slept through films. This article highlights concerns from historians and movie theater enthusiasts who view its destruction as bulldozing a piece of American history, questioning whether a new theater will truly replicate its storied past.</p>

Title rivals Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri qualified fifth and seventh, with Piastri struggling for pace throughout the weekend. This article highlights the intense competition, noting that Piastri will start eighth after a grid penalty for another driver. The race is set to be crucial for Norris, who stands 14 points behind Piastri and could reclaim the championship lead with a win.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fact-check article debunks a viral bar chart claiming the UK is the "sexual assault capital of Europe" due to seemingly high reported rates. The article explains that comparing sexual assault statistics across countries is misleading due to significant differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors. The UK's consent-based law and method of counting multiple offenses per incident contribute to its higher figures, not necessarily a higher prevalence. Criminologists recommend victim surveys for more accurate comparisons, and the article refutes claims linking higher rates to "uncontrolled mass immigration" as unsupported by evidence.</p>
