          <p>Donald Trump is spending a second day in Scotland, combining leisure with high-stakes diplomacy as he prepares for trade talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The US president played a round of golf at his Turnberry resort amid a significant security presence and a small group of his supporters. The anticipated meeting with von der Leyen is focused on transatlantic trade relations, with Trump having previously stated there is a "50-50" chance of reaching an agreement. He is also scheduled to meet with UK and Scottish leaders during his visit.</p>

          <p>Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna are jointly advocating for a subpoena of Jeffrey Epstein's estate, seeking more than just a reported birthday book. Massie emphasized the need to "follow the money" by obtaining financial records and details of Epstein's plea bargain to uncover the full extent of his network. Their joint legislation aims to force a House vote on the release of the files, though it was delayed by the August recess. The representatives are now pursuing a discharge petition to bypass the Speaker and compel a vote on the matter.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of New 'Trump IRA' Suggests Better Savings Options for Children Exist</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 10:00:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new government savings plan, dubbed the 'Trump IRA,' allows parents to contribute up to $5,000 annually for children under 18, with a one-time $1,000 government contribution for those born in a specific timeframe. While the tax-free growth is a benefit, this article argues that other strategies offer more substantial long-term advantages. Alternatives like 529 education savings plans and custodial Roth IRAs provide greater flexibility and potential returns for educational or long-term goals. The author also advocates for whole life insurance policies, which can lock in low premiums and build cash value over a child's lifetime. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Entertainer Michael Feinstein, renowned for his performances of classic American popular music, has dedicated himself to ensuring its legacy endures. He established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Indiana, which includes a museum and a performance center, to educate and inspire young artists. The foundation also runs a highly selective Songbook Academy for students to intensively study and interpret this music. Feinstein, who got his start as an archivist for Ira Gershwin, believes the songbook is an evolving tradition that includes modern writers like Carole King and Elton John, not just early 20th-century composers.</p>

          <p>Actress Kristin Scott Thomas makes her directorial debut with the film "My Mother's Wedding," a project deeply rooted in her own childhood experiences of loss. The film, starring Scarlett Johansson and Sienna Miller, explores the story of three daughters grappling with their past as their mother prepares to remarry. Thomas, who lost her father at age five and her stepfather five years later, drew from these personal tragedies to shape the screenplay. In a recent interview, she discussed how this history influenced her creative process and her journey from a shy child to an acclaimed international star.</p>

          <h2>Four-Day Workweek Boosts Happiness by Increasing Effectiveness, Not Just Free Time</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 09:35:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek reveal that the resulting boost in employee happiness stems from more than just increased leisure time. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a key factor is that workers feel more effective and productive while on the clock. Faced with a condensed schedule, teams are motivated to streamline processes, eliminate busywork, and focus on high-impact tasks, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment. This feeling of being on top of their work reduces stress and improves overall well-being, which in turn spills over into their personal lives.</p>

          <p>The iconic work of sculptor Louise Nevelson is being celebrated in new exhibitions at the Whitney Museum in New York and the Columbus Museum of Art in Ohio. Nevelson, who passed away in 1988, became famous for her massive, monochromatic sculptures created from found objects, often discarded wood she scavenged from the streets of New York. It took the art world decades to recognize her unique vision, which transformed humble materials into monumental, immersive experiences. Her granddaughter, Maria Nevelson, describes her as an intimidating and unconventional figure who fiercely pursued her artistic passion throughout her life.</p>

          <p>French companies are being forced to recalibrate their strategies in Africa as France's long-standing political and military influence, known as "Francafrique," diminishes, particularly in the Sahel region. Countries like Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso are increasingly challenging their former colonial power's footprint, creating a more competitive landscape where Chinese, Turkish, and other international firms are gaining market share. In response, some French multinationals are suspending operations, while others are adapting by forming local partnerships and joint ventures to maintain a presence without high visibility, shifting focus to new markets in English- and Portuguese-speaking Africa.</p>

          <h2>Travel Writer Lists Common Phrases That Can Make American Tourists Sound 'Obnoxious'</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A travel expert with experience in 70 countries outlines several phrases that American tourists should avoid to prevent sounding rude or ignorant while abroad. These include asking for prices in U.S. dollars, commenting on how cheap things are, and assuming other countries are divided into states. The author also advises against seeking out American corporate chains like Starbucks instead of supporting local businesses. Complimenting someone's English can be perceived as condescending, and using outdated terms like "third-world country" can come off as judgmental, undermining the goal of respectful cultural exchange.</p>

          <h2>Dietitians Weigh In on Whether Raw Vegetables Can Harm Gut Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While raw vegetables are an excellent source of fiber and nutrients, they may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those with pre-existing gut conditions like IBS or IBD. Dietitians explain that the firm texture and high volume of raw veggies can be difficult for some people to digest, potentially causing bloating and gas. Cooking vegetables breaks down their fibers, making them easier to digest and absorb. While cooking can reduce some heat-sensitive vitamins, it can also enhance the bioavailability of other nutrients. Experts recommend a mix of raw and cooked vegetables for a balanced, gut-friendly diet.</p>

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of stabilizing under CEO Kelly Ortberg, who came out of retirement to lead the company a year ago. The manufacturer's aircraft production and delivery numbers have improved, and Wall Street analysts anticipate the company could post its first annual profit since 2018 next year. Despite facing challenges like a major machinists' strike and renewed FAA scrutiny after a door-plug blowout, Ortberg's hands-on approach has been credited with changing the company's culture. Major airline customers have noted a dramatic improvement in production quality and delivery predictability.</p>

          <p>Top delegations from the US and the European Union have converged at Donald Trump's Turnberry golf resort in Scotland for critical talks aimed at averting a trade war. The meeting, which Trump stated has a "50/50" chance of success, could result in a major trade pact. If talks fail, Trump has threatened to impose 30% tariffs on all EU imports starting August 1. An agreement would likely establish a baseline tariff of 15% on EU goods, providing stability for global investors and key European industries like the automotive sector, which have faced uncertainty since Trump's tariff threats began.</p>

          <p>After securing a Test series victory against Australia, the British and Irish Lions rugby team is now focused on achieving a 3-0 series whitewash, a feat not accomplished on a major tour in nearly a century. This article, a column by former player Matt Dawson, argues that a clean sweep is necessary for this squad to be considered truly legendary. He contrasts the current team's mindset with his 1997 series-winning squad, noting the current players and management are openly discussing the 3-0 goal. He suggests a few strategic team changes could help maintain freshness and intensity for the final match.</p>
