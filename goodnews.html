          <p>A recent report indicates that home equity levels in the United States have reached a record high, with mortgaged residential properties holding an aggregate of $17.6 trillion in equity, a 4% increase from the previous year. Homeowners have access to $11.5 trillion in "tappable" equity, allowing them to borrow against their homes while maintaining a 20% equity threshold. With rising home equity levels, homeowners have an opportunity to borrow large sums of money at lower interest rates compared to personal loans or credit cards. Additionally, interest paid on home equity loans or HELOCs used for home repairs and renovations is tax-deductible, offering further financial benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

Kurtz stated that the company will cooperate with the inquiry and stands by the accounting of its transactions. The company had suffered a major IT outage in July, which disrupted businesses globally and was attributed to a faulty software update. CrowdStrike's shares declined following its quarterly report, despite solid earnings and revenue, due to a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter. Kurtz noted a 97% customer retention rate despite the outage. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court revived a lawsuit filed by an Ohio woman who claimed she was the victim of reverse discrimination after being denied a promotion because she is straight. The court unanimously rejected a federal appeals court ruling that had dismissed Marlean Ames' claims, concluding that the "background circumstances" requirement unfairly imposed a higher burden on members of a majority group. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the standard for proving disparate treatment under Title VII does not vary based on whether the plaintiff is a member of a majority group. The ruling makes it easier to pursue claims of reverse discrimination in several states. </p>
