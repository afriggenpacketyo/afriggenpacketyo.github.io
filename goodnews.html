          <p>Taylor Swift's attorneys have refuted claims made by actor Justin Baldoni's legal team that she had agreed to be deposed in his ongoing legal battle with his co-star, Blake Lively. Swift's lawyer stated that the singer has no material role in the case and would only comply if compelled by the court, noting her schedule could only accommodate it in late October. Lively's attorney accused Baldoni's team of trying to involve Swift to create a media spectacle, arguing there is no valid reason to extend the discovery deadline to accommodate the deposition.</p>

          <p>At a recent technology conference, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff praised data analytics firm Palantir for its impressive market performance and investor appeal, calling himself "inspired" by the company. However, he also took a jab at its business model, describing Palantir's software as "the most expensive enterprise software I've ever seen" and joking that perhaps he isn't charging enough. The comments highlight the growing rivalry between the two companies, which occasionally compete for major government and enterprise contracts.</p>

          <p>The state of Massachusetts has filed a lawsuit against the predictions market platform Kalshi, alleging that it is offering illegal sports gambling without the required license. Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell stated that Kalshi's sports-related events contracts function as wagers and must comply with state gaming laws. The state is seeking a court order to prevent Kalshi from offering these products in Massachusetts while the lawsuit proceeds, a move that challenges the company's position that it is federally regulated by the CFTC.</p>

          <p>In his public response to the murder of Charlie Kirk, Utah's Republican Governor Spencer Cox delivered a strong plea for civility and an end to political rage. He urged young Americans in particular to choose a different path and embrace healthy conflict through conversation rather than violence. Cox's message aligns with his long-standing "Disagree Better" initiative, which promotes civil debate across the political spectrum, and his tone offered a notable contrast to more polarizing reactions to the high-profile assassination that occurred in his state.</p>

Karki is the first woman to hold the position of prime minister in the nation's history. She will lead a transitional government tasked with restoring order and organizing general elections for next March.

          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals upcoming interest rate cuts, a debate has emerged over what will happen to the record $7.6 trillion currently held in high-yield money market funds. Some on Wall Street theorize this "wall of cash" will flow into stocks and other riskier assets as yields on cash decrease, potentially fueling a market rally. However, other experts are skeptical, arguing that a large portion of these funds is institutional cash that is unlikely to move, and that historically, money fund assets only shrink significantly when interest rates fall near zero.

          <p>With mortgage rates dropping to a near one-year low, this article provides four key reminders for potential homebuyers. It advises that timing is crucial, as rates can move in anticipation of Federal Reserve decisions, not just after. Buyers should also focus on improving their credit scores to qualify for the best possible rates. Furthermore, it suggests prioritizing finding the right home over waiting for even lower rates, as the perfect property may not remain available, and securing a pre-approval is still essential to making a competitive offer.
