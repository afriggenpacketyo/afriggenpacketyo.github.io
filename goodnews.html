          <p>The Kurdish group PKK, which has been engaged in a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced it is laying down its arms and disbanding. This decision follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who stated that the armed struggle has achieved its goals and further progress can be made through political means. The move is seen as a significant step towards peace and stability in the region, and it could influence other Kurdish militias. The Turkish government acknowledges this as a positive development and hopes for a "terror-free Turkey," though the long-term implications for Kurdish rights remain uncertain.
