          <p>This article provides an overview of current interest rates for savings accounts, highlighting the significant difference between the national average and the rates offered by high-yield savings accounts. It explains that while the average rate is quite low, consumers can earn substantially more by choosing high-yield options, which are often available through online banks with lower overhead costs. The text advises savers to compare different accounts, considering not just interest rates but also fees, to maximize their earnings and effectively build an emergency fund.

          <p>The article outlines the current average interest rates for 15-year and 30-year mortgages and refinances, acknowledging the challenging market for borrowers due to higher rates compared to previous years. It suggests that potential relief may come if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes, but emphasizes proactive steps borrowers can take to secure better rates. Key recommendations include strengthening one's credit profile, paying bills on time, and comparing offers from multiple lenders to find the most favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that recent tax legislation under President Trump could create a "golden opportunity" for more investors to qualify for the 0% long-term capital gains tax rate. New deductions for 2025 may lower the taxable income for many, potentially allowing them to sell profitable assets without incurring taxes through a strategy known as "tax-gain harvesting." This involves strategically selling investments during lower-income years to reset the cost basis, which could lead to significant future tax savings for those who qualify.

          <p>A federal jury in Arkansas has ruled in favor of consumers in a class-action lawsuit against State Farm, finding that the insurance carrier systematically underpaid claims for "totaled" vehicles. The lawsuit, led by plaintiff Rose Chadwick, argued that the software used by State Farm unfairly calculated replacement values by assuming customers could negotiate a "haggling discount" from used car dealers. The verdict, which affects 37,000 plaintiffs in the state, has prompted similar legal challenges against insurers in other states.</p>

          <p>This article provides a scientific overview of why landslides and mudslides occur, classifying them into four main types: falls, topples, slides, and flows.

The text also outlines several prevention strategies, including improving surface and subsurface drainage, constructing retaining walls to reinforce slopes, and creating diversion paths for debris.</p>
