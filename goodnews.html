          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced that she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the upcoming election. In a public statement, Harris explained that after careful consideration, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now, though she intends to remain active in politics. Sources close to Harris indicated that she seriously weighed the gubernatorial run but ultimately concluded she could have a greater impact on the national stage. This decision keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential campaign and allows her to focus on campaigning for other Democrats.</p>

          <p>The United States has secured a trade deal with South Korea, setting a 15% tariff on goods, including automotive exports, thereby avoiding a threatened 25% levy. As part of the agreement, South Korea has also committed to purchasing $100 billion in U.S. energy products and making significant investments in the American economy. While President Trump hailed it as a "full and complete trade deal," South Korean officials clarified that sensitive agricultural markets like rice and beef would not be further opened to U.S. imports. The deal aligns South Korea's tariff rate with that of other key trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal was part of a busy day of trades that saw several contenders bolster their bullpens for the playoff push. In other notable moves, the New York Mets added relievers Tyler Rogers and Ryan Helsley, while the Cincinnati Reds acquired Gold Glove third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes from the Pittsburgh Pirates. These trades indicate a heated market for high-impact players as teams position themselves for the final stretch of the season.</p>

          <h2>Hotel Tycoon Surinder Arora Proposes Rival Heathrow Expansion Plan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 20:59:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Arora Group, led by hotel tycoon Surinder Arora, has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's owners. Arora's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which the company claims would be less costly and disruptive by avoiding the need to reroute the M25 motorway. The proposal estimates a cost of under £25 billion and suggests the new runway could be operational by 2035. This development introduces competition into the long-debated expansion project, with the government now set to review both bids to determine the future of the UK's busiest airport.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported strong second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, with revenue climbing 45% year-over-year to $989 million. The company's net income more than doubled, and it saw significant growth in funded customers and total platform assets, which nearly doubled to $279 billion. The performance was driven by strong net deposits and higher valuations in equities and cryptocurrencies, though crypto trading revenue itself was slightly below forecasts. The results reflect Robinhood's ongoing push to expand beyond retail trading into broader wealth management services, successfully attracting new clients and assets from competitors.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning, causing initial concern, but the team later announced the issue was only cramping. Ohtani looked uncomfortable on the mound during a hot and humid night before being removed, though he was able to remain in the game as the designated hitter. Despite the scare being minor, the Dodgers went on to lose the game 5-2, capping a difficult month for the team. The early exit marked another step in Ohtani's gradual return to pitching after recovering from his second Tommy John surgery.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, maintaining the 4.25% to 4.5% range despite public pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The decision was not unanimous, with two board members dissenting in favor of a rate reduction, signaling a potential broadening of support for future cuts. Policymakers are navigating a complex economic landscape, balancing a stable job market against the uncertain effects of new tariffs and persistent inflation. The central bank indicated it is proceeding cautiously, watching for the full impact of the administration's trade policies to become clear before making its next move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a major earthquake, this article explains the science behind how tsunamis are generated, move, and impact coastal areas. A tsunami is typically triggered by a large underwater earthquake, at least a magnitude 6.5, that causes vertical displacement of the seafloor, creating a series of powerful waves. These waves can travel at speeds comparable to a jet airplane in the deep ocean and, while they may be unnoticeable at sea, they slow down and build to dangerous heights as they approach shallower coastal waters. Experts emphasize that even small tsunamis can create extremely powerful currents, making it crucial to heed all official warnings.</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed abundant communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led team observed dense fields of tube worms, clam beds, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme high-pressure, pitch-black environments. These ecosystems are not powered by sunlight but by chemosynthesis, where organisms derive energy from chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest these "chemosynthetic" communities may be more widespread than previously thought and offer new insights into how life adapts.</p>

          <p>The debate over the effects of screen time on children's development continues, with some UK scientists arguing that concrete evidence of widespread harm is lacking. Psychologists point out that much of the research relies on flawed self-reporting and fails to distinguish between different types of screen use, from educational content to passive "doomscrolling." While some studies correlate high screen use with mental health issues, others find little to no link, suggesting factors like loneliness may be more significant. This scientific uncertainty leaves parents with inconsistent guidance, caught between fears of digital harm and the reality of raising children in a technologically integrated world.</p>

The detailed scans revealed intricate designs of mythical creatures and animals, such as leopards and a griffin, showcasing a level of sophistication that would challenge modern tattoo artists. By collaborating with an expert in ancient tattooing techniques, the scientists concluded the tattoos were likely made with a multi-pointed tool and stencils. The findings provide a rare and intimate glimpse into the culture, artistry, and technical skill of these ancient nomadic people.</p>

At 30, he is the most experienced player in a secondary that the team kept intact from last season, a decision Witherspoon sees as a vote of confidence. After joining the Rams mid-season in 2023 and becoming a key starter, he was re-signed to a one-year deal, allowing him to participate fully in offseason preparations. Witherspoon is embracing his role as a mentor and expresses optimism about the defense's potential, citing a powerful front line and an aggressive secondary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent 8.8 magnitude tremor off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula did not cause a catastrophic Pacific-wide tsunami. Scientists explain that the location and directionality of the quake were key factors in mitigating its impact. The main energy of the resulting tsunami was directed into a relatively empty stretch of the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate significantly before reaching populated coastlines. While the area near the epicenter saw damage, this "best-case scenario" for a distant tsunami avoided the widespread destruction seen in past events.</p>
