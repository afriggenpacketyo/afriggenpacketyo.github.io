          <p>The UK government is set to announce the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to shorter journey times and fewer delays, although changes near London are not expected until the 2030s. The redesign, the largest since the 1950s, aims to reduce aviation's climate impact and accommodate new technologies like flying taxis. While ministers highlight smoother takeoffs and landings, concerns are raised about new flight paths affecting previously unaffected residential areas. Industry leaders like Tim Alderslade of Airlines UK support the changes, emphasizing the need for swift action to achieve CO2 reductions, while pressure groups urge prioritization of environmental impacts and community well-being.</p>

          <p>Almost six decades after humans first walked on the moon, space agencies and commercial companies are increasingly focused on lunar missions, envisioning the moon as a gateway to Mars and a hub for scientific research. NASA and ESA are collaborating on the Artemis program to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole, while China and Russia aim to build the International Lunar Research Station by 2035. The moon's abundant resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and rare earth elements, are attracting interest for potential extraction and utilization in future space endeavors. These lunar bases could also serve as transit lounges for astronauts on their way to Mars.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>First-time homebuyers are now taking out mortgages with an average term of 31 years due to persistent affordability challenges, according to UK Finance. This is an increase from 28 years a decade ago, as higher mortgage rates push buyers to extend their repayment periods to lower monthly costs. Despite recent rate decreases, mortgage terms are not shortening, and a significant portion of new mortgages extend into retirement. While long mortgage terms offer manageable repayments, they also mean homeowners may still be making payments later in life.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen has admitted that his collision with George Russell during the Spanish Grand Prix was a mistake caused by frustration. Verstappen received a 10-second penalty for the incident, which occurred when he appeared to drive deliberately into Russell's Mercedes. He stated that the move "was not right and shouldn't have happened," attributing it to heightened emotions. The penalty left Verstappen 49 points behind championship leader Oscar Piastri, and he also received three penalty points on his license, bringing him close to a race ban.</p>

          <h2>Exercise Shown to Improve Cancer Survival Rates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major international trial has demonstrated that an exercise program for colon cancer patients can reduce the risk of dying by a third. The three-year program, which started soon after chemotherapy, aimed to have participants exercise at double the recommended amount for the general population, such as brisk walking for 45-60 minutes three to four times a week. Results showed that 80% of people exercising remained cancer-free after five years, compared to 74% in the other group, with a 37% lower risk of death eight years after initial treatment. Scientists are now investigating whether similar exercise regimes could improve survival for people with other diseases, such as breast cancer.</p>
