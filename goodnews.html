          <p>A decommissioned nuclear plant in Michigan is being revived to power the nation's first small modular reactors (SMRs), signaling a broader shift in public and market sentiment toward nuclear energy. This revival is largely fueled by the massive electricity requirements of AI and data centers, with tech giants like Microsoft and Google investing in nuclear solutions. While proponents highlight the economic benefits and the technology's safety advancements, some experts caution that regulatory frameworks and cost challenges could slow widespread SMR deployment. Public support for nuclear power is growing, however, as the demand for reliable, clean energy intensifies.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Identifies Tone of Voice as the Primary Source of Conflict in Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-05 09:36:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common subject of fights among couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. Research indicates that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the actual words spoken, turning simple questions into perceived accusations. The article suggests that partners can de-escalate potential arguments by becoming more self-aware. It advises individuals to pause and rephrase their statements if their tone is harsh, and for those on the receiving end to calmly ask their partner to try again, thereby interrupting the cycle of negativity.</p>

          <p>Under new leader Zack Polanski, the Green Party of England and Wales is shifting its strategy from that of well-meaning activists to a more confrontational, "eco- populist" force, aiming to capitalize on recent membership growth. Polanski's promise to "pick fights" is part of a broader effort to gain attention and convert momentum into electoral power, even at the risk of alienating some traditional supporters. The party is observing the playbook of right-wing populist movements, hoping to use simple messaging and emotional appeals to resonate with voters disillusioned with mainstream politics. This new boldness represents a significant gamble as the party navigates a fractured political landscape.</p>

          <p>A growing number of schools are implementing "bell-to-bell" cellphone bans, leading to notable changes in student behavior. At Jericho High School in New York, students report being more engaged in class discussions and discovering interests in subjects they previously found boring without the distraction of their phones. While some students admit to separation anxiety, many acknowledge the benefits, including a more vibrant social atmosphere in places like the cafeteria. School administrators support the policy, noting that it encourages direct communication and helps students develop crucial interpersonal skills that were being hindered by constant phone use.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge identifies a single, non-negotiable rule for parents in the digital age: no electronic devices in a child's bedroom overnight. She argues this is crucial for protecting sleep, which is vital for a child's physical and mental health, cognitive development, and emotional regulation. Research shows that devices in the bedroom significantly disrupt adolescent sleep, a key risk factor for issues like depression and anxiety. While acknowledging that implementing this rule with older children can be challenging, Twenge advises parents to be firm and transparent about the decision to prioritize their children's well-being.</p>

Among the most significant changes are the ability to write off 100% of certain new equipment purchases and the immediate deduction of all domestic research and development costs, reversing a previous policy that required amortization. The legislation also revives a more generous calculation for deducting business loan interest and makes the popular 20% Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction permanent. These measures are designed to reduce the tax burden and encourage reinvestment and growth for smaller enterprises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent tax legislation signed by President Trump may impact how individuals approach their year-end charitable giving. Starting in 2026, a new tax break will be available for non-itemizers, making it potentially advantageous for some to delay smaller donations until then. Conversely, higher earners may face a reduction in the value of their charitable deductions in 2026 due to a new deduction "floor" and a cap on the benefit for top-bracket filers. Financial experts suggest that donors, especially those in higher income brackets, might consider accelerating their giving into the current year by using tools like donor-advised funds.
