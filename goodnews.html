        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and halting flights at Midway International Airport. The National Weather Service issued only its second-ever dust storm warning for the Chicago area, surprising residents unaccustomed to such phenomena in an urban setting. The storm, driven by 60 to 70 mph winds over dry farmlands, forced drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and disrupted a high school graduation ceremony in Morris, Illinois. While skies cleared within 30 to 45 minutes, the event left a lasting impression on those who witnessed it, with one resident describing it as "something out of the history books."</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of the Middle East was marked by extravagant displays of honor and respect from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. He secured over $2 trillion in economic investments for the United States, including deals with Boeing and G.E. The New York Times article notes that Trump was treated to lavish welcoming ceremonies, Arabian horses, and glitzy chandeliers, a stark contrast to the backlash he faces at home over tariff policies. Gulf leaders praised Trump's shift towards peace and profit in the region, echoing his campaign slogans and expressing enthusiasm for his leadership. </p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates is increasing its investment and presence in Africa as the United States and China reduce their involvement on the continent. The New York Times article reports that Emirati investments have exploded in recent years, with $110 billion worth of deals announced since 2019. Emirati corporations are investing in ports, renewable energy projects, and critical mineral mines across Africa. This move is part of the Emirates' plan to diversify its economy and increase its influence over global supply chains, as the Trump administration reduces funding and dismantles U.S.A.I.D. programs in the region.</p>

The closures would affect approximately 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The decision remains uncertain as the company has yet to hold talks with labor unions, parts makers, or municipalities hosting the plants.</p>

The South China Morning Post reports that a research team has developed a small rocket named Tianxing-1, which features lift-enhancing wings and adjustable tail fins. Unlike conventional rocket artillery, this guided munition can transition into a glide phase for extended range and maneuverability, but its maximum speed may limit its ability to chase high-speed aircraft or drones.</p>
