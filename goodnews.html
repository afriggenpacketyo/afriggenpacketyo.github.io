          <p>New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel was knocked to the ground while attempting to break up a fight during a joint practice with the Minnesota Vikings. The incident, which occurred on the coach's 50th birthday, was captured on video and circulated on social media, showing Vrabel inserting himself into a scrum between players. No injuries were reported from the altercation, and the practice continued. This is not the first time Vrabel has physically intervened in a practice fight, having previously sustained a bloodied cheek while separating players during a session with the Washington Commanders.</p>

The orchestra's founder, Ahmad Sarmast, highlights that their music is a protest against the Taliban's ban on music and destruction of cultural heritage, which he describes as a violation of human rights. Performing at the Young Euro Classic Festival in Berlin, the ensemble plays traditional Afghan music with themes of social cohesion and support for oppressed women. Their concerts, streamed online, serve as a beacon of hope for a future where arts can once again flourish in their homeland.</p>

          <p>A loud sonic boom was heard across parts of London, Essex, and Cambridgeshire after the Royal Air Force (RAF) scrambled Typhoon fighter jets to intercept a civilian aircraft. The plane, traveling from Nice, had lost contact with air traffic control, prompting the quick reaction alert. The RAF jets broke the sound barrier while en route, creating the explosive sound that startled residents and shook houses. Communications were successfully re-established with the civilian plane, which was then safely escorted to Stansted Airport, where Essex Police confirmed there was no cause for concern.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is evaluating a wide-ranging list of nearly a dozen potential candidates to replace Jerome Powell as the next chair of the Federal Reserve. The contenders include former Fed officials, economists, and market strategists, many of whom have publicly advocated for lowering the central bank's benchmark interest rate. Prominent names on the list include former Governor Kevin Warsh, who has called for significant changes at the institution, and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. The selection comes at a critical time for U.S. monetary policy, with the new chair set to shape the nation's economic direction.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new investment in UnitedHealth, acquiring a stake worth approximately $1.6 billion in the beleaguered health insurance giant. The purchase is notable given UnitedHealth's stock has fallen nearly 50% in 2025 amid a Justice Department investigation into its billing practices and a recent downward revision of its earnings outlook. The move aligns with Buffett's classic value investing strategy of buying into fundamentally strong companies during periods of market difficulty. Following the disclosure, shares of UnitedHealth surged 6% in extended trading, signaling renewed investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is showcasing its advancements in robotics by hosting the world's first-ever humanoid games, an event featuring bipedal robots competing in contests like basketball, kickboxing, and running. The games kicked off with a 1,500-meter race, which was dominated by the H1 humanoid from Hangzhou-based Unitree Robotics. This event highlights China's ambitions to become a leader in the rapidly growing humanoid robotics sector. The winning H1 model, priced at over $90,000, previously gained attention for performing a traditional Chinese folk dance at the country's widely watched Spring Festival Gala.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly being integrated into the multifamily apartment market, automating tasks ranging from maintenance work orders and lease renewals to property tours and investor due diligence. Startups are developing AI-powered virtual agents to interact with prospective tenants and software that can analyze leases to streamline the underwriting process for property acquisitions. While the technology is still in its early stages and expensive to implement, venture capital firms are investing heavily in its potential to centralize operations and increase efficiency for large property management companies and real estate investment trusts.</p>

          <p>A major federal building in Lower Manhattan, which houses offices for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, was evacuated after an unknown white powder was found in the mailroom. The FDNY and hazmat units responded quickly, and sources later confirmed the substance was non-hazardous. The FBI reported that five separate letters contained the powder, and at least two people were exposed without incident. The building at 26 Federal Plaza has recently been a focal point of protests and legal challenges regarding the conditions in which immigrants are held for processing.</p>

          <p>Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein saw its UK sales surge by over 32% in 2024, reaching £2.05 billion and boosting its pre-tax profits by 57% to £38.3 million. Despite this strong performance, the company acknowledged that future consumer spending could be affected by inflation and the rising cost of living. Shein, which is reportedly preparing for a London stock market listing, may also face new import taxes as the UK government reviews a tax exemption for low-value packages. The brand has expanded its UK presence with new offices and has been criticized for its business model's environmental and labor impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Former Chinese Economic Official Urges Removal of Purchase Restrictions to Boost Consumption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 07:30:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former senior Chinese economic official has advised the government to stimulate domestic consumption by removing purchase restrictions on items like property and vehicles. Yin Yanlin, previously with a key Communist Party economic body, argued that such measures constrain demand and that letting affluent groups spend more would create a positive cycle of income growth. He noted that income levels are not the primary barrier, pointing to the significant increase in household savings, which grew by nearly 9.7 trillion yuan (US$1.35 trillion) in the first seven months of 2025, as evidence of untapped spending potential.
