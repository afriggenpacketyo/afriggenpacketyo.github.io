Musk's space program, SpaceX, has launched significantly more tonnage into space than the rest of the world combined in the first half of 2024. The author draws a comparison between Musk and Cecil Rhodes, another businessman, politician, and visionary who shaped the world according to his will, suggesting that Musk's political endeavors may be a minor detail in his overall historical impact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With forecasts predicting above-normal temperatures this summer, Americans are likely to increase their air conditioning use, leading to higher electricity bills. Home electricity bills are expected to reach a 12-year high, averaging $784 for the summer, disproportionately impacting lower-income households. Experts recommend using fans, ensuring AC filters are clean, and setting AC temperatures between 70¬∞F and 78¬∞F. Additional tips include using indoor plants for shade, keeping curtains closed, and unplugging small appliances when not in use, and many utility companies and state governments offer programs and financial assistance to help manage energy costs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Charles Barkley suggested that the "Inside the NBA" hosts may have another show on TNT despite the show's move to ESPN, describing TNT's idea as "stupid." Barkley mentioned that they taped a pilot for a separate show that would air on TNT when they are not on ESPN, but expressed concerns about competing with NBA games and lacking basketball highlights. The new show is intended to make the hosts earn their money from TNT, as they will only be working for ESPN part-time. Barkley gave TNT credit for acknowledging that the pilot was not successful and that they need to figure something else out.</p>

          <p>Lindsey Graham, known for calibrating his pro-Ukraine support to align with Donald Trump, is now pushing for tougher sanctions on Russia. Graham expects the Senate to begin moving his Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, which would impose "bone-breaking sanctions" on Vladimir Putin and a 500% tariff on goods from countries buying Russian oil. Trump's growing frustration with Putin, particularly the bombardment of Ukrainian cities, has seemingly emboldened Graham to advocate for these sanctions. The White House may allow Republicans to "vote their conscience" on the bill, but Trump's final approval is still needed for it to advance.</p>

          <p>Credit card issuers can lower credit limits without warning due to various factors, including inactivity, a drop in credit score, high balances, missed payments, or changes in income. Issuers are legally required to notify customers after the fact but do not need prior permission. This action can negatively impact credit scores by increasing credit utilization, and customers should contact their issuer for an explanation, request a credit limit increase, and monitor their credit reports. If dissatisfied, customers can consider switching to another card with better limits and perks (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordered Lindsey Hill, the woman who accused former Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer of sexual assault, to pay more than $300,000 for violating the terms of a settlement agreement. Bauer and Hill had settled dueling lawsuits two years ago, with neither party paying any money to the other. However, Hill later claimed on social media that Bauer "handed back an insurance sum to me that was meant for him in order for me to drop my countersuit," leading Bauer to sue her for violating the settlement agreement. Hill did not contest the suit, resulting in a default victory for Bauer.</p>
