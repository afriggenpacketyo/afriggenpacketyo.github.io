          <h2>Switzerland's Landslide Prediction Success Story Offers Lessons for Global Preparedness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 12:59:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Switzerland has achieved significant success in predicting landslides through advanced technologies and continuous monitoring of environmental factors. The recent landslide in Blatten, where early warnings allowed for evacuation, highlights the effectiveness of these measures. Swiss authorities maintain hazard risk maps for every community affected by hazards, mandated by federal regulations. Despite this success, predicting landslides remains a challenge globally, especially in mountainous regions vulnerable to climate change. International efforts, such as the UN's Early Warnings for All initiative, aim to improve global preparedness and save lives from natural hazards. The fact that people were able to evacuate the town in time points to the fact that we are moving in the right direction.</p>

She humorously recounted her hospital visit, maintaining a positive attitude despite the incident. The actress, who recently stepped away from Hollywood, pondered the possibility of a spiritual element to her out-of-body experiences.

          <p>President Donald Trump will hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh, following his announcement of a "partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are eager to learn more details about the structure of the deal, which Trump claims will keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh and involve a $14 billion investment from Nippon. U.S. Steel has described the deal as a "merger" where it will become a "wholly owned subsidiary" of Nippon Steel North America. The original offer was made before President Joe Biden rejected the deal on national security grounds.

          <p>The UK Treasury announced the sale of its final shares in NatWest Group, marking the end of government ownership nearly two decades after the 2008 financial crisis bailout. The government spent ¬£45 billion to acquire an 84% stake in RBS, now part of NatWest Group, to prevent its collapse. Experts debate whether banks are now safer and whether taxpayers would need to step in again during a future financial crisis. The governor of the Bank of England says there are now alternative methods of rescuing a failing bank, including buying assets and providing emergency cash, which would allow them to handle bank crises without using public money.
