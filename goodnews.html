          <p>The UK and the EU are pursuing a stronger relationship through new agreements on fisheries, trade, and security, as British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosts EU leaders in London. The agreements aim to reduce bureaucracy and boost the British economy, with eased customs checks on food and plant products expected to significantly benefit the UK. A new defense and security pact is also in the works, potentially allowing the UK defense industry to participate in the EU's defense fund. Starmer views these agreements as a starting point for increased cooperation, though some conservative opponents have criticized the move towards further integration with the EU.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing new regulations to oversee the rapidly growing buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector, addressing concerns about potential debt traps for consumers. The proposals require BNPL firms to conduct upfront checks to ensure borrowers can repay their loans and simplify the refund process. Consumers will also have the option to file complaints with the Financial Ombudsman, a service designed to resolve disputes between consumers and financial service providers. The move aims to bring stability and protection to shoppers in what has been described as a 'wild west' financial landscape.</p>

          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland saw centrist candidates halting or slowing down hard-right breakthroughs, though discontent with mainstream parties remains prevalent. In Romania, Nicusor Dan, an independent mayor, defeated George Simion, a Trump-aligned nationalist, confounding expectations of a sharp turn to the right. Poland's election was less decisive, with liberal Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski securing a spot in a runoff against nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, indicating a fragmented political landscape and growing support for hard-right candidates. Both elections highlight a move away from established parties and the rise of nationalist sentiments in Eastern Europe.</p>

          <p>China has introduced revised regulations to enforce frugality and reduce waste among party and government bodies, targeting white elephant projects, lavish meals, and excessive use of official vehicles. The new rules, jointly issued by the Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council, emphasize diligence and thrift, urging officials to avoid extravagance. Observers have described this round of tightening as the most detailed and stringent since the austerity campaign began 12 years ago. Analysts suggest the move reflects Beijing's growing concern over mounting debts and the need to curb wasteful spending at all levels of government.</p>
