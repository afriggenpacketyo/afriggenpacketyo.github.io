          <p>Nottingham Forest has sacked head coach Nuno Espirito Santo after a 20-month tenure that saw the club achieve its highest Premier League finish in decades and qualify for European competition. The dismissal follows a period of public friction between Nuno and club owner Evangelos Marinakis, with the coach recently stating their relationship had deteriorated. Despite success on the pitch, internal disagreements, reportedly centered on transfer policies, created an untenable situation. The club is already in talks to appoint a successor, marking another significant change in leadership for the team.</p>

Thames Valley police have announced that the measures will include a round-the-clock police presence, a temporary airspace restriction, and the deployment of police drones to act as an "eye in the sky." This order will prohibit non-police drones and small aircraft from flying in the protected area during the visit. The large-scale operation reflects the high-profile nature of the event, which is also expected to draw significant protests in London and near Windsor.</p>

          <p>England Test cricket coach Brendon McCullum has expressed frustration with the public perception of his team's aggressive playing style, often dubbed "Bazball." He stated that characterizing the approach as simply swinging the bat hard without thought is "disrespectful" to the hard work and strategic determination of the players and staff. McCullum clarified that the core philosophy is not about reckless play but about creating an environment where players can perform without being restricted by the pressure of international cricket. He emphasized that the mindset is about enabling talent to flourish, not just a rigid focus on high-risk, high-reward tactics.</p>

          <p>An Indiana bankruptcy lawyer named Mark S. Zuckerberg has filed a lawsuit against Meta, alleging the company has repeatedly and negligently suspended his Facebook accounts because his name is the same as its CEO. The attorney claims his business and personal accounts have been shut down at least nine times over eight years, disrupting his law practice and costing him thousands in advertising. He argues that the platform mistakes him for an impersonator of CEO Mark E. Zuckerberg, despite his identity being genuine. In response to the lawsuit, a Meta spokesperson confirmed the lawyer's account had been disabled in error and has since been reinstated.</p>

          <p>Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere has won a second term in office after his Labour Party emerged as the victor in a closely contested parliamentary election. The Labour Party, along with its left-leaning allies, secured a narrow majority of 87 seats in the 169-seat parliament. The election campaign focused on domestic issues such as the rising cost of living and the quality of public services, as well as the stability of incumbent leadership amid international turmoil. While the right-wing populist Progress Party saw a significant increase in its support, it was not enough to unseat the current governing coalition.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team has made a solid start to its World Cup qualifying campaign, securing four points from its first two away games. A 2-0 victory over Belarus followed a hard-fought goalless draw against Denmark, placing Scotland in a strong position within their group. Manager Steve Clarke emphasized the importance of building on this foundation, particularly the team's defensive record of three consecutive clean sheets. The positive results have raised hopes among supporters that Scotland can end its 28-year absence from the World Cup, with crucial home games scheduled for the upcoming months.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Argues Recent Market Fears About Major Tech Companies Were Overblown</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that many recent pessimistic theories circulating on Wall Street, particularly regarding major tech companies, have proven to be unfounded. He highlighted concerns about a potential breakup of Alphabet, Amazon's cloud services falling behind, and Apple's AI strategy, noting that all three companies' stocks have since recovered from these fears. Cramer argued that the market often overhypes negativity and fails to acknowledge when initial concerns do not materialize. He also expressed confidence in Nvidia's continued strong performance, suggesting a recent price target cut by an analyst will likely be seen as a mistake in hindsight. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-standing succession drama within the Murdoch family has concluded with a $3.3 billion settlement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over the media empire, including Fox Corp. and News Corp. The agreement involves his three older siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—relinquishing their shares and future roles in the family trust. This resolution follows patriarch Rupert Murdoch's efforts to ensure the conservative direction of his companies after his death, a vision he felt was best stewarded by Lachlan. The settlement establishes new trusts, effectively buying out the siblings who held more moderate or liberal views, thus preventing a future power struggle.</p>

          <p>China has made substantial progress in combating pollution over the last two decades, driven by a strategy of industrial decarbonization rather than deindustrialization. According to environmental research, the country has seen significant improvements in both air and water quality. From 2015 to 2022, the average annual level of PM2.5 air pollutants fell by over 35%, a reduction comparable to what the United States achieved over thirty years. This environmental turnaround is attributed to the large-scale deployment of cutting-edge green technology, massive investments in green infrastructure, and the implementation of real-time environmental monitoring systems.</p>

The book details his public meltdown, his firing from "Two and a Half Men," and his 2015 HIV diagnosis, which he says was a "tremendous relief" to finally disclose publicly.

          <p>Staff at Angel Island State Park recently filmed a coyote swimming across the Raccoon Strait, a deep-water channel separating the island from the mainland in the San Francisco Bay. This sighting provides a fascinating glimpse into how a budding population of coyotes has established itself on the island over the past decade. Researchers believe the original breeding pair first paddled the one-mile distance against a strong current in 2017, filling a new predator niche. The video has sparked public curiosity, with park officials reassuring people that coyotes are strong swimmers and that they are working to educate visitors on how to coexist with the wildlife.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has upheld the city's decision to designate Marilyn Monroe's former Brentwood home as a historic cultural monument, saving it from demolition for a second time. The homeowners had filed a legal challenge against the landmark status, arguing they had the right to raze the property, which they purchased in 2023. This house is the only one Monroe ever owned herself and is where she died in 1962, making it a site of significant cultural interest for fans and preservationists. The ruling marks a potential end to a long-running dispute over the property's historical value versus the owners' development plans.</p>
