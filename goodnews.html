          <p>Major corporations including Amazon, Meta, and warehouse REIT Prologis have co-founded the Sustainable Concrete Buyers Alliance (SCoBA) to address the significant carbon footprint of concrete manufacturing. The initiative aims to use the members' collective purchasing power to create demand for low-carbon concrete, thereby encouraging producers to invest in expensive decarbonization technologies. By establishing a 'book-and-claim' system, the alliance will allow companies to purchase environmental attribute certificates for sustainable concrete without needing to physically ship the material over long distances. This market-driven approach is designed to accelerate the adoption of greener building materials across the industry.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, "Cat on the Road to Findout," singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam, also known as Cat Stevens, explores his lifelong spiritual journey and complex public identity. The artist discusses his early rise to stardom, his subsequent conversion to Islam, and his nearly 30-year departure from the music industry, which he initially believed was forbidden by his new faith. He now reconciles his past and present by performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens, viewing it as a complete picture of who he is. The article also touches on his controversial 1989 comments regarding Salman Rushdie, which he attributes to a misjudged attempt at humor.</p>

          <p>During his hosting appearance on "Saturday Night Live," musician Bad Bunny humorously addressed threats from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem regarding his upcoming Super Bowl halftime performance. Noem had warned that immigration agents would be present and that only Americans should attend. In his monologue, Bad Bunny joked that everyone, "even Fox News," was happy about his performance, before delivering a message in Spanish celebrating the indelible contribution of Latinos to the United States. The artist has previously been critical of the Trump administration's immigration policies and cited fears of raids as a reason for excluding the U.S. from a recent tour.</p>

The actor clarified that he never intended to fully retire but chose to step away from one type of work to focus on other pursuits, including making fiddles. The new film, which tells the story of a man in self-exile, was a collaborative project that drew the elder Day-Lewis back to his craft. He reflects on his career, the pressures of fame, and how finding acting in boarding school provided an illuminated, alternative world.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, musician Miley Cyrus opened up about her personal growth, including her journey with sobriety and the making of her latest album, "Something Beautiful." Cyrus explained that being sober allows her to be fully present and prepared for her work, a significant change from her more turbulent post-"Hannah Montana" years. She also revealed that a song on the new album served as a peace offering to her estranged father, Billy Ray Cyrus, helping them to reconnect through their shared language of music. At 32, Cyrus expresses a strong sense of self-acceptance and satisfaction with her life and career.</p>

At Eglin Air Force Base, AI systems are learning complex combat maneuvers, with an AI-piloted F-16 already demonstrating its capabilities in a dogfight. This strategic shift is driven by the necessity to counter the growing air power of nations like China, with officials aiming to deploy up to 1,000 AI aircraft eventually. While a human will remain in control of lethal decisions for now, experts believe military pressure may lead to greater autonomy for these systems in the future.</p>

          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common source of conflict for couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. He explains that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry significant emotional weight and can make simple questions feel like accusations, leading to escalation. The article suggests that partners should practice self-awareness, pausing to rephrase when their tone is harsh and owning the mistake. For those on the receiving end, it is recommended to calmly ask for the statement to be repeated in a different way, interrupting the cycle of defensiveness without escalating the argument.</p>

In her book, she argues that this single, straightforward rule is crucial for the physical and mental health of children, whose developing brains rely on sleep for cognitive growth and emotional regulation. Research shows that a majority of adolescents miss out on sleep due to late-night device use, a habit linked to increased risks of depression and anxiety. Twenge advises parents to be firm in implementing this rule, even with older teens, by explaining its importance for their well-being.</p>

Using an income-replacement model, the bank estimates that a household earning $90,000 annually would need approximately $700,000 by age 65 to maintain its lifestyle. The analysis indicates that a seven-figure savings goal is typically only necessary for households with current incomes of $125,000 or more.
