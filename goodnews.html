          <p>A significant fire occurred at a Chevron oil refinery in El Segundo, California, one of the largest on the U.S. West Coast. The blaze, which followed reports of an explosion, prompted an active response from Chevron's fire department and emergency services. The company confirmed that all personnel and contractors were accounted for and that no injuries resulted from the incident. As of Friday, no evacuation orders were issued for nearby residents, and facility monitoring systems detected no dangerous exceedances in the surrounding area.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stated that while the artificial intelligence sector is currently experiencing an "industrial bubble," the underlying technology is real and will ultimately provide enormous benefits to society. Speaking at Italian Tech Week, he compared the current hype to past bubbles like the dot-com era, noting that both good and bad ideas are receiving funding. However, Bezos argued that such industrial bubbles can be beneficial, as the innovations from the eventual winners lead to significant societal progress, much like the biotech boom of the 1990s produced life-saving drugs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's head coach, Thomas Tuchel, has omitted Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham from the latest national squad, signaling a new era where player reputation does not guarantee selection. Despite Bellingham's desire to be included after recovering from shoulder surgery, Tuchel prioritized players who have been performing consistently, particularly after a strong win against Serbia. This decision underscores Tuchel's philosophy that the team's success should not depend on a single player and that all squad members must earn their place based on current form. The manager aims to build a resilient team dynamic ahead of the next World Cup.</p>

The organizer, citing religious teachings on compassion, stated that the shooter's family are also victims of the tragedy and are now facing significant hardship. The attack, which authorities believe was motivated by anti-Mormon hatred, killed four people and injured eight others before the shooter died in a firefight with police. The fundraiser has garnered substantial support, with many donors expressing forgiveness and solidarity with the family.</p>

Jones has successfully stepped in for the injured Brock Purdy, leading the team to a 4-1 record despite numerous injuries plaguing the roster.

          <h2>Digital Price Tags in Grocery Stores Spark Debate Over Dynamic Pricing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electronic shelf labels are increasingly replacing paper price tags in major U.S. grocery stores like Walmart and Kroger, allowing for rapid, centralized price updates. While retailers claim the technology improves efficiency and helps reduce food waste by enabling quicker markdowns on perishable items, some lawmakers express concern it could lead to "dynamic pricing." Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, worry that stores could use the technology to surge prices during periods of high demand. However, retailers and academic studies currently suggest that surge pricing is not occurring, as it would risk alienating customers.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team began their Women's World Cup campaign with a decisive 10-wicket victory over South Africa. The English bowlers dismantled the South African batting lineup, dismissing them for just 69 runs, their third-lowest total in one-day international history.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have observed a free-floating rogue planet outside our solar system consuming surrounding gas and dust at an astonishing rate, described as a massive "growth spurt." The planet, named Cha 1107-7626, is accreting material at a rate of six billion tonnes per second, the strongest ever recorded for a planetary-mass object. This discovery, made using the European Southern Observatory, challenges previous understandings of planetary behavior and blurs the line between planets and stars. The findings suggest that magnetic activity, previously thought to be exclusive to stars, may play a role in the formation of some rogue planets.</p>

          <p>This article explores the deep-rooted cumbia culture in Monterrey, Mexico, where the Colombian music genre has been kept alive by "sonideros," or street DJs. Originating in migrant neighborhoods, this subculture gave birth to unique styles like "cumbia rebajada," a slowed-down version of the music. For decades, cumbia was associated with gang life in low-income areas, but it has since evolved into a cherished cultural identity. After a period of intense cartel violence forced the scene indoors, cumbia has returned to the streets, with dance groups working to reclaim and celebrate their heritage.</p>

          <p>After nearly 34 years, a major breakthrough has been announced in the infamous 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders, where four teenage girls were killed. New ballistic and DNA technology has linked the crime to Robert Eugene Brashers, a serial killer who died by suicide in 1999. The connection was made after advances in a national ballistics database matched a shell casing from the scene to another unsolved murder. This development brings long-awaited answers to the victims' families and is expected to fully exonerate two men who were wrongly convicted for the crime based on coerced confessions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is under intense pressure from both industry groups and public health advocates as he decides whether to sign a bill banning the sale of cookware containing PFAS, or "forever chemicals." The legislation would make California the seventh state to enact such a ban, but cookware manufacturers and some celebrity chefs are lobbying against it, claiming it will harm restaurants and consumers. Supporters of the bill, including actor Mark Ruffalo, argue it is a necessary step to reduce exposure to the toxic compounds, which are linked to serious health problems and do not break down in the environment.</p>
