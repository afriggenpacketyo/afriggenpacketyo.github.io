          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg announced that airplane deliveries to China will resume next month after a pause due to trade tensions. Ortberg stated that China has indicated they will take deliveries, with the first shipments occurring next month. Boeing, a major U.S. exporter, has been paying tariffs on imported components for its Dreamliner planes made in South Carolina. However, these tariffs are largely recouped when the planes are exported, mitigating the overall impact on the company's financials. This resumption of deliveries is expected to help Boeing ramp up its Max production, signaling a positive outlook for the company's operations and trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has partially reversed its decision to revoke Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification, granting the school 30 days to demonstrate compliance. This decision follows Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's earlier announcement to terminate Harvard's SEVP certification, which would have impacted nearly 7,000 international students. Harvard sued to block the policy, arguing that students were being used as pawns in a retaliatory campaign, and a federal judge issued a temporary order barring the revocation. DHS officials stated that the revocation was necessary because Harvard failed to provide requested information about international students, including disciplinary records.</p>

          <p>An op-ed challenges Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's claim that U.S. export controls on AI chips are a failure, arguing that these controls are about national security, not Nvidia's commercial interests. The author contends that China's drive for technological independence predates the 2022 restrictions and is fueled by substantial state support. While Huang expressed concerns about Nvidia's market share decline in China due to these restrictions, the author notes that Nvidia's overall revenue has surged, driven by strong demand in other markets. The piece concludes that U.S. semiconductor policy aims to protect America's strategic edge in a high-stakes geopolitical contest, even if it means sacrificing some market access for individual companies.

          <p>The United States is considering a potential reduction in troop deployment to South Korea as it assesses its regional strategy to counter China. While 28,500 U.S. troops are currently stationed in South Korea to defend against North Korea, the U.S. aims to optimize its forces across the Indo-Pacific to deter potential Chinese aggression, particularly towards Taiwan. No final decision has been made, but any future troop presence would be designed to address both North Korean and Chinese threats.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve maintaining current rates, savers can maximize returns using certificate of deposit (CD) accounts. Short-term CDs currently offer more competitive Annual Percentage Yields (APY) than long-term options due to market uncertainty. Experts suggest that short-term CDs (six to nine months) are more attractive for higher rates and earlier maturity dates. Long-term CDs may be suitable for those seeking certainty and fixed growth, but they are generally riskier in the current environment. A CD ladder strategy, using various maturity dates, can also be beneficial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has sided with a Utah railway project, limiting the scope of environmental impact studies required for federal agency-regulated projects. The 8-0 ruling overturned a lower court decision that had halted the railway, which is intended to transport crude oil, stating that the environmental review was too limited. The court held that agencies need only consider the environmental effects of the project at hand and not potential future or geographically separate projects. This ruling is seen as a setback for environmentalists and a boost for infrastructure development.</p>

          <p>An article argues that the recent court ruling striking down President Trump‚Äôs tariffs is not judicial overreach, but a vindication of the rule of law. The ruling is based on the Constitution, which delegates tariff power to Congress, and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which the court found did not authorize Trump's tariff orders. The author points out that the lawsuit was brought by states acting as a check on federal power and that the Court of International Trade was specifically created to handle trade disputes. The author concludes that the ruling reinforces the importance of checks on presidential power.</p>

Cloud providers remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of the data center revenue. The company's data center division continues to surge as companies, countries, and cloud providers snap up Nvidia graphics processors, or GPUs, for artificial intelligence software. However, U.S. export controls are hindering Nvidia's sales in China, a market that CEO Jensen Huang estimates could be worth $50 billion. Looking ahead, Nvidia is focused on Blackwell and AI inference, with surging demand expected for GPUs used in AI models serving millions of customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Stocks Rise After Court Blocks Trump's Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Stock markets rose following a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Trump's tariffs, as investors were encouraged that it could slow momentum for a trade war. The S&P 500 index increased, and Nvidia's strong earnings report also boosted the market. However, markets elsewhere were mixed, and bond markets experienced volatility. Analysts noted that the court ruling reduces uncertainty about extreme tariffs but could add short-term challenges for U.S. businesses, as the White House maintains it has other avenues for pursuing tariffs.
