          <p>Lowe's reported its first-quarter earnings, slightly missing sales expectations but beating earnings estimates, and reaffirmed its full-year forecast, supported by growing sales to home professionals. CEO Marvin Ellison attributed the company's resilience to investments in stores, technology, and customer service, which helped navigate near-term market uncertainties and housing market headwinds. While demand from do-it-yourself customers has slowed due to high interest rates, Lowe's is focusing on attracting more sales from professionals, including the acquisition of Artisan Design Group for $1.3 billion. The company expects full-year sales to range from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion, with comparable sales flat to up 1% year over year.</p>

          <p>Chinese robotics developers showcased their latest products at an exhibition in Guangzhou, amidst a competitive market reminiscent of the early days of the electric vehicle industry in China. Many firms plan to achieve large-scale production this year, buoyed by recent tariff reductions between the US and China. Li-Gong Industrial aims to produce 1,000 units of its Lidian D1 humanoid robot, initially for manufacturing applications like car assembly, with plans to expand into service roles in the future. Shenzhen DX Intech Technology, which develops robotic receptionists and tour guides, is also expanding production and eyeing overseas markets, particularly the US, due to lowered tariffs.</p>

          <p>Boston Red Sox pitcher Walker Buehler was ejected from a game against the New York Mets after directing expletives at the home plate umpire, Mike Estabrook, over a ball call. Buehler expressed his frustration with the call, leading to his ejection and that of manager Alex Cora, who defended his player and made contact with first base umpire Laz Diaz. Diaz, the crew chief, stated that Buehler was ejected for leaving the mound to argue the call, while Cora expressed surprise at Buehler's ejection, suggesting he wished Estabrook had ejected him instead. Despite the incident, the Red Sox won the game 2-0.</p>

He was arrested last week and charged with grievous bodily harm for allegedly attacking a music producer with a tequila bottle. The judge set a ¬£5m security fee as a condition of his bail.</p>

          <p>Vani Hari, formerly known as the Food Babe, has transitioned from dispensing diet and fitness tips to becoming a significant figure in the Trump administration's healthy-food agenda. Hari, once a Democratic activist, now advocates for eliminating petroleum-based food dyes and promotes the 'Make America Healthy Again' movement, gaining influence within the administration with support from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Despite facing criticism from scientists and food industry executives who accuse her of spreading pseudoscience and scare tactics, Hari's ascent has garnered support from millions of social media followers. Her involvement highlights a shift in the food-policy landscape, with Trump supporters championing organic produce and seeking to remove ultraprocessed foods from schools.</p>

          <p>Four British former special forces soldiers set a record by climbing Mount Everest in under five days without acclimatizing on the mountain, using a high-speed expedition aided by xenon gas. The team, including a UK government minister, summited the world's highest peak early on Wednesday, using xenon to pre-acclimatize to low oxygen at high altitudes. The use of xenon remains disputed within the mountaineering industry, with some criticizing it, but organizers say it made the fast ascent possible. The team reached the 8,849-meter summit after starting their climb on May 16, taking four days and approximately 18 hours.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent trip to the Middle East has been lauded for its focus on using the American private sector as an instrument of national power and for avoiding traditional nation-building projects. Trump brought captains of American industry to meetings with Gulf states, positioning the U.S. as a commercial and strategic partner rather than just an arms merchant or human rights scold. In exchange, Americans are expected to benefit from hundreds of billions of dollars in new investment. Trump's willingness to navigate Middle East politics without being constrained by domestic concerns has allowed him to take actions that other presidents could not.</p>

          <p>Japan's tourism sector experienced a surge in April, with foreign visitors reaching a single-month record of 3.91 million, according to government data. The increase was driven by the weak yen, high travel demand during the cherry blossom season, and the Easter holidays overseas. From January to April, Japan welcomed approximately 14.45 million foreign arrivals, exceeding the 11.60 million recorded in the same period in 2024. Authorities are struggling to manage overcrowding in popular areas and encourage tourists to explore the countryside, with the number of foreign visitors this year potentially reaching 45 million or 46 million.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that people should not be able to camp without permission. The ruling, which interprets the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, is expected to reignite the debate over public access to land in England. Judges stated that the act's provision for "open-air recreation" naturally includes camping. The Dartmoor National Park Association welcomed the ruling, emphasizing the importance of responsible access, while campaigners called for extending the right to wild camp to other parts of England.</p>
