          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board expresses support for Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, as he confronts the rising popularity of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The AfD, known for its extreme views and ties to Russia, poses a significant threat to German democracy, having gained alarming support in recent elections. Merz faces the daunting task of leading a broad coalition government and addressing critical issues like migration and economic stagnation, which have fueled the AfD's appeal. The editorial emphasizes the importance of Merz's success in demonstrating the ability of mainstream parties to counter extremism and deliver tangible results for German voters.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration intensifies efforts to collect on student loans, borrowers are urged to understand the difference between delinquency and default to avoid severe consequences such as wage garnishments. Delinquent borrowers should contact their loan servicer to request forbearance and enroll in affordable repayment plans, including income-driven repayment options. Borrowers in default can contact the government's Default Resolution Group to explore options like loan rehabilitation. With millions at risk of default, proactive measures are crucial to protect borrowers' credit scores and financial stability.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously overturned a federal appeals court ruling in *Barnes v. Felix*, a case involving police violence, criticizing the lower court's narrow focus on the moment of the threat rather than considering the totality of the circumstances. The case involves an officer who shot and killed a driver after jumping onto a moving vehicle. The Supreme Court's decision emphasizes that courts must consider the events leading up to a shooting to determine whether the use of force was justified from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, but the Supreme Court did not ultimately decide the case itself.</p>

          <p>Financial advisors are cautioning that long-term care costs can be substantial, often exceeding $100,000, and many Americans are unprepared for this expense. Many types of insurance do not cover these costs, and Medicare does not cover most expenses. They recommend considering long-term care insurance policies, particularly hybrid policies that combine life insurance with long-term care benefits. They also advise proactive planning and discussions with family members about long-term care needs and logistics well in advance of needing care.</p>

Trump emphasized points reflecting Israeli priorities, such as condemning Hamas, urging Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, and warning Iran.

          <p>With the NBA draft approaching, a columnist argues that the Los Angeles Lakers should prioritize drafting a mature, experienced player who can handle the temptations of money and fame. The columnist points to economic shifts in the league, such as capped rookie contracts and the NCAA's NIL policy, which have changed the landscape for young players. The piece suggests that the Lakers should focus on drafting a 24-year-old college graduate with NIL money in the bank and a good head on his shoulders, rather than solely focusing on raw talent and potential.</p>
