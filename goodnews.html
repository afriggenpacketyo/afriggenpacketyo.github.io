        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline of over 34% in May, marking the steepest drop in more than five years, attributed to the effects of tariffs and trade tensions. Despite this significant decrease in U.S.-bound shipments, China's overall exports rose by 4.8% due to increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, the European Union, and Africa. Imports also plunged by 3.4%, reflecting sluggish domestic demand, while the country's total trade surplus increased by 25% to $103.2 billion. Renewed trade talks are expected to take place in London between Chinese and U.S. officials to address ongoing disputes and potential violations of the Geneva trade agreement. </p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, across English waters to protect marine life and the seabed. The proposal would increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 in the UK's offshore areas already designated as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This announcement comes as the UN Ocean Conference begins in France, with warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the damage caused by bottom trawling.
