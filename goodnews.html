        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, President Donald Trump's approach to his counterpart, Xi Jinping, may act as a stabilizing force in the relationship. While US officials have criticized China's trade practices, Trump has avoided directly antagonizing Xi or challenging Beijing's core interests. Analysts suggest that Trump's control over his administration, including China hawks, makes leader-to-leader diplomacy crucial in shaping ties. Tensions are expected to persist due to structural competition, but Trump's direct involvement could prevent further escalation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has clarified that a $100,000 fee imposed on H-1B visas applies only to new applicants living abroad. The fee is for those outside the U.S. who are not current H-1B visa holders and whose petitions were filed on or after September 21. The fee does not apply to visa applicants already in the U.S. filing to change their visa status. The White House had previously indicated the fee would apply to all new H-1B visa applicants, but now it's clear that some specialized workers are exempt.</p>

          <p>A study by Schroders finds that 90% of working Americans plan to claim Social Security benefits before age 70, despite financial advice to delay for higher monthly payments. Many retirees face a shortfall in savings and need immediate income from Social Security. Concerns about the future of Social Security also influence the decision to claim early. A majority of Americans lack knowledge about Social Security and its role in retirement planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paybis co-founder Konstantin Vasilenko argues that stablecoins are fulfilling the role of digital cash, transforming how companies transact globally. Businesses are increasingly offering customers the ability to buy goods and services in crypto, driving adoption. Vasilenko notes that stablecoin transactions are now used more for payments than trading. He also praises crypto regulation, such as the EU's MiCA framework, for boosting consumer trust. Vasilenko believes that governments resisting crypto will eventually regulate it, as it represents the next logical step in how people and businesses handle money. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched its own web browser called Atlas, aiming to challenge Google's dominance in the browser and search markets. Atlas uses ChatGPT at its core, allowing users to chat with websites, find products, and automate tasks. CEO Sam Altman envisions a future where internet access is through chat experiences and web browsers. Atlas includes typical browser features like tabs and bookmarks, but replaces the search bar with a ChatGPT chat box. The company is co-designing its own AI chips and has received backing from Nvidia.</p>

          <h2>Netflix Shares Drop After Earnings Miss Due to Brazilian Tax Dispute</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix shares fell after the company missed third-quarter earnings estimates, citing a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities. The company incurred a $619 million expense related to a 10% tax on payments made by Brazilian entities to operations outside the country. Revenue rose 17%, in line with expectations, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments, and increased ad revenue. Netflix projects revenue to rise 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Despite the earnings miss, Netflix reported its best ad sales quarter ever and is on track to more than double ad revenue this year.</p>

          <p>Several SUVs are expected to experience significant price drops in late 2025 due to factors such as inventory clearance and increased market competition. The Jaguar F-Pace may see price drops due to dealerships clearing inventory and Jaguar's transition to an all-electric lineup. The Mercedes-Benz GLA is losing market appeal due to a shift toward electric vehicles. The Range Rover Sports may see price drops due to increased competition and potential updates in the latest model. The BMW iX electric SUV has seen notable depreciation due to stiff competition among electric vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>
