          <p>Primary school teacher Alice Cole returned to work part-time after having her first child and emphasizes the importance of flexible working arrangements for new parents in addressing teacher recruitment and retention issues. She believes offering flexibility allows teachers to confidently balance their personal and professional lives, which is especially crucial given the recent data showing a decline in the number of new teachers entering the profession. Computer science teacher Sam Alner highlights the challenge of balancing work-life balance and the potential for burnout, especially in disadvantaged schools that struggle to recruit teachers in specialist subjects. Overall, the article underscores the need for schools to offer flexible working options to retain experienced staff and attract new talent, ensuring that all students have access to quality education. The future of education hinges on supporting teachers' needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have discovered that the rare mineral tellurium can be used to create an artificial retina, restoring sight in blind animals and providing them with the ability to see infrared light. The study, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, details how tellurium nanowire implants were used in a biocompatible device to restore vision in mice and a monkey. Tellurium's photoelectric properties allow it to convert visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, making it a potential replacement for damaged photoreceptor cells in the retina. This breakthrough offers hope for treating human blindness and potentially enhancing vision beyond normal capabilities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, offering a fresh approach to China's deepening demographic challenges. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong argue that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. The findings are particularly relevant as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study also found that traditional expectations placing the burden on women to perform most childcare duties persist in China and other East Asian countries, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>

          <p>An ancient writing system from Zambia, Sona or Tusona, is being reclaimed after it was nearly erased by colonialism. Originating from the Chokwe, Luchazi, and Luvale people, Sona involves geometric patterns carrying mathematical principles, messages about nature, and instructions on community life. The original custodians and teachers of Sona were women, and their knowledge is now being used to corroborate research. The Women's History Museum of Zambia is documenting and archiving women's histories and indigenous knowledge, aiming to piece together a fragmented cultural heritage.</p>
