Ishiba aims to boost rice production but faces challenges like potential oversupply and opposition from lawmakers with agricultural interests. He has also released reserve rice to lower prices and proposed boosting rice exports to stabilize farmer incomes, while opposing consumption tax cuts proposed by opposition parties.
