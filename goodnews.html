        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to meet with President Trump, a significant event as Nvidia recently became the first company to close with a market valuation over $4 trillion. The meeting's agenda is unconfirmed but is expected to address U.S. export controls on AI chips, which have impacted Nvidia's sales to China. The Trump administration has been reviewing these policies, creating uncertainty for the chipmaker's access to the substantial Chinese market. The discussion will likely be crucial for navigating future trade and national security regulations affecting the tech industry.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss has increased its full-year sales and earnings guidance, citing strong business performance that helps offset the impact of new tariffs. The denim company plans to absorb the initial $25-30 million in tariff-related costs, but this strategy may change depending on evolving U.S. trade policies. The company's updated forecast, which beat analyst expectations, assumes a 30% tariff on its minimal China production and a 10% tariff elsewhere. Strong consumer demand and a shift towards premium, full-price products are providing a buffer against these new economic headwinds.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high of over $113,000, continuing its upward momentum as investors showed increased appetite for risk assets. The rally was fueled in part by a significant liquidation of short positions, totaling around $318 million in a 24-hour period, which forced more buying activity. Other cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, also saw gains, with Ether and Solana rising alongside crypto-related stocks like Coinbase and Riot Platforms. The sustained price action is supported by strong institutional inflows into bitcoin ETFs and optimism surrounding potential stablecoin legislation. (not investment advice)</p>
