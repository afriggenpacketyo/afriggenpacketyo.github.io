          <h2>Enhanced Mammography Shows Promise for Detecting Breast Cancer in Dense Tissue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 12:58:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in The Lancet indicates that contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is more effective than ultrasound in detecting invasive cancers in women with dense breast tissue. The study, conducted across multiple sites in the UK, found that CEM identified three times as many tumors as ultrasound and detected tumors smaller in size, potentially leading to earlier and more effective treatment. While MRI scans showed similar detection rates, CEM is noted as more cost-effective and accessible, potentially becoming a standard of care for high-risk women with dense breasts, though concerns about allergic reactions to the contrast agent remain. The research underscores the importance of additional screening methods for women with dense breast tissue to improve early cancer detection and avert potentially life-threatening situations.</p>

          <p>Jamie Foxx has addressed rumors that Sean "Diddy" Combs was involved in his 2023 hospitalization, attributing them to an altered state of mind while heavily sedated and on painkillers during his recovery from a stroke. In a discussion with The Hollywood Reporter, Foxx humorously debunked the theory that Combs attempted to silence him regarding alleged crimes, emphasizing their friendship before Combs' legal troubles, while also expressing amusement and disbelief at rumors he was cloned. Foxx also shared an anecdote about a stand-up joke he made about Oprah Winfrey, which her friend Gayle King enjoyed.</p>

          <p>Jussie Smollett has settled a lawsuit filed by the city of Chicago by donating $50,000 to Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts, a local organization supporting underprivileged youth. The settlement resolves the city's claim for reimbursement of investigation costs related to Smollett's 2019 claims of being a victim of a hate crime, which police determined to be a hoax. Smollett's conviction on charges related to staging the incident was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court, citing double jeopardy concerns, and he maintains the attack was real, leading him to make an additional donation of $10,000 to the Chicago Torture Justice Center.</p>

This prisoner exchange has remained one of the few areas where the two sides have kept an open line of communication.

          <p>Tax relief can potentially halt wage garnishment by the IRS, provided taxpayers act promptly and choose the appropriate strategy to address their unpaid debt. Effective methods include establishing an installment agreement, seeking an Offer in Compromise to settle the debt for a reduced amount, or applying for Currently Not Collectible status to temporarily halt collections due to financial hardship. Taxpayers can also explore innocent spouse relief if the debt stems from their spouse's actions, and consulting with tax relief professionals can aid in negotiating with the IRS and requesting a garnishment release while a resolution is pursued.
