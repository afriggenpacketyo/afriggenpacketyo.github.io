          <p>Ecuador has extradited José Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious gang leader known as "Fito," to the United States to face drug trafficking and weapons charges. This marks the first direct extradition of an Ecuadorean national from Ecuador to the U.S. Macías, leader of the violent Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape last year. His organization is accused of smuggling vast quantities of cocaine into the U.S. and trafficking firearms, contributing significantly to the wave of violence that has destabilized Ecuador in recent years.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the fierce clashes between striking miners and police outside a coking plant in Rotherham on June 18, 1984, as well as the subsequent, failed prosecutions of 95 miners. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry aims to address unanswered questions that have persisted for 40 years. Campaigners and former miners expressed cautious optimism, hoping the investigation will finally bring truth and justice to the affected communities.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 06:28:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has appointed former Scotland defence coach Steve Tandy as the new head coach of the men's national team. The 45-year-old Welshman will join the team on September 1, signing a contract that runs until at least the 2027 World Cup. Tandy's appointment comes after Warren Gatland's resignation and a period of instability for the team, which had suffered a record run of 18 straight Test defeats. His hiring is seen as a key part of the WRU's long-term strategy to rebuild the national side and restore its competitive standing in world rugby.</p>

          <p>China's Central Military Commission has released new political guidelines for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) aimed at strengthening political loyalty and eliminating corruption. The move follows a recent anti-graft purge that has implicated over a dozen senior military officials and defense industry executives. According to the official PLA Daily, the regulations establish "clear political red lines" and require military cadres to lead by example with integrity. This initiative reflects President Xi Jinping's ongoing emphasis on ideological control and party loyalty as central to China's ambition of becoming a dominant military superpower.</p>

          <p>The wellness industry has expanded to cater to canine companions, with Los Angeles at the forefront of this growing trend. This article explores the world of high-end dog wellness by following a golden retriever named Dug through a week of pampering, including sound baths, hydrotherapy, reiki, and a blueberry facial. The trend reflects a shift where pet owners, increasingly viewing their dogs as children, seek preventative and holistic care for them. While some treatments offer tangible benefits, veterinarians caution owners against projecting human desires onto their pets, as some services may cause more stress than relaxation.</p>

          <p>The Huntington Library in San Marino is anticipating the bloom of its rare and notoriously smelly corpse flower, nicknamed "Green Boy." The massive plant, which can grow over 12 feet tall, is expected to unfurl its maroon petals this week, an event that lasts only 24 to 48 hours. During this brief window, it emits a powerful odor often compared to rotting flesh, a strategy to attract pollinators in its native Indonesian habitat. The Huntington's cultivation of these endangered plants provides the public a unique spectacle and serves as a vital part of global conservation efforts.</p>

          <h2>Simple Rule Change for Manufactured Homes Could Ease Housing Crisis</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Housing advocates argue that removing a 50-year-old federal rule could significantly ease the U.S. housing crisis by making manufactured homes cheaper and more attractive. The regulation requires these homes to be built on a "permanent chassis," a steel frame that adds cost, limits design, and provides a pretext for exclusionary zoning. Despite decades of support for its removal, the change has been stalled by resistance from the traditional homebuilding industry and bureaucratic inertia. With the housing crisis intensifying, Congress is now reconsidering the proposal, which could scale up production and provide affordable options for millions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has confirmed the club is actively seeking to make more signings before the transfer window closes, stating that his squad is currently "short on numbers." Despite already spending over £120 million on four new players, Arteta emphasized the need to "improve the depth and quality" of the team. The club is reportedly still in negotiations for Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres and Valencia defender Cristhian Mosquera. Arteta's comments indicate that Arsenal's summer transfer business is far from over as they prepare for the upcoming season with a pre-season tour in Asia.</p>

The commission will aim to build a national consensus on how to boost retirement savings, as analysis shows a significant savings gap.

Players currently receive less than 10% of league revenue, a figure far lower than their male counterparts in the NBA. With team valuations skyrocketing, the article suggests the players' demands for a larger share of the profits and better compensation are well-founded. (not investment advice)</p>
