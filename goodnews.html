        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pacers coach Rick Carlisle expressed surprise at the New York Knicks' decision to dismiss coach Tom Thibodeau, who was fired after failing to reach the NBA Finals. Carlisle, who also heads the National Basketball Coaches Association, initially believed the news was fake. He praised Thibodeau for the changes he implemented in New York, acknowledging the players' respect for him. Meanwhile, UConn head coach Dan Hurley's name has been linked to the job opening, but he appears to have little interest in making the leap to the NBA.</p>

          <p>Air quality in the Eastern U.S. has improved after a day of unhealthy conditions caused by smoke from Canadian wildfires. The smoke had created unhealthy air quality from the upper Midwest to New York City. Officials indicate that the worst conditions have passed for the affected regions. The incident underscores the impact of wildfires on air quality across long distances.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts in the UK are advising women to stop using weight-loss injections if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding, as it is not known whether the medicines could harm an unborn baby. The MHRA says women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant. The UK drugs regulator, as well as doctors and pharmacists, are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines, known as Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda, Victoza and Ozempic, are not being used safely. Weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese, the MHRA says.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to end the Transportation Security Administration's "Quiet Skies" program, a federal domestic surveillance program for travelers. The program was intended to identify travelers who could present an elevated risk to aviation security. Quiet Skies has faced criticism for tracking U.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes, and some high-profile people have been caught up in its dragnet. It remains unclear whether Quiet Skies staff will be shifted elsewhere in the administration.</p>

          <p>A Guatemalan man who said he was deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution there was flown back to the US after a judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return. The man, identified as OCG, had applied for asylum in the US after being attacked multiple times in homophobic acts of violence in Guatemala. The administration admitted to an ‚Äúerror‚Äù of falsely claiming that OCG was not afraid of being returned to Mexico. The judge found that the deportation likely lacked any semblance of due process.</p>
