        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial markets in the Asia-Pacific region largely saw positive movement, influenced by gains on Wall Street. China's central bank decided to keep its one-year and five-year loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision to hold rates steady at 3.0% and 3.5% respectively comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented a rate cut. The stability in China's rates provided a degree of certainty for investors, though Hong Kong's Hang Seng index experienced a slight decline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Democratic-leaning audiences are turning away from established media corporations, feeling that these outlets have become too accommodating to the Trump administration. This disillusionment has fueled the rise of independent, left-of-center digital platforms like The Bulwark and Crooked Media, which have seen significant growth in subscribers and engagement. The trend is also benefiting platforms like Substack, where many journalists and political figures have migrated after leaving legacy institutions. This shift reflects a broader frustration and is leading to a realignment in how political news and commentary are consumed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy, in a joint operation with Dominican authorities, destroyed a speedboat carrying an estimated 1,000 kilograms of cocaine off the coast of the Dominican Republic. Officials from the Dominican Republic's drug control agency confirmed they recovered 377 packages of the drug from the vessel, which was targeted by an aerial military strike about 80 nautical miles south of Isla Beata. This operation is described as the first of its kind against "narco-terrorism" in the Caribbean, part of a broader U.S. mission to combat drug trafficking in the region. The White House reports the naval flotilla has destroyed at least three drug-carrying boats so far.</p>

The existing Terminal 1 will be fully closed by Tuesday, at which point all flights will operate out of the new facility. Travelers are advised to confirm which terminal their flight is using during this transition period. The new terminal features significant upgrades, including 30 gates, expanded security checkpoints, more concessions, and improved on-airport road access to ease traffic. The old terminal building is scheduled for demolition to make way for the next phase of construction.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people in palliative and end-of-life care are creating playlists of meaningful music to provide comfort and connection during their final days. Local DJ Dave Gilmore, who is terminally ill, is curating the soundtrack of his life to help him and his family navigate this difficult period. Experts note that music has significant therapeutic benefits, lighting up multiple parts of the brain and reducing anxiety even in unconscious patients, as hearing is believed to be the last sense to go. These playlists also serve as a lasting comfort for loved ones, helping them feel connected to the person after they have passed away.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers achieved a 3-0 start to their season by defeating the Denver Broncos 23-20 in a dramatic comeback win. After taking an early lead, the Chargers fell behind and trailed for the entire second half before a critical touchdown pass from Justin Herbert to Keenan Allen tied the game. Kicker Cameron Dicker then secured the victory with a 43-yard field goal as time expired, completing an early sweep of their AFC West rivals. The win marks a significant "signature win" for new coach Jim Harbaugh, whose team has now defeated three Super Bowl-winning coaches in consecutive weeks.</p>

          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic move, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially recognized a Palestinian state. The leaders of the three nations stated the decision is intended to build momentum for a two-state solution and revive hopes for lasting peace in the region. The announcement was met with strong opposition from Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it a "reward to terror" and vowing that a Palestinian state would not be established. This historic decision aligns the three countries with over 140 other nations that have already recognized Palestine, representing a significant shift in policy for these key Western allies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that exceptional social skills are cultivated through early, consistent parental modeling rather than memorized pleasantries. Key practices include openly discussing feelings to build emotional vocabulary, demonstrating empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Parents are also advised to teach conflict resolution, validate their child's feelings, and help them recognize social cues. By creating an environment of emotional safety and connection, parents can equip their children with the tools for healthy, real-world relationships.</p>

          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, has stated that reforming the welfare system is a necessity that "must happen." He emphasized the government's commitment to providing support for people on sickness benefits to help them return to work, addressing both individual well-being and the rising costs of benefits. This comes after the government recently scrapped a controversial policy aimed at cutting disability benefits. McFadden indicated that the goal is to move away from a "binary divide" of being fit or unfit for work, instead offering voluntary support through specially trained job centre staff to those who have been out of the labor market for extended periods.</p>

          <p>On the island of Nantucket, a team of scientists is developing a novel approach to reduce the transmission of Lyme disease by genetically engineering wild mice. The project, led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, aims to make the white-footed mouse—the primary carrier of the Lyme bacteria—immune to the disease. By introducing an antibody gene into the mice, they can create a heritable immunity that is passed down through generations, breaking the infection cycle where ticks feed on mice. This first-of-its-kind effort is being developed in close consultation with the local community to ensure public buy-in before any potential release of the engineered animals.</p>

For now, UATX is offering free tuition, funded by nearly $200 million in private donations. The curriculum is rooted in Western civilization, and classes are small, seminar-style discussions intended to encourage the "fearless pursuit of truth" among students from diverse political perspectives.</p>

          <p>A special "super generation" of monarch butterflies, which can live up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, has completed its annual migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to a remote forest in Mexico. These butterflies suppress their reproductive hormones to conserve energy for the 3,000-mile journey, a mysterious and ancient phenomenon. However, the monarch population has declined by 70% in the last 30 years due to habitat loss, particularly the eradication of milkweed plants essential for their caterpillars. Conservation efforts, including planting "Monarch Waystations" and protecting their wintering grounds in Mexico, are underway to help preserve this iconic species.</p>

The dispute arose over the launch of a membership system for the new organization, which Corbyn's faction deemed "unauthorised."

The company's massive growth is attributed to its dominant position in supplying essential chips and software for the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence sector. While the company's valuation is high, with a price-to-earnings ratio nearly double that of the S&P 500, continued high expectations are fueled by projections of soaring AI-related spending in the coming years.
