          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees following a lawsuit filed by 21 states. The judge's preliminary injunction emphasized the department's need to fulfill its functions and obligations as mandated by Congress. The Trump administration's reduction in force, announced on March 11, would have significantly reduced the agency's staff. The lawsuit was filed after President Trump signed an executive order aimed at dismantling the Education Department, with additional parties, including the American Federation of Teachers, also suing to save the agency.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged to a new record high, surpassing $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and a pro-crypto agenda from the Trump administration. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt have further fueled the rally. Bitcoin ETFs have seen steady inflows, and the number of bitcoins held by public companies has significantly increased.

          <p>A White House report, the product of a presidential commission led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., identifies ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, lack of physical activity, stress, and excessive prescription drug use as drivers of chronic disease in American children. The report criticizes the overmedicalization of children and the influence of the pharmaceutical industry. It calls for more research into the causes of chronic diseases and prevention strategies, including long-term studies comparing whole foods to ultraprocessed foods. The report diverges from standard government thinking, focusing less on smoking and alcohol and more on environmental factors and the food system.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is predicting an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season, with a range of 13 to 19 named storms expected between June 1 and November 30.

Forecasters anticipate that six to ten of these storms will strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become major hurricanes. The neutral condition of the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation cycle is a significant factor influencing this prediction.</p>

          <p>In times of frustration and cynicism, seeking moral beauty can be a source of happiness and inspiration, as demonstrated by stories like Maximilian Kolbe's self-sacrifice. Witnessing acts of kindness, compassion, and courage elicits moral elevation, stimulating specific areas of the brain and fostering a desire to be better. To cultivate moral beauty, one should surround themselves with generous individuals, dedicate leisure time to serving others, and practice gratitude. While true crime may be entertaining, focusing on moral ugliness can negate the positive effects of moral beauty, leading to depression instead of elevation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury has ordered its last batch of penny "blanks," signaling an end to penny production due to rising costs. The move is expected to save taxpayers $85 million, as minting pennies costs nearly four times their worth. The last of the new pennies will enter circulation early next year, eventually leading to businesses rounding prices to the nearest nickel. There are currently 114 billion pennies in circulation, with an annual production cost of $192 million. The decision aligns with President Trump's efforts to reduce wasteful government spending.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department will cease minting pennies, aiming to save $56 million annually due to the high cost of production, as each penny costs nearly four cents to produce.

The Trump administration supports the move, following similar actions by Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. The decision is expected to impact the demand for nickels, which also cost more to mint than their face value.</p>

The decline, driven by fewer people arriving to work and study, follows changes introduced by the previous Conservative government. The ONS also attributed the decrease to the departure of individuals who arrived on study visas after the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased. The government has highlighted efforts to speed up asylum claim processing and combat cross-channel boats as contributing factors to the reduction.</p>
