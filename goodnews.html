        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a free trade agreement projected to boost their bilateral trade by over $34 billion annually in the long term. The deal, finalized after three years of negotiations, will slash tariffs on a wide range of goods, including textiles, automobiles, and Scotch whisky. Under the agreement, 92% of UK exports to India will see reduced or eliminated tariffs, while 99% of Indian goods shipped to Britain will become tariff-exempt. Leaders from both nations hailed the pact as a "historic" deal that will enhance economic prosperity and lower consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is under increased pressure to conclude a trade agreement with the U.S. before an August 1 deadline, after which American tariffs are set to rise to 26%. The urgency has been heightened by a recent U.S.-Japan trade pact and Washington's desire for greater market access for its agricultural products, a sensitive issue for India. Analysts suggest the U.S. also has strategic motivations for a deal, viewing India as a crucial partner in the Indo-Pacific and a potential manufacturing alternative to China. India's position within the BRICS bloc may also provide it with diplomatic leverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has stated it will play a constructive role in de-escalating the border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, urging both nations to exercise restraint. A Chinese official emphasized that both countries are important members of ASEAN, which has a tradition of resolving disputes peacefully. This diplomatic intervention comes after intense clashes, including artillery and rocket fire, erupted along the shared border on Thursday. The escalation has resulted in multiple casualties, a majority of whom are believed to be civilians.</p>

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is scheduled to fight Reinier de Ridder in Abu Dhabi, nine months after suffering a severe jaw injury that required surgery. In his last fight, a face crank from his opponent caused his bottom teeth to cave in, an injury he says was less painful than the subsequent medical procedures to fix it. Whittaker, who had four to six teeth removed and replaced with implants, stated that the surgery has improved his quality of life. Now 34, he says his motivation to continue fighting is driven by setting an example for his children.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize Palestine as a state, with the decision to be formalized at the U.N. General Assembly in September. The move makes France the largest Western power to take this step, adding diplomatic pressure on Israel amid the ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. While the Palestinian Authority welcomed the decision, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly condemned it, arguing it rewards terror. The United States also expressed its rejection of the plan, calling it a reckless decision.</p>

          <h2>English Football Association Chief Opposes Expanding VAR's Powers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 01:37:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chief executive of England's Football Association, Mark Bullingham, has stated there is no need to expand the use of the video assistant referee (VAR) system in football. His comments come amid reports that the sport's law-making body, IFAB, might consider widening VAR's scope to include decisions on corner kicks and second yellow cards. Bullingham argued that the current model already features enough interruptions to the game's flow. The FA, which holds a vote on IFAB, has made its opposition clear, though it would consider any formal proposals brought forward.</p>

          <p>During a personal trip to his golf resorts in Scotland, U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold an informal meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer to refine their recent trade agreement. While a deal establishing a 10% baseline tariff on British goods was initiated in June, key elements remain unresolved, including the removal of 25% tariffs on U.K. steel and aluminum. The U.S. is also pushing for the removal of a British digital services tax that affects American tech companies. The talks represent an opportunity to finalize these important economic details.

          <p>In a UK-first initiative, individuals in Wales with conditions like coeliac disease will receive pre-loaded debit-style cards to purchase gluten-free food. This new system offers an alternative to the current model of obtaining specific food items on prescription from a pharmacy. The card will function like a standard bank card at most retailers, providing patients with greater choice and convenience. Health officials state the goal is to "de-medicalise" the supply of gluten-free foods in a way that is cost-neutral for the NHS.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, clearing a major regulatory hurdle for the deal. The approval transfers broadcast licenses for 28 CBS television stations to the new entity, which will be led by Skydance founder David Ellison. The decision, which followed a controversial $16 million legal settlement between Paramount and President Donald Trump, was met with criticism from Democratic officials who cited a conflict of interest. As part of the approval, Skydance has committed to installing an ombudsman to review complaints of media bias.</p>
