          <p>Amazon has created a new group within its consumer product-development arm, Lab126, focused on agentic artificial intelligence. This team will develop an agentic AI "framework" for use in its robotics operations, often referred to as "physical AI." These systems will enable robots to "hear, understand and act on natural language commands," the company said. Amazon's AI lab released a web browser-based agent earlier this year, and its cloud unit has also formed its own agentic AI group.

          <p>A nearly 200-year-old condom is on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam as part of an exhibition on 19th Century prostitution and sexuality. The condom, believed to be made of a sheep's appendix, features an explicit print and is in "mint condition." It is thought to have been a "luxury souvenir" from a brothel in France. The museum notes the item embodies both the lighter and darker sides of sexual health in an era fraught with fears of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
