          <p>A French court has convicted eight individuals for their involvement in the 2016 armed robbery of Kim Kardashian in Paris, where $10 million worth of jewelry was stolen. The robbers, some of whom were dubbed the "grandpa robbers" due to their age, received prison sentences ranging from three to eight years, with some suspended sentences. Kardashian testified earlier this month, stating she feared for her life during the ordeal and expressed gratitude to French authorities for pursuing justice. She also said she forgave the ringleader, Aomar A√Øt Khedache, for the sexual assault and theft.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced support for a "partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, projecting it will create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. This announcement comes after the Biden administration blocked Nippon Steel's outright acquisition of U.S. Steel on national security grounds. While details of the deal are unclear, it seems to suggest an investment rather than an acquisition, although Nippon Steel has historically preferred a wholly-owned subsidiary arrangement. Shares of U.S. Steel surged following the news, while the United Steelworkers union expressed concern about job security under foreign ownership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is restructuring the National Security Council, reducing its size and shifting responsibilities to other agencies such as the State and Defense departments. This move aims to streamline the agency and eliminate perceived bureaucratic staffers who do not align with Trump's agenda. Andy Baker, national security advisor for Vice President JD Vance, and Robert Gabriel will take on deputy national security advisor roles. The restructuring follows the departure of Mike Waltz and is intended to target Washington‚Äôs so-called "Deep State," according to a White House official. The goal is to have a more top-down approach to foreign policy debates.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, also serving as national security advisor, announced a significant restructuring of the National Security Council, reducing its size by at least half. The changes involve officials returning to their original agencies and others being placed on administrative leave. Some teams focusing on specific regions or issues will be eliminated or merged into others. Andy Baker, national security advisor for Vice President JD Vance, will serve as deputy alongside Robert Gabriel. The downsizing aligns with President Trump's preference for top-down foreign policy decision-making.</p>

          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially due in the spring, with a spokesperson stating it will be released later this year. The Child Poverty Taskforce is considering measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap. The delay has drawn criticism from the SNP, while the Trussell Trust charity suggests it may be beneficial if it leads to a more substantial strategy. The taskforce was launched last July amid pressure to address the two-child benefit cap, a policy affecting 1.5 million families.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, following a lawsuit filed by the university. Harvard argued that the ban was a violation of the First Amendment and due process. The Trump administration claimed the school had not complied with demands to supply information on student visa holders, citing concerns about antisemitism and campus policies. Harvard President Alan Garber called the order a "critical step" to protect international students, while the dispute marks the latest conflict between the administration and the university.</p>

          <p>New Jersey is holding its gubernatorial elections this year, with hotly contested primaries set for next month. Experts say the race could be a harbinger for the mood of the country ahead of 2026's midterm elections, and the first real test for the potential Democratic backlash against the Trump administration. The Democratic primary features six figures hoping to succeed incumbent and term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. Republicans are hoping to flip New Jersey's governorship red, and point to the closer-than-expected margin between Trump and Harris in 2024 as evidence that it's in reach.</p>
