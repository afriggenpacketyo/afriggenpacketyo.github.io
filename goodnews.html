          <p>A twin-engine propeller plane carrying 20 people crashed near Tullahoma, Tennessee, resulting in injuries but no deaths, according to the FAA and local police. The crash occurred shortly after takeoff from Tullahoma Airport, with at least three people airlifted to hospitals as a precaution. The plane, a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, was carrying skydivers at the time of the incident. Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash, and a photo showed the plane with its nose on the ground and a wing missing. The fact that there were no fatalities is a cause for relative relief.</p>

          <p>The computer-generated film "Lilo & Stitch" retained its top spot at the box office for the third week, while "From the World of John Wick: Ballerina" opened below expectations. "Ballerina" garnered $25 million domestically, falling short of the anticipated $35-40 million. Despite positive reviews and audience surveys, its opening weekend performance was somewhat disappointing, though long-term success remains possible. Meanwhile, "Lilo & Stitch" continues to thrive, surpassing the domestic earnings of the live-action "The Little Mermaid". The enduring appeal of family-friendly entertainment is clear.</p>
