          <p>Fans of the Virginia Cavaliers football team rushed the field at Scott Stadium following a dramatic 46-38 double-overtime victory against the eighth-ranked Florida State Seminoles. The celebration, which marked the university's first home win over a top-10 opponent since 2005, occurred immediately after the final play. While coaches reported no players were injured during the field storming, some fans required medical attention, and the university now faces a significant fine under a new ACC policy designed to penalize such events.</p>

          <p>A six-year-old girl from Miami, Imani Dell, was diagnosed with a medulloblastoma, a fast-growing brain tumor, after her aunt noticed her eyes were crossed. Her mother, initially facing insurance issues, rushed her to an emergency room where a CT scan revealed the golf-ball sized mass. Following a successful surgery at Holtz Children's Hospital, Imani underwent 30 rounds of radiation and nine cycles of chemotherapy over the course of a year. Now finished with treatment, she has returned to school, and her family is celebrating her recovery and return to normalcy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a rise in serious runway incursions, aerospace company Honeywell is testing a new cockpit alert system called Surface Alert (SURF-A) designed to give pilots more time to avoid potential disasters. The system uses GPS data to provide audible and visual warnings, such as "Traffic on runway!", which could have provided critical extra seconds of reaction time in recent near-collisions. While not yet required by regulators, the technology is being adopted by some major airlines like Southwest and American Airlines as an additional layer of safety to mitigate risks in increasingly congested airports.</p>

          <p>The "dirty soda" trend, which involves adding flavored syrups and cream to carbonated drinks, has surged in popularity since its origin at the Utah-based chain Swig in 2010. This customizable beverage concept is now being embraced by major corporations, with PepsiCo launching ready-to-drink versions and fast-food giants like Taco Bell and McDonald's adding similar items to their menus. The trend is credited with revitalizing the soda category by attracting younger consumers and offering an affordable, creative treat, demonstrating a foodservice trend successfully transitioning into the retail market.</p>

          <p>This opinion article revisits the 1977 legal battle where the ACLU defended a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, a community with many Holocaust survivors. The author explores the enduring debate over whether the First Amendment protects hateful and offensive speech, drawing parallels to contemporary free speech controversies. The piece quotes the ACLU lawyer involved, David Goldberger, who, despite finding the case personally painful, maintains that denying speech because it is offensive allows officials to censor any expression they dislike, reaffirming that free speech must apply universally.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is actively promoting a new, "ambitious" youth migration agreement with the European Union, arguing it would benefit the British economy and foster growth. The proposed scheme, which would allow individuals aged 18-30 to stay and work for two to three years, is currently under negotiation between London and Brussels. Reeves is urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential positive economic impacts of this deal into its forecasts, hoping it could reduce the need for future tax increases or spending cuts in the upcoming autumn Budget.</p>

          <h2>Simple "Thumb Test" May Help Identify Risk for Aortic Aneurysm</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A simple self-check known as the "thumb test" could offer a clue about a person's risk for an aortic aneurysm. The test involves placing the thumb across the flat palm; if the thumb extends beyond the edge of the palm, it can indicate joint hypermobility, which is associated with connective tissue diseases like Marfan syndrome. These conditions can weaken blood vessel walls, increasing aneurysm risk. However, cardiologists caution that the test is not a diagnostic tool, as many with aneurysms will have a negative test, and a positive result does not confirm an aneurysm is present.</p>

          <p>The American state fair, a tradition dating back to 1841, has evolved significantly from its origins as a showcase for livestock and agricultural competition. While retaining its agricultural roots, today's fairs have transformed into large-scale events featuring everything from live music by major artists to elaborate craft competitions and a vast array of fried foods. The article traces this development, noting how early fairs focused on functional displays of farming techniques, while modern fairs have become pop-up theme parks that serve as a beloved pastime and contribute significantly to the U.S. economy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines whether investors should purchase Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares as they trade near the $500 level, weighing valuation concerns and economic uncertainty against the company's long-term strengths. While its earnings multiple is higher than in the past, it remains lower than the S&P 500, and the company has historically delivered growth despite similar valuations. The author concludes that for long-term, buy-and-hold investors, Berkshire's diversification across numerous industries and its potential to act as a safe haven during an economic downturn make it a persuasive buy.
