        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a tearful exit from Wimbledon after a hard-fought loss to world number one Aryna Sabalenka, Emma Raducanu expressed pride and renewed confidence in her performance. The British player believes the competitive match demonstrated she is closing the gap with the sport's top athletes, a significant improvement from earlier in her career. Sabalenka praised Raducanu's mentality and predicted her swift return to the top 10. Raducanu credits her recent progress to her coaching team and a more positive, joyful approach to her game.</p>

          <h2>Is Crying at Work a Sign of Weakness or a Display of Human Emotion?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:11:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent public display of emotion by a UK politician has sparked a debate about the acceptability of crying in the workplace. While traditional views often label it as unprofessional or a sign of weakness, many modern career coaches and executives argue it reflects emotional intelligence and strength. The article explores different perspectives, noting that biases still exist, particularly for women and senior leaders. Ultimately, it suggests that how an individual recovers and the overall workplace culture are more critical than the act of crying itself.</p>

          <h2>Tiny Zooplankton Play Major Role in Carbon Sequestration, New Research Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:10:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New scientific research reveals that tiny marine animals called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in the fight against climate change. These creatures undertake a massive annual migration in the Southern Ocean, gorging on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface before sinking deep into the ocean to burn the stored fat. This process effectively locks away vast amounts of carbon, equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55 million cars, preventing it from warming the atmosphere. The findings highlight a much larger role for these organisms in regulating the global climate than previously understood.</p>

          <p>A pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom. This is part of a successful breeding season for the vulnerable species at the zoo, which saw ten chicks hatch. To improve survival rates, keepers distributed eggs among different nests, giving one to the first-time foster parents. Same-sex penguin parenting has been observed in other zoos and is a natural behavior, with both parents sharing incubation and feeding duties.</p>
