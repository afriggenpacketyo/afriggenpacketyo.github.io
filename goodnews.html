          <p>Despite receiving over 1.2 million fan votes and being named a captain for the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game, Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark was ranked only ninth among guards by her fellow players. The voting process combines fan, media, and player ranks, with fan votes accounting for 50%. While Clark led fan voting, players ranked several others higher, including top-ranked Allisha Gray of the Atlanta Dream. This disparity may reflect Clark's limited playing time this season due to injury, as she has appeared in only nine of her team's 16 games.</p>

          <p>A coffee boom in China is spreading beyond urban centers into rural areas, creating a new trend of countryside cafes. These establishments often attract social media-savvy consumers with unique natural settings, but some patrons question the long-term viability of this influencer-driven model. China's coffee industry is now valued at approximately US$42 billion, with consumption expected to continue its double-digit growth. This cultural shift is reflected in customs data, which shows a 65.7% average annual growth rate in net coffee imports between 2020 and 2024, signaling a significant change in the nation's traditional tea-drinking habits.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made moves at the start of NBA free agency, losing a key role player but quickly signing a replacement. Forward Dorian Finney-Smith departed the team, agreeing to a four-year, $53-million contract with the Houston Rockets after opting out of his deal with the Lakers. In response, the Lakers secured forward Jake LaRavia with a two-year, $12-million agreement. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing, played for Memphis and Sacramento last season, demonstrating strong three-point shooting ability, which the Lakers hope will fill the void left by Finney-Smith.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a comprehensive review of the parental leave and pay system, aiming to modernize policies for maternity, paternity, and shared leave. Campaigners have welcomed the move, calling it a generational opportunity to fix a system that has been "overlooked for years." The current statutory paternity leave, for instance, pays less than half the National Living Wage, and take-up of shared parental leave is very low. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated the system needs a "serious looking at" after several decades without a major update.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has asked the Trump administration to return 200 troops to California's state command. The request comes as the state's wildfire season begins and its specialized firefighting Guard unit is at only 40% strength. These troops were federalized and deployed to Los Angeles to respond to immigration-related protests. Governor Gavin Newsom, who has legally challenged the federalization, supports the move, urging President Trump to "listen to your military leaders" and return the troops to their critical firefighting duties.</p>

Jassy also noted that the diversity of sellers on Amazon's marketplace creates competition that helps keep prices stable.

          <p>Millions of households in England, Scotland, and Wales will see their energy bills fall by about 7% starting Tuesday, according to the latest price cap from regulator Ofgem. This translates to a reduction of around ¬£11 per month for a typical household. However, analysts caution that prices, while lower, remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels and may not decrease much more. Energy consultancy Cornwall Insight forecasts only a small additional drop in October, warning of "significant uncertainty" in future prices, partly due to potential volatility in the Middle East affecting wholesale costs.</p>

The law was originally introduced to comply with a court ruling that same-sex couples were entitled to legal protections equivalent to marriage.

          <p>At 44 years old, Brazilian goalkeeper Fabio Deivson Lopes Maciel is a standout figure at the Club World Cup, having made his professional debut in 1997. He recently helped his club, Fluminense, secure a spot in the quarter-finals and just broke the world record for most career clean sheets, surpassing Gianluigi Buffon with 508. Having made 1,378 senior appearances, Fabio is now closing in on what is believed to be the all-time record for most matches played in world football. The record is currently held by former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, whose exact total is a matter of some debate.</p>
