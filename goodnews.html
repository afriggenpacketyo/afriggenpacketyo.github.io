          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced President Trump's plan to ensure Americans pay no more for medications than citizens of other wealthy nations. The goal is to address the disparity where Americans often pay significantly higher prices for the same drugs.

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board expresses its support for Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, as he faces the challenge of leading a coalition government and countering the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The AfD, known for its extremist views and ties to Russia, has gained popularity due to frustrations over immigration and the economy. The editorial emphasizes the importance of Merz's success in addressing migration and economic issues to prevent a further shift towards right-wing populism. The board underscores the need for mainstream parties to focus on shared values and deliver results to German voters to safeguard democracy.</p>

          <p>With the Trump administration increasing efforts to collect on student loans, borrowers are advised to understand the difference between delinquency and default. Delinquency occurs after missing a payment, while default happens after 270 days of non-payment, leading to potential garnishments. Borrowers are encouraged to contact their loan servicer for retroactive forbearance and explore income-driven repayment plans. Those in default can contact the government's Default Resolution Group for options to regain good standing, as millions face the risk of default in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The article argues that the Los Angeles Lakers should focus on drafting older, more experienced players who have demonstrated maturity and financial responsibility in college. The author suggests that the league's economic shifts and the advent of NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) deals have made it more valuable to select players who have already navigated the challenges of money and fame. The Lakers, in need of a big man, should prioritize a 24-year-old college graduate with a proven track record over younger, more unproven prospects.</p>
