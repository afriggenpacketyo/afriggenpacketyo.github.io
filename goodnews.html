        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Hogg stepped down from his position as a Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair, citing a "fundamental disagreement" with the party apparatus regarding the role of the vice chair. Hogg stated that he will now focus on his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, which aims to endorse and support aligned candidates in Democratic primaries. DNC chair Ken Martin acknowledged Hogg's activism and respected his decision, despite escalating tensions between them. Hogg's departure follows a period of controversy surrounding his plan to support primary challenges against incumbent Democrats. The DNC will proceed with a re-do election for the vice chair position, with Malcolm Kenyatta now running unopposed. The situation has introduced some uncertainty within the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled a spending review that allocates an additional ¬£29 billion per year to the NHS in England, alongside increased funding for defense and housing. The review prioritizes artificial intelligence and transport projects, aiming to "renew Britain." However, some departments, including the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face budget squeezes. The government hopes increased spending in health and investment in longer-term projects will reassure voters, while Reeves has urged Labour MPs to promote the government's plans. The review reflects a balancing act between investment in key areas and fiscal responsibility.</p>

          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 recorded detailed observations of a new star, later confirmed to be a nova, an event caused by a dying star. The details, including the star's size, brightness, and color, were documented in a formal report to the Emperor Yongle. The rediscovered memorial has helped modern astronomers narrow down the star's possible position and confirmed the phenomenon as a nova rather than a comet or meteor. The discovery showcases the historical significance of Chinese astronomical records and their contribution to modern scientific understanding.</p>
