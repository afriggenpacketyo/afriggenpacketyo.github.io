          <p>Google and Kairos Power are collaborating with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to deploy an advanced nuclear plant, Hermes 2, by 2030, marking the first U.S. utility power purchase agreement with such a reactor. This initiative aims to provide carbon-free power for Google's data centers, with Kairos and Google bearing the financial risk to avoid consumer cost burdens. The project seeks to standardize reactor design and develop supply infrastructure, potentially ushering in a new era of more affordable and safer nuclear construction in the U.S. The smaller, liquid salt-cooled reactor design offers advantages over traditional large plants.</p>

The dictionary also incorporated "tradwife," describing a woman embracing traditional gender roles, and "broligarchy," referring to a powerful group of tech men.

          <p>MSNBC will be rebranded as My Source News Opinion World, or MS Now, and will remove the iconic peacock logo as part of Versant's separation from Comcast's NBCUniversal. This change aims to establish a distinct identity for the political news network, which is aggressively building its own independent newsroom and Washington D.C. bureau. While CNBC, also part of Versant, will retain its name but lose the peacock, MSNBC's rebrand is supported by a major marketing campaign to assert its new independent course and progressive slant.</p>

          <p>Bournemouth has reached an agreement to acquire Liverpool winger Ben Doak for an initial £20 million, with an additional £5 million in add-ons. The 19-year-old Scottish international, who spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough, is expected to complete his transfer shortly, seeking more first-team opportunities. This sale contributes to Liverpool's summer transfer income, which is nearing £200 million, significantly boosting their profit and sustainability rule calculations. Bournemouth has also been active in the transfer market, making several signings and sales.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale experiment in rural Kenya has revealed that unconditional cash transfers significantly reduce infant and child mortality, proving as effective as medical interventions like vaccines. Infants born to families receiving $1,000 were nearly half as likely to die, with a 70% drop in deaths around birth. The cash enabled families to access healthcare facilities and better nutrition, with children 44% less likely to go to bed hungry. This study highlights the profound impact of economic support on health outcomes, especially when healthcare access is financially constrained.</p>

          <p>The UK media watchdog Ofcom has opted not to investigate the latest series of Love Island, despite receiving over 14,000 complaints regarding alleged bullying, abusive behavior, and misogyny. While acknowledging emotionally charged scenes, Ofcom stated that negative behavior was not portrayed positively and contestants were shown supporting each other. The watchdog also noted the show's established format and viewer expectations for relationship challenges. ITV maintains that participants receive training on respectful behavior and comprehensive psychological support, refuting allegations of biased editing or racism.</p>

          <p>The opening weekend of the Premier League season highlighted Liverpool's defensive issues, particularly their susceptibility to counter-attacks, a stark contrast to their previous season's record. Despite attacking reinforcements, the team's balance appeared off, with misplaced midfield passes and numerous players committed forward leaving them exposed. While sloppy passing is a factor, the article suggests manager Arne Slot may need to adjust full-back or central midfielder positions for better defensive protection. The analysis also touches on tactical changes for other top clubs like Manchester City and Arsenal.</p>

          <p>While Hurricane Erin poses a direct threat to the U.S. East Coast, its remnants are forecast to bring unsettled, wet, and windy weather to the UK next week. Meteorologists clarify that reports of a "600-mile wall of rain" are physically impossible, as the low-pressure system containing Erin's remnants will be typical in size. The storm, currently over 3,000 miles away, will weaken as it crosses the Atlantic. Despite uncertainties, the UK can expect a shift from settled weather towards more autumnal conditions by mid-week.</p>

          <p>Mallory Contois, a VP of growth at an online learning startup, advocates for sending "scary emails" – ambitious cold emails – as a key strategy for career advancement. Having used them to secure jobs, make connections, and launch ventures, Contois emphasizes that the worst outcome is no response. She advises making requests as easy as possible for the recipient, keeping messages concise, and showing genuine passion. This low-risk, high-reward approach, she argues, can lead to "astronomical" career growth by creating opportunities outside one's existing network.</p>

          <p>The labor market is experiencing a shift from "job-hopping" to "job hugging," where workers are holding onto their current positions due to economic uncertainty and a cooling job market. Consultants describe "job hugging" as clinging to a job "for dear life," a stark contrast to the high quit rates of previous years. This trend is driven by low hiring and layoff rates, making workers nervous about finding new employment. While staying in a job isn't inherently bad, experts warn it could lead to stagnated earnings and skills development if workers become too comfortable.</p>

          <p>China is closely monitoring the U.S.-led diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine, particularly the recent Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. Beijing views the talks as an opportunity to understand how Trump negotiates in high-stakes situations, noting his apparent willingness to push Ukraine towards territorial concessions. Despite Trump's unpredictability, China sees a potential alignment in prioritizing political values less in international dealings. While the summit offers lessons for China's own disputes with Washington, experts doubt Beijing will fundamentally alter its close relationship with Moscow.</p>

          <p>Despite massive payrolls, both the New York Mets and Yankees are experiencing significant late-season slumps, jeopardizing their postseason aspirations. The Mets' pitching staff, particularly the bullpen, has faltered since the All-Star break, negating offensive strengths. Similarly, the Yankees' pitching, especially their high-profile relief acquisitions, has struggled with consistency and control, despite a powerful offense. While both teams possess star power, their defensive and pitching woes highlight the challenges of translating high investment into consistent performance as the season nears its end.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2014, China's electric vehicle (EV) supply chain invested more in overseas factories than domestically in 2024, a trend driven by intense home market competition and rising export tariffs. The majority of this outbound investment is in battery plants, though assembly plant investments are also rapidly growing. This strategy aims to overcome regulatory barriers in host markets and gain foreign government support for expansion. However, only a quarter of announced overseas projects have been completed, and Beijing's concerns over technology leakage could lead to tighter controls on outbound investment.
