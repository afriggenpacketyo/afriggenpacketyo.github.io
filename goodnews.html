        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in UK rail policy. The initial nationalized service departed from Woking to Surbiton on schedule, though the journey to London Waterloo was via a rail replacement bus due to engineering work. While the government hails this as a "new dawn for rail," they refrained from promising fare reductions, focusing instead on service improvements and infrastructure investment. Concerns have been raised by unions regarding outsourcing of staffing for security and cleaning, while the Conservatives emphasize the need for Labour to fulfill their commitments. </p>
