          <p>Shawn Carney, president and CEO of 40 Days for Life, has praised Texas lawmakers for passing a bill that mandates the display of the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom. Carney believes the bill represents a step in the right direction and reflects a broader cultural shift towards moral clarity. He argues that the legislation does not violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause and frames it as a response to a secular "woke mentality." The bill, awaiting Governor Greg Abbott's signature, has sparked debate over its constitutionality and potential impact on religious freedom.</p>

          <p>Xiaomi has launched its new YU7 sports utility vehicle in Beijing, aiming to compete with Tesla in the electric vehicle market. The YU7 follows the success of Xiaomi's SU7 sedan, which has outsold Tesla's Model 3 since December, but the launch comes amidst controversies surrounding a fatal crash involving an SU7 and complaints of misleading marketing. Analysts predict the YU7 could pose a significant threat to Tesla's Model Y, citing Xiaomi's understanding of Chinese consumers and its competitive pricing, which is estimated to range between 230,000 yuan and 330,000 yuan. Visitors to the showroom noted the car's styling, color, and integration with Xiaomi's ecosystem of gadgets and smart home products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia's first-quarter results fell short of expectations, but Wall Street analysts remain largely optimistic due to strong demand for AI infrastructure products. The company attributed the shortfall to the US ban on H20 chip shipments to China, which is expected to impact sales significantly. However, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the "incredibly strong" global demand for Nvidia's AI technology and its efficient ramp-up in production of the Blackwell chip. Analysts from Citi and D.A. Davidson offered varying perspectives, with Citi raising its price target and D.A. Davidson highlighting concerns over Nvidia's access to the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek has quietly released an upgraded version of its R1 artificial intelligence reasoning model, escalating competition with OpenAI. The upgraded model, released on Hugging Face, is a reasoning model capable of executing complex tasks through logical thought. DeepSeek's rise to prominence this year, with its low-cost and short development time, has sparked concerns that U.S. tech giants are overspending on infrastructure. The upgraded model is just behind OpenAI's models on LiveCodeBench.</p>
