          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has erupted again, marking its 31st display of molten rock since December, with lava shooting 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. This highly active volcano continues to attract visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, where the spectacle is observed safely, posing no immediate threat to homes. Scientists diligently monitor the expanding magma supply and minuscule ground changes around the volcano to predict future activity, noting recent lava fountains have been shorter, possibly due to a widening vent. Native Hawaiian traditions view lava as a sacred natural resource that hardens into land, forming the very foundation for the island, underscoring its profound cultural and ecological significance for the region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is actively navigating complex Russia-Ukraine negotiations, having met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders at the White House, following a recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Trump indicated a crucial decision on U.S. actions, potentially involving massive sanctions or tariffs, is expected within two weeks, though he explicitly ruled out sending U.S. troops to Ukraine. Domestically, the President joined law enforcement and National Guard troops in Washington D.C. amid a federal takeover to crack down on crime, claiming the city has seen "incredible results." Additionally, Trump unveiled plans with FIFA President Gianni Infantino to hold the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw at the Kennedy Center in December.</p>

          <p>The Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta has been ranked the top public college for return on investment (ROI) for the third consecutive year by The Princeton Review, which evaluated nearly 400 institutions. The publication considered colleges' ratings in academics, financial aid, and college costs, with Georgia Tech excelling due to its relatively low tuition fees and the high median earnings achieved by its former students. The institution's strong focus on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields is a key factor contributing to the impressive salaries its alumni command post-graduation. This article highlights the increasing importance of evaluating a college degree's long-term value in a landscape of rising educational costs, while also noting that some students may attend expensive schools for free through federal or institutional aid.</p>

          <p>College athletics are undergoing a significant transformation, evolving from a casual pastime into an increasingly professionalized endeavor, particularly in revenue-generating sports like football and men's basketball. Recent court cases have empowered athletes to receive payment from advertisers, fans, and their schools, fundamentally altering their status and the nature of college-level sports. This article, presented as part of "The Wonder Reader" newsletter, delves into the changing meaning of school sports, addressing debates about the potential decline of niche sports if schools prioritize revenue-generating athletes. It also highlights arguments that college sports have historically functioned as a form of affirmative action for affluent white students, raising profound questions about player compensation and the core purpose of collegiate athletics.</p>

After conventional physical and occupational therapy yielded only minor improvements, Fello received the device, which uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, known as neuroplasticity. Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon, explains this "first-of-its-kind technology" boosts neuroplasticity, leading to greater and faster improvements in motor function for stroke survivors. Fello, the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant, has shown remarkable progress in regaining function and experiencing reduced pain, offering substantial hope for many stroke survivors whose recovery had previously plateaued.</p>

          <p>The CEO of LAR, a key logistics provider, has asserted that the Angola rail project is not aimed at countering China, despite earlier announcements from U.S. officials regarding a planned cross-continental railway. The CEO emphasized LAR's strong commercial ties with China, including its role in serving Chinese-owned mining companies and its reliance on Chinese manufacturing for operational equipment. He clarified that LAR's involvement is purely commercial, focused on operating the rail and port infrastructure, and that "no geopolitics is involved whatsoever" from their perspective. This article highlights the complexities of international infrastructure development and the often-debated geopolitical implications, particularly concerning China's expanding influence in global development.</p>

          <p>Wealth advisors are outlining crucial strategies for wealthy parents to effectively transfer real estate to their children, aiming to minimize both financial and emotional pitfalls amidst the projected $105 trillion wealth transfer by 2048. The article strongly advises against gifting long-held real estate during a lifetime to avoid heirs incurring higher capital gains taxes, instead recommending transfers through wills or trusts upon death to leverage stepped-up basis rules. It also suggests using Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) and establishing trusts to shield assets from potential lawsuits and clearly outline property usage rules, thereby preventing common family disputes. Crucially, parents are advised to proactively set aside liquid assets for the property's ongoing upkeep and insurance, and to prepare for the likelihood that some heirs may eventually wish to cash out their share.

          <p>This opinion article critically examines Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's sartorial choices during his White House meetings with President Trump, framing them as a deliberate act of "wardrobe diplomacy." After a combative February meeting where Trump publicly chastised Zelenskyy for his casual, bunker-chic look, the Ukrainian president adopted a more formal, albeit still tie-less, black canvas blazer over a collared shirt for a recent visit. The article suggests this shift was a strategic move to convey seriousness and facilitate a more productive diplomatic engagement. It emphasizes how politicians' clothing choices are inherently political, sending powerful messages and influencing perceptions in high-stakes diplomatic encounters, drawing parallels to historical figures like Winston Churchill's wartime attire.</p>

          <p>South Park's latest season is achieving record ratings for its unrestrained and direct satire of the Trump administration, specifically targeting figures like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Vice President JD Vance. This article highlights the show's creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, for their willingness to "speak truth to the ultimate power" and even mock their parent company, Paramount Pictures, which recently underwent a merger under Trump administration scrutiny. Despite corporate pressures and settlements faced by other media outlets, South Park's significant commercial success and valuable, long-standing content library make it a crucial asset for Paramount. The article suggests this unique situation demonstrates how strong business interests can sometimes "trump politics" in the entertainment industry, allowing for a rare degree of creative freedom.</p>

          <p>Medtronic PLC, the world's largest medtech company, has announced the appointment of John Groetelaars and Bill Jellison to its board, along with the formation of a Growth Committee and an Operating Committee. These strategic changes follow engagement with activist investor Elliott Investment Management. This article highlights that Medtronic's stock has stagnated over the past decade despite its market leadership, a performance many attribute to its broad diversification strategy rather than focused growth. The newly established committees aim to address these concerns by identifying tuck-in M&A opportunities, allocating research and development more effectively, and improving gross margins, with Jellison joining both. This move signals management's acknowledgment of long-term investor frustration and a commitment to a professional process for delivering sustained growth. (not investment advice)</p>

This article highlights a growing demand for generational change within the Democratic party, arguing that party elders have failed to act with sufficient urgency against the Trump administration's policies. Challengers like Liam Elkind and Everton Blair contend that the intraparty divide is between "fighters and folders," emphasizing the critical need for new energy, a fresh vision, and a more direct approach to voters on key issues like housing and healthcare. This movement reflects a deep introspection within the Democratic party and a fervent desire to redefine its message and leadership for what they hope will be a new political era.</p>

Horne, who attended the reform school in the 1960s, suffered molestation and vicious beatings, which ultimately led him to drop out of high school to financially support his family. He pursued his diploma through a compensation program established for Dozier victims, fulfilling a promise he made to himself long ago.

          <p>A recent Empower survey found that Americans believe the ideal retirement age is 58, which is notably younger than the current average retirement age of 62-64. However, financial advisors caution that retiring early carries substantial financial risks, including the critical need for sufficient savings to cover potentially 30 to 40 years of non-work. It also requires planning to bridge the healthcare coverage gap before Medicare eligibility begins at age 65. Many Americans, 58%, actually retire earlier than anticipated due to health or employment issues, rather than achieving financial stability. The article emphasizes the importance of aggressive early savings, a clear understanding of retirement spending needs, and considering the benefits of delaying Social Security to reduce the risk of outliving one's funds.

          <p>Tinted sunscreens offer a unique and crucial benefit over traditional sun protection by effectively blocking visible light radiation, which is a significant contributor to hyperpigmentation and melasma, particularly prevalent in individuals with darker skin tones. While standard sunscreens primarily target harmful UV rays, growing research indicates that radiation from visible light can also trigger skin damage and the development of dark spots. Dermatologists strongly recommend looking for iron oxide as a key active ingredient in tinted sunscreens, as this compound provides the necessary pigment and robust visible light protection. This article emphasizes the significant psychosocial impact of hyperpigmentation and advocates for more diverse tinted sunscreen options, highlighting a crucial advancement in inclusive skincare and comprehensive sun protection.</p>
