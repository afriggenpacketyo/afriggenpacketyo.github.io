          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 13:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration has reversed its decision to phase out paper checks for beneficiaries, following concerns raised by lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren. The agency will now continue issuing paper checks to recipients who lack other means of payment, while still promoting the benefits of electronic deposits. The initial plan, aimed at saving costs and increasing security, faced criticism for potentially harming vulnerable populations, including the elderly and unbanked individuals. The SSA also committed to an independent audit to assess and improve its customer service performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced a new anti-corruption bill after a previous version sparked widespread protests and criticism from the European Union. The initial legislation was seen as undermining the independence of anti-corruption bodies, a move that critics feared was a step back for the country's rule of law. The reversal comes as Ukraine continues to pursue EU membership, a goal for which tackling corruption is a critical requirement. The new bill aims to reaffirm Ukraine's commitment to strengthening its legal framework and maintaining trust with international partners.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 12:49:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 27th season of "South Park" premiered with an episode that sharply satirized both President Donald Trump and its parent company, Paramount. The episode, titled "Sermon on the Mount," was released just after creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone secured a new $1.5 billion deal with the company. It directly references recent controversies, including Trump's lawsuit against Paramount, the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," and the president's alleged ties to the Epstein case. The defiant episode was seen by media observers as a bold move, criticizing the very entity funding its future production.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley is preparing to run for the open U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina in 2026. His potential candidacy follows Lara Trump's announcement that she will not seek the seat. On the Democratic side, former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is also expected to announce his bid for the same position. The race is for the seat currently held by Republican Senator Thom Tillis, who is vacating it, setting the stage for a major political battle in a key swing state.</p>

The stock, which has high short interest, attracted attention from retail investors on forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. This investor activity can create a "short squeeze," artificially driving up the stock price as short sellers buy shares to cover their positions. The campaign will focus on the company's denim line, capitalizing on the growing popularity of Western-inspired styles in fashion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the psychological phenomenon of time seeming to accelerate with age, drawing on philosophy and neuroscience. It explains that our perception of time is subjective, influenced by age, circadian rhythms, and our current emotional state. To make life feel subjectively longer, the author suggests pursuing meaningful, emotionally evocative activities that create dense memories, rather than simple fun. Other strategies include savoring moments fully and avoiding routine to prevent being on "autopilot." Ultimately, the piece argues that how we use our time is more important than how long it feels.</p>

One of the marsupials was safely captured near the French city of Lille after several days on the loose, but its companion remains at large. The animals' owner was on vacation when they escaped. Sightings of the hopping fugitives in urban areas were shared widely on social media, with authorities now relying on local residents to report the location of the second, still-missing wallaby.</p>
