          <h2>Trump Reduces Proposed EU Pharmaceutical Tariffs in New Trade Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 03:23:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US President Donald Trump has significantly lowered previously threatened tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union, capping them at 15% in a newly detailed trade deal. This decision alleviates earlier concerns stemming from Trump's threats of tariffs as high as 250% for the pharmaceutical sector. The agreement stipulates that the EU must first enact legislation to reduce its own tariffs on US industrial goods to zero before a reciprocal reduction applies to European motor vehicle exports. While the deal is hailed as a step towards stability in the world's largest trading partnership, sectors like wine and spirits remain disappointed, as they were not exempted from tariffs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its earlier directive on stray dogs in New Delhi, now mandating that animals be caught, sterilized, and immunized before release, unless they exhibit rabies infection or aggressive behavior. Concurrently, the court has prohibited public feeding of stray dogs, instructing civic bodies to establish designated feeding zones in municipal wards and warning of legal action against violators. This new order follows widespread protests from animal rights activists against the previous ruling, which called for the removal of 5,000 dogs from "high-risk areas" due to a surge in dog bite incidents, with nearly 2,000 reported daily in the capital. The court aims to frame a comprehensive nationwide policy, transferring all similar cases to its jurisdiction.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Cools to 3.1% in July, Rice Prices Show Signs of Easing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 02:39:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate eased to 3.1% in July, marking its lowest level since March, though it surpassed economists' expectations of 3%. This cooling trend is primarily attributed to a significant deceleration in rice inflation, which dropped to 90.7% after two months of surging past 100% and dominating national headlines. Despite this moderation, the headline inflation figure remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 40th consecutive month, prompting some analysts to suggest the BOJ is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates. The central bank had recently upgraded its inflation forecasts, indicating sustained price pressures even as food inflation shows signs of easing. (not investment advice)</p>

This landmark development holds significant meaning for the estimated half a million Sikhs in the UK and millions worldwide, offering new representation in British football. The ownership group emphasizes bringing core Sikh principles like discipline, trustfulness, and compassion to the club, aiming to change the narrative around football ownership and attract a global Sikh fanbase. This milestone is seen as a powerful source of inspiration for underrepresented communities, fostering greater visibility and encouraging individuals to pursue diverse professional dreams.</p>

The charges stemmed from a 2015 interview where he allegedly defamed the monarchy, a crime under Thailand's strict lese majeste law, often criticized for targeting political opponents. The court ruled that the evidence was insufficient for conviction, interpreting the law literally since Thaksin had not named specific individuals. This verdict brings significant relief to the Shinawatra family, whose political movement has been a dominant force in Thai politics for decades, and comes as Thaksin's daughter, suspended PM Paetongtarn, faces her own legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a significant crackdown on individuals incorrectly claiming child benefit while residing outside the country, with an expected saving of £350 million over the next five years. Under the new rules, claimants who are abroad for more than eight weeks will generally no longer be eligible for the benefit, unless exceptional circumstances apply. A new specialist team will utilize travel data to track if claimants have left the UK and are no longer entitled to payments. A pilot program successfully stopped £17 million in incorrect payments from 2,600 people, and the expanded team of over 200 investigators will continue this effort, potentially extending scrutiny to other benefits claimed overseas.</p>

In response, Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif expressed keen interest in expanding cooperation to include aerospace, information technology, and infrastructure, while pledging full efforts to ensure the safety of Chinese nationals and projects from terrorist attacks. CPEC has already seen over $65 billion in Chinese investment, with the second phase focusing on establishing special economic zones.</p>

He confirmed TSMC is producing six new products for Nvidia, including next-generation AI chip components. While the article also briefly mentions Nvidia's H20 chip production halt in China, the primary focus remains on TSMC's industry standing and its strategic importance in the global semiconductor landscape.

This contradicts a Nikkei Asia report suggesting carmakers were passing tariff expenses to American consumers. Toyota clarified that its July price adjustments were standard annual increases reflecting operational costs, not tariffs, despite anticipating a significant financial impact from the duties. Honda similarly stated it avoids direct tariff pass-through due to its high percentage of US-made parts.

This challenges NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return US astronauts around 2027, despite lingering questions over its chosen lunar landers like SpaceX's Starship.

US District Judge Kathleen Williams cited violations of environmental laws and the risk of irreparable harm to the sensitive ecosystem, noting the state failed to explain why the facility needed to be in the Everglades. The order mandates the removal of temporary structures and a decline in detainee population within 60 days. While Florida plans to appeal, environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe hailed the ruling as a victory for conservation and upholding environmental protections.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of scientists has discovered that corn plants communicate with their neighbors by releasing a gas, linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil composition. This novel mechanism offers crucial insights into how planting density affects plant growth and defense, particularly against herbivores. Researchers from Zhejiang University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Leiden University, and the University of Bern conducted surveys in maize fields in Hainan, China, observing that densely planted inner rows suffered less herbivore damage but also exhibited reduced growth. Optimizing the release of this gas could potentially be harnessed to combat pests and increase crop yields, presenting a promising avenue for agricultural innovation and sustainable farming practices.</p>
