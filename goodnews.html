          <p>Fire crews swiftly responded to a brush fire that ignited in the Hollywood Hills, north of West Sunset Boulevard, briefly threatening several homes. The blaze, which consumed approximately a quarter of an acre of vegetation while moving uphill, was brought under control within half an hour due to the rapid deployment of about 80 firefighting personnel and water drops from LAFD helicopters. Although one car was burned, no structures were affected, and all active flames were extinguished, with forward progress stopped by 7:30 p.m. Residents in the vicinity were advised to shelter in place as crews worked to achieve full containment on the steep terrain.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy grew by 1.8% year-over-year in the second quarter, surpassing Reuters' economist forecast of 1.6% and marking the fastest growth pace since September 2023. The expansion was primarily driven by robust domestic spending, including household and government consumption, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This positive economic news follows the Reserve Bank of Australia's recent 25 basis point rate cut to 3.6% in August, alongside a more optimistic outlook on global economic stability. Despite a reduced annual growth forecast to 1.7%, consumer and business confidence are reportedly improving, indicating a potential end to prolonged pessimism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, aged 79, publicly dismissed recent speculation regarding his health as "fake news," asserting his robust activity over the Labor Day weekend. Addressing reporters in the Oval Office, Trump stated he was busy with media interviews and a visit to his Virginia golf course, countering social media rumors that had circulated about his well-being. He criticized the media for questioning his health after a brief absence from public appearances, emphasizing his active schedule. This comes amidst ongoing political scrutiny and public interest in the health of prominent political figures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill requiring schools, universities, and community colleges to notify families and staff when immigration enforcement authorities are present on campuses. Authored by state senator Sasha Renée Pérez, the legislation aims to inform and empower school communities regarding safety amidst the Trump administration's aggressive mass deportation campaigns. If signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill would take immediate effect and remain active until 2031, providing a system similar to alerts for other campus emergencies. This measure is part of a broader state effort to protect immigrants and maintain educational institutions as safe spaces.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing an early-stage branding supercycle, exemplified by the global success of brands like Labubu dolls, which are changing perceptions from 'cheap' to 'trusted.' This phenomenon extends beyond consumer goods into industrial sectors such as batteries, cars, and biotech, with companies like Xiaomi and CATL gaining significant brand recognition. Xiaomi's rapid success in the EV market and CATL's dominance in EV batteries illustrate a shift from cost advantage to brand advantage in Chinese manufacturing.

          <p>A woman was rescued from a domestic violence incident at a 7-Eleven in Alhambra, California, after discreetly using a hand signal popularized on TikTok. A bystander, recognizing the gesture, called 911, leading Alhambra police to the scene where they apprehended the suspect, John Palombi. Palombi, who attempted to flee, was found to have an active warrant and a stun gun. The "signal for help," created by the Canadian Women's Foundation to combat rising domestic violence during the pandemic, involves tucking the thumb into the palm and covering it with fingers, proving effective in facilitating rescues globally.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, former chief of staff to Sir Keir Starmer, has questioned the government's decision to limit a civil service internship scheme exclusively to students from "lower socio-economic backgrounds." Gray, who comes from a working-class background herself, expressed concerns about the "evidence base" for this change, arguing that diverse exposure is crucial for interns. While the government aims to broaden the talent pool, critics like Tory Baroness Finn argue the new criteria could discriminate against children from various working professions. The scheme, set to begin in October 2026, prioritizes successful interns for the Fast Stream graduate program.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B was cleared by a Los Angeles jury in a $24 million civil lawsuit brought by a security guard who alleged assault during Cardi B's first pregnancy in 2018. The jury deliberated for approximately an hour before finding Cardi B not liable for claims of assault, battery, and emotional distress. Cardi B testified that the security guard, Emani Ellis, had followed and appeared to film her during a private obstetrician appointment, leading to a heated verbal altercation, but denied any physical contact or spitting. The case garnered significant media attention due to the rapper's candid testimony and public profile.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against the most severe penalties sought by the U.S. Department of Justice in its landmark antitrust case against Google, allowing the tech giant to retain its Chrome browser and Android operating system. However, the ruling bars Google from exclusive contracts involving payments or licensing and mandates the sharing of search data with rivals, aiming to pry open the market. The judge noted that the emergence of generative AI, with its competitive dynamics and numerous new market entrants, significantly influenced the decision, preventing Google from applying its past anti-competitive playbook to AI products.

          <p>A divided U.S. appeals court has allowed Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, to resume her role, rejecting the Trump administration's attempt to remove her. The 2-1 decision by the District of Columbia circuit court of appeals affirmed that FTC commissioners cannot be fired by a president without cause, a principle established nearly a century ago. Slaughter, who was appointed to her second term by President Biden, stated she was heartened by the ruling and eager to return to her duties, emphasizing that Trump is "not above the law." This ruling challenges the executive's power over independent regulatory agencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have made a promising discovery that waxworms can digest polyethylene, the most common type of plastic, converting it into body fat within days. Researchers at Brandon University found that approximately 2,000 waxworms can break down an entire plastic bag in just 24 hours. While the worms cannot survive on a plastic-only diet and lose weight over time, scientists are optimistic about developing a co-supplementation to maintain their health while they process plastic waste. This breakthrough offers a potential biological solution to the global plastic pollution crisis, which sees 57 million tons of plastic produced annually, persisting for hundreds or thousands of years.</p>

          <p>Valentine Low's new book, 'Power and the Palace,' reveals several claims about the British royal family, including Queen Camilla's experience fighting off a sexual assault as a teenager in the 1960s. The book recounts Camilla telling Boris Johnson that she used her shoe to fend off an attacker on a train, leading to his arrest. This anecdote aligns with the Queen's public campaigning against domestic abuse and violence against women. Other revelations include Queen Elizabeth II's private preference for remaining in the EU, Prince Charles's frosty relationship with Boris Johnson, and details about royal funding negotiations, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the monarchy's interactions with politics.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed erupting, with lava fountains shooting up to 330 feet into the sky from its summit crater. This marks the 32nd episode of molten rock release since its current eruption began in December 2024, with all lava contained within the Halemaʻumaʻu crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma is continuously supplied from deep within the earth, building pressure and forcing lava to the surface through narrow vents. Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has a history of such episodic eruptions, and scientists continue to monitor its activity, though the exact duration and evolution of the current event remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>Police forces and councils across the UK have issued fresh warnings about a rise in parking scams, urging the public to protect themselves from increasingly creative fraudsters. Common tactics include fake text messages demanding payment for unpaid tickets and tampered car park machines that steal card details. Experts advise checking parking notices for key details like vehicle registration, time, and location, as genuine fines always arrive in writing. It's crucial to avoid clicking suspicious links in texts, and if clicked, to restart devices, change passwords, and contact banks. Additionally, vigilance for physical skimming devices on payment machines is recommended to prevent card theft.</p>

          <p>Apple shares saw a significant rise after a federal judge ruled that Google could continue making payments to preload Google Search onto iPhones, avoiding the most severe penalties in the landmark antitrust case. While the judge barred Google from entering or maintaining *exclusive* contracts that bundle its services or condition revenue share agreements, he stopped short of banning all payments for default placement. This decision is lucrative for Apple, as Google's payments for being the default search engine on Apple devices contribute billions to its services business. The ruling, however, does impose limits on how Google distributes its services and requires sharing search data with rivals. (not investment advice)</p>
