        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Donald Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for at least 14 days. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that Trump's determination of "war-ravaged Portland" was "simply untethered to the facts" and likely exceeded his constitutional authority under federal law, also violating the Tenth Amendment. The judge emphasized the country's longstanding tradition of resistance to government overreach, particularly military intrusion into civil affairs, warning against blurring the line between civil and military federal power. This significant legal decision affirms the state of Oregon's sovereignty and highlights the judicial system's role in scrutinizing executive actions regarding domestic troop deployment and the nature of protests.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 20:26:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Queuing, traditionally perceived as an inconvenience, is transforming into a desirable social and experiential activity, particularly evident in the UK. People are willingly waiting for hours, and sometimes even overnight, for events such as new store openings for Korean cosmetics or the launch of limited-edition products. Psychologists attribute this phenomenon to the "anticipation" of a reward, which triggers dopamine release in the brain, and the "exclusivity" of being among the first to experience something. Brands are actively leveraging this trend through experiential marketing, offering freebies, interactive experiences, and social media-worthy moments to deeply engage consumers. This cultural shift highlights a growing desire for community, unique in-person experiences, and the appeal of "good vibes" in an increasingly digital world.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the largest U.S. Lutheran denomination, has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a historic milestone for the predominantly white church. Curry, 53, who grew up Catholic and found his path to Lutheran leadership through a unique congregational program, expressed hope that his presence would inspire more leaders of color within the denomination. His six-year term begins amid significant challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations, including substantial membership declines and ongoing theological disputes over LGBTQ+ inclusion. Curry's stated goals include exploring ways for the ELCA to become a more connected, welcoming, and thriving church, building on existing affirmed strategies to deepen engagement from local congregations upwards.</p>

          <p>Lithuania's Vilnius Airport temporarily closed its airspace in the early hours of Sunday, reportedly due to the sighting of hot air balloons heading towards the airport. Flights were redirected to other airports, including Riga and Kaunas, causing disruption for travelers. This incident follows a series of recent European airport closures over drone sightings, highlighting ongoing airspace security challenges. The closure comes after Lithuania imposed a 90-km no-fly zone along its border with Belarus, a Russian ally, to enable its armed forces to respond swiftly to potential airspace violations, underscoring heightened regional security concerns.</p>

          <p>The previously winless UCLA Bruins achieved a stunning 42-37 victory over No. 7 Penn State, marking a dramatic turnaround under newly elevated playcaller Jerry Neuheisel. Neuheisel, who had only four days to prepare, orchestrated an offensive plan that produced points on each of the Bruins’ first five drives, revitalizing a team that had recently lost its coach and coordinators. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava delivered a standout performance, accounting for five touchdowns and showcasing his potential with 166 passing yards and 128 rushing yards. Despite a tense late Penn State rally, the Bruins' defense secured the win, leading to jubilant celebrations and prompting questions about whether this unexpected triumph signals a genuine turning point for their season.</p>

          <h2>Understanding "Freshers' Flu": Why New University Students Get Sick So Easily</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 19:05:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Freshers' flu," a prevalent ailment among new university students, is an assortment of common respiratory viruses that spread rapidly due to crowded living conditions and intense social interaction during the initial weeks of term. Immunologists explain that students, arriving from diverse locations, are exposed to new virus variants their immune systems haven't encountered, forcing them to build new defenses. Compounding this vulnerability, the significant stress of adapting to university life, coupled with insufficient sleep, poor diet, and alcohol consumption, all contribute to suppressing immune function. Experts advise prioritizing rest when sick, despite social pressures to participate, and seeking medical help if symptoms persist or worsen, emphasizing that the body requires adequate time to recover from these viral assaults.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative and protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, has been elected leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on its 70th anniversary, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. After two previous attempts, the 64-year-old former government minister, known for her past as a heavy metal drummer, will now face the challenge of leading a party grappling with voter trust and a rising far-right. Takaichi, who has softened her stance on some social issues while maintaining conservative views on others, aims to revive "Abenomics" and expand social support services, drawing on her personal experiences with caregiving. Her election marks a historic moment for Japanese politics.</p>

          <p>Milan Mandaric, the Serbian-American businessman who formerly owned English football clubs Portsmouth, Leicester City, and Sheffield Wednesday, has died at 87 after a short illness. Mandaric, known as football's 'Mr Fixit' for reviving clubs on the brink of bankruptcy, began his involvement in English football in 1999 with Portsmouth. He later owned Leicester City and Sheffield Wednesday, securing promotions and stabilizing clubs before selling them. His family stated his love for football was only surpassed by his love for his family. Mandaric was also acquitted of tax evasion alongside Harry Redknapp in 2012, and most recently served as vice-president of Serbian team Vojvodina.</p>

          <p>Hearts fans are increasingly optimistic about a potential Scottish Premiership title challenge after their team's unbeaten start to the season, now five points clear at the top. Head coach Derek McInnes, while professionally cautious, acknowledges fans' excitement following a 91st-minute Edinburgh derby winner at Tynecastle. The club's strong performance follows a £10 million investment from owner Tony Bloom, who had boldly predicted a challenge for second place. With rivals Rangers in turmoil and Celtic yet to hit top gear, former players like Kevin Thomson support the fans' right to "get carried away" by the team's stunning form, despite historical precedents of other teams' collapses.</p>
