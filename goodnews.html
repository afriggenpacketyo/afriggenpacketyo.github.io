At the Qatar Economic Forum, Musk explained that he feels he has "done enough" in terms of political spending, although he left open the possibility of future donations if he sees a compelling reason. Musk previously spent over $250 million supporting Trump's reelection and more than $19 million aiding Republicans in the 2024 congressional elections.

The decision follows what appears to be a compromise involving a gas pipeline agreement with the state. The project, which will be the first to deliver electricity directly to New York City, had been temporarily stopped due to concerns raised by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum regarding the project's approval process. Governor Kathy Hochul stated that the project supports 1,500 union jobs, and Equinor aims to begin commercial operations in 2027.</p>

          <p>The gold-silver ratio, which compares the price of gold to the price of silver, is a useful metric for precious metal investors. It indicates how many ounces of silver are needed to purchase one ounce of gold, helping investors assess whether silver is relatively undervalued or overvalued compared to gold. A high ratio may suggest that silver is undervalued, while a lower ratio may suggest the opposite. Investors use this ratio to inform their decisions on whether to favor silver or gold in their investment strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seniors considering tapping into their home equity can choose between a home equity line of credit (HELOC) and a reverse mortgage, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. HELOCs offer a flexible credit line with lower interest rates but require monthly payments, while reverse mortgages allow seniors to access equity without immediate repayment, accruing interest and fees. Experts recommend HELOCs for short-term financing needs with manageable payments, while reverse mortgages are more suitable for seniors with limited income seeking to age in place. Consulting with a professional is crucial to determine the best option based on individual circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>
