          <p>Poland is holding a presidential runoff election featuring pro-EU Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and conservative nationalist Karol Nawrocki, supported by the opposition Law and Justice party. The winner will succeed the current president, Andrzej Duda, and the outcome will significantly impact Poland's relationship with the European Union and its internal policies. This election is crucial for determining the future direction of Poland's political landscape and its international alliances. The results will reflect the country's divided views on European integration and national identity. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A palliative care physician reflects on the meaning of living fully in the face of death, drawing on experiences with patients facing terminal illnesses. The article contrasts clich√© bucket lists with the more profound and ordinary wishes that arise when people confront their mortality, such as reconciling with estranged family or fulfilling long-postponed personal goals. The author suggests that awareness of death can illuminate what truly matters in life, leading to a more authentic and meaningful existence. Ultimately, considered reflection on mortality nudges people toward a more complicated version of the ordinary, not novel permutations of extremes.</p>

          <p>Japan, a skateboarding powerhouse, supports the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older starting with the 2028 Los Angeles Games. World Skate implemented the limit in April due to increasing injuries among younger athletes attempting more difficult tricks. Despite the potential impact on Japan's medal prospects, head coach Daisuke Hayakawa believes it is a good decision to protect physically immature children. While domestic competitions may remain open to younger skaters, the focus shifts to supporting the development of older athletes aiming for the Olympics.</p>

          <p>Japan has implemented an amendment to the Penal Code, emphasizing rehabilitation efforts in prisons over strict punishment.

Prison work is now non-mandatory, allowing more time for rehabilitative guidance and education to reduce recidivism. The revised law includes 24 programs tailored to inmates' age, characteristics, and other factors, such as programs for elderly inmates and those with addiction issues.</p>
