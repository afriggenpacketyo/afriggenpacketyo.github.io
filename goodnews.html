          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City and New Jersey area on Saturday night, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the minor tremors were felt across the region but resulted in no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Officials reassured the public that while quakes are rare on the East Coast, this event was not considered significant. The incident was contrasted with a larger 4.8 magnitude earthquake that had rattled the same area in April 2024.</p>

          <p>Shayna Glassman, whose late father was a neighbor of David Berkowitz and was targeted by the 'Son of Sam' killer, has formed an unusual relationship with the infamous murderer, visiting him in prison. Her father, Craig Glassman, received threatening letters and had a fire set outside his door by Berkowitz in 1977. Despite her family's disapproval, Shayna initiated contact with Berkowitz, seeking a deeper understanding and a connection to her deceased father's story. She describes their relationship as non-romantic but psychologically complex, viewing it as her way of processing a story that has been part of her life since childhood.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a Marine Corps veteran, has been released from ICE custody after being detained for two months in Louisiana. Clouatre, who had recently given birth and was breastfeeding, was arrested in May during what she believed was a routine green card interview, due to an old deportation order she was unaware of. Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, campaigned for her release, which was supported by the office of Senator John Kennedy. Now reunited with her family, Paola must wear an ankle monitor and attend regular check-ins with an ICE officer while her immigration case proceeds.</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has transformed from a niche experiment into a foundational technology for global finance, now valued at over $420 billion. Originally conceived as a 'programmable money' platform, it now underpins decentralized finance, NFTs, and trillions of dollars in stablecoin transactions. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are building on Ethereum, using it to tokenize assets and create more efficient financial systems. Despite its success, founder Vitalik Buterin warns of the risk of centralization as mainstream adoption grows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana are establishing a new left-wing political party in the UK, which has already garnered over 600,000 registered supporters. Unconventionally, the party has been launched without an official name; the founders are asking supporters to propose one as part of a broader debate on the party's platform. Before it can field candidates in elections, the new entity must register a name with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties. The move highlights a desire to build a brand that resonates in a modern, digital political landscape.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have solidified Luka Dončić's position as the franchise's new centerpiece by signing him to a three-year, $165 million contract extension. The team's public celebration and praise for Dončić's inner circle signal a clear shift in focus, intensifying questions about the future role of LeBron James. James, who is 40 and under contract for only one more season, has historically been the focal point of his teams. General Manager Rob Pelinka expressed hope that James would retire as a Laker but acknowledged the decision rests with James and his family, indicating a degree of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the early death of his stepfather was the catalyst for his decision to leave medicine and pursue a career in entertainment. Hill, who qualified as a doctor in 1988, felt unsuited for the profession and recalled feeling 'completely out of my depth' when breaking tragic news to patients. His stepfather's death at age 54 made him realize he did not want to spend his life in a career he wasn't passionate about. He subsequently found widespread fame with shows like 'Harry Hill's TV Burp,' though he admits he does not miss the stress of its weekly production schedule.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more 'careful' with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift comes as China's tech companies are rapidly advancing and releasing their own powerful open-source models. Renowned computer scientist Andrew Ng suggests that China's competitive 'Darwinian' open-source ecosystem may be its path to surpassing the U.S. in AI. Recently, Chinese firms like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have launched new open-source video and language models, claiming they are among the most advanced in the world.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia in 1943 has finally been solved. The platypus, named Winston, was a secret diplomatic gift during World War II, but perished just days before reaching England. For decades, it was rumored the creature died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, recent archival research by students at the University of Sydney revealed logbooks showing the platypus was exposed to prolonged high temperatures as the ship crossed the equator, suggesting it likely died from heat stress.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using large-scale theme parks as a strategy to boost its domestic economy and fuel consumer spending. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest addition to a rapidly growing attractions industry, which is forecast to expand by 19% annually over the next three years. According to the global association for the theme park industry, these attractions serve as significant economic drivers for local economies. For every one yuan of operating revenue a park generates, it creates an estimated 3.8 yuan of broader economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>
