          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator reported that President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel and aluminum was not discussed during recent talks with U.S. officials in Washington. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's minister in charge of economic policy, stated that the Japanese government would closely monitor the specific details of the measures. Regarding Nippon Steel Corp.'s plan to acquire United States Steel Corp., Akazawa expressed optimism for a positive announcement from the Trump administration. Japan and the U.S. are planning a meeting between Prime Minister Ishiba and Trump at the G7 summit in Canada.</p>

          <p>Germany's national police chief, Dieter Romann, has given a positive initial assessment of the country's tightened border controls. He dismissed concerns from the police union about overburdened personnel, asserting that the Federal Police should be able to manage the situation effectively. Since the reintroduction of temporary border checks in September 2024, nearly 1,200 additional officers have been deployed, bringing the total to between 13,000 and 14,000. Romann rejected the idea that personnel would be withdrawn from other operational areas, such as train stations, to reinforce border controls.</p>

They highlight lessons from past poor people's movements, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), led by Black women. The NWRO staged mass marches and demonstrations, demanding a guaranteed adequate income and challenging societal norms. The authors propose four strategic principles based on the "Johnnie Tillmon model" to unite the poor and build lasting power.</p>

          <p>Dermatologists advise wearing sunscreen on airplanes, especially when seated by a window, due to the risk of UVA ray exposure. Airplane windows block most UVB rays, which cause sunburn, but not all UVA rays, which contribute to premature aging and skin cancer. A 2015 study indicated that pilots and cabin crew have a higher incidence of melanoma compared to the general population. Experts recommend using broad-spectrum sunscreen and other protective measures like hats and sunglasses during flights.</p>

Buckley, known for his wit and congeniality, founded National Review and hosted Firing Line. He aimed to articulate a coherent conservative philosophy but struggled, ultimately promoting a blend of aristocratic libertarianism and Catholic charity. He played a pivotal role in shaping the modern right and supported figures like Reagan, though their relationship evolved over time.</p>
