          <p>Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal has expressed his dissatisfaction with the current direction of the NBA, stating that the league has become "soft." O'Neal criticized the trend of centers shooting 3-pointers and voiced his preference for dominant big men playing in the paint. He also expressed his disapproval of the current NBA All-Star game format, noting the lack of effort from players and the decline in the game's quality. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has announced that next year's All-Star game will feature a USA vs. World format, though the specific details are yet to be determined.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is assessing the implications of Operation Spider's Web, a large-scale assault on Russia's strategic aviation, with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) releasing footage of the attacks. Ukrainian analysts consider the operation a success, demonstrating Ukraine's strength and creativity in striking distant enemies, with President Zelenskyy claiming 41 aircraft were damaged or destroyed. The SBU released footage showing drones targeting Russian strategic bombers, transport aircraft, and AWACS, while satellite imagery showed the wreckage of planes at various airbases. The use of specially constructed containers to transport armed drones close to Russian airbases was also highlighted, marking a potential turning point in the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coordinated national effort to combat organized retail theft resulted in hundreds of arrests across 28 states. The initiative, led by the Cook County regional organized crime taskforce, involved over 100 law enforcement agencies and 30 major retailers, including Target, Macy‚Äôs, and Walgreens. Retailers played a crucial role by providing information on criminal activity. Authorities say organized retail crime, involving coordinated theft for profit, has become more sophisticated and widespread. The Cook County state‚Äôs attorney has prioritized combating retail theft, pursuing felony charges for stolen goods exceeding $300 or for repeat offenders.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has signed striker Liam Delap from Ipswich Town in a ¬£30 million deal. Delap, who scored 12 goals in 37 top-flight appearances last term, expressed excitement about joining the club and contributing to their trophy aspirations. Having emerged from Manchester City's academy, Delap had loan spells before joining Ipswich in 2024. Chelsea's qualification for the Champions League provides Delap with the opportunity to compete in the competition, though his participation in the European Under-21 Championships is now unlikely.</p>
