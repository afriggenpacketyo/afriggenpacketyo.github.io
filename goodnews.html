          <p>An NPR correspondent shares a personal reflection from a peaceful woodland west of London, a mature woodland also serving as a burial ground. The article contemplates the meaning of "home" after years of living overseas, emphasizing the privilege of peace that allows one to return to family, even in death. This tranquil setting provides a stark contrast to the horrors of war witnessed by colleagues, where many families are deprived of properly marking their loved ones' deaths. The author expresses gratitude for this sanctuary amidst global turmoil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homebuyers and homeowners considering refinancing face challenges due to high mortgage rates and limited housing inventory, though strong credit can help secure favorable terms. As of September 10, 2025, average national rates are 5.76% for 15-year mortgages and 6.58% for 30-year mortgages, with refinance rates slightly higher. Experts suggest potential relief if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, which could stabilize or lower mortgage rates. Borrowers are advised to improve credit, compare lenders, and consider loan terms and fees to secure the best possible financial outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wholesale prices, measured by the Producer Price Index (PPI), unexpectedly fell 0.1% in August, providing strong support for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut this month. This decline, following a downward revision for July, was contrary to economist expectations for a rise. The core PPI also decreased, driven by a drop in services prices. Market futures gained, and odds for a rate cut increased, with analysts suggesting little to stop the Fed from easing monetary policy. This data point is crucial ahead of the Fed's decision and Thursday's consumer price index release. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global financial investors are cautiously entering Hong Kong's market, aiming to avoid undue attention due to rising geopolitical tensions, according to Clara Chan, CEO of the Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC). The HKIC, a government-owned fund, is facilitating this "low profile" capital flow, helping to "protect" investees from geopolitical risks. Chan noted a "great velocity" of capital, with many long-term investors believing they should not miss opportunities in Hong Kong or via Hong Kong into mainland China. This indicates a strategic, albeit discreet, confidence in the region's financial prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Universities of Kent and Greenwich are set to merge by autumn 2026, creating the UK's first "super-university," to be named London and South East University Group. This move, welcomed by England's higher education regulator, aims to provide a strong financial foundation amid economic challenges, as many universities face deficits. While officials insist it's not a takeover, the University and College Union predicts "almost certainly" redundancies, raising concerns about staff stability. The new institution will serve nearly 50,000 students across existing campuses, with degrees still awarded under individual university names.</p>

          <p>Total mortgage application volume jumped 9.2% last week, reaching its highest level in three years, driven by a sharp decline in mortgage interest rates. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 6.49% from 6.64%, spurring both purchase and refinance applications. This downward rate movement, the lowest since October 2024, indicates a weakening labor market. The increase in demand suggests that lower rates are encouraging homebuyers and current homeowners to engage in the market, with adjustable-rate mortgages also seeing a pickup.
