          <p>President Trump is reportedly poised to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the royal family of Qatar for use as Air Force One. The plane, estimated to cost around $400 million, would be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation at the conclusion of his second term. Qatar's Media Attach√© to the U.S. confirmed that the possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is under consideration between Qatar's Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense. Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres has urged an investigation into the potential ethical implications of accepting such a valuable gift from a foreign government.</p>

          <p>The first group of Afrikaner South Africans, who were granted refugee status by the U.S., departed from Johannesburg en route to Washington, D.C., following President Trump's executive order to resettle them due to alleged "government-sponsored race-based discrimination." The initiative has sparked controversy, with South Africa's government denying any racially motivated discrimination and criticizing the resettlement as politically motivated. The processing of these refugees has been unusually fast compared to the typical 18-24 month period for other refugees. The U.S. State Department maintains that it is prioritizing resettlement for Afrikaners who are victims of unjust racial discrimination.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry‚Äôs emotional plea to reconcile with his father, King Charles III, has resurfaced bitter ruptures within the royal family, potentially undermining the monarchy‚Äôs attempts to model unity. Harry‚Äôs comments, made in a recent interview, followed a legal defeat over his security arrangements in Britain. Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles finds a way to heal the rift with Harry, it could define his reign, undercutting the messages of tolerance and inclusiveness that he has long championed. William has been thrust into a more public role due to his father's illness and his brother's estrangement.</p>
