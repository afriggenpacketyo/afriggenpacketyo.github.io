          <h2>High Court Rejects Legal Challenge, Allowing Wimbledon Expansion to Proceed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 10:14:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK High Court judge has dismissed a legal challenge from the campaign group Save Wimbledon Park, clearing the way for the All England Club to proceed with its expansion plans. The proposal aims to nearly triple the size of the Wimbledon site by adding 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on adjacent parkland. The judge ruled that the Greater London Authority's decision to grant planning permission was a rational and properly exercised judgment, despite arguments that the land was protected by restrictive covenants. This expansion will also allow the club to host its qualifying tournament on-site for the first time.</p>

          <h2>Southwest Airlines to End Open Seating Policy, Introducing Assigned Seats in Early 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 10:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced a major shift in its long-standing business model, confirming it will eliminate its open seating policy and introduce assigned seats starting January 27, 2026. The change, part of a broader overhaul to generate new revenue, will replace the current A-B-C boarding groups with an eight-group system based on seat selection, elite status, and fare type. Customers will be able to purchase tickets with assigned seats beginning July 29, 2025. This move follows the airline's decision to also begin charging many customers for checked bags, ending another key policy differentiator.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Advise on Common Mistakes to Avoid When a CD Matures</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As many high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs) opened during the 2023-2024 rate surge begin to mature, financial experts are cautioning savers against common pitfalls. One major mistake is allowing a CD to automatically renew, as renewal rates are often significantly lower than the promotional rates initially offered. Experts also advise against chasing the highest available rate without considering the term length and your own liquidity needs. Instead of letting a CD roll over, savers should use the maturity date as an opportunity to reassess their financial goals and shop around for the best rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new company, The Ether Machine, is set to begin trading on the Nasdaq with the goal of becoming the largest public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. The firm plans to replicate the accumulation strategy of MicroStrategy but will focus on ether instead of bitcoin, differentiating itself by generating yield through staking. Proponents argue that staking makes ether a more productive asset than bitcoin, allowing it to function as a foundational layer for tokenizing a wide range of real-world assets. The company's debut comes as ether gains prominence due to new U.S. stablecoin regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Workplace strategist Mita Mallick recounts how blunt criticism from a former boss became a pivotal moment in her career. Early in her professional life, Mallick was hesitant to speak in meetings, which led her manager to tell her she was a "wallflower" and that "no one knows what you do here." While devastated by the harsh delivery, she recognized it as necessary feedback that motivated her to overcome her shyness and develop her communication skills. Mallick emphasizes that although the feedback was not delivered with kindness, it was the catalyst she needed to grow into the confident speaker and leader she is today.</p>

          <p>New research from the JPMorganChase Institute reveals a growing trend of Americans shifting money from traditional checking and savings accounts into vehicles that provide investment income, such as brokerage accounts and CDs. This shift helps explain the surprising resilience of U.S. consumer spending despite recent economic uncertainty. The analysis of 4.7 million households found that while balances in standard bank accounts are flat, total household cash reserves are growing when these other investment accounts are included. This indicates that families are actively managing their cash in a higher-interest-rate environment to generate returns. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the developmental benefits of involving children in household chores, arguing that many parents inadvertently discourage their kids' natural willingness to help. Researchers suggest that when parents take over tasks for efficiency or immediately correct a child's clumsy efforts, they diminish the child's enthusiasm and sense of competence. Engaging in chores helps children develop crucial skills like executive function, motor control, and responsibility, while also fostering a sense of belonging within the family. Rather than using bribes or charts, experts recommend turning chores into a collaborative social activity to cultivate these benefits.</p>

To secure the best possible rate in the current high-rate environment, experts advise borrowers to strengthen their credit profile, aiming for a score in the mid-to-high 700s.

          <p>Eric Jackson, founder of EMJ Capital, has made a highly ambitious long-term price prediction for Ethereum, suggesting its value could eventually reach $1.5 million per token. His reasoning is based on the idea that global commerce will increasingly move onto blockchain systems, with Ethereum serving as the dominant transactional platform. Jackson points to the growth of stablecoins and the tokenization of real-world assets, sectors where Ethereum is a leader, as key drivers for this potential surge. While this long-term view is exceptionally bullish, he also offered a more immediate cycle prediction of $10,000 to $15,000 for ETH. (not investment advice)</p>
