          <p>Poland is holding a crucial presidential runoff election between Warsaw's mayor, Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative candidate backed by President Trump. The election is seen as pivotal due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and concerns over Russian influence, with differing views on Poland's relationship with the EU and the US at stake. Nawrocki, who met with Trump, advocates for closer ties with the US, while Trzaskowski favors stronger connections with Brussels, Berlin, and Paris. The outcome could significantly impact Poland's domestic and foreign policies, particularly regarding judicial independence and alignment with either the EU or the US.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults shares five simple rules for effective parenting, emphasizing instinct, culture, and individual attention. The rules include trusting parental instincts, following cultural traditions, understanding the child's unique interests, focusing on enjoyment rather than strict development, and being authentic. The psychiatrist argues that parents should prioritize love and attention over striving for perfection, as children learn best when they are happy, relaxed, and engaged in playful activities with caring individuals. This approach aims to reduce parental anxiety and promote healthy youth development.</p>
