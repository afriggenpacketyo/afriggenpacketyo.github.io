          <p>The Dalai Lama marked his 90th birthday with celebrations in Dharamshala, India, vowing to continue defying Chinese control over Tibetan Buddhism. The Nobel laureate used the occasion to address concerns about his succession, stating he intends to reincarnate and that his non-profit trust holds the sole authority to recognize his successor, a direct challenge to Beijing's claim that it must approve the process. The event, attended by global followers and officials, highlighted his enduring influence as a spiritual leader and his commitment to advocating for Tibetan autonomy and religious freedom.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter performed for 65,000 fans at London's BST Festival, delivering a show that was noticeably more toned down than some of her recent, more controversial appearances. The article notes that while she maintained her signature charm and energy, she adapted her set for a more family-friendly audience, forgoing some of her racier choreography. This shift comes after criticism of a pre-watershed TV performance and her original album artwork. The performance demonstrated her professionalism and ability to cater her act to different contexts while still captivating a massive crowd.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally submitted what it calls a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated proposal for a 60-day ceasefire and hostage exchange. While the group stated it is ready for immediate negotiations on implementation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office deemed the changes requested by Hamas as "unacceptable." Despite this, Israel will send a negotiating team to Doha, Qatar, on Sunday to continue discussions. The proposal reportedly includes the release of 10 living hostages and the remains of 15 others over the 60-day truce period, with talks on a permanent ceasefire to occur concurrently.</p>

          <p>Young people in the UK are finding it increasingly difficult to secure summer or part-time jobs, often facing the challenge of needing experience to get experience. This article provides practical advice from careers experts on how to overcome this hurdle. Recommendations include highlighting skills from volunteering or teamwork, keeping CVs simple and targeted, and preparing thoroughly for interviews. Experts also suggest that dropping off CVs in person at smaller businesses can still be effective, as it demonstrates initiative and allows for a personal connection that online applications lack.</p>

          <h2>The Pros and Cons of Lifetime ISAs for Young Savers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:05 EDT</div>

          <p>The Lifetime ISA (LISA), a UK savings vehicle, is designed to help those under 40 save for a first home or retirement with a 25% government bonus on up to £4,000 saved annually. While some users praise it as an excellent tool that helped them buy property, others criticize its significant drawbacks. Key issues include a harsh penalty for early withdrawal that can cost savers their own money, and a property price cap of £450,000 that has not been updated since 2017, making it obsolete in many high-priced areas. These flaws have led to calls for reform from financial experts and a UK parliamentary committee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Newport Beach, California, conducted 350 rescues on July Fourth as dangerous surf conditions created powerful rip currents. One particularly large "monster rip current" pulled more than 10 swimmers far from shore, requiring a major rescue effort involving lifeboats and aerial support. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for strong rip currents and high surf for much of Southern California through the holiday weekend. The incidents serve as a stark reminder of ocean dangers as hot weather draws large crowds to the coast.</p>
