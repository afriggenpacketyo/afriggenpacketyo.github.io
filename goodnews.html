        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is developing a compensation plan for victims of mis-sold car finance, with initial payouts anticipated next year. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while hidden commissions are not inherently unlawful, excessively large ones can be deemed unfair. The proposed scheme, estimated to cost the industry between £9 and £18 billion, will likely offer affected motorists less than £950 per deal for agreements dating back to 2007. The FCA will consult on eligibility and compensation amounts starting in October. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are introducing a variety of new spicy menu items to appeal to Gen Z and Gen Alpha diners, who show a strong preference for bold flavors. This trend allows brands like Chipotle, Taco Bell, and Wendy's to create buzz and drive sales with relatively low-cost additions like sauces and seasonings. According to market research, 95% of restaurants now feature at least one spicy option, as it is an effective strategy to re-engage consumers amid slower spending. The trend is heavily amplified by social media platforms like TikTok, where taste tests and challenges go viral.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian has announced it will restore references to Donald Trump's two impeachments in its National Museum for American History exhibit in the coming weeks. The museum faced public concern after a temporary placard detailing the impeachments was removed, sparking fears of historical censorship. In a statement, the Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for presentation and was not the result of pressure from any administration. The updated presentation will be integrated into the existing section on the limits of presidential power, alongside materials on other impeached presidents.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won the Hungarian Grand Prix, skillfully defending against a late charge from his teammate, Oscar Piastri. Norris employed a bold one-stop strategy after a difficult start, which put him in the lead but required him to manage his tires carefully in the final laps. Piastri, on fresher tires, closed the gap and made several attempts to overtake but was unable to pass on the notoriously difficult track. The victory narrows Norris's championship deficit to Piastri to just nine points, while Mercedes' George Russell secured the final podium position after starting from pole.</p>

          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport is progressing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. The structure is now weather-tight, and key infrastructure like baggage systems and ticketing counter areas are visible. As part of a larger $19 billion overhaul of JFK, the new terminal will be the airport's largest and will be dedicated exclusively to international travel. The project aims to modernize aging infrastructure and is designed to be flooded with natural light, featuring a unique microgrid for power resiliency.</p>

The team, composed of Regan Smith, Kate Douglass, Gretchen Walsh, and Torri Huske, clocked a time of 3 minutes, 49.34 seconds. Their victory provided a strong finish for the U.S., which topped the medal table despite challenges with a stomach illness that affected the team's performance earlier in the competition. Meanwhile, Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh secured her fourth individual gold medal of the championships by winning the 400-meter individual medley.</p>

          <p>Footage aired on Chinese state television appears to show the country's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, conducting its first test of an electromagnetic catapult system to launch an aircraft. The brief video segment, part of a series celebrating the People's Liberation Army anniversary, showed a control room operator clearing a jet for take-off. This drill marks a significant milestone for the Fujian, China's first carrier equipped with this modern launch technology, which is more efficient than the ski-jump ramps used on its other carriers. The vessel is expected to officially enter service later this year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For couples facing marital instability without a prenuptial agreement, divorce attorneys recommend two key strategies to protect personal finances. The first is to proactively gather comprehensive information about all shared assets, liabilities, and accounts while access is still readily available. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. While potentially a difficult conversation, attorneys suggest that clearly defining financial boundaries can provide security and prevent more significant conflicts in the future.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, using specific calming and validating phrases can effectively manage children's tantrums. Instead of punishing or dismissing a child's outburst, phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" help a child feel safe and understood. This connection-based approach soothes the child's nervous system and teaches emotional regulation. The goal is to set compassionate boundaries, acknowledging the emotion while stopping harmful actions, which helps prevent future meltdowns by building trust and emotional security.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced it is working "at pace" on a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to receive medical care in the UK. The initiative, expected to be operational within weeks, could allow up to 300 children, each accompanied by a guardian, to enter the country for free treatment. This move follows a Foreign Affairs Committee report criticizing the government's previous refusal to support such evacuations. A British charity, Project Pure Hope, which has already privately funded treatment for three Gazan children, welcomed the plan and offered its expertise to help the government scheme succeed.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across the region on Saturday night, including in New York City and its suburbs. This is the second seismic event to strike the state in less than two weeks. While the quake was relatively weak and caused no immediate reports of damage, officials warned residents about the possibility of aftershocks. Geologists note that New Jersey's Ramapo Fault line produces several small quakes annually, though a stronger 4.8 magnitude earthquake in April 2024 was felt by millions and caused some minor damage.</p>

The philosophy, popularized by bloggers like Mr. Money Mustache and authors like Vicki Robin, focuses on defining what is "enough" for a happy life.

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry, despite being one of the highest-paid athletes, revealed he does not know his exact net worth and prefers to focus on building a meaningful investment portfolio. Financial professionals view this approach positively, suggesting that fixating on a single number can be less productive than focusing on cash flow and values-aligned financial goals. Experts advise that understanding daily income and expenses is more powerful for creating an actionable financial plan. They encourage setting tangible goals that bring a sense of pride and accomplishment, rather than chasing an ever-increasing net worth figure.</p>
