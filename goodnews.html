          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were tarnished by gambling scandals. The league's policy on permanent ineligibility has been changed, with bans now expiring at death. Rose agreed to a permanent ban in 1989 for betting on baseball, while Jackson was implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame's board will now consider their eligibility under existing rules, which also take into account a player's character and integrity.</p>

          <p>Jos√© Mujica, the former president of Uruguay known as the world's "poorest president" for his modest lifestyle, has died at the age of 89. Serving from 2010 to 2015, he refused to live on a presidential estate and gave away most of his salary to help build housing for neglected towns. As a member of the Tupamaro urban guerrilla movement in the late 1960s, he spent over a decade in prison. Under his leadership, Uruguay legalized same-sex marriage and became the first country in the world to legalize and fully regulate marijuana.</p>

Researchers at Radboud University based their calculations on a reinterpretation of Stephen Hawking's theorem on black hole radiation. The study focused on the decay of white dwarf stars to set an upper limit for the lifetime of matter in the universe. While the end is sooner than expected, it is still trillions of years in the future.</p>

          <p>Chime Financial paid the NBA's Dallas Mavericks roughly $33 million over three years to have its logo worn as a patch on player jerseys, the company disclosed in its IPO filing Tuesday. The Mavericks finalized the jersey deal, along with "certain other sponsorship and promotional rights," in 2020, but terms weren't announced. Cynthia Marshall, who was CEO for the Mavericks from 2018 until December of last year, is on Chime's board, so the company included details of the arrangement in the related party transactions section of its filing.</p>
