          <h2>Singapore's Economy Avoids Technical Recession with 1.4% Q2 Growth</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore successfully avoided a technical recession by posting 1.4% GDP growth in the second quarter of 2025, reversing a 0.5% contraction from the previous quarter. This growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors, with some analysts attributing the boost to businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential tariff changes. Despite the positive figures, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year due to unclear U.S. tariff policies. This economic context precedes an upcoming monetary policy decision by the nation's central bank.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's value has surged to a new record high, breaking the $120,000 mark, a rally largely attributed to substantial inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This momentum is further supported by growing institutional investment and anticipation of clearer U.S. regulatory frameworks for digital assets, with several crypto-related bills under consideration by Congress. Analysts suggest that increased institutional buying and growing policy clarity are key drivers, with some predicting further appreciation. However, the potential for continued hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve policies and interest rate hikes remains a significant risk to the cryptocurrency's outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a meeting in Beijing, Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Chinese Vice President Han Zheng discussed advancing practical cooperation and normalizing bilateral ties. Both sides acknowledged the 75th anniversary of their diplomatic relations, with Jaishankar noting a "positive trajectory" and calling for open dialogue to navigate an increasingly complex international situation. This high-level engagement follows recent talks between the nations' defense ministers aimed at finding a permanent solution to their long-standing border dispute. The discussions, held on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting, represent a continued thaw in relations after years of tension.</p>

          <p>Ahead of The Open's return to Portrush, golfer Shane Lowry reflects on his memorable 2019 victory and the intense pressure he faced. He recalls the final 24 hours as one of the toughest of his life but credits his previous failure at the 2016 U.S. Open for teaching him to play to win rather than not to lose. Lowry discusses the importance of celebrating major victories, noting that other players have expressed regret for not enjoying their own moments more. While he cherishes the memory, he emphasizes his continued drive for more major titles, stating he would be happy with his career if it ended today but still wants more success.</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated that the central bank is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK's job market continues to slow. In an interview, Bailey stated his belief that the path for rates is downward, citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay increases, partly in response to a recent hike in employers' national insurance contributions. With job vacancies falling to their lowest level since 2021 and the economy contracting in May, many economists anticipate a rate cut at the Bank's next meeting in August. The current interest rate stands at 4.25%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing expectations and bolstered by strong demand from Southeast Asian and European markets, while a temporary tariff truce with the U.S. slowed the decline in shipments to America. Imports also saw their first increase of the year, rising 1.1%, though this was below forecasts. The data revealed a surge in exports of rare earths and steel, alongside growth in shipments to Vietnam, a common route for sidestepping U.S. tariffs. Despite the positive first-half performance, economists caution that the export momentum may falter due to continued uncertainty over U.S. trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

In a market where nearly 94% of new cars are electric, Chinese brands have secured about 10% of sales, posing a significant challenge to Tesla and traditional European automakers. Unlike the U.S. and EU, Norway has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs, allowing them to compete effectively on price and technology.
