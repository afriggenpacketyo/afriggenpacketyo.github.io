          <p>Defending US Open champion Aryna Sabalenka secured her place in the quarter-finals with a dominant 6-1, 6-4 victory over unseeded Spaniard Cristina Bucsa on Louis Armstrong Stadium. The 27-year-old Belarusian, who clinched her first US Open title last September, emphasized that her current motivation is to win more major titles, rather than the pressure of defending her previous success. Sabalenka, the top seed, has advanced through the tournament without dropping a single set, demonstrating formidable form and a clear focus on her objectives. She is now set to face 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the last eight, aiming to become the first player to successfully defend the US Open women's singles title since Serena Williams in 2014.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba Group Holdings surged nearly 19% following better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results, primarily driven by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing unit and a continued revival in its e-commerce business. The company reported a substantial 78% increase in net income, attributed largely to gains from equity investments and the disposal of Turkish e-commerce firm Trendyol, though core profitability faced pressure from significant investments in "quick commerce." Alibaba's cloud division, a key area for monetizing artificial intelligence, saw revenue jump 26% year-on-year, with AI-related product revenue maintaining triple-digit growth. This article highlights investor confidence in Alibaba's strategic focus on AI and its delicate balancing act within China's competitive market, despite challenges in its core e-commerce segment.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping called for strengthened artificial intelligence cooperation among Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) members and explicitly rejected a "Cold War mentality" at the largest-ever SCO summit in Tianjin. Attended by over 20 foreign leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the meeting served as a crucial platform for China to project itself as a global peacemaker amidst persistent trade tensions with the United States, the war in Ukraine, and the Israel-Hamas conflict. Xi highlighted China's substantial $84 billion investment in SCO countries and pledged support for vocational education programs, emphasizing a new phase of high-quality development and cooperation within the bloc.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 01:14:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail has permanently abolished peak rail fares across Scotland starting September 1, a significant policy change aimed at making train travel considerably cheaper for many passengers. This initiative means a rail ticket from Edinburgh to Glasgow will be nearly 50% cheaper, with trips between Perth and Dundee seeing a third less than previous costs. The move, championed by the Scottish Greens, seeks to encourage more commuters to use trains instead of cars, simplify ticketing, and reduce carbon emissions. While a previous pilot scheme in 2023 ended due to limited success and cost concerns, First Minister John Swinney announced the permanent change, citing improved national finances and strong calls from commuters, climate activists, and the business community.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with the private RatingDog purchasing managers' index (PMI) rising to 50.5, sharply beating Reuters' estimates and marking the fastest expansion since March. This improvement was primarily driven by a recovery in new export orders, suggesting a notable resilience in external demand despite ongoing trade tensions and tariffs with the U.S. However, the gains in overall output and new orders remained somewhat muted, indicating persistent weakness in domestic demand. While average raw material costs rose, prompting some businesses to pass on expenses, overall business confidence improved. Yet, employment in the manufacturing sector remained bleak, with job reductions for a fifth consecutive month, highlighting that the durability of this upturn hinges on sustained export stability and a stronger pickup in domestic demand.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, with peace talks reportedly "turbocharged" by recent U.S. tariffs on Indian imports. This article highlights India's strategic autonomy in response to strained U.S. ties, prompting it to seek new opportunities with China, the world's second-largest economy. Despite the positive tone of the meeting, significant roadblocks persist, including unresolved border issues where tens of thousands of troops remain deployed, and India's burgeoning trade deficit with China. This rapprochement could create complex geopolitical challenges for India, especially with its upcoming Quad summit, potentially testing the renewed synergy between Delhi and Beijing. The article questions whether closer ties with China will ultimately aid or hinder India's ongoing negotiations with the U.S., its largest trading partner.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has soared to an estimated $1.1 billion, making it the fifth-largest prize in the game's history, after no one matched all six winning numbers in Saturday's drawing.

Nine tickets across the U.S., including four sold in California, successfully matched all five white balls, earning each winner over $1.1 million due to the pari-mutuel payout system. The next drawing offers potential winners a choice between periodic payments totaling an estimated $1.1 billion or a lump sum estimated at $498.4 million, both calculated before taxes.
