          <p>Alex Palou became the first Spanish driver to win the Indianapolis 500, triumphing over Marcus Ericsson in the final laps. The race was marred by several incidents, including Scott McLaughlin crashing during warm-up laps and Kyle Larson crashing out mid-race. Josef Newgarden's attempt at a three-peat ended due to a fuel pump issue. The race was briefly delayed due to rain, adding to the chaotic nature of the event, which included brake fires and pit road collisions.</p>

          <p>Following a disappointing campaign, Manchester City is expected to undergo a period of transition both on and off the pitch. Key players like Kevin de Bruyne are departing, and there are uncertainties surrounding the future of others such as Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva. New faces are anticipated, especially in positions where the team is weaker. Guardiola has expressed confidence in the existing squad, stating that he doesn't feel a major rebuild is necessary, but new players will be brought in to strengthen weaker areas.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani threw a live batting practice session, marking a significant step in his recovery from Tommy John surgery. It was his first time facing live hitters in a Dodger uniform, 19 months after the procedure. Ohtani threw 22 pitches, reaching speeds of 94-97 mph with his fastball and incorporating his full repertoire, including his sweeper. While the Dodgers are cautious about setting a specific timeline, it is unlikely that Ohtani will pitch in any big-league games before the All-Star break.</p>

The motion, lodged by the university‚Äôs Friends of Palestine group, expressed solidarity with Palestinians and accused Israel of being an apartheid state committing ongoing genocide. Jewish students protested the motion and put forward amendments, but these were rejected. The UMSU apologized for the length of time it took to consider the motion and said it would be reviewing its democratic processes.</p>

          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting is More Effective, Says Expert</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, an expert has developed a new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting." This approach focuses on being deeply attuned to a child's emotional needs and creating a safe space for them to express their feelings. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without rushing to fix or dismiss them, and they respond without shaming their child. The expert teaches parents not just how to manage their children's behaviors, but also to help them build emotional resilience, trust and connection through open and honest conversations.</p>
