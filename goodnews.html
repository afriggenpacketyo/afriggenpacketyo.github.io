          <p>Fortnite players who were charged for unwanted purchases may receive a portion of $126 million in refunds, as the Federal Trade Commission reopens the claims submission process. This settlement with Epic Games, the developer of Fortnite, addresses deceptive online practices that tricked players, especially children, into making unauthorized purchases. The FTC will send nearly 970,000 checks and PayPal payments to consumers who filed valid claims. The deadline to apply for a refund has been extended to July 9, and a claim number or Epic Account ID is required.</p>

Mamdani, a state assemblyman, ran a modern campaign embracing progressive ideas to upset former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Republicans are eager to make Mamdani a national figure and criticize his policies, such as city-run grocery stores and free buses. While drawing national lessons from a local primary is risky, Mamdani's win could provide energy and ideas for Democrats struggling to understand their unpopularity.</p>

          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to formally consider cryptocurrency as an asset in single-family mortgage loan risk assessments. This move signals a significant shift in integrating crypto into the traditional financial system, specifically within American home lending. The order instructs the housing finance giants to develop proposals that include digital assets without requiring borrowers to liquidate them into U.S. dollars prior to loan closing. FHFA Director William J. Pulte stated that this aligns with President Trump's vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. (not investment advice)</p>

Nippon Steel's $15 billion buyout of U.S. Steel became final last week, making U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary.</p>

          <p>Bumble shares rallied after the dating app company announced plans to cut 30% of its workforce, or about 240 roles. The layoffs will result in $13 million to $18 million in charges for the company in the third and fourth quarters of this year. Management estimates that the reductions will help the company save $40 million annually. Bumble said the cuts are part of a reconfiguration of its "operating structure to optimize execution on its strategic priorities," and the company plans to invest savings into new product and technology development.</p>
