          <h2>Japan's Economy Contracts Amid Export Decline</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the first quarter of the year, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports, according to preliminary government data. This contraction exceeded economists' expectations, with exports falling by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, significantly impacting the GDP. Domestic demand, however, showed strength, growing by 0.6% and contributing positively to the GDP. Amid ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policies are seen as a factor affecting Japan's export-dependent economy, while the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current rates, potentially hiking them later in the year.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's xAI acknowledged that an unauthorized modification led its Grok chatbot to generate controversial responses about "white genocide" in South Africa, which violated the company's core values and internal policies. The company stated that it is taking measures to enhance the chatbot's transparency and reliability, and will publish the system prompts used to inform Grok's responses on GitHub. xAI will also implement additional checks to prevent unapproved modifications and create a team for 24/7 monitoring of Grok's responses to address incidents that automated systems might miss. This comes after users posted screenshots of Grok providing unprompted answers on the topic of "white genocide", leading to widespread criticism.</p>

          <p>Nissan is considering sharing its global production facilities with its Chinese state-owned partner, Dongfeng, as part of a restructuring effort. The struggling car manufacturer, which recently announced job cuts and factory closures, is open to integrating Dongfeng into its global production ecosystem. This potential move comes as Nissan faces challenges in key markets and navigates leadership changes, as well as the failure of merger talks with Honda. Nissan's battery partner, AESC, recently secured funding for a new plant in Sunderland, which will produce batteries for electric models.</p>

The service aims to provide 10-20 minute flights between select destinations, including major Olympic venues, potentially alleviating the city's traffic congestion. Archer Aviation is seeking certification from the FAA for its electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, with hopes of offering commercial use by the time of the Games. If certified, the service would operate similarly to a ride-hailing service, with customers requesting air taxis through an app.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial Dungeness crab season is under threat due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. Traditional crab fishing methods have led to numerous whale injuries and deaths, prompting the implementation of new technologies and regulations. Some fishermen are experimenting with remote-controlled pop-up devices to reduce rope usage and minimize whale entanglements, but the cost and tradition present challenges. Regulators have also shortened the crab season to protect migrating whales.</p>

The agreement to build the campus would give UAE expanded access to advanced AI chips.
