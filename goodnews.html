Roman Martin's two-RBI triple in the eighth inning provided a cushion, and freshman Easton Hawk closed out the game for the save. UCLA is now one win away from advancing to the College World Series, showcasing their resilience and defensive prowess in a tightly contested match.</p>

The decision comes as Google's emoji have become more globally prevalent, leading Docomo to adopt Noto Color Emoji by Google or Samsung emoji for its new Android smartphones and feature phones. Introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service, Docomo's emoji gained widespread popularity in Japan before spreading globally, and in 2016, the set was included in the Museum of Modern Art's collection.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's "996" work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. Venture capitalists have sparked debate by suggesting that overwork is necessary for European startups to compete globally. However, many founders argue that sustainable innovation, adequate funding, and work-life balance are more critical for success. They emphasize that the "996" culture can lead to burnout, decreased retention, and a revolving door of talent, contrasting with the European mindset and regulations.</p>
