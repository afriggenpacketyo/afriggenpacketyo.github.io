          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 22:11:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump as much as 14% during its Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised $4.6 billion, with 90% of the funds allocated to constructing a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. This expansion aligns with the global push from Chinese EV makers, though it faces challenges due to tariffs imposed by the U.S. and EU. CATL's revenue experienced a slight dip due to intense competition in China's EV market, but net profit still increased by 15% year over year.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction in seven months, as a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions provide room for monetary easing. The 1-year loan prime rate was lowered to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. This move is part of a broader package of stimulus measures aimed at boosting the economy, including reductions to deposit rates and mortgage rates under the nation's housing provident fund. Analysts predict further policy easing, with forecasts of additional lending rate cuts by year-end.</p>

          <p>A new UK-EU deal signifies an attempt to improve trading ties but underscores the ongoing complexities and trade-offs in their relationship post-Brexit. While the government touts improved access to major economies, some Brexiteers criticize the acceptance of "dynamic alignment" with EU rules. The agreement's details, including costs, defense cooperation, youth travel, and professional qualification recognition, are yet to be fully resolved. This deal, expected to be the first of many annual summits, serves as a reminder of the UK's continuing, and perhaps permanent, uneasy relationship with its European neighbors.</p>
