          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a record high after the Liberal Democratic Party elected Sanae Takaichi, a staunch conservative, as its new leader, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. Takaichi is expected to advocate for continued accommodative monetary policy from the Bank of Japan, aligning with the government's "high-pressure economy" strategy. This article highlights investor optimism for economic expansion through public-private partnerships under a Takaichi administration. The yen, however, weakened against the dollar.

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is set to gradually restart some production this week, beginning with its engine factory, following a major cyberattack in late August that halted operations across its global sites. The attack forced JLR to shut down IT systems, impacting car manufacturing and parts distribution, costing an estimated £50 million weekly. The government has provided a £1.5 billion loan guarantee to support affected suppliers, many of whom faced severe financial pressure.

          <p>China is heavily investing in AI and robotics, aiming to reduce its reliance on imported high-end chips and challenge global leader Nvidia. Companies like Alibaba and Huawei have unveiled new chips, with Huawei planning to make its designs public to attract local firms. Nvidia's CEO acknowledged China is "nanoseconds behind," recognizing its vibrant tech industry and talent pool. However, experts caution about the lack of transparent data from Chinese chipmakers and note a performance gap in complex analytics.

          <p>Following President Trump's proposed hike in H-1B visa fees, India is actively encouraging its skilled professionals to return home, aiming to reverse a decades-long "brain drain." While anecdotal evidence suggests some Indians are considering relocation due to a hostile US immigration environment, experts believe a large-scale return will be challenging. The article highlights the rise of Global Capability Centres in India offering new opportunities, but also notes the lack of concerted government effort and persistent "pull" factors from other countries. The uncertainty in US policy could accelerate this trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced significant housing market reforms aimed at cutting costs, reducing delays, and halving failed property sales. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated the changes would "fix the broken system," potentially saving first-time buyers an average of £710 and shortening transaction times by four weeks. Key proposals include legally requiring sellers and agents to provide upfront property information, and potentially introducing binding contracts to prevent late collapses. This article highlights the government's efforts to boost professional standards and increase transparency in the housing sector. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mohamed Salah's reduced defensive work is becoming a "little problem" for Liverpool, particularly against stronger opponents, as it creates a 2v1 overload for the right-back. While manager Arne Slot might allow Salah freedom to conserve energy for attacking, the article argues that players behind him are not providing adequate cover. This tactical imbalance was evident in a recent loss to Chelsea, leading to a lack of game control compared to the previous season. The article suggests Liverpool needs to improve its defensive setup and composure, but remains optimistic about Salah's scoring form and the team's overall improvement over the season.</p>

          <p>Historian Martin Powers explains how visual evidence from imperial China, such as art depicting social hierarchies and political concepts, offers unique insights into historical norms that texts alone might not convey. He argues that art "participates" in political debate, illustrating how intergroup relations and authority were imagined. Powers cites examples like the Han dynasty prime minister story, showing widespread understanding of jurisdictional limits. The article highlights how concepts like Montesquieu's "honour," signifying arbitrary privilege, are evident in both Eastern and Western aristocracies through visual representations of power.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer observes a complacent, speculative bull market, seemingly unaffected by government shutdowns, driven by circular reasoning and a "Trump put" effect. He attributes current market strength to a post-"Liberation Day" rally, where a temporary reversal of tariffs by President Trump spurred buying after a dip. Cramer notes a new generation of buyers chasing high-growth, often unprofitable, tech stocks, leading to "life-changing moves." Despite this "year of magical investing," he advises taking profits to secure gains, emphasizing that even magic can end. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China, having been the world's largest exporter for 16 years, should now pivot its economic strategy to become the largest importer within the next five to ten years. As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, the article suggests this shift is crucial for accelerating its transition to a consumption-driven economy and addressing structural imbalances. Such a move would have profound geopolitical and economic implications, transforming China from an inward-focused economy to a global powerhouse focused on domestic demand.
