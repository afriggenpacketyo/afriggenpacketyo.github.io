          <p>Line dancing is experiencing a significant modern resurgence, shedding its outdated image to become a widespread social media phenomenon, particularly on platforms like TikTok. Enthusiasts like 16-year-old Ava Stratford-Davies credit this renewed popularity to the mainstream appeal of country-pop artists and the adaptation of routines to diverse music genres beyond traditional country. The dance offers a unique blend of low-impact exercise and community building, attracting a younger demographic and breaking previous stereotypes associated with older participants. This article details how social media has been instrumental in expanding its reach and making it more accessible, fostering a vibrant and growing community that defies traditional perceptions and continues to evolve.</p>
