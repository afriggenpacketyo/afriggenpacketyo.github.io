          <p>DoorDash's acquisition of Deliveroo for ¬£2.9 billion underscores the diverging fortunes of US and UK stock markets. The article points out that DoorDash's greater financial power, fueled by its access to US capital markets, enabled the takeover. Companies are increasingly shunning the London Stock Exchange for US listings due to higher valuations and greater investor demand. The article also touches on the government's "Edinburgh Reforms" aimed at making UK listings more attractive, but highlights the continued trend of UK companies being acquired by US firms.

          <p>Hugo Boss shares experienced a surge following the announcement of better-than-expected first-quarter sales, despite a 2% revenue decline adjusted for currency. Weaker sales were primarily attributed to subdued consumer demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China. The company reaffirmed its 2025 outlook, projecting full-year sales between 4.2 billion euros and 4.4 billion euros, while closely monitoring macroeconomic developments and potential impacts from tariffs. The article highlights Hugo Boss's strategic overhaul to broaden its appeal beyond formal wear, although womenswear remains a weak area.</p>

          <p>The REAL ID deadline is now in effect, twenty years after the law was enacted to set federal standards for state-issued identification. The article discusses the origins of the law, the resistance from states citing cost and privacy concerns, and the resulting variety of REAL ID versions. It highlights the impact on individuals who do not have legal status in the U.S., as their state-issued licenses will no longer be accepted in airports. The Trump Administration is now pressuring states that issue licenses to residents without checking immigration status, adding further complexity to the system.</p>

Iovance Biotherapeutics is recommended for its tumor infiltrating lymphocyte treatment for certain types of skin cancer. PepsiCo is suggested as a worthwhile purchase, as its stock is undervalued due to the market's over-rewarding Coca-Cola's approach. (not investment advice)</p>
