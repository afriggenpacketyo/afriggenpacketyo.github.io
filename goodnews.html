        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated that U.S. Steel will remain under American control despite a planned partnership with Nippon Steel Corp. Trump indicated Nippon Steel would have "partial ownership," without providing details on the acquisition. He touted the partnership would create 70,000 jobs and boost the economy by $14 billion. Trump's approval follows a review by federal agencies, and both Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have expressed support for the decision. Optimism is cautiously high as the deal promises economic benefits, but details remain vague, so the deal's ultimate impact is still unknown.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the number detected in 2022. The company attributes the increase to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and improvements in their detection systems. Tripadvisor employs a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to moderate reviews. The article notes that most paid reviews originate from Asia, and Tripadvisor uses AI and behavioral biometrics to identify patterns indicative of fake reviews.</p>

          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner, suggests China should lower its annual GDP growth target to around 4% for the next five to ten years. This recommendation considers the potential for prolonged rivalry with the United States and the need to address structural problems within China. Xu argues that a 4% growth rate would be beneficial if it leads to expanded employment and controlled debt ratios. He highlights challenges such as a shrinking population, falling savings and production rates, and issues in the property sector as reasons for a more conservative growth target (not investment advice).</p>
