          <p>President Trump displayed a trade agreement with the United Kingdom during a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the G7 summit in Canada. He mistakenly referred to the agreement as being with the European Union, later clarified by the White House as being with the UK. Trump downplayed the differences between this agreement and one signed in May, emphasizing that it is a fair deal that will produce jobs and income. The White House provided additional details on steel and aluminum in the US-UK agreement, outlining a quota system for products entering the U.S. without tariffs. The article highlights the ongoing trade negotiations and the importance of these agreements for both the U.S. and its allies.</p>

          <p>Singer Nezza performed a Spanish version of the national anthem, ‚ÄúEl Pend√≥n Estrellado,‚Äù at Dodger Stadium, sparking conversation about the song's origins and the composer, Clotilde Arias. Arias, a Peruvian immigrant, was commissioned by the U.S. State Department in 1945 to create a Spanish translation of the anthem to strengthen ties with Latin American countries. Her version was accepted as the only official translation, but Arias's legacy remained largely unknown until her grandson rediscovered her work. Nezza's performance aims to celebrate Latino contributions to American history and challenge ongoing immigration sweeps.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in NIH research grants was "void and illegal." The cuts, which targeted research with a perceived connection to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), were deemed unlawful racial discrimination. The judge ordered the reinstatement of grants to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit. The ruling highlights the legal challenges to the Trump administration's policies on research funding and DEI initiatives. The judge's decision restores funding that was targeted in a previous cutback.</p>
