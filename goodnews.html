          <p>Marine biologists in East Tennessee are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake for the first time since Hurricane Helene caused significant debris accumulation. The study aims to determine the hurricane's impact on sport fish, comparing current data with surveys from the past 30 years. Initial observations suggest conditions are within normal range, but scientists will continue to analyze the data to assess potential disruptions to shoreline habitat and the broader ecosystem. Sport fishing is a major contributor to the local economy, making the health of the fish population crucial for tourism.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to step up tariff talks with the goal of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement as early as June. Following meetings in Washington, officials announced plans for intense ministerial discussions in mid-May after working-level talks.

The discussions may involve increased Japanese purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans, as well as simplified safety screening for imported cars.</p>
