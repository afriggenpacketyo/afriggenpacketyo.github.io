          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a surge of over 5% after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his purchase of approximately $1 billion worth of the company's shares. This move is widely interpreted by the market as a strong signal of Musk's confidence in the electric vehicle maker's future, despite a recent plunge in sales and increasing competition. The purchase comes as shareholders prepare to vote on a new pay package for Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire if aggressive performance targets are met over the next decade.

          <p>An analysis of energy production costs indicates that renewables, particularly onshore wind and utility-scale solar, are the cheapest forms of energy, even before accounting for government subsidies. The report uses the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) metric, which shows these sources are more affordable to generate than coal, natural gas, or nuclear power. However, the true cost is complex, influenced by factors like tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, which are being phased out by the Trump administration, and new tariffs that could increase costs for projects relying on imported components.</p>

This development reinforces the deep reliance CoreWeave has on Nvidia's GPUs, which are central to its business of renting out AI computing power to clients like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI.

She recommends programs like the Epic SchoolKids Colorado Pack and the Colorado Ski Country USA pass, which offer free or heavily discounted access for elementary school children at numerous resorts. Miner also suggests booking packages that combine lodging and lift tickets, skiing on weekdays, considering smaller resorts, and renting equipment for children until they are teenagers to avoid the expense of them quickly outgrowing it.</p>

          <p>United States and Chinese trade officials have announced a framework agreement to transfer ownership of the social media platform TikTok to a US-controlled entity. The breakthrough, confirmed by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese negotiator Li Chenggang after talks in Madrid, aims to resolve long-standing national security concerns in Washington over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. While the commercial terms between the private parties have reportedly been agreed upon, the final details await approval from President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has reached a market capitalization of $3 trillion, joining an exclusive club that includes only Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged more than 4% on Monday, pushing it past the milestone, partly driven by investor relief over a recent antitrust ruling that imposed lighter-than-feared penalties. This achievement comes as Alphabet navigates increased competition from AI startups and ongoing regulatory scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe, with its shares up over 30% for the year.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and average interest rates near 22%, financial experts are highlighting simple mistakes that can make carrying a balance significantly more expensive. Key errors include making late payments, which can trigger hefty fees and penalty APRs, and allowing a balance to carry over month-to-month, which allows interest to compound daily. The article also notes that failing to explore debt relief strategies, such as 0% balance transfers or debt consolidation loans, is another costly oversight for consumers struggling with high-interest debt.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to implement its first interest rate cut of the year, which could provide some relief for consumers with variable-rate debt. Financial experts advise that while the cut may be small, it's a good time for individuals to take proactive steps with their money. Recommendations include paying down high-interest credit card debt, locking in high returns on savings with CDs before rates drop, and improving credit scores to qualify for better loan terms in the future. For prospective homebuyers, lower rates could also help unfreeze the housing market.</p>
