          <p>Brazilian club Fluminense has made an unexpected run to the Club World Cup semi-finals, where they will face Chelsea. Led by coach Renato Gaúcho and veteran defender Thiago Silva, the team has overcome low expectations with a surprisingly solid defensive performance. The match will be a notable reunion for the 40-year-old Silva, who previously played for Chelsea and won the Champions League with the English club. Despite being considered underdogs, Fluminense's campaign has been marked by strong leadership and tactical adaptability, creating an intriguing matchup against the heavily favored Premier League side.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beijing's export controls on rare earth elements are prompting increased international efforts to diversify supply chains and reduce reliance on China. In response to China's market dominance, new exploration and development projects are underway globally, including an Australian-listed company's project in Brazil and a U.S. partnership to explore deposits in Kazakhstan. While these initiatives signal a global pushback, analysts note that China still holds a strong position in the critical minerals sector. The strategic importance of these materials for technology and defense is driving the search for alternative sources outside of Chinese control.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels defeated the Texas Rangers 6-5 after Nolan Schanuel drew a bases-loaded walk in the bottom of the ninth inning. A key moment earlier in the game came from catcher Travis d’Arnaud, who hit a two-run home run against his former teammate, star pitcher Jacob deGrom. D'Arnaud later hit a crucial game-tying double in the sixth inning, finishing the night with three RBIs. The victory was a significant morale boost for the Angels, who had recently suffered a series of close, one-run losses and were able to prevail in a tight contest.</p>

          <p>The first malaria treatment designed specifically for babies and very young children has been approved, with a rollout in African countries expected within weeks. Previously, infants under 4.5kg were treated with modified doses of drugs for older children, which posed a risk of overdose due to their developing bodies. This new medicine, developed by Novartis in collaboration with the Medicines for Malaria Venture, addresses a critical treatment gap for the most vulnerable population. The approval is being hailed as a major public health breakthrough that could save countless lives, as three-quarters of malaria deaths occur in children under five.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is in Britain for a three-day state visit that combines royal ceremony with significant political discussions. Key topics on the agenda with Prime Minister Keir Starmer include tackling illegal migration across the English Channel and advancing plans for a post-ceasefire security force for Ukraine. The visit, the first by an EU leader since Brexit, symbolizes a desire to reset U.K.-France relations. While featuring royal pageantry like a carriage procession and a state banquet, the talks are expected to address the thorny issue of stopping small boat crossings and reinforcing diplomatic and defense partnerships.</p>

          <p>Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman has been discharged from the intensive care unit and moved to a rehabilitation facility, more than three weeks after he and his wife were shot in their home. Hoffman was shot nine times and his wife, Yvette, was hit eight times during the attack on June 14; she was released from the hospital last month. The incident was part of a series of what officials have called "politically motivated" attacks that also resulted in the deaths of state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. A suspect is in custody facing federal and state charges.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 stock indices have both formed a "golden cross" on their charts, a technical indicator that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term one. Market analysts view this as a potentially bullish signal for a long-term upward trend. The last time the MSCI World Index formed a golden cross in January 2023, it was followed by a 43% rise over the next two years. Historical data suggests that this pattern has preceded positive market performance a majority of the time over the past 50 years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, stating that the country must be able to defend itself against Russian aggression. This decision comes just days after the White House confirmed it had paused some weapons shipments as part of a broader review of U.S. military stockpiles. The Pentagon affirmed that the additional weapons are being sent at the president's direction to ensure Ukraine can defend itself while the U.S. works toward a lasting peace. Trump recently spoke with both the Ukrainian and Russian presidents, expressing disappointment with his call with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Chinese students are choosing Singapore over the United States for their overseas education, citing cultural familiarity and safety concerns in the U.S. as key factors. While the U.S. has long been the top destination, industry insiders report an uptick in applications to Singaporean universities from Chinese nationals. Students are drawn to Singapore's high-ranking universities, economic openness, and environment, which they perceive as a more suitable long-term fit. This trend reflects shifting preferences amid increasing hurdles and a changing social climate for international students in America.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has begun phasing out the mandatory requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screenings at some U.S. airports. Sources confirm the change is being implemented at airports including Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, and Philadelphia, with travelers at other major hubs also reporting they were not required to remove footwear. The no-shoes rule was officially implemented nationwide in 2006, following the 2001 attempted bombing by Richard Reid. This policy shift marks a significant change in airport security procedures for travelers who are not enrolled in the TSA PreCheck program.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted unanimously to advance a permanent ordinance aimed at preventing landlords from evicting tenants under the guise of a substantial renovation, a practice known as a "renoviction." The new rule would only permit such an eviction if the landlord has a government agency order to vacate the unit to address code violations. The city is also developing rules that would require landlords to pay for relocation expenses or provide comparable temporary housing for tenants during legitimate, necessary remodels. This move aims to close a loophole that tenant advocates say has been used to unjustly displace renters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to boost its economy and tourism sector, China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa. This unprecedented loosening of travel restrictions has led to a noticeable increase in foreign visitors, with travel companies reporting a surge in bookings. The policy, which has been progressively rolled out to most of Europe, parts of Asia, and Latin America, is designed to make travel to China less cumbersome. While U.S. citizens are not on the 30-day list, they can use a more restrictive 10-day transit option.</p>
