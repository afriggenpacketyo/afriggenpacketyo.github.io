          <h2>UK Medicines Regulator Warns Women About Weight-Loss Jabs and Contraception</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 05:42:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued a warning to women using weight-loss jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro, stating that these medications may affect the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. The MHRA advises women to use effective contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward, ranging from one to two months depending on the specific drug. There are concerns that the increasing popularity of these "skinny jabs" may lead to unsafe usage and inadequate medical advice, particularly given side effects like vomiting and diarrhea which can impact pill absorption. The MHRA recommends women consult their prescribers about the risks and benefits, and pharmacists for advice if confused about stopping the drugs. The article details a personal anecdote from a woman who became pregnant while on Mounjaro and taking the contraceptive pill, highlighting the potential risks. The MHRA has received around 40 reports related to pregnancy through its Yellow Card scheme, prompting the new guidance. </p>

          <p>China has granted approval for the mass production of its first domestically developed 1,000-kilowatt helicopter engine, the AES100, produced by the state-owned Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC). The move signifies a major step forward for China's aviation sector, particularly as Beijing aims to reduce its reliance on foreign technologies. The announcement comes shortly after the United States imposed new export restrictions targeting China, including curbs on jet engine-related technologies. Li Gaiqi, chief designer of the AES100, stated that the license reflects China's ability to independently develop and manufacture advanced civil turboshaft engines. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that leprosy, or Hansen's disease, existed in the Americas long before the arrival of European explorers. Researchers from the Institut Pasteur in Paris found evidence of the bacterium Mycobacterium lepromatosis in ancient human remains from Argentina and Canada, dating back 1,000 years. This discovery challenges the previous belief that leprosy was solely introduced to the Americas by European settlers. The study, which involved collaboration with indigenous communities and various international institutions, analyzed over 800 DNA samples from ancient human remains and recent medical cases showing signs of leprosy. The findings suggest that Mycobacterium lepromatosis spread rapidly throughout the continent and that unknown animal reservoirs may exist. </p>

          <p>With forecasts indicating an "above-normal" Atlantic hurricane season, experts are urging homeowners to review their insurance policies to ensure adequate coverage. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts a 60% chance of above-normal activity, with 13 to 19 named storms expected. Experts recommend assessing policy limits to cover rebuilding costs, checking deductibles, and determining the need for flood insurance, as standard homeowners policies typically do not cover flood damage. Acting promptly is advised, as insurers often suspend policy changes when a storm is imminent. </p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss trade disputes and the ongoing war in Ukraine.

Additionally, NATO spending and defense contributions will be discussed, as Trump has long advocated for increased defense spending by member countries. </p>

This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible and save parents ¬£500 a year, potentially lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund the change up to 2029. While the announcement has been welcomed by the education sector and organizations campaigning against child poverty, some critics argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective at reducing child poverty. </p>
