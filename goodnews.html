          <p>Australia is investing an initial AU$12 billion ($8 billion) over a decade to upgrade its Henderson shipyard near Perth. This significant investment is part of the AUKUS security pact with the UK and US, aiming to establish a maintenance hub for a future fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. The project will also develop facilities for army landing craft and navy frigates, supporting approximately 10,000 local jobs. This strategic move strengthens Australia's defense capabilities and the AUKUS alliance in the Indo-Pacific, with potential US access to the facilities.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans secured a significant 33-17 victory over Purdue, marking their first win outside the West since 2012 and ending a 14-game losing streak in Eastern and Central time zones. Despite a three-hour lightning delay before kickoff, quarterback Jayden Maiava led the offense with 282 passing yards and a rushing touchdown, while the team amassed 460 total yards. Crucially, safety Bishop Fitzgerald made two interceptions, including a fourth-quarter pick that sealed the win, preventing a late Purdue comeback. This performance demonstrates USC's resilience and ability to overcome past road struggles in the Big Ten.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is requesting $58 million from Congress to bolster security for the executive and judicial branches, including enhanced protection for Supreme Court justices, in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination. This move reflects growing concerns over political violence, with the U.S. Capitol Police anticipating over 14,000 threats to members this year. House Speaker Mike Johnson supports a thorough review of existing security programs, emphasizing the need to protect public officials. The funding request highlights a bipartisan recognition of heightened security risks for those in public service.</p>

          <h2>California Lawmakers Vote to Ban PFAS "Forever Chemicals" in Cookware and Consumer Products</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 21:25:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 682, a measure to phase out PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," from cookware, cleaning products, and other household items. The legislation, now awaiting Governor Newsom's signature, is a response to the health risks associated with PFAS exposure, including cancer and organ damage. While environmental groups and actor Mark Ruffalo advocate for the ban, the cookware industry and celebrity chefs like Rachael Ray argue that certain PFAS, like PTFE (Teflon), are safe when used correctly. The bill sets compliance deadlines, with cookware needing to be PFAS-free by 2030, and aims to prioritize public health over corporate profits.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have approved a complex energy package, allowing up to 2,000 new oil wells annually in the San Joaquin Valley to stabilize crude-oil refineries, while simultaneously tightening restrictions on offshore drilling. The deal, brokered by Governor Newsom, aims to address gas prices and the planned closure of two refineries, which could reduce state refining capacity by 20%. The legislation also extends the "cap and invest" climate program through 2045 and creates a pathway for California to join a regional electricity market. This package represents a balancing act between short-term energy stability and long-term clean energy goals.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is investing in major infrastructure projects, including a land bridge with a natural gas pipeline and the Rio Indo dam, to mitigate severe droughts that have plagued its operations. The canal, critical for global trade, experienced a 29% drop in vessel transits due to recent low water levels. The land bridge aims to transport natural gas liquids, offering a water-independent alternative to canal transits, while the $1.6 billion Rio Indo dam will supplement Lake Gatun's water supply. These ambitious plans seek to ensure the canal's reliability and resilience against future climate impacts, though completion is years away. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Earl Richardson, former president of Morgan State University, has died at 81, leaving a legacy of fighting for equitable funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). He spearheaded a 15-year lawsuit that resulted in Maryland agreeing to provide $577 million in supplemental funding to four HBCUs, addressing historical underfunding. Richardson's leadership during student protests against dilapidated facilities in 1990 helped pave the way for this landmark case. His work highlighted systemic funding disparities faced by HBCUs nationwide and contributed to Morgan State's "Renaissance," significantly expanding its enrollment and campus infrastructure.</p>
