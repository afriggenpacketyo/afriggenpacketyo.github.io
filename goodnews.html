          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow US colleges to pay athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement allows each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year, and $2.7 billion will be paid over the next decade to former players. This agreement professionalizes college athletics, leading to high-stakes recruitment of top athletes and potential program adjustments by schools. NCAA President Charlie Baker stated that the settlement opens a pathway to stabilizing college sports, though the long-term impacts remain to be seen.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a multibillion-dollar settlement, known as House v. NCAA, paving the way for a new era in college sports where schools can directly pay athletes. Schools will be allowed to pay athletes, with payments limited by a salary cap initially set at $20.5 million per school. The settlement also includes $2.75 billion to be paid to former college athletes who were not allowed to earn money while in school. NCAA president Charlie Baker stated that direct payments to players are a positive change that was long overdue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had a "very positive" phone conversation, easing tensions between the two countries. The call, focused on trade, offered respite for Asian countries caught in the rivalry between the US and China. However, the relationship between the two powers remains fragile, and Asian neighbors may still face challenges in balancing trade with both countries. Analysts suggest that the detente might complicate calculations on how to strike a balance between the two superpowers.</p>

The city's financial infrastructure and international links make it a preferred choice for businesses looking to raise capital and operate globally.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is targeting Japan's rice policy amid escalating public grievances over soaring rice prices. With a national election looming, Ishiba aims to overhaul the decades-old production adjustment system to counter opposition parties' populist policies. He is pursuing a consumer-focused approach by releasing reserve rice to lower prices, but challenges remain, including the risk of a price plunge due to oversupply. Ishiba's moves come as opposition parties urge the government to cut the consumption tax, and some pundits have cautioned against using rice policy as a political tool.</p>
