          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's total compensation for the 2025 fiscal year rose by 22% to $96.5 million, largely driven by stock awards tied to the company's strong share performance. The surge in Microsoft's stock value is attributed to the ongoing boom in artificial intelligence and the growth of its Azure cloud business. The pay package includes over $84 million in stock awards and more than $9.5 million in cash incentives. This increase comes despite recent workforce turmoil, including the elimination of over 15,000 jobs within the company during 2025.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Israel, Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S.-brokered ceasefire plan to end the war in Gaza is progressing "better than I expected," despite recent violent flare-ups. He acknowledged the challenges, including difficulties in recovering all hostage remains, but urged patience and flexibility. The peace process has seen incremental steps, with Israel receiving more hostage remains and returning the bodies of Palestinians to Gaza. However, some Israeli observers remain skeptical of the long-term viability of the deal, questioning both sides' commitment to a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce has partnered with activist investor Jana Partners in an investment group that has acquired a roughly 9% economic interest in Six Flags Entertainment. The group aims to engage with the amusement park operator's board to find ways to improve guest experience and increase shareholder value. Kelce, a two-time Super Bowl champion, stated his involvement is personal, as he grew up visiting the parks. The news caused Six Flags' stock to surge over 15%, providing a boost to the company which has struggled with performance in recent years.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has instructed the government to remove nine social media posts from the Department of Homeland Security's accounts, deeming them "prejudicial" to the case against U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver. The Democratic congresswoman is facing charges for allegedly assaulting immigration officers during an oversight visit to a New Jersey detention center. The judge found that the posts, which called the visit a "reckless stunt," were not factual and could compromise her right to a fair trial. The judge is also considering a motion to dismiss the case entirely based on McIver's congressional oversight authority.</p>

          <p>Actor Adam Driver disclosed that he spent two years developing a potential "Star Wars" movie centered on his character, Ben Solo, set after "The Rise of Skywalker." He pitched the idea, titled "The Hunt for Ben Solo," to Lucasfilm with filmmaker Steven Soderbergh, and a script was written that Driver described as exceptionally cool. While Lucasfilm executives were reportedly enthusiastic, top Disney leadership ultimately rejected the project. The main obstacle was their inability to see a narrative path forward, given that the character was depicted as deceased at the end of the sequel trilogy.</p>

          <p>Following a recent decline in the price of silver, some market observers are evaluating its potential as an investment opportunity. The article notes that silver has seen significant year-to-date growth and that such price drops have historically preceded surges. It is also positioned as a more affordable alternative to gold for portfolio diversification and as a hedge against inflation, especially amid economic uncertainties. The text suggests that despite a cooling inflationary environment, portfolio protection remains a relevant concern for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The defense ministers of Germany and Norway are in Ottawa to persuade Canada to join their joint project for procuring modern, standardized submarines. An order of up to 12 submarines from Canada would significantly boost production and lower the per-unit cost for all participating nations. The proposal is framed as a move to strengthen North Atlantic naval cooperation and maritime security in response to a growing threat from Russia. Germany is also increasing its military presence in the North Atlantic, deploying reconnaissance aircraft from Iceland to monitor Russian submarine activity and protect critical undersea infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat skyrocketed by over 146% on Tuesday, marking its best trading day ever. The massive rally began after the stock was added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF and was further fueled by an announcement of expanded distribution through a new deal with Walmart. The surge appears to have triggered a significant short squeeze, as over 63% of the stock's available float had been sold short. This marks a dramatic reversal for the company, whose stock had fallen to penny-stock levels after years of poor performance.</p>

          <p>General Motors' stock surged 15% after the automaker exceeded Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations and raised its full-year financial guidance. The company now projects adjusted earnings between $12 billion and $13 billion for 2025, signaling confidence despite challenges in the electric vehicle market. GM's strong performance was bolstered by gains in its China and international operations, which helped offset a decline in its North American profit margin. The company also reduced its expected financial impact from tariffs for the year, citing recent policy updates from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut widely expected at its upcoming October meeting, homeowners are evaluating whether to secure a home equity loan now or wait for potentially lower rates. The article suggests that while lenders may have already priced in the anticipated cut, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) could be a more strategic option. HELOCs feature variable rates that can adjust downward following a Fed cut, unlike fixed-rate home equity loans. Currently, average HELOC rates are already lower than those for home equity loans, offering a more affordable borrowing option in a cooling rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

This move expands DraftKings' business beyond its core sports betting operations. The predictions market for sports and elections is controversial, with many states viewing it as unlicensed gambling.
