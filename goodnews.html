          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, calling him a 'fool' after the central bank decided to maintain current interest rates, citing economic uncertainty related to tariffs. Trump has been advocating for rate cuts to stimulate the economy, but the Fed is hesitant due to concerns about potential inflation. Powell has stated that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and are not influenced by political pressure. The president had previously expressed concerns about potentially firing Powell, which had unsettled markets, but later stated he had no intention of doing so.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that new trade deals could be announced soon, as his administration faces pressure to reach agreements before a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs ends.

While negotiations with China have not yet formally begun, Bessent is scheduled to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation in Switzerland.

          <p>President Trump briefly proposed a 100 percent tariff on movies made outside America, causing concern in Hollywood and among entertainment companies before the White House retracted the announcement. The potential tariff aimed to address the shift of filmmaking overseas due to cheaper labor and tax credits. However, filmmakers argued that such a levy would halt production and could lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries. The industry prefers tax credits to lure moviemakers back to America, but that would require additional government spending.</p>
