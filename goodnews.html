          <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an aid group backed by the U.S. and Israel, is distributing food to people in Gaza, focusing on ensuring that aid reaches those in need without being stolen by Hamas. According to GHF's executive chairman, Gazans have expressed gratitude for the support, specifically thanking President Trump for his promise to address the issue of Hamas interfering with humanitarian aid. The GHF aims to provide aid without the need to compromise with nefarious purposes, offering an alternative to the challenges faced by other aid organizations. Despite facing criticism, the GHF continues its operations, emphasizing its commitment to delivering essential resources directly to the people of Gaza.</p>

          <p>The United States may extend a 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if they continue to negotiate in good faith, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Bessent's remarks suggest a willingness to push the deadline beyond 90 days for countries actively engaged in negotiations. Japan is one such partner, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba scheduled to meet with President Trump at the upcoming G7 summit. The pause, which runs until July 8, applies to country-specific tariffs under the reciprocal scheme, covering about 60 trading partners with trade surpluses with the United States.

          <p>Hong Kong is positioning itself as a leader in global finance with the passage of a comprehensive stablecoin law, aiming to address past industry setbacks and capitalize on the city's vast offshore yuan holdings. The new law, effective August 1, makes Hong Kong one of the first jurisdictions with detailed regulations for stablecoins, ahead of the US Genius Act. This move is expected to give Hong Kong a competitive edge in Asia, with a friendlier regulatory stance than Singapore. Analysts believe the law could secure Hong Kong a prominent spot in the stablecoin market, currently dominated by US dollar-backed tokens.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, from fossils in a Mongolian museum, which they say alters the understanding of tyrannosaur evolution. The 86 million-year-old skeletons represent the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the T.rex. This discovery reveals an evolutionary shift from small hunters to the formidable giants that dominated North America and Asia. The new species exhibits early stages of features crucial to tyrannosaurs' dominance, such as skull anatomy that provided a strong jaw, enhancing their ability to capture larger prey.</p>

          <p>Brian Wilson, who passed away on Wednesday at the age of 82, was a visionary musician whose sound epitomized the lore of Southern California. As a composer, constructor of textures, and arranger of vocal harmonies, he was among the greats, alongside Phil Spector, George Martin, and the Motown team. Wilson's genius lay in his control of emotion, articulating feelings of affection, fear, and disappointment. The Beach Boys' music, especially their masterpiece "Pet Sounds," captures the essence of the California dream while exploring deeper emotional themes.</p>
