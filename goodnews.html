          <p>The Reserve Bank of India has maintained its key policy rate at 5.5%, a decision influenced by rising trade tensions and tariff threats from the U.S. This move was widely expected by economists following a significant rate cut in the previous meeting. While recent low inflation data could support a future cut, the central bank is taking a cautious "neutral" stance, waiting for a clearer economic outlook, especially with India's GDP growing faster than anticipated. The decision also comes as the U.S. criticizes India's trade relationship with Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is encountering a significant challenge in its ambition to build a satellite internet constellation to rival SpaceX's Starlink due to a shortage of available rockets. The state-backed Guo Wang project is receiving priority access to the national Long March rockets, leaving other commercial projects like Shanghai's Qianfan to rely on the nascent private launch sector. This bottleneck highlights the growing pains of China's space industry as it tries to balance national strategic goals with burgeoning commercial demand for launch capacity. The situation underscores the intense competition in the global space economy.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a state prison in Norco, Riverside County, by fall 2026. The decision is attributed to a significant decline in the state's overall inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates, will see its population and staff transferred to other locations. The closure has sparked local discussions about the future of the site, which was originally a luxury resort hotel in the 1920s.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists and policy thinkers regarding whether to include specific, measurable consumption targets in the country's next five-year plan. Proponents argue that setting a national goal for the household consumption rate—the share of consumer spending in GDP—is a crucial strategy to boost domestic demand. Opponents, however, question the feasibility of using such metrics as operational policy goals. This discussion reflects China's ongoing efforts to rebalance its economy away from investment-led growth towards a more consumer-driven model.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who had a difficult start to the season before being sidelined with a shoulder injury, is showing promising signs of recovery. The Japanese phenom is progressing in his throwing program, with improved velocity and a new two-seam fastball added to his repertoire. After an underwhelming debut, the team is hopeful that a healthier and more confident Sasaki could rejoin the active roster by late August. He could provide valuable pitching depth for the team's postseason push.</p>

          <p>Meta has announced that its messaging platform, WhatsApp, took down over 6.8 million accounts associated with fraudulent activities in the first half of this year. Many of these accounts were linked to organized crime centers in Southeast Asia that often use forced labor to carry out investment schemes and other scams. The announcement coincided with WhatsApp rolling out new security features to alert users to suspicious activity. This crackdown targets the growing problem of account hijacking and large-scale digital fraud.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker AMD announced second-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations, even as its revenue surpassed estimates, causing its stock to slide in after-hours trading. The company's AI business revenue declined, impacted by U.S. export controls restricting sales to China. However, its data center and client/gaming segments saw significant year-over-year growth, driven by strong demand for CPUs and gaming console chips. CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in the competitiveness of AMD's upcoming AI chips against rivals like Nvidia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA funds intended for disaster mitigation projects. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its funding without congressional approval. The judge stated that the transfer could cause "irreparable harm" to communities vulnerable to natural disasters. The administration is now temporarily blocked from repurposing the funds.</p>

          <p>A massive copper mining project in Afghanistan, backed by China's state-owned Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC), is reportedly making significant progress toward beginning extraction this year. The Mes Aynak Mine project, awarded in 2008, has been stalled for 17 years due to security issues, archaeological concerns, and a lack of infrastructure. The Taliban government announced last year that the mine would use a costlier underground mining process to better protect ancient Buddhist relics at the site. This development signals a potential economic step forward for the region.</p>

First detected in Southeast Asia, the variant is a combination of two other strains and may have an enhanced ability to evade immune responses. However, the World Health Organization has assessed its public health risk as "low," and there is currently no evidence it causes more severe disease than previous Omicron variants.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The measure aims to protect tenants, particularly vulnerable populations, from the increasing danger of extreme heat waves driven by climate change. The law will take effect next month but will not be enforced until 2027 to give landlords time to comply. Officials are encouraging passive cooling methods like blackout curtains and reflective roofing.</p>
