          <p>Nine veterans with PTSD traveled to Mexico for a psychedelic retreat, seeking relief from their invisible wounds through psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT ceremonies. Organized by the Heroic Hearts Project, the retreat aimed to help veterans revisit traumatic moments and find new perspectives. While most participants reported improved symptoms and life-changing experiences, one veteran experienced a decline in mental health and returned to antidepressant medication. The Veterans Administration is now conducting clinical trials using psychedelics to treat PTSD, depression, and addiction, but cautions against self-medicating outside of a safe and monitored environment.</p>

          <p>Britain's energy bills are rising due to grid limitations that force energy firms to be paid significant sums to not provide power. Wind farms in Scotland are often restricted because the grid lacks capacity to transport the electricity to England, leading to compensation payments. The government is considering a shift to regional electricity markets to improve efficiency and lower costs, but the move has sparked intense debate and opposition from energy companies. The proposed changes aim to address the challenges of integrating renewable energy sources and delivering cheaper electricity to consumers, although the outcome remains uncertain.

There is a particular need for more black donors, who are more likely to have specific blood types crucial for treating sickle cell disease.

          <p>Clayton Kershaw pitched effectively, leading the Dodgers to a 7-3 victory over the Cardinals and ending a losing streak. Kershaw allowed just one run over five innings, striking out seven and issuing no walks. The performance helped stabilize the Dodgers' rotation amid injuries and roster changes. The offense also provided support, scoring seven runs, the most in a game this month, and the team now moves on to face the Padres in San Diego.</p>

          <p>The computer-generated film "Lilo & Stitch" maintained its lead at the box office for a third weekend, while "From the World of John Wick: Ballerina" fell short of expectations. "Ballerina" grossed $25 million domestically, below the anticipated $35-40 million range. Despite positive reviews, the film's box office performance was somewhat disappointing, although it has already recouped a significant portion of its production costs through foreign pre-sales. "Lilo & Stitch" continued its success, surpassing the domestic earnings of the live-action version of "The Little Mermaid."</p>
