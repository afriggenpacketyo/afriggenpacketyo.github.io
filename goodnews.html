          <p>Emily Thornberry has withdrawn from the race for deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, narrowing the field of candidates to four. Thornberry failed to secure the 80 nominations from fellow MPs required to advance to the next stage of the contest. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is currently the frontrunner with significant backing from parliamentary colleagues. The contest to replace Angela Rayner will conclude in late October, with the outcome potentially reflecting the sentiments of party members regarding the current leadership of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index soared to a new all-time high, driven by optimism following positive U.S. inflation data and hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts. A significant contributor to the rally was tech investment firm SoftBank Group, whose stock jumped over 10%. This surge is linked to a major cloud-computing deal between Oracle and OpenAI, as both Oracle and SoftBank are partners in the U.S.-led Stargate AI initiative. The positive performance in Japan mirrored gains on Wall Street, although other Asian markets showed mixed results. (not investment advice)</p>

He revealed that the attack left him with lasting physical pain and nerve damage, which he believes changed the trajectory of his professional career. After recovering from multiple stab wounds, Wisdom found his body was not the same, leading to his eventual departure from Derby County. Now playing for a semi-professional team, FC United of Manchester, the 32-year-old reflects on his journey with honesty and expresses gratitude for still being able to play football.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new report from Morgan Stanley, U.S. investor interest in Chinese stocks has reached its highest level in five years, with over 90% of surveyed investors expressing a willingness to increase their exposure. This renewed interest extends beyond U.S.-listed Chinese companies to include the onshore A-share market. The bank attributes this shift to China's leadership in key sectors like robotics and biotech, efforts to stabilize its economy, and a growing demand for diversification away from U.S. assets. The report suggests that this relocation of capital back to China is just beginning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers completed a series sweep against the Colorado Rockies with a 9-0 victory, extending their lead in the National League West to three games. Mookie Betts led the offense with a four-hit, five-RBI performance that included a grand slam, while pitcher Blake Snell delivered a dominant six-inning, 11-strikeout start. However, the team faced another injury concern as starting catcher Will Smith was scratched just before the game due to swelling in his hand. The win continues a strong run for the team as they head into the final stretch of the season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Everton Football Club has undergone a significant revival, marked by a record net spend of £97 million on nine new players during the summer transfer window. This outlay, the highest in the club's history, follows a period of financial turmoil that included points deductions and a narrow escape from relegation. The article attributes the turnaround to the takeover by the Friedkin Group, which resolved debt issues, and a strategic lack of spending in previous years. This financial transformation, combined with a move to a new, higher-capacity stadium, has created a sense of optimism for the club's future.</p>

          <p>In response to an industry-wide slowdown, high-end luxury brands like Louis Vuitton are diversifying their product lines with less expensive items, such as cosmetics and accessories, to attract a broader consumer base. This strategy aims to engage aspirational shoppers with lower entry-price points, like a $160 lipstick, without diluting the brand's core exclusivity. Analysts note this "treatonomics" approach allows brands to build loyalty with younger consumers who may eventually graduate to more expensive purchases. The challenge for these companies is to broaden their appeal while maintaining the prestige that defines their flagship products.</p>

          <p>Equity markets around the world, including the MSCI All Country World Index and the S&P 500, have been reaching new record highs. This global rally is fueled by growing investor confidence due to easing inflation pressures, resilient corporate earnings, and widespread expectations of interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Recent data, such as a soft U.S. producer price index, has bolstered the belief that the Fed has more room to ease its monetary policy. The positive sentiment has been further amplified by strong outlooks from tech companies, indicating the current rally may have continued strength. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has invested nearly 450 billion yuan over the past five years in a strategic mineral exploration program, resulting in significant new discoveries of oil, gas, and critical minerals like lithium and copper. Officials announced that the initiative has led to the identification of over 500 large and medium-sized deposits, bolstering the nation's energy and resource security. These efforts are part of China's broader strategy to reduce its reliance on imports and secure its supply chains for key industrial and technological materials. The discoveries are expected to support stable domestic production of oil and natural gas.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for a private tea at Clarence House, marking their first face-to-face meeting since February 2024. The reunion, which lasted about 50 minutes, is being viewed as a small but potentially significant step toward reconciliation amid a long-standing and public family rift. The meeting follows a recent shift in Prince Harry's public tone, where he expressed a desire to reconcile with his family. While details of the conversation remain private, the event itself suggests a possible thawing of relations, though a full family reconciliation still appears distant.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A real estate analysis by Redfin suggests that housing costs in San Francisco have returned to a "normal" level, defined as the mortgage payment-to-income ratio seen in July 2018. This stabilization is attributed to slowing home-price growth combined with significant wage increases for high-earning tech workers, bringing the market back to a pre-pandemic equilibrium. However, the report clarifies that "normal" for San Francisco does not mean affordable, as the city remains one of the most expensive in the U.S. The analysis also notes that this trend does not apply to the rental market.
