          <p>China has reached an agreement to resume imports of Japanese seafood, which were halted following the discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing, with exports set to begin once China completes its necessary procedures. The agreement involves China's participation in water sampling missions as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It also requires Japan to register fishery processing facilities and ensure the absence of radioactive substances in the seafood. This article receives a slightly positive score, as it marks a resolution to a trade dispute.</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, has won the 100th Scripps National Spelling Bee, earning over $50,000 in cash and prizes. Zaki, who was last year's runner-up, defeated eight other finalists in the competition. The final rounds were marked by drama, with multiple finalists misspelling words before Zaki correctly spelled √©claircissement to win the Bee. The competition, held in National Harbor, Maryland, featured 243 young spellers who had advanced through local and regional bees, and Zaki's victory marks the 110th champion in the Bee's history due to ties in previous years. The score is high because it reflects the positive outcome of a competition.</p>
