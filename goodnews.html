SinoHydro Group will invest over $100 million to create a grain base, with 60% of the output designated for China. The conglomerate Citic has committed $250 million to cultivate 100,000 hectares for soybean and corn production over the next five years.

          <p>The government of Cambodia has announced its intention to nominate President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination is in recognition of his role in helping to broker a ceasefire agreement that ended a recent deadly border conflict between Cambodia and Thailand. Cambodia's Deputy Prime Minister, Sun Chanthol, thanked Trump for his efforts in bringing peace to the region. The White House credited Trump's direct involvement and threats of trade repercussions for halting the fighting, which had killed dozens and displaced over 300,000 people.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Uncover Potato's Evolutionary Link to a Tomato Ancestor</h2>

          <p>A Chinese-led research team has made a significant discovery about the evolutionary history of the potato, tracing its origins back to an ancient hybrid event. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists found that about nine million years ago, a forerunner of the modern tomato hybridized with a tuberless, potato-like plant. This event was a key driver in the development of the tuber, the edible part that has made the potato a staple food crop worldwide. The study, published in the journal Cell, provides new insight into how this crucial agricultural trait emerged.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC (LAFC) played to a 1-1 draw against Mexican club Pachuca in the Leagues Cup, ultimately winning the subsequent penalty shootout 4-2. Despite the shootout victory, the result leaves LAFC with only three points from two matches, making their advancement to the next round highly unlikely. The match saw goals from LAFC's Dennis Bouanga and Pachuca's Elías Montiel, with both teams having a player sent off after VAR reviews. For Pachuca, the single point from the draw keeps their qualification hopes alive ahead of their final group stage match.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a temporary restraining order that blocks the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops in Southern California. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that there was a high likelihood of future constitutional violations without the injunction. The court rejected the government's argument that the order hindered its enforcement efforts, noting that the injunction simply prevents stops that lack the legally required reasonable suspicion. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass celebrated the decision as a victory for the rule of law and a relief for immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Amid a summer of intense heat and wildfires across Greece, Turkey, and other European destinations, travel experts are advising tourists on their rights and options. While the UK Foreign Office currently deems travel safe, those with concerns should first contact their airline and hotel for potential solutions. Standard travel insurance policies typically cover cancellations or trip curtailments only if official advice changes to "do not travel." However, some insurers may offer coverage if a specific area is directly affected, so travelers are urged to check their policy details before making any changes to their plans.</p>

          <p>In response to growing online dating burnout, app developers are introducing new features and entire platforms designed to offer a different experience. With major apps like Tinder and Hinge seeing a decline in UK usage, new approaches are emerging, such as apps that facilitate group dates or, like Breeze, arrange in-person dates while minimizing pre-date messaging. A journalist trying this method found that while his date didn't lead to a romantic spark, the lack of extensive pre-chat made the interaction more present and human. These innovations reflect a broader shift towards lower-pressure, more direct ways of connecting.</p>

          <p>Motorists on a busy Pennsylvania highway experienced a unique traffic delay when a truck carrying hot dogs had an accident, spilling its entire cargo across the road. A mechanical issue caused the truck's trailer to scrape against a concrete divider, which ripped it open and scattered the sausages over the roadway. The incident occurred during the morning commute in Shrewsbury, creating a slippery and unusual cleanup challenge for fire crews. A front-end loader was eventually brought in to scoop the discarded wieners into a dump truck, clearing the way for traffic to resume.</p>
