          <p>Inspector Terrell Anderson of the New York Police Department was transferred after allegedly overriding negative psychological reports for 80 police candidates, allowing them to enter the Police Academy despite failing to meet mental health standards. The article states that the decision came amidst a department-wide struggle with hemorrhaging officers since 2020, with uniformed officers down from 40,000 in 2000 to 33,531 as of April 1. Anderson's union president defended his actions, claiming he had the authority to override psychological reports and was always transparent about his decisions. Anderson, who has a history of meritorious service, was known for his efforts to recruit more officers of color and improve community relations.</p>
