        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Walt Disney Company announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air, nearly a week after being indefinitely suspended. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which drew criticism from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr and prompted major affiliate station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair to pull the show. Disney stated the suspension was to avoid inflaming a tense national situation, and the decision to reinstate the show came after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel. The move had faced significant backlash from free speech advocates and Hollywood figures.</p>

          <p>NASA has introduced its newest class of 10 astronaut candidates, selected from a pool of over 8,000 applicants, who will train for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and Mars. The diverse group is composed of six women and four men, marking the first female-majority astronaut class for the agency. The candidates include pilots, a biomedical engineer, a geologist, an anesthesiologist, and a former SpaceX launch director. After completing two years of intensive training, they will become eligible for flight assignments, potentially playing key roles in NASA's upcoming Artemis moon missions and beyond.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is introducing a new initiative called "Jess's Rule" to help general practitioners avoid potentially deadly diagnostic errors. The rule urges doctors to "think again" if a patient presents with the same symptoms three times without a clear diagnosis or if their condition worsens. It is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed over five months. The guidance encourages actions like ordering more tests, seeking a second opinion, or referring to a specialist to improve patient safety and prevent similar tragedies.</p>

          <p>China is in the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, a strategic blueprint that will guide the nation's economic and social development from 2026 to 2030. These plans are a core feature of China's governance, setting long-term priorities to achieve ambitious goals, such as reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As officials prepare to discuss the new plan, it is expected to address rising uncertainties both domestically and internationally. Experts suggest that to navigate these challenges, Beijing may need to prioritize qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets to maintain flexibility.</p>

          <p>Police in Northern California report that a potential school shooting was averted thanks to a tip submitted through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system.

          <p>The future of TikTok in the United States may depend on a new agreement concerning the control of its powerful recommendation algorithm. Under a proposed deal, TikTok's U.S. operations would be managed by a U.S.-based joint venture that would control a copy of the algorithm, with software company Oracle providing comprehensive security oversight. This arrangement aims to address national security concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data or manipulate content. The algorithm, considered TikTok's "secret sauce" for its user engagement, has been a major sticking point, as Chinese law restricts the export of such technology.</p>
