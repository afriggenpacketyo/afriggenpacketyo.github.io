          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will consider the most appropriate governing framework for his coalition following the critical House of Councillors election in July. Securing a majority is a "must-attain" goal, though he acknowledged it will be difficult amid voter concerns over inflation, stagnant wages, and economic uncertainty. The election is seen as a public verdict on his minority government, which is grappling with issues like soaring rice prices. Ishiba also commented on tariff negotiations with the U.S. and plans for a regional revitalization package.</p>

Mathers emphasized the family-like environment, noting the cast and crew were mostly parents who knew how to work with children.

          <p>An excerpt from a forthcoming book argues that despite having less partnered sex than previous generations, Gen Z is spearheading a new sexual revolution by politicizing and redefining sexuality. The article posits that this generation, shaped by political turmoil and the erosion of reproductive rights, views sex through a political lens and is actively challenging traditional gendered expectations. Rather than being sex-negative, many young people are expanding the definition of sex beyond heterosexual intercourse and focusing on consent and agency. This shift is presented as a progressive response to a restrictive political and social environment.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that the Labour government is now in a "better position" to pass its welfare reforms after making significant concessions to avoid a major backbench rebellion. Last week, the prime minister reversed course on several planned cuts to disability benefits, including Personal Independence Payment (Pip), after more than 120 Labour MPs threatened to vote against the bill. Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and that the government had to learn from the near-rebellion. Key changes include limiting Pip cuts to new claimants and creating a review of the assessment process co-led by a prominent MP.</p>

          <p>The Senate has voted to advance the so-called "One Big Beautiful Bill" after a prolonged and tense session where Republican leadership worked to secure support from a bloc of conservative holdouts. After hours of negotiation, Senator Ron Johnson switched his vote to yes, allowing the legislation to proceed without a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The holdouts, including Senators Mike Lee and Cynthia Lummis, said they felt "more comfortable" after receiving promises for a future amendment vote on deficit reduction and Medicaid changes. The bill now faces a lengthy process before a final vote.</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old Cleveland man, David Carr, received a distressing notice from the Social Security Administration demanding he repay $1,700 for unemployment benefits allegedly collected by his late wife for six months after her death. The demand threatened the financial stability of Carr, who relies on survivor benefits to care for his two adult children with special needs. After being initially rebuffed by the SSA, the erroneous overpayment notice was finally rescinded following an inquiry from a local news outlet.

          <p>In this commentary, author V (formerly Eve Ensler) reflects on finding the will to resist and act in a climate of political despair, citing threats to democracy, human rights, and global stability. The author argues against immobilization, advocating for the ability to hold onto opposing thoughts of pain and hope simultaneously. Drawing inspiration from Congolese activists and American community organizers, the piece suggests that the antidote to fascism and exhaustion is not just protest, but building local networks of care and support. The author concludes that every action, small or large, matters in building a new world as old structures crumble.</p>

An initial $10,000 investment would be worth nearly $3 million today. The article recounts the company's journey from the Roadster to the mass-market success of the Model Y and Model 3. However, it also notes current challenges, including sluggish 2025 sales, an aging lineup, and CEO Elon Musk's pivot to futuristic goals like autonomous driving and humanoid robots as the primary drivers of future value.
