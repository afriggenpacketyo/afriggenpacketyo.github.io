          <h2>Supreme Court Upholds Right to Wild Camping on Dartmoor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 05:02:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that camping should require their permission. The judgement centers on the interpretation of a Dartmoor by-law granting the public access to commons for "open-air recreation." The court determined that this encompasses camping, affirming the public's right to camp on Dartmoor without needing explicit landowner consent. This decision is likely to reignite discussions regarding public access to land in England, particularly in areas with significant natural beauty and recreational value.</p>

          <p>NHS England will launch a world-first gonorrhoea vaccination program starting in August, primarily targeting gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple sexual partners or STIs. The vaccine, originally designed for meningitis B, has shown 30-40% effectiveness against gonorrhoea, which has seen a surge in cases. This initiative aims to reduce the rising rates of infection and combat antibiotic-resistant strains of the bacteria. The program is projected to prevent 100,000 cases and save the NHS nearly ¬£8 million over the next decade, with Public Health Scotland and Northern Ireland also considering similar programs.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its "retention scheme" that would have paid substantial bonuses to senior executives linked to securing a ¬£3 billion rescue loan. The decision follows criticism from Downing Street, which deemed rewarding executives for failure as unacceptable, and accusations that the company was attempting to circumvent forthcoming rules banning water company bonuses. The company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with turnaround objectives and public expectations. Thames Water has faced heavy criticism for its performance, including sewage discharges and leaks, and is working to reduce its ¬£20 billion debt pile.</p>

The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snakes bite one to three million people annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Existing antivenoms, derived from animals injected with small amounts of venom, are specific to certain snake types, making a universal treatment highly valuable.</p>

          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope, has raised questions about potential clashes with the Maga movement, particularly among Catholic figures within its ranks. Pope Leo XIV's emphasis on addressing global issues like climate change, inequality, and migration contrasts with the nationalist and insular views often associated with Maga ideology. Drawing inspiration from Leo XIII, the new pope is expected to challenge the right-wing populist turn, advocating for a Catholic commitment to universality and compassion for the stranger, which may create tension with Catholic Maga leaders.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo metropolitan government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer, aiming to encourage residents to use air conditioning without financial constraints during extreme heat. A supplementary budget of 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) will cover the costs, benefiting approximately 8.2 million households. The initiative responds to concerns about declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer, with the goal of protecting residents' lives and daily living. Metered water usage will still be charged, but the base fee waiver is expected to save households around 5,000 yen over the four months.</p>
