This marks a significant challenge to SpaceX's dominant Starlink, which already boasts numerous airline customers and a much larger constellation of satellites. While Amazon has a substantial gap to close in terms of deployed satellites and launch capacity, the increasing competition is set to benefit the 2.5 billion people globally who lack internet access.

          <p>The California Assembly has passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and significantly expand high-density housing near public transit stops. The legislation, championed by Sen. Scott Wiener, aims to address the state's severe housing shortage by allowing taller buildings and denser developments, even in single-family neighborhoods. Critics argue it's a state overreach that strips local authorities of control and could displace residents. However, the bill gained momentum after securing labor union support through amendments for union hiring.</p>
