        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has conceded to allowing the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's Article 5. This potential breakthrough, reportedly discussed during the recent summit with President Trump, could address Ukraine's security concerns without formal NATO membership, a long-standing Russian objection. While European leaders welcomed the development, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy noted that the practical details of such a guarantee remain unclear, emphasizing the need for a security framework that works in practice to prevent future aggression.</p>

          <p>In a significant display of solidarity, several key European and NATO leaders will join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his meeting with President Trump at the White House. This collective move is seen as an effort to support Zelenskyy and present a united European front, ensuring Ukraine is not pressured into an unfavorable peace deal with Russia. The presence of leaders from the European Commission, NATO, France, and Germany underscores Europe's determination to have a voice in the negotiations, particularly after Zelenskyy was excluded from Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, reflecting the growing influence of internet culture on the English language. Among the new entries are Gen Z and Gen Alpha terms such as "skibidi," a viral nonsense word, "delulu," short for delusional, and "tradwife," describing women who adopt traditional gender roles. Other additions include "mouse jiggler," a device for feigning remote work activity, highlighting how modern work culture is also shaping language.

          <p>Acclaimed actress Dame Helen Mirren has weighed in on the future of the James Bond franchise, stating that the iconic spy character should continue to be played by a man. Despite identifying as a feminist, Mirren argued in an interview that changing the character's gender "just doesn't work" and that Bond must remain Bond, or else the franchise becomes something different entirely. Her sentiment was echoed by former 007 actor Pierce Brosnan, adding to the ongoing cultural conversation about the evolution of legacy characters.</p>

          <p>A growing movement across the Caribbean is seeing people reconnect with their African heritage through culture, travel, and economic initiatives. This resurgence of "pan-Africanism" is being driven by social media, the global popularity of Afrobeats music, and a desire to explore ancestral roots beyond the history of slavery. The article notes that this new wave extends beyond cultural exchange, with governments on both sides of the Atlantic working to forge stronger trade links, improve transportation, and even discuss the possibility of a shared digital currency.</p>

In contrast, current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns are running on a joint ticket that favors continuing the current strategy of broad appeal and local campaigning, which led to record success in the last general election.</p>
