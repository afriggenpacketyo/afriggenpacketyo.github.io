          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made 'substantial progress' in trade talks held in Geneva, with details to be released soon. The talks aimed to ease tensions after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory measures from China. Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, suggested a 'deal' had been reached addressing national security concerns related to China's trade practices, though it remains unclear if tariffs will be dropped. The two countries have agreed to establish a 'consultation mechanism' to discuss economic and trade issues, signaling a potential de-escalation in the trade war.</p>

He acknowledged that the industry's top priority is safety and that the system is deliberately slowed down, which can be disruptive to customers, but is necessary to keep the system safe.</p>
