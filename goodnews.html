          <p>NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations are suing the Trump administration over an executive order that cuts federal funding to what the president deems "biased media." The lawsuit argues the order violates the First Amendment right to free speech, targeting NPR for its news coverage. Experts believe NPR has a strong case, as the administration's rationale for defunding NPR and PBS has been described as "leftwing propaganda." NPR's CEO, Katherine Maher, asserts the lawsuit is a matter of necessity and principle, defending the rights flowing from the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified Yunnan province as a possible origin for the "ghost ancestors" of modern Tibetans, through analysis of ancient DNA. The study, published in Science, verifies a hypothesis that academics have speculated about but struggled to prove. Scientists analyzed genetic data from an archaeological site in central Yunnan, filling a critical gap in the understanding of prehistoric populations in East and Southeast Asia. The research sheds light on the origins and migration patterns of people living on the Tibetan Plateau.</p>

          <p>Germany has reinforced its border controls, with national police chief Dieter Romann reporting positive initial results.

Romann dismissed concerns about overburdened personnel, stating that the Federal Police should be able to manage the increased workload.

Dermatologists confirm that airplane windows block most UVB rays but not all UVA rays, which can cause premature aging and skin cancer. While the risk from occasional flights is low, flight crew members and pilots face higher exposure to ultraviolet light. Wearing sunscreen on a plane is recommended, especially for those with a history of skin cancer or increased sun sensitivity.</p>
