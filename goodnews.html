          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will evaluate the most suitable governing framework following the upcoming House of Councillors election in July. Securing a majority for his ruling coalition is a primary goal, though he acknowledges it will be challenging amid voter concerns over inflation and economic uncertainty. A recent poll indicates that half of voters hope the ruling bloc loses its majority. The election is seen as a public referendum on Ishiba's government, which previously lost its majority in the more powerful lower house.</p>

          <p>According to sources, China intends to invite U.S. President Donald Trump to a military parade in September marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. This move comes as the U.S. has concurrently proposed a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping during the same month. If realized, it would mark the first in-person meeting between the two leaders since Trump's second term began, occurring amidst ongoing trade tensions and diplomatic maneuvering. The potential attendance of both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could present a complex diplomatic situation for Japan.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its flagship welfare reform bill after facing a substantial rebellion from over 120 of its own MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and stated the government is now in a "better position" after making major concessions. Key changes include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and ensuring the health component of Universal Credit rises with inflation. The U-turn has likely secured the bill's passage, though it raises questions about the Prime Minister's authority.</p>

An initial investment of $10,000 would be worth nearly $3 million today, reflecting the company's massive growth driven by its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. However, the company now faces challenges including sluggish sales in 2025, increased competition, and concerns over CEO Elon Musk's focus and political activities.

          <p>One hundred years after a devastating earthquake ruined downtown Santa Barbara, experts reflect on the lessons it offers for modern seismic preparedness. The 1925 quake highlighted the extreme vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, a danger that took decades for many California cities to address through mandatory retrofitting laws. The event also spurred Santa Barbara to adopt a unified Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style that defines it today. However, experts note that vulnerabilities, such as soft-story apartment buildings, still exist, underscoring the ongoing challenge of translating historical lessons into comprehensive safety regulations.</p>
