        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of people are curating personal playlists to provide comfort and connection during terminal illness and palliative care. Experts note that music has significant therapeutic benefits, capable of reducing anxiety and evoking powerful memories, even in unconscious patients, as hearing is believed to be the last sense to fade. For instance, a local DJ with a terminal illness has created a playlist of his life's most meaningful songs to share with his wife. This practice also offers lasting comfort to grieving loved ones, who can reconnect with memories through the shared music.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered that applying a mild electrical current to food waste can significantly boost the microbial process that breaks it down, yielding higher quantities of useful industrial chemicals like butanol and ethanol. This electrofermentation process could help reduce the 8-10% of global greenhouse gases generated by food waste while creating valuable products from discarded materials. The innovation offers a potential solution to reduce landfill methane, lessen reliance on fossil fuels for chemical production, and alleviate financial losses from uneaten food, which costs the average U.S. family around $1,500 annually.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded higher on Monday, following gains on Wall Street, as investors anticipated China's decision on its loan prime rates. According to a Reuters poll, the rates are expected to remain unchanged, a move that would follow the central bank's decision to hold a key interest rate steady after the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut. Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 all saw early gains, reflecting positive sentiment carrying over from record highs on the Dow and S&P 500.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child psychologist who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, raising children with exceptional social skills depends more on early, consistent modeling than on memorizing polite phrases. Key practices include openly discussing feelings to build emotional vocabulary, modeling empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Parents are also advised to teach conflict resolution, validate their child's feelings, and listen more than they lecture. These behaviors create an environment of emotional safety, which is the foundation for developing strong interpersonal abilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden has stated that reforming the welfare system "must happen" to address rising costs and better support individuals in returning to work. Despite the government recently scrapping a controversial policy to cut disability benefits, McFadden insists that reform efforts are ongoing. The government plans to offer skills and employment support to tens of thousands currently on sickness benefits without a requirement to seek employment. The goal is to move away from a binary system of being either fit or unfit for work, which is seen as unhealthy for individuals and costly for the state.</p>

          <p>In a pioneering project on Nantucket, scientists are developing genetically engineered mice to combat the spread of Lyme disease. The plan involves editing the DNA of wild white-footed mice, the primary carriers of the Lyme bacteria, to make them permanently immune. This heritable immunity would be passed down through generations, breaking the transmission cycle where ticks become infected by biting the mice. Led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, the "Mice Against Ticks" project aims to reduce the number of infected ticks without harming the mouse population or the broader ecosystem, though it requires careful community consultation and regulatory approval.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has opened its doors to an inaugural class of 92 students, positioning itself as an alternative to mainstream higher education by championing open debate and the "fearless pursuit of truth." Founded by figures like historian Niall Ferguson and journalist Bari Weiss, the university aims to counteract what they see as a culture of self-censorship and ideological conformity on other campuses. UATX offers free tuition for now, funded by nearly $200 million in private donations, and emphasizes intellectual diversity, small seminar-style classes, and merit-based admissions without consideration for race or ethnicity.</p>

          <p>Each year, a special "super generation" of monarch butterflies undertakes a remarkable 3,000-mile migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico. Unlike other monarchs that live for about a month, these butterflies can live up to nine times longer, allowing them to complete the arduous journey. Scientists are still studying the mysteries of their navigation, which involves an internal sun compass and sensitivity to the Earth's magnetic field. However, the monarch population has declined by 70% in 30 years due to threats like illegal logging and the eradication of milkweed, their primary food source.</p>

          <p>Apple has taken control of all core chips in its new iPhone lineup, introducing the A19 Pro processor, N1 wireless chip, and C1X modem to prioritize on-device artificial intelligence. The A19 Pro features a new architecture with neural accelerators added to its GPU cores, boosting its machine learning and AI processing power to what Apple describes as MacBook Pro class performance. This vertical integration allows Apple to enhance efficiency, responsiveness, and privacy by handling more AI tasks directly on the device. The move also signals Apple's intent to phase out its reliance on suppliers like Qualcomm and Broadcom.</p>

          <p>An analysis highlights three growth stocks—Palantir Technologies, AppLovin, and Carvana—that have seen remarkable turnarounds and substantial gains since the beginning of 2023. These companies, once unprofitable, have improved their financials, driven by factors like the adoption of AI solutions and successful restructuring efforts. The article notes that a hypothetical $7,000 investment in each of these three companies would have grown to over $1.1 million combined. However, it also cautions that the valuations for these stocks have become significantly inflated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are expected to be part of an investor group seeking to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants in the deal, which is necessary to prevent a ban on the app under a 2024 law. The law was passed due to concerns over the Chinese parent company ByteDance's access to American user data. The White House has suggested a deal is imminent, which could place the popular social media platform under the influence of prominent American media and tech figures.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two spectacular defensive plays to secure a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets, impacting the NL wild-card race. In the fifth inning, Young made a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch, kicking the ball with his foot to regain control after it was jarred from his glove at the wall. He followed this with a leaping catch in the ninth inning to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. The loss proved costly for the Mets, who fell into a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the final National League wild-card spot.</p>

In an interview with the BBC, Lee argued that while the long-term goal remains denuclearization, halting the North's current production of 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually would be a feasible and beneficial alternative for now. President Lee, who aims to reduce tensions on the peninsula, believes resuming the talks that broke down in 2019 is possible due to the apparent mutual trust between Trump and Kim.</p>
