          <h2>Experts Advocate 'Food as Medicine' Approach to Combat Declining Public Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 07:00:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers from the University of Florida are championing the "food is medicine" movement to address America's declining health, as detailed in a recent article. They argue that increasing fruit and vegetable consumption is crucial for preventing chronic diseases, yet only one in ten U.S. adults meets the daily recommendation. The study highlights that current agricultural output is insufficient to meet these needs and advocates for a major increase in producing nutrient-dense foods like berries and leafy greens. Experts suggest that even frozen produce retains its nutritional value, offering an accessible way for people to improve their dietary habits.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines' shares jumped 10% after it reinstated its 2025 profit outlook and provided a third-quarter forecast that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. Although the airline reduced its full-year earnings forecast due to softer-than-expected demand earlier in the year, CEO Ed Bastian stated that bookings have since stabilized. The company reported strong revenue from premium-class seats and its partnership with American Express, indicating continued spending from less price-sensitive travelers even as overall fares have declined across the industry.

          <p>Eritrean cyclist Biniam Girmay, who made history last year with three stage wins and the green jersey at the Tour de France, is facing a more challenging race this year. Despite an early second-place finish, a knee injury has hampered his performance, yet he remains focused on winning another stage and competing for the points classification. The 25-year-old athlete acknowledges the pressure but says it motivates him, as he embraces his role as the sole African rider in this year's tour. His journey highlights his growing maturity and his status as a prominent representative for his country and continent.</p>

          <p>An Australian teenager who went missing while surfing has been found safe after spending a night on a remote, uninhabited island. The 19-year-old, Darcy Deefholts, was located on North Solitary Island, about seven miles offshore, following a large-scale land and sea search operation initiated by his concerned family. Marine Rescue NSW announced the successful rescue, which the surfer's father described as a "one in a million miracle."

          <p>South African Olympic champion Caster Semenya has won a partial victory in her long legal fight against World Athletics' sex eligibility rules. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that Swiss courts had violated her right to a fair hearing when they upheld regulations restricting testosterone levels for female athletes. While the decision does not directly overturn the current rules, it is a significant symbolic and legal win for Semenya. The case, which was against the Swiss government for not protecting her rights, could now return to Switzerland's federal court for re-evaluation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article in the Los Angeles Times examines how implementing ranked-choice voting could significantly alter California's political dynamics. Proponents argue the system, which allows voters to rank candidates by preference, could eliminate costly runoff elections, increase voter turnout, and foster less negative campaigning. In California's nonpartisan primary system, it could also provide more opportunities for underrepresented parties and potentially lead to more centrist outcomes by rewarding candidates who can secure second- and third-choice votes from a broader electorate.</p>
