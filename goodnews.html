          <p>Aviation company Joby is partnering with defense contractor L3Harris to create a new generation of military aircraft capable of both piloted and autonomous flight. The collaboration will integrate Joby's vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology with L3Harris's expertise in military systems. This initiative aims to produce smaller, more adaptable, and cost-effective aircraft for low-altitude support, reflecting a strategic shift in military aviation technology. Testing is scheduled to begin this fall, with operational demonstrations expected by 2026.</p>

          <p>After seven years helping lead Vox's Future Perfect section, a journalist is leaving and reflecting on the role of journalism in creating real-world change. The writer expresses pride in their work, particularly in covering topics like pandemic prevention before COVID-19, but also voices a sense of frustration over whether this reporting actually influenced policy or prevented negative outcomes. The article contemplates the difficulty of measuring impact in a world facing numerous crises. It concludes with gratitude for the readers and a call for journalism to focus more on bridging the gap between stories and tangible results.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 08:22:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the "Happy Gilmore" film series, including the newly released sequel, subtly promotes traditional conservative family values. The author contends that the protagonist's motivation in both films is not personal glory but selfless dedication to his family—first saving his grandmother's house and now providing for his daughter's dream. The piece suggests that Adam Sandler, the star and a former registered Republican, uses the comedic character to convey a message that a meaningful life is one of altruism and fulfilling obligations to one's family. The author notes that Sandler even cast his own wife and daughters in the sequel, reinforcing this theme.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United has turned down an opening offer from Liverpool for their 25-year-old striker, Alexander Isak. Reports suggest the bid was around £110 million plus add-ons, which is below Newcastle's valuation of approximately £150 million for the Sweden international. Isak has reportedly expressed a desire to leave the club and was not included in their pre-season tour, despite the team qualifying for the Champions League. It is currently uncertain if Liverpool will return with an improved offer for the player, who has been training alone at his former club.</p>

Their popularity, fueled by celebrity endorsements and social media unboxings, has turned them into a status symbol or "social currency" for avid collectors. New editions sell out instantly, driving up prices and creating a frantic market with resellers and even knock-offs. Despite recent price increases and purchasing difficulties, the trend shows no signs of slowing down, as fans continue to flock to meetups and events dedicated to the collectible figures.</p>

          <p>This article reviews "Mailman: My Wild Ride Delivering the Mail in Appalachia and Finally Finding Home," a memoir by Stephen Starring Grant. The book chronicles the author's year as a rural mail carrier in Virginia after losing his corporate job during the pandemic. The reviewer notes the book is a multi-faceted work, blending pandemic memoir, an ethnography of the postal service, and a lament for the declining ideal of public service. While acknowledging the "Hollywood material" nature of the premise, the review praises Grant's empathetic observations and his exploration of the dignity, complexity, and harsh realities of blue-collar labor in modern America.</p>

          <p>Pewabic Pottery, a Detroit institution founded in 1903, has survived over a century of the city's economic booms and busts by staying true to its Arts and Crafts roots. While Detroit became the heart of mass production, Pewabic focused on handcrafted tiles and vessels, renowned for their unique, iridescent glazes. Today, the non-profit organization continues to use much of its original equipment and techniques, employing around 50 people. In an age of AI and automation, the pottery's commitment to craftsmanship has found a renewed appreciation, leading to its best sales year ever in 2024 and ensuring its legacy continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron reported a significant 44% decline in second-quarter net income, which fell to $2.49 billion, largely due to lower crude oil prices and a one-time charge related to its acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the drop in profit, the company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.77 beat Wall Street estimates. The oil major achieved record global production of 3.4 million barrels per day, with U.S. output seeing a notable 8% jump. The recently finalized Hess acquisition is expected to boost earnings starting in the fourth quarter and contribute to future cost reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil's second-quarter earnings beat analyst expectations, as record production levels helped mitigate the impact of lower oil prices.

Production reached 4.6 million barrels per day, the highest for a second quarter in over 25 years, driven by strong output in the Permian Basin and Guyana. Exxon also continued its aggressive shareholder return program, paying out $9.2 billion through dividends and share buybacks during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Richard Masters, the chief executive of the Premier League, has confirmed that England's top football division will not be reduced from 20 to 18 clubs. The statement comes amid growing tensions with FIFA over an increasingly congested global match calendar, which includes an expanded Club World Cup and a 48-team World Cup. Masters criticized FIFA for a lack of proper consultation with domestic leagues, arguing that the calendar is being redesigned "at the altar of European and global expansion." He asserted that while the league supports growth, it should not come at the expense of domestic football's integrity and structure.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a new anti-money-laundering regulation specifically targeting the precious metals and gems sector to close a significant loophole. Under the new rule, dealers must now report any cash transactions totaling 100,000 yuan (about $13,870) or more to the country's financial crime watchdog. This is China's first such regulation to extend beyond traditional financial institutions to a specific non-financial sector. The move aims to prevent illicit funds from being laundered through the purchase of high-value, easily transportable assets like gold and jewels, which had become an attractive method for criminals.</p>

          <p>The private investment firms of the ultra-wealthy, known as family offices, are increasingly using structured, long-term incentive plans to compete for top executive talent. According to a new report, nearly two-thirds of investment-focused family offices now offer these plans, which tie compensation to performance and investment returns. This marks a shift away from informal "handshake agreements" toward more formalized structures like co-investments, carried interest, and phantom equity. As a result, compensation is rising, with median total pay for CEOs at larger family offices exceeding $1.2 million annually. (not investment advice)</p>
