          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's largest creditor for the first time in 34 years, with Germany now holding the top spot, according to the Finance Ministry. Despite Japan's net external assets reaching a record high, due in part to a weaker yen, they were surpassed by Germany's larger current account surplus. Japan's gross external assets increased significantly, exceeding 500 trillion yen for the first time, driven by direct investment in the United States by domestic financial institutions and trading houses. The yen's depreciation also played a role, boosting the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets when converted into the local currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits rose for the second consecutive month in April, indicating improved growth despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and deflationary pressures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms increased by 3% compared to the previous year, driven by stronger earnings in the equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Weining Yu from the National Bureau of Statistics noted the industrial sectors' resilience but cautioned that demand and price constraints persist. State-owned industrial firms experienced a profit decline, while private enterprises and those with foreign investments saw profits improve.</p>

          <p>Three more inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail earlier this month have been captured, according to Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill. Lenton Vanburen was detained in Baton Rouge, while Leo Tate and Jermaine Donald were arrested in Walker County, Texas. These recaptures leave two escapees still at large, with the three men now facing additional charges related to the escape.

          <p>A bill advanced by House Republicans proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for professional sports team owners, potentially impacting the demand and value of teams. The legislation targets the deduction of "intangible assets," such as player contracts and media rights, limiting owners to deducting only half the value over 15 years. While this change would only affect future owners, it could deter potential buyers and slow the growth of team values. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this measure would generate $991 million in revenue over 10 years. (not investment advice)</p>

Domestic shipments of gin have increased significantly, with distilleries incorporating local specialties like "goya" bitter gourd from Okinawa and camellia flowers from the Goto Islands. The ability to convert existing shochu and whiskey equipment for gin production, combined with the quick monetization from production to sales, has fueled the industry's growth. E-commerce sites and gin-dedicated bars are also on the rise, as major manufacturers join the market with sugar-free canned gin products.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was released from the hospital after being treated for an inflammation of the inner ear, which caused him to experience vertigo. The 79-year-old president underwent imaging and blood tests, all of which came back normal, according to hospital officials. Lula has a history of medical issues, including a fall in October 2024 that led to a concussion and a subsequent brain bleed, as well as past battles with throat cancer and high blood pressure.</p>

          <p>King Charles III is visiting Canada in a move seen as a subtle rebuke to President Trump, who has threatened the country's sovereignty. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited Charles to open Canada‚Äôs Parliament, emphasizing Canada‚Äôs distinct heritage from the United States. This visit marks Charles's first to Canada since becoming king, and is interpreted as a symbolic show of support for Canada's independent identity. The speech King Charles delivers will be written by the Prime Minister's office and will likely emphasize Canada's sovereignty.</p>
