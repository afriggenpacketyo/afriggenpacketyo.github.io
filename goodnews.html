          <p>Broadcom's second-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street estimates, with an adjusted earnings per share of $1.58 versus the expected $1.56 and revenue of $15 billion compared to the anticipated $14.99 billion. The company's net income rose significantly to $4.97 billion, or $1.03 per share, from $2.12 billion, or 44 cents per share, in the previous year. Broadcom anticipates approximately $15.8 billion in third-quarter revenue, exceeding analysts' projections of $15.70 billion, driven by strong demand for its custom AI chips from hyperscale partners. Broadcom's AI revenue reached $4.4 billion during the quarter, with expectations of $5.1 billion in the third quarter, and the company projects continued AI growth through fiscal year 2026 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that anti-discrimination laws in the United States protect all employees equally, regardless of their race, sexual orientation, or other group affiliations. The justices rejected the notion that majority group members must provide additional evidence of discrimination to pursue successful lawsuits. The ruling revives a case brought by Marlean Ames, who alleges she was discriminated against by a lesbian supervisor due to her heterosexual orientation. The decision clarifies that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits workplace discrimination against any individual, regardless of their majority or minority status.</p>

          <p>The government has announced that six water companies will be banned from paying bonuses to senior executives under new rules. The measures apply to water companies that do not meet environmental and consumer standards, are not financially resilient or have been convicted of a criminal offence. There has been growing public concern about sewage spills and rising bills for years while water companies have paid out ¬£112m in rewards to executives over the past decade. The ban, which is backdated to April 2024, means regulator Ofwat can force firms to claw back bonuses that have been paid or face enforcement action.</p>
