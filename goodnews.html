          <p>The Scottish Parliament is preparing for a crucial vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally-ill adults, marking the third time such proposals have been debated. The bill, championed by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, includes strict eligibility criteria, requiring mental fitness assessments by two doctors and raising the minimum age to 18. While supporters argue it eases suffering, opponents, including First Minister John Swinney and former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, voice concerns about safeguarding vulnerable individuals and potential coercion. The vote is expected to be closely contested, with MSPs granted a free vote on the matter.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that the IRS can share immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to identify individuals illegally in the U.S. This decision follows a lawsuit by nonprofit groups arguing that undocumented immigrants deserve the same privacy protections as citizens and legal residents. The judge stipulated that DHS and the IRS must adhere to strict limitations, requiring ICE to provide the name and address of the person, the time span of the information, and the relevance of the data to criminal investigations. This ruling comes after controversy and resignations within the IRS over the Trump administration's decision to share taxpayer data.</p>

          <p>Following a surprise trade truce between the U.S. and China, several investment banks are increasing their growth outlooks for China's GDP. The agreement involves temporarily halting the majority of tariffs on each other's products for 90 days, with mutual tariffs reduced from 125% to 10%. UBS, Morgan Stanley, and ANZ Bank have all adjusted their forecasts upwards, anticipating increased exports and production due to the lower tariffs. This revision marks a significant shift after earlier tariff escalations had prompted banks to lower their China growth projections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following trade talks between the U.S. and China, tariff rates have been lowered, reducing the triple-digit duties imposed since April. While the headline changes include reduced tariffs for the next 90 days, the new effective tariff rate for Chinese exporters is estimated to be around 50%, factoring in previous tariffs and the new duties still in force. This reduction is expected to provide some relief to Chinese manufacturers and exporters, particularly for products destined for the U.S. market, but the overall impact will vary depending on the specific product.</p>
