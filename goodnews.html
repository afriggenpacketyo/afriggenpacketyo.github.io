          <p>This New York Times article delves into the intricate process of how the Catholic Church selects a new Pope, addressing common questions about the conclave. It explains that the conclave's duration is indefinite, requiring a two-thirds majority for a decision, and cardinals are sequestered without outside communication. The article also touches on the various priorities different factions have for the next Pope, highlighting the diversity within the College of Cardinals and the impact of Pope Francis's reforms on Catholic politics. The piece concludes by outlining the eligibility criteria for cardinals and the reasons behind the age limit for voting. (The Pope's death is mentioned in this article, but the article is primarily about the process of electing a new Pope rather than the death itself).</p>

          <p>Google has signed an agreement with Elementl Power to fund the development of three new nuclear sites, aiming to meet the increasing energy demands of data centers, according to this CNBC article. Google will provide early-stage development capital, with each site expected to generate at least 600 megawatts. The company will have the option to purchase the power once the sites are operational, with the funding allocated for site permitting, interconnection rights, and contract negotiations. Elementl Power, founded in 2022, is technology-agnostic and plans to choose the most advanced reactor technology when construction begins, targeting 10 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2035. This move aligns with Google's commitment to strengthening power grids and leveraging advanced nuclear technology for reliable energy.</p>
