          <p>The highly anticipated third fight between boxers Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano is scheduled to take place at New York's Madison Square Garden. Despite Taylor holding a 2-0 record in their previous encounters, the rivalry remains intense and commercially successful, with both fighters set for career-high paydays. Their first match in 2022 was a groundbreaking event for women's boxing, and the second was a gripping, albeit controversial, rematch. This final chapter is expected to deliver similar excitement, solidifying their rivalry as one of the great trilogies in modern sports history.</p>

          <p>European nations, with U.S. participation for the first time, have agreed to establish a headquarters in Paris for a multinational force to be deployed in Ukraine after a ceasefire. The force aims to provide logistical support, train Ukrainian armed forces, and secure the country's skies and the Black Sea to deter future Russian aggression. The meeting, held in Rome, included a U.S. delegation with President Trump's special envoy and bipartisan senators, signaling unified Western support for Kyiv. While no U.S. troops will be on the ground, the move is seen as a crucial step in ensuring long-term security for Ukraine and Europe.</p>

          <p>Caesar Sengupta, CEO of the fintech startup Arta Finance, advises that the most crucial "superpower" for an entrepreneur is the ability to ground oneself and filter out noise. Having spent 15 years at Google before co-founding his startup, which has raised over $92 million, Sengupta emphasizes that meditation is his number one strategy for navigating the volatility of the startup world. He notes the transition from a large corporation to a startup is a "scary leap," making mental and physical health paramount. He recommends daily meditation and using exercise like cycling as a way to disconnect and recenter.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental effort, China is demolishing approximately 300 dams and shutting down hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the upper Yangtze. This action aims to restore natural water flows and protect the habitats of rare and endemic fish species. For decades, the dense network of dams has fragmented the river, blocking fish migration routes and drastically reducing suitable spawning grounds. The project represents a major shift in policy, prioritizing ecological restoration over hydropower in this critical refuge for aquatic biodiversity in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is experiencing a boom in electric heavy truck sales, which are rapidly gaining market share and reducing the country's demand for diesel fuel. Driven by government subsidies and an expanding charging infrastructure, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have risen 175% in the first half of the year. This surge, primarily in short-haul vehicles for industrial use, has led analysts to revise down diesel demand forecasts and accelerate predictions for when China's overall oil consumption will peak. The trend signals a significant shift in the logistics and transport sector toward electrification, further impacting global oil markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles has issued a tentative ruling suggesting she will order the Trump administration to halt unlawful stops and arrests of individuals based on their appearance. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other rights groups, argues that federal agents have been targeting brown-skinned people without probable cause as part of a mass deportation plan. The judge appeared to agree that the government had not provided sufficient evidence to refute these claims of indiscriminate targeting. A final order is expected soon, which could place significant legal constraints on the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.</p>
