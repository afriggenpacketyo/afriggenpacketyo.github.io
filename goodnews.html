          <p>President Trump wants to make a deal with Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. Putin says Russia wants to engage in peace talks, but Putin has also been ordering the most widespread and violent aerial attacks on Ukraine in years. This has led Trump to criticize Putin more and more in public ‚Äî a step that's been rare over the course of Trump's two terms in office. The fact that Trump is criticizing Putin more often leads to a slightly more optimistic score.</p>

          <p>Salman Rushdie stated that he has moved on from the knife attack he experienced, with his attacker sentenced to 25 years in prison for attempted murder. Rushdie and his wife Eliza returned to the scene of the crime to show himself he could stand up where I fell down. Rushdie said that an "important moment" came for him when he and his wife Eliza "went back to the scene of the crime to show myself I could stand up where I fell down." The fact that he has moved on is a sign of resilience, leading to a higher score.</p>

          <p>Investors are closely monitoring bond market movements, particularly the short end of the fixed-income market, due to concerns and volatility. ETF flows in 2025 indicate that ultrashort opportunities are attracting the most investors, with the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF (BIL) among the top ETFs in investor flows this year. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has also doubled its ownership of T-bills, now owning 5% of all short-term Treasuries (not investment advice). The relative stability of the economy leads to a higher score.</p>

          <p>Glamorgan made a winning start in this summer's competition as figures of 4-28 by leg-spinner Mason Crane set up a five-wicket victory over Middlesex at Merchant Taylors' School. Smeed played arguably the innings of the day for last year's runners-up Somerset, hitting a six and 11 fours in his 81 not out off 54 balls as they cruised to an eight-wicket win over Essex at Chelmsford. The positive nature of the news leads to a higher score.</p>
