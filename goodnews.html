          <p>Nike is launching its highly anticipated activewear collaboration with Kim Kardashian's brand, Skims, this Friday after experiencing production delays. The partnership, called NikeSKIMS, is a strategic move by Nike to attract more female customers and regain market share from competitors like Lululemon and Alo Yoga. The collection will feature around 40 new styles designed for both athletic performance and lifestyle wear, incorporating Nike's drying technology. This initiative aligns with new CEO Elliott Hill's strategy to refocus on sports and athletes while expanding the brand's appeal to a broader consumer base.</p>

The collaboration underscores the deep interdependence between the two companies, which have been central to the recent AI boom. The investment is expected to be deployed progressively, with the first phase utilizing Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin systems coming online in the latter half of 2026.

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, with its epicenter located near Berkeley. The quake, which occurred just before 3 a.m., was widely felt across the region, jolting many residents awake and causing objects to fall from shelves. While the shaking was strong and prompted a surge in 911 calls, there have been no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) initiated safety inspections, causing systemwide delays, and officials used the event as a reminder for residents to be prepared for future seismic activity.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid dismissed a heated sideline exchange with tight end Travis Kelce during their win against the New York Giants, telling reporters not to "make too much of it." Cameras captured the two yelling at each other, with Reid appearing to bump Kelce's shoulder, following a stalled offensive drive. Reid framed the incident as a display of passion, stating he loves Kelce's emotional investment in the game and that the team needed more "juice" after a slow start to the season. This is not the first on-field spat between the two, who had a similar, widely publicized confrontation during Super Bowl LVIII.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $3,700 per ounce, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty and await key inflation data. Gold typically performs well in low-interest-rate environments and during periods of geopolitical instability, and analysts note that ongoing purchases by global central banks are supporting demand. For investors looking to gain exposure, experts generally recommend using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold rather than buying bullion directly. Financial advisors typically suggest limiting gold to a small portion, under 3%, of a diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup hosted by England has become the most attended tournament in the sport's history, with a sold-out final at the 82,000-seat Twickenham stadium set to break the record for the largest crowd. The event has sold 440,000 tickets in total, more than triple the amount from the previous tournament. This success is attributed to strategic planning, including competitive ticket pricing starting at £10, clever scheduling of all matches on weekends to attract families, and a focus on promoting player personalities. The tournament has operated at nearly 94% capacity, marking a significant milestone for women's rugby.</p>

          <p>An elk named Emil, who became a social media sensation after wandering across Central Europe for months, has been safely captured in Austria. The young male was tranquilized near a motorway, fitted with a GPS tag, and released on the Czech-Austrian border in the hopes he will join the local elk population. Emil's journey covered nearly 500 kilometers through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria, with his movements tracked by thousands of followers online. Elk were hunted to extinction in the region centuries ago but have been slowly reintroduced since the 1970s.</p>

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has become the best-selling beer in the U.S., overtaking Modelo Especial, which had previously unseated Bud Light. This shift marks a significant turnaround for AB InBev, whose sales suffered after a controversial Bud Light marketing campaign two years ago. Modelo's decline coincides with challenges for its parent company, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and reduced spending from its core Hispanic consumer base. While AB InBev's stock has climbed over 16% this year, Constellation's shares have fallen by 39%, reflecting the changing dynamics in the American beer market.</p>

His release follows extensive international pressure from human rights groups, the United Nations, and the UK government. The pardon was requested by the National Council for Human Rights, citing humanitarian concerns, and comes shortly after Abdel Fattah's mother ended a lengthy hunger strike demanding his freedom.</p>

Cramer noted that such corporate separations have historically worked well for investors. Additionally, he commented that Microsoft's recent underperformance is merely the stock "resting after a remarkable run" and not a cause for concern. (not investment advice)</p>

The glasses can connect to apps like "Be My Eyes," which links users with volunteers for real-time assistance with tasks like reading mail or navigating grocery stores. The technology also features optical character recognition (OCR) to read text aloud from menus and signs, providing crucial access to information. While advocates acknowledge the technology is still a work in progress, they praise Meta's collaboration with the blind community to improve its functionality and meaningfulness.</p>
