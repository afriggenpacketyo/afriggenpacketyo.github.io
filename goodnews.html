          <h2>Formula 1 Stewards Review Verstappen-Russell Incident</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 03:11:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the Spanish Grand Prix, Max Verstappen and George Russell made contact in Turn One, leading to a stewards' inquiry. Red Bull ordered Verstappen to give the place back based on recent incidents and the expectation of a penalty. The stewards later ruled that Russell had momentarily lost control and collided with Verstappen, taking no further action. Christian Horner admitted that Red Bull's decision to pit Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car was also a mistake. The optimism score for this article is moderately high, as it primarily concerns the sporting aspects of a Formula 1 race, with no severe injuries or significant negative consequences.</p>
