          <p>President Trump visited House Republicans to advocate for the passage of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act", urging them to set aside their reservations and support the legislation. Speaker Mike Johnson engaged in negotiations with various factions to address their concerns, with some progress being made. The bill encompasses a wide range of provisions, including extending the 2017 tax cuts, increasing military and immigration enforcement spending, and reducing funding for Medicaid, food stamps, education, and clean energy subsidies. Trump's entreaties initially failed to resolve the divisions, but by Tuesday evening, Speaker Johnson appeared to have made progress in behind-the-scenes negotiations with lawmakers from across the conference.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, gradually building immunity to multiple types of venom. Researchers are studying Friede's blood to synthesize a universal antivenom that could treat various venomous snake bites. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snakes bite one to three million people annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Current antivenoms are specific to certain venoms and derived from animals injected with small amounts of venom to produce antibodies.</p>

          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the US, has been met with skepticism from some within the Maga movement, who view him as a globalist. The article explores the potential challenges that Pope Leo XIV's papacy may pose to Catholic Maga figures, particularly regarding issues such as economic populism, immigration, and global cooperation. The new pope's choice of name is a sign that he recognizes the scale and the novelty of the challenge that the rightwing populist turn represents. The article suggests that Leo XIV's commitment to Catholic social teaching and universality may conflict with the nationalistic and insular views of Maga Catholics.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo metropolitan government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer, hoping to encourage residents to use air conditioning without hesitation during the predicted extreme heat. The supplementary budget bill, which includes 36.8 billion yen to cover the costs, will be submitted to the Tokyo metropolitan assembly in June. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike stated that the measure aims to protect residents' lives and daily living amidst declining real wages and surging prices. About 8.2 million households are expected to benefit, saving approximately 5,000 yen on their water bills over the four months.</p>

          <p>Leanne Lucas, a survivor of the Southport stabbings, is advocating for the use of blunt-tipped kitchen knives to reduce the risk of serious injuries, driven by her discomfort around knives since the attack. Lucas launched the "Let's Be Blunt" campaign, promoting the idea of swapping traditional pointed-tip blades with safer alternatives. She realized cooking had become a trigger for hyper-vigilance and is working to drive a cultural shift towards safer kitchen tools. The campaign aims to educate the public about the potential benefits of blunt-tipped knives, which are considered equally effective for everyday cooking purposes.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its scheme to pay out bonuses to senior executives linked with securing its ¬£3bn rescue loan following criticism from the government and the public. The company's "retention scheme" was set to amount to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, which could have led to them getting ¬£1m on top of their annual salaries and regular bonuses. The decision comes after Downing Street said bosses at the troubled firm "rewarding themselves for failure is clearly not acceptable". The company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with turnaround objectives and public expectations.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to "pause" its scheme to pay out big bonuses to senior executives linked with securing its ¬£3bn rescue loan. Thames had been accused by the environment secretary of "trying to circumvent" forthcoming rules to ban water companies from paying bonuses. Downing Street added ministers were "clear that, after presiding over years of mismanagement, Thames Water should not be handing itself bonuses". The company secured an emergency ¬£3bn loan in March to stave off collapse and is now looking to reduce its huge ¬£20bn debt pile by requiring lenders to accept a discount in what they are owed.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a dramatic 4-3 walk-off victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks, snapping a four-game losing streak. Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a stellar performance, pitching seven scoreless innings with nine strikeouts. Despite Tanner Scott blowing a one-run lead, the Dodgers rallied in the bottom of the 10th inning, with Tommy Edman, Will Smith, and Max Muncy contributing to the comeback. The victory was particularly important after Yamamoto's strong outing, which manager Dave Roberts emphasized needed to be capitalized on.</p>

          <p>Tuesday didn‚Äôt start as a game the Dodgers necessarily had to win. But, by the time extra innings arrived on a nervy night at Dodger Stadium, the team was in a situation where they simply couldn‚Äôt afford to lose. Not after entering the day with four consecutive losses, a season-long skid caused primarily by a banged-up pitching staff. Not after Yoshinobu Yamamoto looked like an ace, a stopper and a Cy Young candidate all wrapped in one, spinning seven scoreless innings in a nine-strikeout gem. Winning, of course, should have been a much simpler task for the Dodgers (30-19) on Tuesday night.</p>

The test will initially be available at about 50 American research institutes and hospitals that specialise in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, Goki Ishikawa, head of Fujirebio Holdings, a unit of Japan‚Äôs H.U.

The Food and Drug Administration cleared the blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer‚Äôs disease last week, potentially making it easier to find and treat patients with the memory-robbing disease that affects nearly 7 million Americans.</p>
