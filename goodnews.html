          <p>China has successfully completed the inaugural test flight of its next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, designed for lunar missions by 2030. The test involved a critical zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre. The Mengzhou spacecraft features two variants: one for near-Earth operations and another for deep-space missions. During the test, the spacecraft's escape engines ignited, the return capsule separated cleanly, and parachutes deployed for a safe landing, simulating emergency crew extraction during a launch failure. This marks China‚Äôs first test of this kind since 1998.</p>

          <p>Honda has successfully tested an experimental reusable space rocket on the island of Hokkaido, Japan. The company aims to achieve suborbital space flight by 2029, utilizing technologies amassed in the development of various products and automated driving systems. Honda sees potential in contributing to daily life by launching satellites with its own rockets, which could lead to services compatible with other Honda businesses. The company notes the growing expectations for a "data system in outer space" will increase the demand for satellite launch rockets. This marks a significant step for Honda in entering the space technology sector.</p>

Under the changes, most people in a sexual relationship of six months or more with a single partner will be eligible to donate blood, regardless of their gender or sexuality.

          <p>With Donald Trump's administration casting doubt on collective defense commitments, European allies need to take control of NATO to protect their interests, according to an analyst. This involves building a "European pillar of NATO," where European governments maximize NATO's chain of command and experience in collective defense. This would prepare them for a scenario where they may need to act without the United States. While maintaining transatlantic ties is crucial, Europe must be ready to lead in security matters, especially as the U.S. shifts its focus towards countering China.</p>
