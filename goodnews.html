          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, announced it has engineered its own hardware solution to cool the next generation of power-hungry Nvidia GPUs used for artificial intelligence. The new system, called the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), was developed because existing commercial options were too slow to implement or inefficient for AWS's massive scale. This custom hardware allows AWS to integrate Nvidia's latest high-density GPU clusters into its data centers more effectively. The move reflects a broader trend of major cloud providers developing bespoke infrastructure to optimize performance and control costs in the competitive AI landscape.</p>

          <p>Paris Saint-Germain delivered a commanding performance, defeating Real Madrid 4-0 to advance to the Club World Cup final against Chelsea. The French champions established their dominance early, scoring three goals within the first 24 minutes, with Fabian Ruiz netting two and Ousmane Dembele adding another. Analysts praised PSG's relentless pace and tactical "masterclass" under manager Luis Enrique, highlighting the team's evolution since the departure of Kylian Mbappé, who now plays for the defeated Madrid side. The decisive victory continues PSG's impressive run as they seek a fourth major trophy of the year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a stark reversal of roles, Ousmane Dembélé's relentless work rate and brilliant play for Paris Saint-Germain completely overshadowed Kylian Mbappé's debut against his former club. Dembélé was instrumental in PSG's 4-0 Club World Cup semi-final victory, scoring one goal and forcing errors that led to others, showcasing his transformation under coach Luis Enrique. In contrast, Mbappé and his fellow Real Madrid stars appeared disjointed and unable to counter PSG's cohesive and energetic system. The match highlighted PSG's successful team-focused rebuild and raised questions about Madrid's ability to integrate its high-profile attackers.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin reached a new all-time high on Wednesday, briefly exceeding $112,000, buoyed by a broader rally in technology stocks. The cryptocurrency's surge coincided with Nvidia becoming the first company to momentarily reach a $4 trillion market capitalization, indicating a strong "risk-on" sentiment among investors. Despite significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, the digital asset's price had been relatively stable for weeks. Analysts suggest the rally reflects growing institutional adoption and positive momentum ahead of potential crypto-related legislative action in Washington D.C. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined a request from Florida officials to lift a lower court's injunction against a controversial state immigration law. The law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, would have made it a state felony for certain undocumented immigrants to enter Florida. A federal judge had previously blocked the law, ruling that it unconstitutionally encroached on the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration policy. The Supreme Court's decision keeps the law on hold while the legal challenge, brought by the ACLU, proceeds in the lower courts.</p>

The acquisition would bring iconic cereal brands like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes under Ferrero's ownership. The potential deal reflects ongoing consolidation in the packaged foods industry, as many legacy cereal brands have faced declining sales due to consumer shifts toward healthier breakfast options and private-label alternatives. WK Kellogg became a standalone company after spinning off from Kellanova in 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold has recently declined by about 4%, prompting discussion about whether this is an opportune moment to invest. While the drop is modest, it offers a lower entry point into a market that has seen significant gains in 2024 and is projected by some to rise further. Given that factors like inflation reports and Federal Reserve decisions could soon influence prices again, acting now could be strategic. The article suggests that the dip is likely temporary, and waiting could risk being priced out of the market permanently. (not investment advice)</p>
