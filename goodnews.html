          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the number detected in 2022. The company attributes the increase to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and improvements in their detection systems. Tripadvisor employs a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to moderate reviews. The report categorizes fake submissions into boosting, vandalism, member fraud, and paid reviews, with paid reviews being a smaller but "more pernicious" category. The article explains the steps Tripadvisor is taking to combat fake reviews.</p>
