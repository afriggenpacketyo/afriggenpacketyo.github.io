          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 18:33:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, have consistently ruled that the Trump administration must provide due process to immigrants facing deportation. This stance challenges the administration's efforts to expedite deportations by circumventing constitutional protections. The Supreme Court recently criticized the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants before deportation. The courts' actions underscore the importance of due process rights for all individuals, regardless of citizenship status, before being deprived of liberty or property.</p>

          <p>China is investing heavily in the digitalization of museums and cultural heritage sites to preserve history, strengthen national pride, and enhance its soft power. This initiative includes using advanced technologies like 3D scanning, AI, and VR to bring ancient history to life for new generations. An example is the digital Tangut princess Yun Zhuo at Dafo Temple, who interacts with visitors, showcasing China's integration of various ethnic groups. This push contrasts with budget cuts for cultural heritage in many Western countries, highlighting China's ambition to become a cultural superpower.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the European Union. This reciprocal arrangement would allow young people to move abroad for up to two years. While Starmer insists this is not a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement, Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized the scheme as "free movement through the back door". An agreement is expected at the upcoming summit, though details regarding age eligibility and numerical caps remain unclear.</p>

This success marks the first combat validation for Chinese aircraft using domestic systems, representing a breakthrough for Chinese air power and demonstrating a doctrinal shift towards ecosystem-centric warfare. </p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator called Mosura fentoni, nicknamed the "sea moth." The fossilized remains were found in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. The creature, about the length of an index finger, had a circular mouth lined with teeth and claws extending from its head. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period and reveals that the creature was more complex than previously understood.</p>
