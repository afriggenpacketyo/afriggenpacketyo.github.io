        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia announced quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with sales growth remaining above 50 percent. This performance is largely attributed to the sustained high demand for its data center chips, which are crucial for artificial intelligence infrastructure. Despite the positive results, the company's data center revenue fell slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter, and the company noted it sold no advanced H20 chips to China during the period. The report signals continued confidence in the AI market's expansion, with Nvidia's board also approving an additional $60 billion in share repurchases. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising vehicle prices and high interest rates, a financial analysis from Edmunds highlights several costly errors consumers make when buying a car. The report advises against purchasing a vehicle beyond one's means, particularly with long-term financing that can exceed 60 months. Other key mistakes include relying solely on dealership financing without securing a pre-approved loan, and trading in a vehicle with negative equity, which rolls existing debt into a new loan. The article also recommends working with a dealership's internet sales team for better pricing and considering certified pre-owned vehicles to avoid rapid depreciation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Country music artist Carly Pearce has revealed that she knew her marriage to fellow singer Michael Ray was a mistake from the very night they wed. In a podcast appearance, Pearce described the relationship as being driven more by "hot and heavy lust" than genuine love, admitting they lacked deep conversations and a connection to reality. She filed for divorce in 2020 after just eight months, stating that the marriage was not what she had "signed up for." Despite the difficult experience, Pearce says she is now in the happiest season of her life and credits the divorce with teaching her about her own strength and self-worth.</p>

          <p>Southern California is preparing for potential rainfall, thunderstorms, and hazardous surf conditions this week due to the remnants of Tropical Storm Juliette. The storm, currently weakening off the coast of Mexico, is expected to move north and bring increasing moisture to the region starting Wednesday night. While no major alerts have been issued, forecasters predict scattered showers and a chance of thunderstorms, particularly in the mountains of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. This moisture arrives after a significant heat wave, and the system is also expected to create dangerous rip currents along the coast through Friday.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, savers are advised to take strategic steps now to maximize returns on certificates of deposit (CDs). Financial experts recommend shopping at online banks, which typically offer higher rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions due to lower overhead costs. It is also crucial for savers to accurately determine the amount they can afford to deposit to avoid early withdrawal penalties that can negate interest earnings. Finally, securing the longest-term CD that fits one's budget can lock in current higher rates, protecting funds from the effects of future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Highlight Benefits of Home Equity Lines of Credit for Homeowners in September</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As homeowners navigate the current financial landscape, experts suggest that a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) could be a particularly advantageous borrowing tool this September. HELOCs currently offer lower average interest rates compared to home equity loans, personal loans, and credit cards, making them one of the most affordable financing options. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates, the variable interest rates on HELOCs could become even cheaper for borrowers. Additionally, rising home equity levels across the country mean that homeowners have a larger pool of funds to draw from for significant expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer Kohl's jumped 24% after the company reported fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. Despite a decline in overall sales, the department store demonstrated progress by reducing inventory and lowering expenses. The company narrowed its full-year sales guidance to the higher end of its previous range and revised its earnings outlook upward. Interim CEO Michael Bender acknowledged that lower- and middle-income customers are trading down but stated that Kohl's is focused on winning them back by reintroducing popular categories and adjusting its discount strategy.

While Bradley admitted that the decision "hurts" his personal ambition to compete, he described the captaincy as the "ultimate job in golf" and a significant honor. The move ends speculation that he might become the first playing captain since Arnold Palmer, a dual role considered exceedingly difficult given the modern demands of the event. By prioritizing his leadership role, he aims to eliminate any perception of self-interest and fully inspire the players selected to represent the American side.</p>

          <p>Restaurant chain Cracker Barrel has abandoned its new logo and reverted to its original design following intense criticism from customers and a significant drop in its market value. The rebrand, which removed the iconic image of "Uncle Herschel" from the logo, was met with accusations that the company was abandoning its classic, nostalgic identity for a "sterile" and "soulless" design. The episode is cited by branding experts as a case study in how companies can alienate their core customer base by failing to honor their brand's heritage. After initially defending the refresh, the company acknowledged the misstep and reinstated the original logo to show it was listening to its patrons.</p>

          <p>The New York Mets are calling up their No. 4 prospect, right-handed pitcher Jonah Tong, to make his Major League Baseball debut on Friday. The 22-year-old has had a dominant season in the minor leagues, leading all players in both strikeouts and earned-run average (ERA). Tong began the year in Double-A before a recent promotion to Triple-A, where he continued his success by not allowing a run in over 11 innings. His promotion comes as the Mets, currently in a playoff race, look to manage their pitching rotation during a long stretch of consecutive games, giving a promising young talent a major opportunity.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that nearly six million full-time workers in the U.S. earned six-figure salaries in 2023 without holding a bachelor's degree. The analysis by Lending Tree, based on Census Bureau data, highlights numerous pathways to high earnings outside of traditional higher education. Occupations with a significant share of high earners without degrees include software developers, architectural and engineering managers, elevator installers, and power plant operators. The findings come as many question the return on investment of a costly four-year degree, and as a growing number of employers are loosening their formal education requirements for applicants.

          <p>The NFL has relaxed some of the restrictions placed on Tom Brady as he enters his second season as a broadcaster for Fox while also being a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders. Last year, the league prohibited Brady from attending pre-game production meetings with teams to avoid conflicts of interest. The NFL has now lifted that rule, although he must still attend the meetings remotely and is barred from team facilities for practices. This adjustment allows Brady more access for his analyst role, reflecting a revised balance between his duties as a media personality and his position within an NFL franchise's ownership group.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., has chosen not to return a felony indictment against a former Justice Department employee who was arrested for throwing a sandwich at a federal officer.

Dunn, who was subsequently fired from his paralegal position, admitted to the act upon his arrest.
