        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several dozen Afghan nationals, including former employees of German institutions and others at risk of persecution, have arrived in Germany after securing visas through legal action. Their arrival comes despite the German government's recent move to pause resettlement plans as part of a tougher stance on immigration. A court recently ruled that the government has the right to stop issuing visas, but the families that arrived successfully acquired them after filing lawsuits. The situation highlights the ongoing challenges for Afghans seeking refuge and the shifting immigration policies within Germany.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reached an agreement with Crystal Palace to sign England center-back Marc Guehi, with the deal expected to be finalized after a medical examination. The transfer fee is a compromise from Liverpool's initial £35 million offer. This signing is part of a significant summer spending spree for the Premier League champions, aimed at strengthening their defense after conceding multiple goals early in the season. The acquisition of Guehi follows several other high-profile signings, pushing the club's total summer expenditure to a record high.</p>

          <p>Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has announced an ambitious plan for the country to become a fully digital, cashless society by 2030, but experts and citizens remain skeptical. The goal faces major obstacles, including a high rate of economic informality, a large rural population accustomed to cash, and significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities exposed by recent major attacks on government systems. Financial experts argue the plan is populist and unrealistic without massive investment and a foundational shift in financial culture, while small business owners fear it will be detrimental to their operations.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has officially withdrawn its subpoena for former FBI Director Robert Mueller to testify regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. A committee aide stated that the decision was made after learning of health issues that prevent Mueller from being able to testify. Mueller, 81, was reportedly diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2021. The subpoena was issued last month as part of the committee's investigation into the FBI's handling of the Epstein investigation during Mueller's tenure as director from 2001 to 2013.</p>

          <p>A solar eruption over the weekend is expected to create a geomagnetic storm, potentially making the aurora borealis visible across 18 northern U.S. states and Canada on Monday night into early Tuesday. According to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, the celestial light display will be caused by a coronal mass ejection interacting with Earth's magnetic field. While not predicted to be as intense as the major storm in spring 2024, it offers a significant opportunity for skygazers in states like Montana, Michigan, Maine, and New York to witness the phenomenon.</p>

          <p>A team of five Nigerians has completed a marathon of reading aloud for over 431 hours in an attempt to set a new Guinness World Record. The event, organized by the nonprofit Naija ReadFest in Lagos, aimed to promote literacy and celebrate Nigerian authors in a country where many lack access to books. Over 18 days, the group read 79 books by local authors, taking turns to ensure the reading was continuous. The effort is pending official confirmation from Guinness World Records but has drawn attention to Nigeria's educational challenges.</p>

          <p>The man filmed taking a hat from a young fan at the US Open has issued a public apology, calling his action a "huge mistake." Piotr Szczerek, a Polish CEO, claimed he was convinced tennis player Kamil Majchrzak was tossing the hat in his direction and did not intend to take it from a child. After the video went viral and sparked widespread criticism, Szczerek stated he returned the hat to the boy. The tennis player later met with the young fan to give him a new cap and other merchandise.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's national train operator, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for travel during busy weekday morning and evening hours. The move, which follows a pilot scheme, aims to make rail travel more affordable and encourage commuters to switch from cars to trains. An Edinburgh to Glasgow ticket will now be almost 50% cheaper during peak times. The Scottish government, which owns ScotRail, expects the policy to cost between £40 million and £45 million annually, which it views as a sustainable investment.</p>

          <p>With CD interest rates having fallen from their recent peaks, savers are looking for the best returns. According to financial professionals, short-term CDs, particularly those with a six-month term, are currently offering the most attractive rates, with some yields still above 4%. While longer-term CDs historically offered higher rates, the current inverted yield curve makes shorter terms more lucrative. Experts suggest that savers looking to maximize immediate returns should focus on these short-term options, while those seeking to lock in current rates might consider a CD ladder strategy.

          <p>Amanda Goetz, a two-time startup founder, is promoting a concept she calls "sustainable ambition" as an alternative to "toxic grit" and hustle culture. After experiencing severe burnout that led to hospitalization, she developed a strategy of intentionally scheduling cycles of intense work followed by periods of proactive rest. Goetz argues that ambitious individuals can have it all, but not all at once, and should periodically reevaluate their priorities. Her approach involves accepting that different areas of life require focus at different times, creating a healthier rhythm for long-term success.</p>

          <p>German soccer club Bayer Leverkusen has fired head coach Erik ten Hag just two games into the Bundesliga season. The decision follows a disappointing start, including a home defeat and a draw where the team collapsed late against a 10-man opponent. The club's sporting director cited a lack of feasibility in building a successful team as the reason for the abrupt dismissal. The move highlights the immense pressure on the club, which is undergoing a major rebuild after selling several key players from its historic title-winning squad of the previous season.</p>

          <p>A scientific study has confirmed that humans can build rapport with cats by mimicking their "slow blink" expression. Researchers found that cats are more likely to approach and interact positively with humans who narrow their eyes and blink slowly, an action interpreted as a "cat smile." This behavior, which signals benign intentions, was effective with both familiar and unfamiliar cats. The study provides evidence for what many cat owners have long suspected and offers a simple, practical way for people to enhance their bond with their feline companions.</p>

          <p>The All England Club has indicated it will not be changing the format of the Wimbledon mixed doubles tournament, despite the recent success of a "reimagined" event at the US Open. The US Open's pre-tournament competition attracted top singles players and large crowds, prompting calls for other Grand Slams to follow suit. However, Wimbledon officials consider their traditional mixed doubles event a key part of the tournament's identity and believe doubles competitions are already more appreciated at the Championships. The discussion highlights the different approaches Grand Slams are taking to engage fans.</p>
