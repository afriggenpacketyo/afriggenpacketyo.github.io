          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman disclosed that Meta Platforms attempted to recruit OpenAI employees by offering signing bonuses up to $100 million and substantial annual compensation packages. Altman noted that none of OpenAI's top talent had accepted Meta's offers, even though Meta views OpenAI as a primary competitor. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is personally building an AI team for a "superintelligence" AI lab and investing heavily in AI research. This follows Meta's delay in releasing its latest AI model due to capability concerns and Zuckerberg's frustration with Meta's AI progress. </p>

          <p>An article explores why straight men are often perceived as "bad" at gossip and how this may contribute to male loneliness. While research suggests that men gossip as much as women, they tend to share less neutral information, potentially due to cultural norms. Men's fear of appearing "messy" and societal stigmas around gossip can prevent them from fully engaging in social storytelling. The piece suggests that improving men's gossip skills could foster closer friendships and address the male loneliness epidemic. </p>
