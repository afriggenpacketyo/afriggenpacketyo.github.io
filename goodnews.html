Drawing on philosopher Erich Fromm, the advice highlights the importance of freedom and personal growth in love, while cautioning against masochistic self-sacrifice. It's suggested that the couple focus on strengthening their current relationship and addressing any insecurities before considering opening it up, ensuring both partners feel secure and respected.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, was diverted to Rome after it was determined that the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was too large to land at Naples Airport. Passengers were then transported by bus from Rome to Naples, a journey of approximately three hours. The airline cited "operational limitations" as the reason for the diversion, with historical flight data showing that a smaller Boeing 787-8 is typically used for this route. American Airlines apologized for the disruption to passengers' travel plans, and the incident has highlighted logistical challenges in air travel.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's goal to revive manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to find skilled workers to build and maintain airplanes. The average age of aircraft mechanics is high, with a significant portion nearing retirement, leading to projected shortages. Airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger talent by highlighting competitive wages and offering on-the-job training to obtain FAA licenses. While manufacturing jobs are seen as politically important, geographical immobility and competition from other sectors pose challenges in filling the growing demand for skilled aviation technicians.</p>

          <p>Italians are participating in a two-day referendum on changes to citizenship and labor laws, with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni urging supporters to abstain from voting. The referendum includes proposals to reduce the residency requirement for citizenship applications and to increase worker protections against dismissal. Campaigners for the citizenship law change argue it will help integrate second-generation Italians, while Meloni's right-wing coalition opposes the measure. The outcome of the referendum hinges on voter turnout, with a 50% threshold required for the results to be binding.</p>

          <p>The article argues that "anticipatory compliance" with Donald Trump's policies smooths the way to autocracy, urging instead a strategy of "anticipatory noncompliance." It cites examples of institutions, such as universities and law firms, preemptively censoring themselves or altering their practices to align with Trump's agenda. The author suggests that this behavior grants the regime unchecked power and calls for resistance through challenges to unconstitutional actions. The article highlights examples of pushback in education, the legal profession, and the corporate world, suggesting that popular opposition is emerging.</p>
