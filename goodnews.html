          <p>First Lady Melania Trump wrote a personal "peace letter" to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which was hand-delivered by President Trump during their summit in Alaska. In the letter, she appealed to Putin to protect children and future generations, stating he could "singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter" and serve humanity by implementing a vision of peace. The letter frames the responsibility of world leaders as a duty to nurture hope and guard the innocence of children, which transcends politics and ideology. Putin reportedly read the letter immediately upon receiving it in the presence of both delegations.</p>

          <p>A group of 96 cross-party British Members of Parliament has formally requested that the UK government evacuate sick and injured children from Gaza for medical treatment "without delay." In a letter to senior ministers, the MPs highlighted the "decimated" healthcare system in Gaza and the imminent risk of death for many children. They are calling for the removal of any barriers to evacuation, including waiving biometric visa requirements, and have asked for a clear timeline and adequate funding for the scheme. The letter also suggests that the children and their families be given the option to seek asylum in the UK after treatment.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that President Donald Trump's diplomatic efforts have brought the world "closer than ever before" to ending the war in Ukraine. Despite the lack of a formal ceasefire agreement from the Alaska summit, Starmer commended Trump's leadership in pursuing peace and welcomed the U.S. commitment to providing security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a potential deal. He affirmed that allies would continue to apply pressure on Russia through sanctions until a just and lasting peace is achieved. The statement highlights a key European ally's positive reception of the controversial diplomatic push.</p>

          <h2>Fashion Retailer Topshop Plans High Street Return with New Standalone Stores</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The iconic fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback to the UK high street, with plans to open new standalone physical stores. The brand, which was a cultural touchstone for a generation, closed all its stores after its parent company collapsed in 2020. Now owned by online retailer Asos, Topshop is leveraging nostalgia and a perceived gap in the market for its "London girl" aesthetic to attract both its former core audience and a new generation of shoppers. The brand's return was marked by its first catwalk show in seven years, signaling a confident relaunch into a challenging retail environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both closed the week higher, setting several new record highs along the way. Market optimism was largely fueled by a July consumer price index report that showed inflation cooling more than anticipated, which in turn increased investor expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. Despite a subsequent report showing a rise in wholesale inflation, market sentiment remained positive. The week also saw strong earnings from companies like Cisco, and several major stocks, including Nvidia and Meta, reached all-time highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An architecture-led startup in Phoenix, Arizona, is repurposing old shipping containers to create innovative, rapidly deployable shelters for the city's unhoused population. The "X-WING" shelters are constructed from four containers arranged in an X-shape, creating five private, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. This sustainable approach provides secure and dignified housing in a city facing extreme heat and a growing homelessness crisis. The project aims to offer a cost-effective and environmentally friendly model to help address the broader affordable housing shortage in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson claimed victory over Olympic champion Noah Lyles in their first 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics. Thompson ran a blistering 9.87 seconds to win at the Silesia Diamond League meet in Poland, with Lyles finishing a close second at 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second a year prior. Both athletes are now looking ahead to the upcoming world championships in Tokyo, with this race setting the stage for their ongoing rivalry.</p>
