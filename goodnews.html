          <p>Circle's stock experienced a significant rally after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, landmark legislation for stablecoins, with shares climbing 14% on Friday. The bill, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoin usage, now proceeds to the House of Representatives. Coinbase shares also rose, benefiting from revenue generated from Circle's USDC reserves. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, are gaining traction due to their potential for faster and cheaper payments, with companies like Amazon and Walmart exploring their use.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated the central bank could consider cutting interest rates as early as July, as he believes tariffs will not significantly boost inflation. In a CNBC interview, Waller stated that moving slowly to ease rates is appropriate given the absence of a major economic threat from inflation. He emphasized the importance of acting to avoid potential labor market slowdowns, noting that waiting for a crash before cutting rates is undesirable. Waller's comments led to gains in stock market futures, although it remains uncertain whether his position will garner sufficient support within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).

          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow warning for thunderstorms in parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales.

Many regions are expected to meet heatwave criteria, with temperatures surpassing regional thresholds for three consecutive days.

          <p>A new study in Jama Pediatrics indicates that stricter state gun control measures are associated with a relative decrease in firearm deaths among children, while states with more permissive gun laws have seen an increase. The study categorized states based on the strength of their gun control laws and analyzed pediatric firearm death rates over a 12-year period. States with stricter laws, such as California and New York, saw decreased rates of pediatric firearm mortality, while more permissive states experienced substantial increases, especially among children of color. Experts emphasize the need for lawmakers to translate these findings into action, prioritizing measures like universal background checks and safe-storage regulations.</p>

As tensions escalated, Alexander's Iranian guide advised him to conceal his nationality and avoid contact with others, and he was later interviewed by Iranian officials before successfully crossing the border into Azerbaijan. The U.S. State Department advised him of options for Americans wishing to leave Iran, based on their current locations. Alexander hopes to raise money for his guide and his family, who are still in Iran, and intends to continue his bike ride to Japan.</p>

This confirmation aligns with earlier findings and has implications for understanding the Moon's magnetic field and its evolution.</p>
