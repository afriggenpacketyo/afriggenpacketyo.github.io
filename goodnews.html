          <p>This New York Times article covers several key events from the day. The Supreme Court announced it would review a case concerning the deportation of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership, focusing on due process concerns under the Alien Enemies Act, while a New Jersey Transit strike caused major commuter disruptions due to failed wage negotiations. Additionally, the article mentions Republicans blocking their own party's megabill in the House Budget Committee over budget cut disagreements, and the Department of Homeland Security considering a reality TV show for immigrants seeking citizenship. The article also touches on international peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, and the upcoming Eurovision Song Contest, plus the start of the W.N.B.A. season.

          <p>Vietnam and the United States engaged in direct ministerial-level negotiations in response to a potential 46% U.S. tariff on Vietnamese imports, which could severely impact Vietnam's economic growth. The Vietnamese trade ministry indicated that the meeting symbolized both nations' commitment to fostering a stable economic, trade, and investment relationship. The U.S. has postponed the tariff implementation until July, and Vietnam has implemented measures to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S., including lowering tariffs on U.S. goods and curbing the shipment of Chinese goods through its territory.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, reducing visibility to near zero and prompting the National Weather Service to issue only its second dust storm warning for the area. The storm, caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, forced drivers to pull over, delayed flights at Midway International Airport, and disrupted a high school graduation ceremony. Residents described the event as surreal and unprecedented, with skies clearing up within 30 to 45 minutes after the storm passed. The article highlights the unusual nature of the event, as dust storm warnings are more common in rural areas.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates was marked by extravagant displays of honor and respect, including standing ovations, investment pledges, and national honors. In contrast to the backlash he faces at home over tariff policies and ethical questions, Trump was celebrated in the Gulf, where leaders lauded his approach to peace and profit over judgment and confrontation. The article highlights the economic investments announced during the trip and the absence of controversy regarding Trump's family business dealings in the region. It also notes the shift in U.S. policy toward the Middle East, moving away from human rights concerns and toward economic partnerships.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 00:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Wisconsin judge pleaded not guilty to federal charges of aiding an undocumented immigrant to evade immigration authorities, drawing parallels to a similar case in Massachusetts involving Judge Shelley Joseph. Joseph was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant escape ICE in 2018. While the Wisconsin case moved quickly, the Massachusetts case took over a year to result in charges, and the charges against Joseph were later dropped. These cases raise questions about the balance between state judges' authority and federal immigration enforcement, highlighting differing views on whether judges should prioritize upholding the law or protecting individuals based on their immigration status.</p>

          <p>As the United States reduces its investment and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is leveraging its wealth to become a dominant foreign player on the continent. Emirati corporations are investing heavily in key sectors such as ports, minerals, and renewable energy projects, with $110 billion in deals announced since 2019. This push is part of a broader strategy to diversify the UAE's economy away from fossil fuels and increase its influence over global supply chains, while the Trump administration's cuts to U.S. aid and development programs in Africa create a void for the UAE to fill.</p>
