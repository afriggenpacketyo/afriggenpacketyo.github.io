        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A geomagnetic storm, predicted to produce vibrant displays of the northern lights across many U.S. states, was weaker than initially forecast. While solar activity is currently at its maximum phase in an 11-year cycle, leading to more frequent and widespread aurora sightings, this particular storm did not deliver the expected intensity. Auroras are typically visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's atmosphere. Space weather experts note that the sun's active period is expected to continue through the end of the year, suggesting more opportunities for aurora sightings may arise.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent solar storms, the northern lights may be visible in several U.S. states. A coronal mass ejection from the sun prompted forecasters to issue a rare severe solar storm alert. The northern lights could be visible in states including Alaska, Washington, Montana, and Minnesota. The sun is currently at the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, making these light displays more common. Skygazers are advised to find a dark area away from city lights and check the weather forecast for clear skies to maximize their chances of seeing the aurora.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration remains confident that the Alaska LNG project will attract investors despite its $40 billion price tag. President Trump has prioritized the project, which involves building an 800-mile pipeline from the North Slope to the Cook Inlet for gas liquefaction and export to Asian allies. Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes financing will be straightforward if commercial offtakers are secured, suggesting countries looking to reduce trade deficits with the U.S. could invest. However, energy analysts are skeptical, citing the project's lack of clear commercial logic. The Department of Defense is reportedly ready to support the project by purchasing gas for its bases in Alaska.</p>

          <p>South Korea is holding a snap presidential election to choose a successor to former President Yoon Suk Yeol. Yoon was impeached and removed from office following his attempt to impose martial law. The National Assembly voted to impeach Yoon in December, and the Constitutional Court upheld the decision in April, triggering the need for elections within 60 days. The election marks a significant step towards stabilizing the country after months of political turmoil. Voters are now tasked with selecting a new leader to address the country's challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight California outposts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. The lawmakers argued that closing these offices would negatively impact the USDA's ability to support California's agricultural sector. The reversal comes after the administration had initially planned to close the offices as part of a broader effort to cut costs. The decision to keep the offices open will ensure that farmers in California continue to have access to essential resources and support.</p>

          <p>A runway at Newark Liberty International Airport has reopened nearly two weeks ahead of schedule following renovations. The closure of the runway had contributed to recent flight delays and cancellations. Officials expect the reopening to ease congestion at the airport, which has been struggling with staffing shortages and technical issues. The Federal Aviation Administration says it is also contending with low staffing levels at the Philadelphia TRACON, the radar center that handles flight traffic around Newark.</p>
