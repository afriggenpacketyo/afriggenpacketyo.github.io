          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder, spoke out after being detained during a citizenship interview, asserting that President Trump will not silence him.

He believes his detention was retaliation for his protected speech and advocacy for justice and peace.

          <p>A declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which was used to justify deporting Venezuelans to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment enables the gang, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's operations in the United States. The release of the memo further calls into question the Trump administration‚Äôs rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The legislation provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Democrats argue that the bill hurts public schools and primarily benefits wealthier students already in private school. President Trump praised the bill's passage, stating it is a victory for students and parents.</p>
