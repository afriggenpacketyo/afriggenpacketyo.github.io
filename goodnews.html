          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK), a Kurdish militant group, has declared its intention to disband and disarm as part of a new peace initiative with Turkey after a 40-year insurgency. This decision follows a call from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who urged the group to disarm and pursue Kurdish rights through political means. The PKK's announcement signifies a potential turning point in the decades-long conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives and could reshape Turkish politics. The group stated that it had carried the Kurdish issue to a level where it can be solved by democratic politics, thus completing its historical mission.</p>

          <p>According to royal experts, Kate Middleton has achieved royal success by adhering to royal norms and not acting as a rebel, unlike Princess Diana. Edward White, author of "Dianaworld: An Obsession," emphasizes that Kate was more mature when she married Prince William at 29, learning from Diana's experiences to avoid rushing into royal life. Diana's youth and lack of preparation led to struggles within the monarchy, while Kate benefits from family support and a longer transition into her royal role. Kate's strategy involves fulfilling her duties without drawing excessive attention, contrasting with Diana's more public struggles and media interactions.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party, or P.K.K., announced it would lay down its arms and disband, a decision that could reshape Turkish politics and reverberate in neighboring countries. This announcement follows a call from its imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who suggested that the group's armed struggle had outlived its initial purpose. The move could end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives and may influence other Kurdish militias, particularly in Syria. President Erdogan can claim to have done what his predecessors failed to do, and the P.K.K.‚Äôs dissolution could expand his support among Kurds, which many analysts suspect that he covets to change the Constitution and seek a third presidential term.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has pledged to use executive powers to cut prescription drug prices in the U.S. by 30% to 80%, aiming to align them more closely with other countries. This announcement triggered a sell-off in pharmaceutical stocks due to concerns about potential profit declines if prices are reduced. Trump intends to introduce a "most favored nation" policy, ensuring the U.S. pays the same price as the nation with the lowest drug prices globally. While the U.S. government already negotiates prices for some medicines under Medicare, Trump's proposed order could have a broader impact on the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

Mohanty observed that mainstream banks often don't understand how immigrant communities manage their money, and much of the financial innovation for immigrants focuses on remittances rather than wealth-building.

          <h2>US-China Trade Talks Seen as Symbolic with Long Road Ahead</h2>

          <p>The recent China-US trade talks in Geneva are viewed as politically symbolic, providing both powers with interim relief at home without appearing weak on the trade war front. While the negotiators agreed to establish a ‚Äútrade consultation mechanism,‚Äù analysts suggest that substantive deals addressing tariffs and other trade barriers are still a long way off. The U.S. is under political pressure to show wins, while China sees negotiations as a strategic process to manage bilateral competition and economic resilience. China aims to insulate its domestic economy from external shocks while selectively engaging in global markets.</p>

          <p>Reports of the Trump administration considering a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family have sparked controversy, raising questions about ethics and potential violations of constitutional rules. US presidents have a history of accepting gifts from foreign powers, ranging from furniture to animals, all governed by a complex bureaucratic process. Gifts valued over $480 are considered property of the U.S. government and are managed by the White House Gift Unit. While leaders use gifts to strengthen relationships, concerns about bribery and corruption persist, necessitating strict adherence to regulations.</p>
