Following the announcement, U.S. Steel shares surged by more than 20%, reflecting investor optimism about the deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Quilcene School District in Washington has voted to maintain sports competition based on athletes' birth gender, defying a state policy that allows transgender students to participate based on their gender identity. This decision has sparked controversy, with some board members arguing that Title IX supports gender-based sports, while others claim it is "immoral" to exclude transgender females. The state's superintendent of public instruction has stated that the district's policy defies state law, which prohibits discrimination based on gender identity. The WIAA has proposed creating a separate open division for transgender athletes in response to growing concerns.</p>

The ship reportedly damaged a heating pipe in the cabin, but the homeowner considered himself lucky that the ship did not directly hit his house.

Some gold assets, like ETFs, are better bets than others due to lower premiums and easier trading.

          <p>New Jersey is holding gubernatorial elections this year, with contested primaries in June. Experts suggest the race could be a bellwether for the 2026 midterm elections. The Democratic primary features six candidates, with U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill leading in polls. Republicans are hoping to flip the governorship red, with Trump endorsing Jack Ciattarelli. The race will address issues such as immigration, housing costs, and affordability.</p>
