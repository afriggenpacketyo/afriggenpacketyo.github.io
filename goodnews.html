The pan-European Stoxx 600 index rose 0.1%, although major national indices like the FTSE and DAX saw slight declines within the first hour. This article notes that the U.K. economy expanded by a meager 0.1% in August, while the Swiss government reduced its 2026 growth forecast to 0.9% due to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Investors are also closely monitoring U.S. bank earnings and the persistent trade tensions with China, contributing to the cautious market sentiment across the continent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests Women Biologically Require More Sleep Than Men</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that women not only sleep differently but also biologically require more sleep than men, averaging 11 to 13 minutes longer nightly, with some studies suggesting up to 20 extra minutes. This increased need is linked to complex daytime functions like multitasking, emotional regulation, hormonal balance, and the menstrual cycle. Beyond physiology, social and structural factors, such as disproportionate domestic labor and non-traditional work shifts, significantly contribute to women's sleep debt. Despite built-in biological resilience, this article notes that women report insomnia symptoms twice as often as men, a trend beginning as early as puberty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy expanded by a slight 0.1% in August, showing a modest recovery from a 0.1% contraction in July, primarily driven by a 0.7% increase in manufacturing output. However, the crucial services sector experienced no growth during the month, contributing to an overall sluggish outlook. This article highlights that while the economy showed some improvement over the three months to August, economists anticipate potential tax rises or spending cuts in the upcoming Budget. Concerns about higher household costs and uncertainty are expected to weigh on economic activity, suggesting growth will remain subdued in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Uruguay has legalized euthanasia, becoming the first country in Latin America to pass a law allowing terminally ill, mentally sound adults with irreversible diseases to opt for assisted death performed by a healthcare professional. The "Dignified Death" bill was approved by the Senate with 20 votes in favor, following earlier passage in the lower house. This article notes that the law does not permit assisted suicide where patients self-administer medication, distinguishing it from other practices. Uruguay continues its history of socially liberal laws in the predominantly Catholic region, having previously legalized cannabis, same-sex marriages, and abortion, with over 60% public support for euthanasia.</p>

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate at 7.0968 per U.S. dollar, its strongest since October last year. This article notes that a Fed governor cited U.S.-China trade tensions as adding risks to the U.S. economic outlook, making rate cuts more urgent.

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce and General Administration of Customs announced new export controls on lithium batteries and related materials, effective November 8. These controls target high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries, key production equipment, and critical cathode/anode materials. This article links the controls to China's significant advancements in solid-state battery science, including technologies pushing energy density to 600 Wh/kg and maintaining high capacity over many cycles. Analysts suggest the move aims to consolidate China's advantage in the lithium battery industry, slow competitors' progress, and respond to the growing strategic importance of high-performance batteries for military applications.</p>
