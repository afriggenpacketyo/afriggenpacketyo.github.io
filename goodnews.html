          <p>Bitcoin's price surged above $100,000 for the first time since February, fueled by positive sentiment surrounding a potential trade agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. The cryptocurrency's rise coincided with President Trump's announcement of a broad outline for the agreement, boosting market confidence and reaffirming Bitcoin's status as a resilient asset. Analysts suggest that ongoing market uncertainty and a pro-crypto administration are contributing factors to Bitcoin's strength, positioning it as a safe haven amidst geopolitical tensions. The article notes that the situation between India and Pakistan, alongside the Federal Reserve's concerns about unemployment and inflation, could further test Bitcoin's resilience.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a "most favored nation" plan aimed at lowering Medicare drug prices, reprising an initiative from his first term. The plan seeks to tie the prices of high-cost Medicare drugs to the lowest prices paid in other countries. Previous attempts to implement this policy were blocked by court orders, citing improper rulemaking steps. The Biden administration abandoned the proposal in 2022, citing similar concerns. Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hinted at the policy's return, emphasizing the need to address high drug prices, particularly for medications like Ozempic.</p>

          <p>The Gates Foundation announced that it will close its doors on December 31, 2045, after 20 more years of generous aid, marking a significant shift in its philanthropic strategy. Bill Gates emphasized that the decision allows the foundation to spend down its endowment and his remaining personal fortune more aggressively, targeting health and human development with a "bolus dose" approach. The move comes amid concerns about declining global giving, the Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid, and post-pandemic setbacks. Gates expressed optimism that the foundation's goals can be achieved in a shorter time frame, citing advancements in biomedical tools and the potential of A.I.</p>

          <p>California drivers who filed claims in a $50 million settlement over gasoline price gouging are beginning to receive payments. The settlement stems from allegations that three gasoline trading firms manipulated gas prices in 2015 following an explosion at an Exxon Mobile refinery. As a result, consumers paid more for their gas. The payments, averaging $21.65 per claimant, are being distributed via check, direct deposit, or Venmo. The settlement did not include an admission of fault from the trading companies.</p>
