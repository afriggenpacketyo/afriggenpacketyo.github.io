          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce a ¬£15 billion investment in transport projects across England, focusing on tram, train, and bus improvements in mayoral authorities. The funding aims to address regional disparities and stimulate growth in the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. Key projects include tram extensions in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, as well as the start of the West Yorkshire Mass Transit programme. This investment marks a shift away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the South-East. </p>

          <p>Tesla reported a significant rebound in Australian electric vehicle sales in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months. This surge was primarily driven by record sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV, which saw a 122.5% year-over-year increase. Despite this positive performance, Tesla's overall sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the same period last year. Globally, Tesla has faced challenges due to increased competition and reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities, but Australia stands out as a bright spot.</p>
