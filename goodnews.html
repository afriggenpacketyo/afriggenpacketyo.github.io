While Renault has not officially confirmed plans for an AWD 4, the concept demonstrates the potential for a dual-motor setup. If it reaches showrooms, the 4 4x4 will be among the smallest electric cars available with a twin-motor powertrain, opening possibilities for similar setups in other Renault models.</p>
