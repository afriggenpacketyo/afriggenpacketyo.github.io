          <h2>Psychiatrist Shares Five Parenting Rules for Raising Successful Children</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist with extensive experience working with young adults, offers five simple parenting rules to navigate the complexities of raising children in today's world. The advice emphasizes trusting parental instincts, embracing cultural traditions, following the child's interests, focusing on enjoyment over strict development metrics, and being authentic rather than striving for an unattainable ideal of perfection. The psychiatrist suggests that parents should follow their instincts and cultural traditions rather than influencers or clickbait, and that children learn best when they are happy and relaxed. Ross also advises parents to focus on their children's enjoyment and to be their real selves, rather than their ideal selves. </p>

          <p>Karla Flores, a 20-year-old, underwent a first-of-its-kind surgery to remove a tumor on her spine through her eye after an MRI revealed a second chordoma. Dr. Mohamed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center developed the unique surgical plan, called the 'third nostril' approach, after a misplaced MRI revealed the tumor. The surgery involved removing part of her eye socket and cheekbone to reach the tumor, and Flores has since undergone radiation treatment and is now cancer-free. The procedure offers a new approach for accessing difficult-to-reach tumors in the upper spine.</p>

          <p>A new chocolate trend, originating in Dubai, has taken over the globe, prompting U.S. companies like Shake Shack and Crumbl to create limited edition spinoffs. The original chocolate bars, created by Fix Dessert Chocolatier, are filled with pistachio cream, kadayif, and tahini. Despite the lack of international trademark protection, numerous companies have created dupes sold at major retailers like Target, Costco, Amazon, and Trader Joe's. The trend has lasted for 18 months, and companies are still joining in.</p>

          <p>What Martha Gutierrez DeRomero reported to authorities as a carjacking turned out to be an insurance scam, investigators say. DeRomero and her boyfriend, Alfredo Ledezma, were charged with insurance fraud and filing a false police report. She initially claimed that two masked men with knives stole her Chevy van containing $60,000 worth of fitness merchandise, but the story unraveled during multiple interviews. The van was found abandoned in nearby Merced County, and a storage locker contained the stolen goods, leading to the charges.</p>
