          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-06 15:11:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors considering a reverse mortgage to supplement retirement income, lenders typically require at least 50% to 60% equity in their home. While the FHA does not set a specific percentage, this threshold is a common industry standard to ensure homeowners can cover ongoing costs like taxes and insurance. The actual amount that can be borrowed depends on factors such as the homeowner's age, current interest rates, and FHA lending limits, not just the equity percentage. Homeowners who fall short of the equity requirement may have options like paying down their existing mortgage or downsizing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal of her sex-trafficking conviction, effectively finalizing her 20-year prison sentence. The court provided no explanation for its decision to decline the case. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for abuse by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. Her legal team expressed disappointment but stated they would continue to explore other legal avenues, though options for overturning the conviction are now severely limited.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court has found Ali Muhammad Ali Abd–Al-Rahman, a notorious leader of Sudan's Janjaweed militia, guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. This marks the ICC's first conviction for the atrocities committed in the region over two decades ago, where he was found responsible for murder, sexual assault, and torture as part of a government-backed plan to suppress a rebellion. The verdict is a landmark moment for international justice, though arrest warrants for other Sudanese officials, including former President Omar al-Bashir, remain outstanding.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club has added Corning to its watchlist, citing the company's crucial role in the expanding artificial intelligence infrastructure. As a leading manufacturer of specialty glass and fiber optic cables, Corning is experiencing booming demand due to the massive data requirements of modern AI data centers, which need significantly more fiber content than previous generations. The company's strong position is further bolstered by a major partnership with Apple to produce cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches, positioning it as a key player in both AI and consumer electronics supply chains.

          <p>For over six decades, the Bread and Puppet Theater has been a distinctive presence in American protest movements, known for its giant puppets and politically charged performances. Founded in 1963, the troupe continues to tour the country with its annual circus, blending medieval theatrical traditions with contemporary commentary on issues like capitalism, U.S. foreign policy, and labor rights. Despite facing a political climate that can be hostile to their anti-establishment ethos, the puppeteers remain committed to their founder's mission of making "the revolution irresistible" and providing catharsis through art.</p>
