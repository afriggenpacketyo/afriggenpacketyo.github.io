        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German language is experiencing a surge in popularity in Turkey, second only to English, driven by the country's close ties to Germany and a challenging domestic economy. Many young Turkish students are pursuing German to gain access to Germany's universities and robust job market, seeing it as a path to better career opportunities and academic freedom. This increased demand is creating a shortage of German language teachers in Turkey, as educational institutions struggle to keep up with students' aspirations for a future abroad. The trend reflects a broader desire among Turkish youth for greater economic stability and professional development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small colleges across the United States, such as Roanoke College in Virginia, are adding football programs in an effort to increase overall enrollment, particularly among male students. Administrators hope the sport will foster a greater sense of community and belonging, attracting more applicants at a time when male college attendance is declining. However, research indicates that while adding football may cause a brief, initial spike in male enrollment, it does not typically lead to sustained, long-term gains. These institutions are betting that the investment in athletics will create a more vibrant campus life and provide a crucial revenue stream.</p>

          <p>Child development and technology experts are urging parents to engage in early and open conversations with their children about generative artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT. They recommend that parents learn about AI themselves and explore the technology alongside their kids to teach responsible and ethical usage. While AI can be a helpful learning aid, it also poses risks, including providing misinformation or unsafe responses to mental health queries. The guidance emphasizes setting reasonable limits, fact-checking AI-generated content, and prioritizing real-world interactions to ensure technology serves as a tool, not a replacement for human connection.</p>

          <p>Colombia's highest court has ruled that Meta violated adult film actress Esperanza Gómez's right to freedom of expression by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court found that the company removed her account without a clear justification and applied its content moderation policies inconsistently, as other similar accounts remained active. The ruling orders Meta to adjust its terms of use to provide clearer mechanisms for challenging moderation decisions. This decision underscores a growing trend in South America where courts are holding social media platforms more accountable for their content policies.</p>

          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team is set to face England in a World Cup quarter-final, marking a significant moment in a rivalry historically dominated by the English side. It has been over 25 years since Scotland last secured a victory against England, a period during which the Red Roses have become a dominant force in the sport. Experts attribute the gap to England's early investment in professional structures and larger player pool. Despite the historical odds, there is a sense of belief within the improving Scottish team as they prepare for one of their biggest matches in decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boxing analysts are divided ahead of the highly anticipated fight between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford, with compelling arguments for each fighter. Those favoring Crawford point to his technical brilliance, adaptability, and potential to expose a perceived decline in Canelo, despite moving up two weight classes. Conversely, supporters of Álvarez emphasize his significant size and power advantage at the 168lb limit, his ring intelligence, and Crawford's less convincing performance in his last fight at a lower weight. The matchup pits Crawford's pound-for-pound skill against Canelo's proven strength and experience in the super-middleweight division.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 04:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in Germany have pioneered a mechanical recycling process for electric vehicle battery components that avoids the use of hazardous chemical solvents. The new technique uses mills to grind up production scraps from cathodes made with a PTFE plastic binder, effectively separating valuable materials from their metal backing. This allows the recovered materials to be preserved in their original form for immediate reuse in the manufacturing process. The breakthrough could significantly lower the cost of EV production, reduce environmental impact, and improve worker safety in the battery industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, Nepal has sworn in former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its first female interim prime minister. Her appointment has helped restore calm to the capital, Kathmandu, where curfews have been eased. The new administration has also dissolved parliament and scheduled elections for March 5. The unrest, known as the "GenZ protests," was initially sparked by a social media ban but quickly grew to encompass broader frustrations over the nation's economic struggles and government corruption.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address both declining birth rates and the need to retain scientific talent, Shanghai has launched a new subsidy program for female researchers. The initiative provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to new mothers under 40 with doctoral degrees who are returning to their careers after giving birth. Initially targeting researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the program aims to help women in science overcome career interruptions associated with motherhood.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary article argues that the culture of sexual exploitation surrounding Jeffrey Epstein was a relic of a pre-feminist era where such behavior was normalized. The author recounts how the sexual exploitation of young girls by adult men was prevalent in mainstream and counterculture throughout the 1970s and 80s, citing examples from film and music. The article credits the feminist movement with fundamentally shifting societal norms by establishing the principles of consent and exposing the power dynamics that enable abuse. It frames the revelations about Epstein as a late example of a once-pervasive societal problem.</p>
