          <p>China is rapidly integrating robotics into its society and economy, installing nearly 300,000 new robots last year, surpassing the rest of the world combined. This aggressive push is viewed as a strategic path to achieve independence in core artificial intelligence technologies, beyond mere industrial efficiency. The article highlights China's distinct public-private collaboration model and long-term policy framework, promoting robotics adoption across diverse sectors from manufacturing to agriculture. This concerted effort is creating massive domestic demand for advanced AI capabilities, fostering a built-in market for China's own AI chips and infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is exploring a proposal to raise the minimum wage for workers on residential construction projects to over $32 an hour, plus an additional healthcare credit. This initiative aims to attract workers to an industry facing labor shortages, exacerbated by fears of immigration raids, and to address the city's need to rebuild units. Backed by construction unions and housing groups, proponents argue that increased wages and benefits are essential to protect often non-union, foreign-born workers vulnerable to exploitation. The article highlights efforts to stabilize the labor force and support housing development in the city.</p>

          <p>Nike posted a surprise 1% sales growth in its fiscal first quarter, exceeding expectations, yet its profits fell 31% with a drop in gross margin. This indicates that while the company is making progress in areas like wholesale, running, and North America, its efforts to clear old inventory through discounting are still impacting profitability. CEO Elliott Hill acknowledged that the turnaround "will not be linear" and that some business segments continue to struggle, including Nike Direct sales and revenue in China.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts delivered a scathing ruling, finding that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio unconstitutionally targeted pro-Palestinian international students for deportation. The judge criticized the Trump administration's actions as a "scandalous and unconstitutional suppression of free speech," aimed at chilling lawful expression. He condemned the use of masked agents to detain students and rejected the government's justifications, calling their testimony "disingenuous." This landmark decision underscores the judiciary's role in protecting First Amendment rights against executive overreach, despite the judge's closing remarks on President Trump's broader impact on free speech.</p>

          <h2>California Enacts Landmark Law Requiring Transparency from Frontier AI Developers</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed SB 53 into law, requiring developers of powerful "frontier" AI models to publish transparency reports and safety frameworks. The law, focusing on "catastrophic risks" like AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks, mandates reporting critical safety incidents and establishes whistleblower protections. While a single state law may not prevent all disasters, it aims to regulate fast-moving AI technology before it outpaces oversight, setting a potential precedent for federal legislation. The article notes the ongoing debate between "longtermists" and "neartermists" regarding AI risks, but emphasizes the law's proactive approach to safety.</p>
