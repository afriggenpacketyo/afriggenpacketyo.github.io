          <p>Australia achieved a historic victory against world champions South Africa, overcoming a 22-point deficit to win their Rugby Championship opener 38-22 in Johannesburg. The Wallabies appeared headed for a major defeat after the Springboks scored three tries in the first 20 minutes. However, Australia rallied impressively, dominating the breakdown and scoring six unanswered tries to secure their first win at Ellis Park since 1963. Captain Harry Wilson was a key player, scoring two tries in a performance that led his team to one of its greatest comeback wins in Test match history.</p>

Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and that the UK's support for Ukraine remains unwavering. He also welcomed the U.S. and European willingness to provide robust security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a potential future peace deal.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is making a significant comeback to the UK High Street, with plans to open new standalone stores for the first time since its collapse in 2020. The relaunch was marked by the brand's first catwalk show in seven years, held in London's Trafalgar Square. Once a dominant force in youth fashion, Topshop lost its appeal before its parent company, Arcadia, went into administration. Now owned by online retailer Asos, the brand aims to leverage nostalgia while attracting a new generation of shoppers, facing a competitive market with challenges from fast-fashion giants and a changed economic climate.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both achieved multiple record closes this week, driven by investor optimism following a favorable inflation report. The July consumer price index showed inflation cooling more than anticipated, increasing speculation that the Federal Reserve will implement an interest rate cut at its September meeting. Although a subsequent report indicated a rise in wholesale inflation, market expectations for a rate cut remained strong. This positive sentiment fueled a rally in several major stocks, including tech and financial giants, pushing the major benchmarks to new all-time highs during the week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are planning to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park, along with their three children. The family has been residing at Adelaide Cottage since 2022, but have decided on a move for a "fresh start" following a challenging period that included the princess's cancer diagnosis. Sources indicate the couple views this as a long-term, "forever home" where they will live even after becoming King and Queen. The move is being funded privately, and they will pay market rent on the property, continuing their preference for no live-in staff to maintain family privacy.</p>

          <p>A Phoenix-based startup is repurposing old shipping containers to create innovative and rapidly deployable shelters for the city's unhoused population. Architect Brian Stark designed the "X-WING" shelters, where four containers are joined in an 'X' shape to create 20 individual, air-conditioned rooms. The sustainable design utilizes existing materials and can be constructed in just one week, offering a cost-effective solution to the growing housing crisis. Stark's next project is a 105-unit apartment complex made from containers, aimed at providing affordable housing for low-income senior citizens, furthering his mission to use architecture to address social challenges.</p>

This approach has made Epic a leader, used in over 40% of U.S. hospitals, while also drawing criticism for its closed system. Faulkner, described as a mix of Bill Gates and Willy Wonka, has established a detailed succession plan to ensure the company remains privately held and true to her original vision long after she steps down.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by a California Highway Patrol helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area near Sequoia National Park. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. A search was launched after he failed to return to his car, and a dive team eventually located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety and treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>
