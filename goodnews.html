Four Democrats are vying for the position: Representatives Stephen Lynch, Kweisi Mfume, Robert Garcia, and Jasmine Crockett. The selection process reflects underlying tensions within the party regarding a potential generational shift in leadership roles.</p>

Prime Minister Starmer emphasized the need to navigate an era of radical uncertainty with agility and a clear sense of national interest. Critics, however, have raised concerns about the lack of immediate funding to address current geopolitical threats, arguing for a more urgent increase in defense spending.</p>

          <p>Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are introducing a framework for a major bill to regulate digital assets, aiming to define when crypto is a commodity or a security. The proposed bill would allow crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) regulation of digital currencies. The legislation also includes measures to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion. The Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee on digital assets will hold a hearing on the bill.
