          <p>As protests unfold in Los Angeles, U.S. officials have clarified the rules of force for the deployed National Guard and Marines, emphasizing their role in protecting federal buildings and personnel without directly engaging with protesters unless necessary for self-defense. Troops are carrying weapons but will not have ammunition loaded, and they are instructed to de-escalate situations. The Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell expressed concerns about the logistical challenges and stressed the need for clear communication between agencies. Retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Thomas Edmonds questioned the distinction between protecting federal officers and enforcing the law, seeking clarification on the use of deadly force. The presence of the military aims to ensure continuous coverage of the area. Optimism is present in the safety and security of federal property and personnel.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to address rising rice prices, according to Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi. This move aims to stabilize the cost of Japan's staple food by directly contracting with retailers, particularly smaller supermarket operators. The country's rice reserves will be reduced to 100,000 tons after this release, following previous auctions in March and April. Rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, prompting the government to take action to lower overall prices for consumers. The release consists of rice from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kg. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed £14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear plant project on the Suffolk coastline, aiming to boost economic growth and transition to clean energy. The project is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized the investment as crucial for energy independence and tackling climate change, although the plant will take at least a decade to complete. Critics, like Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C, argue the funds could be better spent and fear increased consumer bills, citing budget disputes and delays with similar projects. The investment reflects the government's broader strategy to eliminate fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros Discovery, the owner of CNN and HBO Max, plans to split into two separate companies by mid-next year. The company will separate its studio and streaming business from its traditional cable television networks, reflecting the shift in media consumption. The Streaming & Studios business, including HBO Max and the film division, will be led by Mr. Zaslav, while the Global Networks company, encompassing CNN, Discovery, and TNT Sports, will be led by Gunnar Wiedenfels. The move aims to provide each division with sharper focus and strategic flexibility to compete effectively in the evolving media landscape. The splitting of the media conglomerate follows the 2022 merger that created Warner Bros Discovery.</p>

          <p>China's next-generation stealth fighter jets, the Chengdu J-36 and the Shenyang J-50, have garnered attention since their emergence in December of last year. The J-36, nicknamed “Gingko leaf,” features a distinctive diamond shape with a delta wing platform designed to reduce air drag at high speeds, and is tailless for radar evasion. Unique aerodynamic features include trailing edge control surfaces per wing and split flaps close to the wingtips, enhancing maneuverability. Increasing sightings and images have provided more detail about these advanced aircraft, although official information remains limited. The development of these jets underscores China's ongoing efforts to modernize its air force.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has described the UK's statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world," citing fundamental flaws and outdated gender stereotypes. The Women and Equalities Committee report recommends increasing paternity pay and leave to promote equality, requiring significant investment. Statutory paternity leave, introduced in 2003, allows new fathers to take up to two weeks off work, but the report argues this is insufficient. The report also criticizes shared parental leave as overly complex and underutilized. The government has stated it is reviewing current parental leave entitlements to better support working families.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate routine tasks such as marking and writing letters home to parents. The guidance emphasizes transparency and the need for teachers to check AI-generated results.

The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) acknowledges the potential for AI to free up time for face-to-face teaching but notes unresolved issues.
