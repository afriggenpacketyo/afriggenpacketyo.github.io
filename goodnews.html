          <p>Actor Steve Buscemi has revealed that most people, including himself for many years, have been mispronouncing his last name. During a recent interview, he explained that while the traditional Italian way is 'Boo-shemi,' he grew up saying 'Bue-semi' and has now settled on 'Boo-Semi' as a compromise. The discussion arose from a running joke in his cameo on the series "The Studio," where characters debated the correct pronunciation. This follows a similar revelation from actor Denzel Washington, who also recently shared that his name has been commonly mispronounced throughout his career.</p>

          <p>Scotland's momentum in the Women's Rugby World Cup was halted by a defeat against world number two, Canada, in a competitive match in Exeter. Despite an early try from Rhona Lloyd and a second-half score by Evie Gallagher, the Scots were overpowered by a dominant Canadian side. The loss means Scotland will now likely face host nation England, the winner of Pool A, in the quarter-finals. Canada's victory secures them the top spot in Pool B, setting them up for a more favorable last-eight matchup against the loser of the England vs. Australia game.</p>

          <p>Thousands of viewers tuned in to a live-streamed event showcasing a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) exploring the bottom of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the United States. The dive, sponsored by environmental non-profits, aimed to raise awareness about the lake's unique ecosystem and the challenges it faces from pollution and tourism. Experts provided commentary on the lake's ancient geological history, explaining its ecological importance as the ROV traversed the lakebed over 1,500 feet below the surface. The event highlighted ongoing efforts to preserve the lake's famed clarity and debunked popular myths about mob bodies, though no sign of the mythical creature 'Tessie' was found.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, an activist investment firm, has taken a significant stake in PepsiCo and is pushing for substantial changes to improve the company's performance. In a detailed presentation to the board, Elliott outlined a plan that includes refranchising the bottling network for the PepsiCo Beverages North America segment to improve margins. The firm also recommends divesting underperforming brands like Quaker, reducing the number of products to streamline operations, and reinvesting capital into core brands such as Frito-Lay and Gatorade. Elliott argues these strategic shifts could unlock at least 50% upside for shareholders by addressing years of stock underperformance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Coach Who Has Owned Four Homes Explains Her Current Preference for Renting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial coach Bernadette Joy, a self-made millionaire who previously owned four properties, explains why she and her husband sold their homes to become renters. She argues that renting has made her wealthier by allowing her to invest the proceeds and focus on her business without the stress and hidden costs of homeownership, such as renovations and unexpected repairs.

          <p>A new book showcases the largely unseen jazz photography of Lisette Model, a Viennese Jewish émigré best known for her street photography. In the early 1950s, Model embarked on a project to document jazz musicians and their audiences, but it was abandoned due to FBI suspicion of her leftist politics. The photos capture not just the rapture of the audience but also the wariness and inner life of the musicians, including Duke Ellington and Miles Davis. The article suggests Model, who fled the Nazis, may have felt a shared experience of persecution with her Black subjects, who faced racism and violence in the U.S. despite their international acclaim.</p>

          <p>Following the sudden departure of executive chairman Daniel Levy, Tottenham Hotspur has effectively placed its leadership in the hands of new chief executive Vinai Venkatesham. Having spent 14 years at rival club Arsenal, Venkatesham is known for his role in appointing manager Mikel Arteta and championing the growth of the women's team. Described as an empathetic and understated leader, he is expected to work collaboratively with the football operations staff rather than ruling with an iron fist. His appointment signals a potential shift in Tottenham's boardroom culture, particularly in negotiations and relationships with other clubs, as the club enters the post-Levy era.</p>

          <p>Chinese military researchers have reported a successful test flight of an AI-powered radar system that they claim cannot be jammed by conventional electronic warfare techniques. According to a paper from the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, the AI system dramatically improved target tracking continuity from around 75% to over 99% during tests where traditional radar failed. The technology uses artificial intelligence to adapt to and overcome jamming signals in real-time. This development is described as a potential paradigm shift in radar design, with significant implications for aerial combat and military surveillance capabilities.</p>

          <p>China is designing a mission to test its ability to defend Earth from potential asteroid impacts, according to the chief designer of its lunar exploration program. The plan involves launching an impactor spacecraft to collide with a small asteroid tens of millions of kilometers away, with the goal of altering its orbit by 3 to 5 centimeters. An observer spacecraft would accompany the mission to monitor the kinetic impact and gather data. If successful, China would become only the second country, after the United States, to demonstrate this planetary defense capability, marking a significant step in its deep space exploration ambitions.</p>

          <p>With gold prices reaching new records, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Financial experts generally recommend gaining exposure to gold through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the physical price of bullion, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). This method is considered more liquid, tax-efficient, and low-cost compared to owning physical gold bars or coins, which involve higher transaction and storage costs. Despite the current rally, advisors typically suggest limiting gold to a small portion, under 3%, of a well-diversified investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ten years after its Broadway premiere, the cultural and political legacy of the musical "Hamilton" is being reassessed as a filmed version hits movie theaters for the first time. The article explores how the show, once seen as a symbol of the hopeful, progressive Obama era, feels different in the current political climate. Initially celebrated for its diverse casting and hip-hop storytelling, "Hamilton" later faced criticism for its portrayal of the Founding Fathers and its perceived glossing over of issues like slavery. The show's journey from an elite phenomenon to a cultural touchstone reflects the shifting political and social conversations in America over the past decade.</p>

However, his life also had deeply mystical elements; he limited his gaming to one hour a week and used his computer skills to create a website cataloging Eucharistic miracles. His story appeals to different corners of the faith, representing both a modern, relatable figure and a deeply devout, countercultural believer.</p>
