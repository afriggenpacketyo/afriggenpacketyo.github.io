        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The luxury jewelry market is experiencing continued growth, driven by wealthy shoppers who are increasingly selective and focused on acquiring pieces from top-tier brands. Swiss luxury group Richemont, which owns sought-after brands such as Van Cleef & Arpels and Cartier, is particularly benefiting from this trend. Richemont reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, with its Jewellery Maisons division leading the way with 11% growth, the strongest segment growing 8%. This trend indicates that while broader luxury spending may be slowing, the demand for high-end jewelry remains robust among affluent consumers.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw made his season debut for the Dodgers after recovering from a bone spur, but struggled in the first inning, giving up three runs. Although he settled down, the Angels ultimately won the game 11-9, highlighted by Logan O'Hoppe's five RBIs. Kershaw's return is crucial for the Dodgers, who are missing several starters due to injury, and his presence is expected to boost the team's intensity. Despite his personal struggles, Freddie Freeman had four hits, continuing his strong performance in May, but the Dodgers could not overcome the Angels' offensive surge.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards' guest essay contrasts the revitalized night train network in Europe with the struggling long-distance public transport in the United States. While Europe invests in high-speed rail and promotes environmentally friendly travel, America continues to prioritize cars and unproven transportation projects. The author argues that America's car dependence has led to decreased happiness and mental health among drivers, and that investing in rail networks and subway systems would offer a better alternative. He also criticizes Elon Musk's Hyperloop project for diverting investment from tried-and-tested transit systems, and suggests that America should rediscover the community, connection, and shared purpose that trains offer.</p>

The refugees, primarily women and children, crossed the border into Rwanda after Rwandan-backed rebels seized key parts of the region. The UNHCR aims to repatriate 2,000 people as part of a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR, with over 101,000 refugees already repatriated. The returnees will receive emergency assistance and support for reintegration into Rwandan society, marking the end of a long period of exile for many.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a groundbreaking fibre-optic gyroscope that offers enhanced stability across a wide temperature range, potentially improving navigation for aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. This gyroscope, developed by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, is an interferometric fibre-optic gyroscope, commonly known as IFOG, which measures orientation and turning rates without external signals. This is vital for military and security applications, as it allows for the measurement of vehicles without the need for external signals like satellites, making them immune to interference.</p>

For example, tickets for comedian Jimmy O. Yang's shows in Hong Kong sold out quickly, prompting many to purchase travel bundles.

          <p>Despite strong vocals and a spirited performance by Remember Monday, the UK's Eurovision entry failed to achieve a high placement, taking 19th place. Critics suggest that the song's manic and inconsistent style, a "mish-mash of musical styles," was the primary reason for its failure to connect with a wider audience. The staging, though energetic, lacked the scale and drama of other entries, but the article suggests that the UK shouldn't be too down on the band themselves. Positive comments from other artists such as Conchita Wurst, show how strong the band's overall performance was.</p>
