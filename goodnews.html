          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a breakthrough in the commercial extraction of rubidium directly from salt lake brine, potentially reducing dependence on imports, mostly from Canada. This industrial-scale method produces ultra-pure rubidium chloride from ultra-low concentrations, offering a new domestic source for this strategically vital material. Rubidium is widely used in the electronics, specialty glass, and aerospace sectors, with extensive military, technological, and civilian applications. The Qinghai Institute of Salt Lakes (ISL) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) announced that researchers had produced 99.9 per cent pure rubidium chloride from potassium chloride material containing just 0.001 per cent rubidium.</p>

          <p>The Italian newspaper Il Foglio has been experimenting with AI-written content, including a daily insert consisting of four pages of AI-written articles and headlines. The paper plans to embrace AI-written content permanently, issuing a weekly AI section and occasionally using ChatGPT to write articles for the standard paper. The top editor believes AI should integrate with journalism, not replace human intelligence, emphasizing its potential in research, summarizing, and writing. Other publications have used AI without full transparency, leading to errors and fabrications, highlighting the need for careful oversight.</p>
