          <p>With credit card debt on the rise, it's crucial to know how to handle late payments to minimize damage to your credit score and financial well-being. The article outlines steps to take at 30, 60, and 90 days past due, including making minimum payments, contacting the credit card company, and exploring debt relief options. Acting quickly can help avoid late fees, penalty APRs, and potential collection actions. Consolidating debt through balance transfers or personal loans and aggressively tracking your budget are also recommended strategies for regaining control of your finances.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance defended President Donald Trump's approach to Iran in a lengthy post on X, amid criticism from some conservatives, including Tucker Carlson. Vance emphasized Trump's consistent stance that Iran cannot possess a nuclear weapon and his efforts to reach a deal with Iran to prevent uranium enrichment. He highlighted Iran's violations of non-proliferation obligations and assured that Trump is only interested in using the American military to achieve American goals. Vance's comments come as a divide emerges among Trump's supporters regarding U.S. involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trump Mobile, a new U.S. mobile service, removed its coverage map shortly after launch due to the use of the term "Gulf of Mexico" instead of the Trump-preferred "Gulf of America." This follows President Donald Trump's executive order to rename the international body of water, a change not recognized by other countries. The map appeared to use data from T-Mobile's network, which also labels the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico. The Trump family licensed its name to the mobile service, aiming to capitalize on the president's political influence.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was unlawful. The judge stated that the cuts, which targeted research with perceived connections to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, represented unlawful discrimination. The judge ordered the reinstatement of grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) maintains its stance that the cuts were intended to prioritize scientific rigor over ideological agendas.</p>

She hopes this will provide a more reliable option for people with hearing difficulties, as some assistive devices have proven faulty.

          <p>Spanish investigators released a report attributing a massive blackout in Spain and Portugal to a "voltage surge." The surge, originating in southern Spain, triggered small grid failures and a subsequent "chain reaction" of protective shutdowns. The report indicates that the power system lacked sufficient voltage control capacity due to a programming error. Authorities stated that the widespread blackout could have been prevented with proactive measures to manage excess voltage and found no evidence of a cyberattack.</p>

The company has already replaced artificial dyes in some products, such as Kraft Mac & Cheese, and will continue to invest in natural color alternatives.
