          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have developed a close, trusting relationship centered on defending Ukraine's sovereignty against Russian encroachment. The article describes how their bond goes beyond strategic partnership, characterized by frequent direct communication and mutual respect. Macron views Zelensky as a courageous leader, while Zelensky sees Macron as a reliable advocate for Ukraine's interests. Their connection has strengthened over time, particularly after Macron's visit to Kyiv and his shift towards a more assertive stance against Russia, which has positioned him as a key intermediary between Zelensky and other world leaders, including President Trump.</p>

          <p>Hainan, a duty-free island off China‚Äôs southern coast, aims to capitalize on the intensifying trade war between the United States and China. The article notes that the island is poised to launch its own separate customs regime, allowing it to avoid retaliatory tariffs on American imports. This move is expected to drive tourism and boost sales in Hainan's duty-free stores, which have struggled due to sluggish domestic consumption and the recovery of overseas tourism. The island hopes to attract Chinese shoppers with the promise of cheap iPhones and U.S. cosmetics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump agreed to lift the 25 percent tariffs on steel from Britain, a move welcomed by British steelmakers facing challenges such as weak demand and high energy costs. The article focuses on Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield, a key steel-making facility, where the announcement brought a sense of relief. However, uncertainties remain regarding tariffs on products processed in the European Union before being shipped to the United States. Despite the positive development, concerns persist about the Trump administration's trade policies and their impact on the industry's stability.</p>

          <p>Driven by President Trump's high tariffs, Chinese companies are increasingly shifting manufacturing operations to Vietnam to maintain access to the U.S. market. The article describes how factories in Vietnam are experiencing a surge in demand as Chinese businesses seek to circumvent tariffs, with e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and Shein facilitating the relocation. While Vietnam offers advantages like a shared border and a young workforce, challenges exist regarding trade deals and potential scrutiny from American officials concerned about tariff evasion. Despite the shift, some Chinese companies remain optimistic about resolving trade issues and maintaining their presence in both countries.</p>

          <p>The head of the Royal Navy, Adm Sir Ben Key, has been removed from his duties while under investigation over allegations of misconduct. The Ministry of Defence has not provided further details on the matter, stating that it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time. This action follows reports in the Sun newspaper suggesting that Adm Key was suspected of having an affair with a subordinate. Earlier this week, the MoD issued a statement saying that the First Sea Lord had "stepped back due to private reasons".</p>

          <p>A judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing large-scale cuts and layoffs at numerous government agencies, as part of the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) cost-cutting drive. The article explains that U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled that the administration's reorganization efforts likely exceeded its legal authority. The restraining order prevents agencies from laying off staff or placing workers on administrative leave to comply with the executive order. The lawsuit, filed by federal employee unions, argued that the administration lacked the power to reorganize federal agencies without congressional authorization.</p>

Swift's name emerged in documents alleging that she and Ryan Reynolds pressured Baldoni to accept changes to the script.
