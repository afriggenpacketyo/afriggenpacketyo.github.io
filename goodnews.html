          <p>In a recent interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated she might consider another presidential run, stating, "I am not done." While promoting her new book, Harris reflected on her 2024 loss to Donald Trump and reiterated her warnings about his authoritarian tendencies. She did not formally commit to a 2028 campaign but left the possibility open, saying it was a question she is not currently focused on. Recent polling in her home state of California, however, shows limited voter enthusiasm for another attempt.</p>

          <p>A basketball game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Brooklyn Nets was briefly halted when a fan ran onto the court to take a selfie with Cavaliers star Donovan Mitchell. The incident occurred late in the fourth quarter, prompting Mitchell to back away before security personnel quickly apprehended and removed the individual. After the game, Mitchell confirmed the fan's intention was to get a photo. Teammate Jarrett Allen praised the Barclays Center security for their swift and effective response to the disruption.</p>

          <p>The interstellar object 3I-ATLAS has sparked debate after exhibiting an "anti-tail," a trail of debris appearing to point toward the sun. While most astronomers attribute this to a 3D optical illusion based on our viewing angle, Harvard researcher Avi Loeb has proposed a more controversial theory. He suggests the phenomenon could be a "technosignature" from an alien spacecraft applying "braking thrust" to slow down and remain in our solar system. The object is currently unobservable, and its true trajectory will not be verifiable until it reappears in December.</p>

          <p>The popular investment strategy of passively buying S&P 500 index funds, such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), may be losing favor among some investors seeking better diversification. With the technology sector now accounting for a record 35% of the index, many feel it has become imbalanced and are looking for alternatives. This has led to renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently outperforming the S&P 500 and hitting an all-time high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union is developing a strategy to end its critical dependence on China for rare earth elements, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. These materials are vital for high-tech manufacturing, including smartphones, electric vehicles, and military equipment. In response to recent export curbs from Beijing, the EU's plan focuses on increasing recycling capabilities, securing alternative sources, and forming strategic partnerships with other raw material-producing countries like Australia, Canada, and Chile to ensure supply chain stability.</p>

          <h2>Mark Cuban Advocates for Bulk Buying as a Practical Investment Strategy</h2>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has advised that one of the smartest financial moves for an average person is not picking stocks but buying household essentials in bulk. He argues that saving a significant percentage on consumables like toilet paper and shampoo by purchasing larger quantities can provide a more reliable financial return than many traditional investments. However, Cuban stressed that this strategy is only beneficial if the purchases are made with cash, warning against accumulating credit card debt to achieve these savings.</p>

          <p>A year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is experiencing a remarkable and rapid recovery. Threatened salmon species have been observed in headwaters for the first time in over a century, water temperatures have stabilized, and native wildlife is returning to the ecosystem. The restoration has been celebrated by local Indigenous tribes, whose youth were the first to kayak the entire length of the newly freed river. This success story is now inspiring other Indigenous-led river restoration movements around the world.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached record highs this week, driven by positive economic news and strong corporate performance. A key factor was a lower-than-expected consumer price index report for September, which increased investor optimism that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates again. This sentiment was further bolstered by a stream of better-than-anticipated earnings reports from major companies, which helped the market overlook ongoing political drama related to the government shutdown and international trade talks.
