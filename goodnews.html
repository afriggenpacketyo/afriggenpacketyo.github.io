          <h2>Federal Reserve Holds Interest Rates Steady Amid Trade War Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 06:40:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged, awaiting the full impact of President Trump's trade war on the U.S. economy. Despite calls for a rate reduction, the Fed maintained the benchmark borrowing rate between 4.25% and 4.5%, with policymakers closely monitoring signs of increased pressure on prices or a weakening job market. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell cited the economy's solid shape as a reason for not feeling an urgency to cut rates. This decision comes as the Trump administration continues to navigate trade negotiations with various countries, facing both opportunities and uncertainties in the global economic landscape.</p>

          <p>International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach stated that Japan is welcome to bid for another Summer or Winter Games, provided issues such as corruption from past events are addressed. Sapporo withdrew its bid for the 2030 Winter Games following scandals linked to the 2020 Tokyo Games. Bach emphasized Japan's continued presence in the Olympic movement, citing its role as host of international tournaments and the success of its athletes.

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is predicted to fall back to Earth uncontrolled, with experts estimating reentry around May 10. The spacecraft, intended to land on Venus, failed to leave Earth's orbit due to a malfunction. While most of it fell back within a decade, the landing capsule has been circling the globe for 53 years and could land anywhere between 52 degrees north and south latitude. Experts suggest the risk to humans is low, comparable to a random meteorite fall, but caution that space debris crashing back to Earth could pose a growing problem for aircraft.</p>

The announcement follows previous discussions and negotiations between the U.S. and UK, with the goal of easing pressure on businesses and consumers in both countries.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that new trade deals could be announced this week, as his administration faces pressure to strike agreements before a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs ends on July 9.

The Trump administration has been in negotiations with Canada, Italy, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Experts believe that smaller countries may be motivated to act quickly in these negotiations, while China is not yet involved in active trade talks.</p>
