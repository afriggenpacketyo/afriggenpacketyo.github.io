          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are planning a move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park, seeking a "fresh start" for their family. The couple and their three children have been living in Adelaide Cottage since 2022, a period that has included Catherine's cancer diagnosis and treatment. A royal source indicated the move offers an opportunity to leave behind difficult memories and establish a long-term family home where they plan to live even after becoming King and Queen. The move is being funded privately, and the couple will pay market rent on the property.</p>

          <p>An architecture startup in Phoenix is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and rapidly deployable housing for the city's unhoused population. The "X-WING" shelters, developed with Steel + Spark, consist of four containers joined in an X-shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. This innovative approach addresses the affordable housing crisis by utilizing existing materials, with each unit taking only a week to construct. The project's founder, Brian Stark, is also planning a larger 105-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors, aiming to provide dignity and stability for vulnerable residents.</p>

Eligible individuals could receive up to $7,500 in compensation for documented losses traceable to the incidents, depending on which breach affected them. The settlement still requires final court approval, with a hearing scheduled for December, and customers must submit their claims by November 18, 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson claimed victory over American Olympic champion Noah Lyles in their first 100-meter head-to-head since the Paris Olympics. At the Silesia Diamond League meet, Thompson ran a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record and narrowly beating Lyles, who finished second in 9.90 seconds. The race served as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by just five-thousandths of a second a year ago. Both athletes are now looking ahead to the upcoming world championships in Tokyo, with Lyles expressing confidence despite the second-place finish.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued via helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. After he was reported missing, a search operation was launched, and a drone eventually located him alive and responsive. He was successfully hoisted to safety by a California Highway Patrol helicopter and treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A leading academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences is urging China to implement a top-down strategy to accelerate the development of space-based solar power. This technology involves building orbital facilities that convert solar energy into electricity and transmit it to Earth, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The call to action highlights the need to close the technological gap with the United States in key areas like materials science and precision control. The article notes that China's current research efforts are fragmented across universities and lack the capacity to support such a large-scale, complex project.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized £180,000 that controversial influencer Andrew Tate had placed as a deposit for an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A court heard that the funds were determined to be the proceeds of tax evasion and money laundering, and the forfeiture order was not opposed by Tate or his brother. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million previously forfeited by the brothers in December 2024 for failing to pay taxes on revenue from their online businesses. Police stated the confiscated money will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support programs in the local community.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping to ease the transition to college for students coming from the foster care system by providing them with essential dorm room supplies. Founded after learning that many former foster youth arrive on campus with nothing, the organization hosts an annual event where students can pick out bedding, towels, and other necessities they might not realize they need. The program aims to level the playing field, allowing these students to feel prepared and equal to their peers on their first day. By involving students in choosing their own items, it also helps them create a personal space that reflects their identity.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share of shipments rising from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This resurgence is partly driven by Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold and Z Flip, which offer a new form factor compared to the traditional design of the iPhone. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of products at various price points and its experimentation with new technology are creating renewed competition. Analysts suggest Apple may respond by releasing its own slimmer and foldable iPhone models in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

However, an international law enforcement hack of the EncroChat servers in 2020 exposed his messages, which detailed his criminal enterprise and a plot that led to the shooting of an innocent man.

          <p>A new Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has dropped to 54%, the lowest level recorded since the question was first asked in 1939. The data also shows that those who do drink are consuming less and are increasingly concerned about the health impacts of alcohol, with a majority now believing even moderate drinking is unhealthy. This trend is even more pronounced among underage individuals, where reported drinking has declined significantly since the 1990s. The shift aligns with growing medical consensus that no level of alcohol consumption is entirely safe for one's health.</p>
