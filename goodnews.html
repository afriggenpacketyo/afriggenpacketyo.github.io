          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to build a new missile defense shield called the "Golden Dome," estimating the project would cost $175 billion and be operational within three years. Echoing President Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" program, the Golden Dome aims to intercept missiles, even those launched from space. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized that technological advancements make the program feasible now. The system's design will integrate with existing defense capabilities, with Gen.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily restored Maine lawmaker Laurel Libby's right to vote in the state house after she was censured for posting a controversial social media post about a transgender student athlete. The court's decision did not explain its reasoning, though Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissented. Libby, who has been critical of Maine's policy on transgender athletes, was barred from speaking on the chamber floor. Libby and her constituents filed a lawsuit, arguing that her punishment silenced voters in her district, leading to the Supreme Court's intervention.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered millions of living eggs near an underwater volcano off the west coast of Canada. The eggs, from the Pacific white skate, were found in waters once thought too cold to support life. The Pacific white skate is a "bone-white, bug-eyed relative of sharks that can live almost two miles underwater." The skates lay their eggs on the vents to help with incubation.
