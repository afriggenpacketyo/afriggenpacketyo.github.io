          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 07:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's State Council, led by Premier Li Qiang, has announced new measures to strengthen support for private investment and boost economic confidence. The cabinet emphasized that private investment is crucial for stabilizing employment and the broader economy. The government plans to expand market access for private enterprises and remove existing bottlenecks to ensure they can invest with confidence and profitability. Key areas of focus will include new infrastructure, emerging services, and what the state terms "new quality productive forces." The plan also involves increasing financial support through central budget allocations and reserving a portion of government procurement for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Questions the Cyclical Nature of Fashion Trends and the Return of Skinny Jeans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 07:00:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece critiques the cyclical nature of fashion, using the potential resurgence of skinny jeans as a prime example of the industry's manufactured trends. The author argues that fashion media often encourages consumers to discard and later repurchase items, fueling a cycle of consumption that benefits large corporations and contributes to global pollution. He expresses frustration with the constant redefinition of what is considered stylish, particularly with denim, and advocates for developing a personal style independent of fleeting trends. The article suggests that true self-expression in clothing should not require conforming to looks that may be uncomfortable or unflattering, nor should it be driven by a desire to emulate youth.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence startup OpenAI is driving significant financial gains across the tech industry through its massive spending on cloud computing and infrastructure, with Oracle being the latest major beneficiary. Oracle's stock surged after revealing huge contracts, a significant portion of which is tied to OpenAI's plan to spend $300 billion on computing power over five years. This pattern of investment has also boosted companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom, adding trillions to their market caps since ChatGPT's launch. While OpenAI's spending is powering a tech rally, some analysts express concern over the market's heavy reliance on a single, cash-burning startup for such substantial growth.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Google Flights and other travel experts, the single most effective strategy for finding affordable airfare is to be flexible with travel dates. Flying mid-week, specifically on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Wednesdays, can be significantly cheaper than weekend travel, with Google data showing tickets are about 13% less expensive. Shifting travel plans by even a day or two can result in substantial savings. While many believe the day of the week a ticket is purchased matters, experts call this a myth, stating the day of travel is far more important. Other cost-saving tips include traveling during a destination's off-season and booking flights with layovers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Accessing the latest COVID-19 vaccine has become more complex as the FDA has limited approval to individuals 65 and older and those with high-risk health conditions. This change from previous universal eligibility means many younger, healthy individuals may be turned away from pharmacies. However, people with a wide range of risk factors, including common conditions like asthma, diabetes, or mental health issues, can often "self-attest" to their eligibility without needing a doctor's prescription. The article provides guidance on identifying risk factors, navigating pharmacy requirements, and understanding potential insurance coverage issues pending formal CDC recommendations.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled for an unprecedented second state visit to the UK from September 16-18, hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. The visit is unusual as U.S. presidents typically do not receive a state visit during a second term. The itinerary includes a formal welcome with a royal salute, a visit to St George's Chapel to lay a wreath on Queen Elizabeth II's tomb, and a state banquet. Trump will also meet with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers to discuss a UK-US trade deal. Protests are anticipated, with the Stop Trump coalition planning a demonstration in London, citing concerns over the president's policies.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, titled "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau," examines the complex cultural legacy of the prefabricated concrete slab apartment blocks that defined much of East Germany. Initially promoted by the socialist state as a modern solution to housing shortages and a symbol of utopian community living, these buildings became associated with dystopia and social decay after German reunification. The exhibition explores this transformation through art, reflecting on the Plattenbau as a shared living space, a site of collective memory, and the backdrop for the painful societal changes of the post-reunification era. This renewed focus aims to foster a deeper understanding of these often-neglected neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>The new book "Chinese Encounters with America" profiles twelve influential Chinese individuals whose experiences in the U.S. helped shape China's future and fostered a period of cooperation between the two nations. The book highlights figures like scientist Xie Xide and diplomat Ji Chaozhu, reminding readers of a time when engagement was viewed with optimism, a stark contrast to the current climate of intense competition and distrust. The co-editors argue that these stories demonstrate the value of finding common ground and express concern that both countries are losing sight of the shared interests and mutual benefits that once defined their relationship. They aim to show the positive outcomes of cooperation despite political differences.</p>

          <p>A growing number of smaller colleges, such as Roanoke College in Virginia, are adding or reviving football programs as a strategy to increase overall student enrollment, particularly among men. With a nationwide decline in male college attendance, administrators hope that the sport, along with associated activities like marching bands, will attract more male applicants and enhance campus spirit. Roanoke's incoming freshman class is over 55% male after reintroducing football. However, research suggests that while adding football can cause an initial one-year spike in male enrollment, these gains often do not persist long-term, as the strategy tends to recruit from different student pools rather than expanding the overall applicant base.</p>

          <p>Child development and education experts are urging parents to proactively discuss the use of generative artificial intelligence with their children, as many teens use tools like ChatGPT with little guidance. They recommend starting conversations early, exploring the technology together to understand its capabilities and limitations, and establishing clear household rules for its ethical use. While AI can be a helpful learning aid, experts also warn of significant risks, noting that chatbots can provide unsafe responses to queries about mental health crises or self-harm. The goal is to teach children to use AI as a tool for learning and brainstorming, rather than as a substitute for critical thinking or human connection.</p>

          <p>Local elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, are being viewed as a significant political test for Chancellor Friedrich Merz's ruling coalition. The vote for municipal councils, mayors, and other local seats will gauge public sentiment towards the coalition, which includes the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democrats (SPD). The results will also be a major test for the state's premier, Hendrik Wüst, who governs in a coalition with the Green Party and is considered a potential successor to Merz. Opinion polls suggest potential gains for the far-right AfD party in some industrial areas, adding another layer of pressure on the mainstream parties.</p>

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta violated the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court found that the company removed her account "without a clear and transparent justification" and applied its policies on nudity inconsistently, as other similar accounts remained active. Meta had argued that Gómez violated its rules. The ruling orders Meta to review its policies to provide clearer mechanisms for users to challenge moderation decisions and to more precisely define its rules on sexual content, affirming that social media posts are constitutionally protected speech in Colombia.</p>

          <p>Boxing experts are divided ahead of the highly anticipated match between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford, with compelling arguments for both fighters. Crawford's supporters point to his superior technical skill, adaptability, and reach advantage, suggesting he can outbox the aging Álvarez, similar to how Floyd Mayweather Jr. did. Conversely, those favoring Álvarez emphasize his significant size and power advantage, as he is a natural super-middleweight while Crawford is moving up two weight classes. They argue that while Crawford is a masterful boxer, Canelo's strength and ability to control the ring will ultimately be too much for the smaller fighter to overcome.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly, youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, Nepal has appointed its first female prime minister, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki. The "GenZ" protests, which escalated after the government banned social media, led President Ram Chandra Poudel to dissolve parliament and call for new elections in March. Karki, known for her strong anti-graft stance, was installed as interim leader after negotiations involving the army, the president, and protest representatives. With her appointment, a curfew in the capital of Kathmandu has been eased and a sense of calm has returned to the streets.</p>
