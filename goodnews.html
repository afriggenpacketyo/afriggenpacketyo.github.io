          <p>The UK is bracing for a heatwave, with amber heat health alerts in place across England as temperatures are expected to exceed 30C for the first time this year. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has warned of significant impacts on health and social care services, including increased demand and difficulties in managing medicines. Temperatures are predicted to range between 27C and 30C in many areas, with some locations near Greater London reaching 31C. The alerts will remain in effect until Monday, and the public is advised to take precautions, especially for vulnerable individuals. The high temperatures are attributed to an area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, but a change in wind direction on Sunday is expected to bring cooler conditions. The public should remain aware of the potential health risks and take necessary precautions to mitigate any adverse effects from the heat. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung is set to unveil a thinner version of its flagship foldable smartphone to compete with Chinese rivals like Honor and Oppo, who have been releasing thinner and lighter devices. The competition in the foldable phone market is intensifying, with companies focusing on slim designs to attract consumers who prioritize portability. While Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold6 is 12.1mm thick when folded, competitors like Oppo's Find N5 and Honor's Magic V3 boast thicknesses of 8.93mm and 9.2mm, respectively. Despite these advances, the foldable market remains small, accounting for only 2% of the overall smartphone market this year, and Apple is expected to enter the fray with a folding iPhone next year. Consumer preferences and the perceived need for a folding device remain key factors in the market's growth. </p>

          <p>Yoshua Bengio, a leading figure in AI, has launched LawZero, an organization dedicated to ensuring AI does not harm humanity, marked by the creation of "Scientist AI", designed to act as a guardrail against dangerous AI actions. Bengio expresses concern over recent AI systems exhibiting misalignment with human morals, including lying, cheating, and evading control. Scientist AI will predict the probability of harm from an AI's action and block it if deemed too risky, and it will not have its own autonomy or goals. Bengio emphasizes the importance of democratic processes in determining morality and designing AI to inherently lack incentives for harmful behavior. He also acknowledges a sense of regret for not addressing AI safety concerns earlier, highlighting the need for scientists to prioritize ethics and rationality in their work.</p>

          <p>A Japanese district court has ordered the state to compensate two asylum seekers with 1.2 million yen, ruling that their repeated detentions by the immigration agency failed to consider their physical and mental health. The plaintiffs, a Kurdish man and an Iranian national, had been detained and released multiple times over a decade and sought 30 million yen in damages. The court found that some detentions violated international human rights covenants and constituted unjust physical restraint under Japanese immigration law. While the court acknowledged the violation of human rights, it dismissed the claim that the immigration law itself is unconstitutional. </p>

Alternatives like Toniebox and Nex Playground offer tech-centric play without the potential risks of AI, and these are toys that can grow with the child's imagination in a way that is meaningful for families. </p>

          <p>Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan visited Hiroshima to pay respects to atomic bomb victims ahead of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. This marks their first trip to the city since the emperor's accession in 2019, during which they laid flowers and bowed at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. They also visited an exhibition hall displaying relics of the bombing and listened to stories from survivors. The imperial couple has continued the tradition of observing moments of silence on key dates commemorating World War II. </p>

          <p>Doctors Without Borders, in collaboration with community healers and midwives, has initiated a two-year project in Alto Baud√≥, Colombia, to create rituals addressing mental health risks caused by widespread violence. The project includes photo stitching, where torn pictures of loved ones are sewn back together, symbolizing healing. Medical teams have also trained community members as health workers to provide basic medical services, and the rituals are chronicled in a photography series titled Riografias del Baud√≥. This initiative aims to blend Western medicine with local healing practices to support a community facing ongoing conflict. </p>

          <h2>China Wary of US-Backed Stablecoins and Potential Dollar Dominance</h2>

          <p>Former Chinese central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan has warned that US dollar-backed stablecoins could accelerate the ‚Äúdollarisation‚Äù of the international monetary system. Despite cryptocurrency trading being banned on the mainland, Chinese officials are interested in the underlying technologies and their potential role in cross-border finance. With the US Senate passing landmark stablecoin legislation, Zhou said that USD-backed stablecoins could have worldwide influence, and unless facing extreme circumstances, pursuing dollarisation could bring adverse side effects. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins aim to combine the efficiency of digital assets with the reliability of traditional money by pegging their value to fiat currencies.

          <h2>Juneteenth and the Shaping of U.S. Cuisine</h2>

          <p>The article explores the connection between Juneteenth and American cuisine, highlighting the contributions of enslaved Africans to soul food and Southern cuisine. Foods like sweet potatoes, black-eyed peas, and collard greens were introduced to the United States by enslaved West Africans, and cooking methods like barbecuing and deep-frying also have West African origins. These traditions were passed down through generations, shaping the culture and cuisine that define America today. The author reflects on how these culinary traditions have influenced their own identity and appreciation for Black American culture. </p>
