          <p>A recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that certain humanities majors, such as nutrition, art history, and philosophy, are outperforming STEM fields in terms of employment prospects. While computer science and engineering graduates face higher unemployment rates, liberal arts graduates are finding opportunities due to the increasing demand for creative thinking and soft skills, especially with the rise of artificial intelligence. BlackRock's COO noted the firm is adjusting its hiring strategy to include more history and English majors. The healthcare sector also shows high demand, with nursing majors experiencing low unemployment rates.</p>

While the specialist watchmakers segment experienced declines in Asia-Pacific, overall sales rose annually across all regions, except Asia Pacific (ex. Japan). Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert noted ongoing global uncertainties would require strong agility and discipline. Despite potential headwinds from gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations, analysts believe Richemont's pricing power could provide a tailwind.</p>

          <p>A $50,000 annuity can supplement retirement income, providing guaranteed monthly payouts that offer peace of mind and protection against longevity risk. The amount paid per month varies based on age, gender, and annuity contract. Purchasing an annuity at age 60 could yield approximately $285 to $294 per month, while waiting until age 75 could increase the monthly income to around $395 to $425. Although annuities lack flexibility and may not be suitable for all retirees, they can provide consistent income, making them a valuable addition to a retirement strategy. (not investment advice)</p>
