          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 01:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Writer and director Lena Dunham has released a new Netflix series, "Too Much," which draws inspiration from her own experiences moving to London as an American. The show, starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, follows a New York workaholic navigating life and love in the UK, contrasting romanticized fantasies with the city's reality. Dunham explains that the series explores the cultural and social challenges of adapting to a new country, even one that shares the same language. The 10-episode romcom is notable for its extensive list of celebrity cameos, including Andrew Scott, Stephen Fry, and Jennifer Saunders, who Dunham credits as a major comedic influence.</p>

          <p>China has announced the completion of a significant 1,856-kilometer green belt in Inner Mongolia, effectively enclosing the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. This project is part of the country's larger "green great wall" initiative aimed at combating desertification and controlling sandstorms. Engineers utilized a method of creating straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, which are then followed by the planting of drought-resistant vegetation like the sacsaoul tree. This ecological barrier is designed to prevent further desert expansion and protect surrounding areas from the environmental impact of these vast deserts, which cover nearly 95,000 square kilometers.</p>

          <p>AI server manufacturer Super Micro is set to increase its investment in Europe, including a significant expansion of its manufacturing capabilities in the region. CEO Charles Liang stated that the decision is driven by rapidly growing global demand for the company's servers, which are crucial for developing and running large-scale artificial intelligence models. The company, which already has facilities in the Netherlands, is looking to capitalize on the AI boom that has also boosted its key partner, Nvidia. Despite recent stock volatility, Liang expressed confidence in the company's strong growth trajectory, citing fundamental technology development and an expanding business scope.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' rookie phenom Jacob Misiorowski delivered a stunning performance, striking out 12 Los Angeles Dodgers batters over six innings to lead his team to a 3-1 victory. Despite giving up a leadoff home run to Shohei Ohtani, the 23-year-old right-hander quickly settled in, overwhelming the Dodgers with a fastball that frequently topped 100 mph. Misiorowski's 12 strikeouts all occurred within the first five innings, tying an MLB record for that span since 2008. The dominant outing handed the Dodgers their fifth consecutive loss, with players and coaches acknowledging the rookie's exceptional talent and command on the mound.</p>

          <p>John Fogerty, six weeks after his 80th birthday, performed an energetic and memorable concert at the Hollywood Bowl as part of his "Celebration Tour." The show heavily featured classics from his time with Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), whose song rights he fully regained two years ago after a long legal battle. Despite his age, Fogerty's vocal performance remained remarkably powerful and consistent, and he played lead guitar with vigor throughout the two-hour set. He performed iconic hits like "Bad Moon Rising," "Born on the Bayou," and "Fortunate Son," demonstrating the timeless appeal and enduring energy of his music for the large crowd.</p>

          <p>In a show of unity, Brazil and India have pledged to triple their trade flows, reinforcing their commitment to the BRICS economic bloc. This announcement comes as former U.S. President Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on the group, claiming it was designed to harm the U.S. economy and threatening a 10% tariff on member nations. Trump described the U.S. dollar as "king" and accused BRICS of trying to "degenerate" its value. The move by Brazil and India signals a strengthening of ties among emerging economies in the Global South, presenting a united front against potential U.S. protectionist policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to fill a void in global public goods as the United States scales back its international development efforts. The piece contrasts the dismantling of USAID as an independent agency under the "America first" policy with China's proactive initiatives, such as the new International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) launched in Hong Kong. As the global center of gravity shifts eastward, the author suggests that Hong Kong can leverage its status as a cosmopolitan city to become a new hub for international cooperation and development. This presents an opportunity for the city to gain prominence by championing global public interests.</p>

          <p>Mandonna “Donna” Kashanian, a 64-year-old Iranian mother who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years, has been released from ICE detention following an intervention from Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Kashanian was detained last month despite having no criminal record and regularly checking in with immigration authorities as required. Her case garnered significant community support and letters to the Trump administration, leading Scalise to request a review. Her attorney noted that while her release is a positive outcome, many others in similar situations lack the political access to achieve it.</p>

          <p>As forecasters predict an above-average hurricane season, homeowners in vulnerable coastal areas are increasingly turning to climate-resilient construction to protect their properties. Designs like the round, aerodynamic homes built by Deltec Homes are engineered to withstand extreme weather, featuring reinforced roofs and foundations that can resist Category 5 winds. These specialized building methods, which can cost about 10% more than traditional construction, are proving their worth by surviving major storms. At research facilities like the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, engineers test and promote storm-ready upgrades to make both new and existing homes safer against nature's forces.</p>
