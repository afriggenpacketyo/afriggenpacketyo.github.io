          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas are set to sign the "first phase" of a Gaza ceasefire deal, aiming to conclude the two-year conflict. This initial agreement involves the release of all remaining hostages, both living and deceased, from Gaza in exchange for an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Additionally, the Israel Defense Forces will withdraw to a "yellow line" within Gaza, as part of a phased de-escalation plan. The Israeli cabinet is expected to ratify the deal on Thursday, with the 72-hour window for hostage release beginning after ratification, signifying a major step towards peace and stability in the region, with gratitude extended to mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convening his cabinet to discuss and is expected to approve a proposed Gaza Strip ceasefire deal on Thursday, following intense negotiations in Egypt. This plan, based on a U.S. proposal, involves the release of all remaining hostages from Gaza in exchange for an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners and a phased withdrawal of IDF troops to a "yellow line" within the territory. The 72-hour window for hostage release is anticipated to begin after the deal's ratification, with 20 living hostages expected to be freed by Sunday or Monday. This significant development, praised by Arab and Muslim nations, aims to halt intense fighting and move towards a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Google is significantly expanding its artificial intelligence offerings by introducing Gemini subscriptions tailored for businesses, empowering corporate workers to develop AI agents for specific work tasks. Gemini Enterprise, targeting large organizations, and Gemini Business, designed for smaller clients, are priced at $30 and $21 per person monthly, respectively. These new offerings enable agents to draw on data from platforms like Box, Microsoft, and Salesforce, and include access to pre-made Google agents for software development, data science, and customer engagement. The initiative aims to help enterprises automate processes without requiring coding, with Google also providing robust security features like Model Armor to inspect and block AI chat requests and responses.</p>

          <p>Israelis are expressing widespread delight and relief following President Trump's announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal expected to lead to the release of hostages. The Hostages Families Forum conveyed "profound gratitude," and jubilant scenes unfolded in Tel Aviv's Hostages' Square with dancing and fireworks. The deal, pending Israeli cabinet approval, promises the return of 20 living and 28 deceased hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Families shared emotional reactions, expressing hope for reunification and the ability to mourn, though some cautioned against full celebration until the very last hostage is safely back home. This moment marks a significant turning point in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Hungarian author László Krasznahorkai has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, recognized "for his compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art." Krasznahorkai, known for his postmodern and often dystopian novels like "Satantango" and "The Melancholy of Resistance," is the second Hungarian author to receive this prestigious honor, following Imre Kertesz in 2002. The Swedish Academy praised him as a "great epic writer" in the Central European tradition, characterized by absurdism and grotesque excess. His works, including the acclaimed "Herscht 07769," frequently portray contemporary social unrest and profound existential themes.</p>

          <p>New research across Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin suggests Democratic candidates face a significant "Democratic penalty," performing eight points worse when identified as Democrats, even with identical economic populist platforms. Voters primarily view the party as out of touch, corrupt, or ineffective, rather than overly "woke," indicating a frustration with lack of delivery. The study indicates that full-throated economic populism, paired with strong anti-corporate rhetoric, can significantly boost appeal, especially on issues like capping prescription drug prices and raising taxes on the super-wealthy. To regain working-class support, Democrats are advised to speak against their own party establishment and champion policies that directly benefit working families.</p>

          <p>Details are emerging regarding the phased withdrawal of Israeli troops as part of the proposed Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal, with a White House map outlining specific lines. The initial phase involves Israeli forces pulling back from certain areas, while Rafah, the Philadelphi Corridor, Khuza’a, and Beit Hanoun are expected to remain under Israeli control, and Gaza City encircled. Subsequent phases would see further withdrawals from parts of Khan Yunis, Rafah, and Beit Lahia. The final stage proposes a "security buffer zone" around Gaza, raising concerns among supporters of the Palestinian cause about a prolonged Israeli presence, as negotiations continue on these critical aspects of the agreement.</p>

          <p>All victims of the UK Post Office Horizon IT scandal seeking compensation are now entitled to free legal advice, a government announcement aims to significantly improve the existing compensation schemes. This crucial change, made in response to recommendations from a public inquiry, could substantially impact payout sizes for the more than 900 sub-postmasters wrongly prosecuted due to faulty software, and hundreds more who covered shortfalls. The government has accepted nearly all inquiry recommendations, including extending the Horizon Shortfall Scheme (HSS) closure date and establishing a new appeals process for those who previously accepted low fixed payouts without legal counsel. Over £1.2 billion has been paid out to more than 9,000 claimants so far.</p>

          <p>Terri Lesley, a former Wyoming library director, has won a $700,000 settlement after being fired amidst controversy over books with LGBTQ+ themes and sexual content. Lesley, who served for 27 years, sued Campbell County officials, alleging her First Amendment rights were violated and she faced a hostile work environment for refusing to remove challenged books and for welcoming LGBTQ+ individuals. The county denied the claims, attributing her dismissal solely to performance issues. Lesley expressed vindication, stating she would "never regret standing up for the First Amendment," and hopes the settlement sends a clear message to other library districts and government officials about upholding constitutional obligations and fighting discrimination.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announced Gaza peace deal marks a significant turning point in the conflict, bringing collective relief and hope for hostage returns and a ceasefire. While celebrating the human aspect of the agreement, including the expected release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, the article emphasizes that this is a ceasefire, not a comprehensive peace deal. Major challenges persist, such as Hamas potentially giving up arms, Israel's full withdrawal from Gaza, and the "political horizon" for a Palestinian state, which Israel's government still firmly rejects. The deal's acceleration is attributed to Trump's focused pressure, including his engagement with Arab leaders and hostage families, and the critical role of mediators like Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey.</p>

          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals a surprising trend: the share of US Republicans who consume alcohol has plunged a significant 19 points to 46% in just two years, a much sharper decline than observed among Democrats or independents. This dramatic shift has prompted various theories, linking it to figures like teetotaler Donald Trump, the rising tide of Christian nationalism, or a "Make America healthy again" movement emphasizing wellness and discipline. Prominent conservatives like Tucker Carlson and the late Charlie Kirk have also advocated sobriety for health and performance reasons. While the broader US drinking decline may be tied to pandemic-era inflation, the pronounced Republican shift remains a notable and statistically significant anomaly.</p>
