          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced that the EU will fast-track its review of the planned 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine cars. The decision comes in response to pressure from European automakers, who cite challenges such as high costs, dependency on Asia for batteries, and competition from Chinese electric vehicles. Carmakers are calling for a relaxation of the rules to allow for other low-emission technologies like hybrids beyond the 2035 deadline. While the industry argues the current target is unfeasible, environmental groups are urging the Commission to remain firm on the phase-out plan.</p>

          <p>China's government has set an ambitious target to increase its new energy storage capacity to 180 gigawatts by 2027, nearly doubling its current level. The plan, announced by the country's top economic and energy regulators, aims to support the rapid expansion of its renewable power infrastructure, particularly solar and wind. This initiative is expected to drive approximately $35 billion in investment into the sector. The move will likely benefit major battery manufacturers and suppliers like BYD and CATL as Beijing works to ensure grid stability alongside its clean energy growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to begin cutting interest rates, market analysts are focused on the record $7.6 trillion currently held in high-yield money market funds. Some on Wall Street speculate that as rates fall, a significant portion of this "wall of cash" will move into riskier assets like stocks and bonds, potentially fueling a market rally. However, other experts are skeptical, arguing that the vast majority of these funds are held by institutional and corporate investors who are unlikely to shift their strategy. They suggest only a return to near-zero interest rates would prompt a significant outflow. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates trend downwards ahead of an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut, prospective homebuyers are advised to remember several key factors. The article suggests that timing is critical, as lenders often adjust rates in advance of official Fed moves, meaning the best opportunity might be fleeting. It also emphasizes that the lowest rates are reserved for applicants with high credit scores, making credit health paramount. Furthermore, buyers are reminded not to let the pursuit of a perfect rate cause them to lose their ideal home, and to secure a mortgage pre-approval to strengthen their offers.

          <p>Terence Crawford, who is moving up two weight classes, successfully weighed in at the same weight as champion Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez for their super-middleweight title fight in Las Vegas. The undefeated Crawford, who aims to become a three-division undisputed champion, came in just under the 12-stone (75kg) limit, appearing shredded and in excellent physical condition. Alvarez will defend his four major world titles in the highly anticipated showdown. While Alvarez has a natural size and power advantage at the weight, many pundits are tipping the adaptable Crawford to make history.</p>
