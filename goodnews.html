          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has stepped down from her role as a government whip due to her opposition to the government's plans to cut disability benefits, specifically personal independence payments (Pips) and universal credit. Foxcroft expressed understanding of the need to address the increasing welfare bill but argued that these particular cuts were not the right approach. In response, a government spokesman stated that the reforms aim to fix a broken welfare system and ensure that those who can work are supported, while those with severe disabilities are protected. The government extended the transition period for those losing their personal independence payments from four weeks to 13. </p>

          <p>Former Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, who was the lead investigator in the Karen Read case, maintains his innocence against allegations of corruption and framing Read. In a television interview, Proctor dismissed the accusations as ridiculous and stated that no evidence supports the claim that he deliberately tried to frame Read in the death of John O'Keefe. Proctor acknowledged sending inappropriate text messages about Read but argued that they were private and should not define him as a person. Following the verdict, Massachusetts State Police Colonel Geoffrey Noble announced new policies to improve investigative training and accountability within the department. </p>

          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, has maintained its benchmark lending rates following recent monetary easing measures and a trade agreement with the U.S., holding the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%. This decision comes after authorities cut lending rates last month for the first time since October to mitigate the impact of trade tensions. The trade truce between the U.S. and China has alleviated some economic concerns, allowing Beijing to support its currency. Chinese policymakers are increasingly inclined to use interest rate cuts in a more restrained role, exploring alternative avenues to stimulate economic growth. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump can maintain control of the California National Guard in Los Angeles, pending the outcome of California's legal challenge. The court found that the president has broad authority to deploy the military in American cities, though this authority is not "unreviewable." Legal scholars suggest the decision was expected, especially given the 9th Circuit's shift towards a more balanced composition. The ruling returns the issue to U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer, focusing on the limits of presidential power rather than the specifics of the situation in Los Angeles. </p>

Biden also referenced his administration's efforts to rename military bases named after Confederate officers, contrasting it with the current administration's reported push to restore the old names.

Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction in a case filed by 20 states, stating that "large-scale irreparable harm would occur without the preliminary injunction." The ruling challenges the Department of Transportation's imposition of an Immigration Enforcement Condition on grant applications, which required adherence to federal immigration laws and the cessation of anti-American DEI policies. The judge agreed with the states that the conditions lacked a plausible connection to the congressionally approved purposes of transportation funding. </p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly planning to hire Daniel Gross, the CEO of Ilya Sutskever's startup Safe Superintelligence, after an earlier attempt to acquire the company was rejected. Zuckerberg's aggressive AI hiring spree also includes Nat Friedman, former GitHub CEO, with both men joining Meta to work on products under Alexandr Wang. Meta will also reportedly gain a stake in NFDG, a venture capital firm run by Gross and Friedman. This move is part of an escalating AI talent war, with Meta, Google, and OpenAI competing to develop powerful large language models. </p>

          <p>Hunan has become the first province in China to utilize special-purpose bond proceeds to guarantee government payments to enterprises, allocating 20 billion yuan (US$2.78 billion) for this year. This adjustment to the annual fiscal budget marks the first instance of these bonds, typically designated for revenue-generating construction projects, being used to cover government arrears. The funds will be distributed based on eligible outstanding debts from existing investment projects. Experts suggest that the 20-billion-yuan sum may be insufficient to address the full scale of local government debt, as complex chains of obligation obscure the repayment picture for many localities.

          <p>National Guard troops have been deployed to crime-plagued Albuquerque, New Mexico, to assist with security, but unlike previous deployments, these troops are unarmed and not in military uniform. The deployment aims to free up Albuquerque police officers to respond to other calls, particularly in the Central Avenue Corridor, an area known for high levels of violence and drug activity. While city officials hope the Guard's presence will help reduce crime, some civil liberty advocates and law enforcement officials have expressed concerns about the effectiveness of unarmed troops. The Guard members have been training in crisis intervention and de-escalation techniques. </p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick made landfall in Mexico's southern state of Oaxaca as a Category 3 hurricane, later weakening to a tropical storm. The storm brought intense rains, posing a risk of life-threatening flooding and mudslides, particularly in areas with steep terrain. Although there were no immediate reports of deaths, some damage occurred, including flooded streets and damaged boats and buildings. Power outages affected over 123,000 users in Oaxaca, with efforts underway to restore service. </p>
