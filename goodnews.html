          <h2>Musk Reverses Course on SpaceX Dragon Decommissioning After Trump Spat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 08:03:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk initially declared that SpaceX would decommission its Dragon spacecraft following President Trump's threat to cancel government contracts with Musk's businesses. This decision was made in response to Musk's criticism of Trump's tax bill. However, after a user on X advised Musk to reconsider, he quickly reversed his decision, stating that Dragon would not be decommissioned. Dragon is currently the only U.S. spacecraft capable of transporting crew to and from the International Space Station, and NASA has affirmed its commitment to its space objectives. The incident highlights the volatile relationship between Musk and Trump, who were previously close allies. The tone of the article reflects a sense of uncertainty regarding the future of the SpaceX program and the relationship between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>Despite a conciliatory phone call between President Xi Jinping and President Trump signaling a potential thaw in China-US tensions, Chinese manufacturers are exhibiting restrained enthusiasm. Many manufacturers are delaying major decisions due to continual policy shifts and disillusionment with Trump's volatility. They are waiting for clearer, signed agreements before making any long-term commitments. The phone call, the first in two months, covered the trade relationship, rare earth exports, and overseas students, with both leaders extending invitations for visits. The article conveys a cautious optimism tempered by past experiences of policy instability.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's meeting with President Trump in Washington, D.C., was largely overshadowed by the public spat between Trump and Elon Musk. Despite the distraction, the meeting was viewed as a success for Merz, who is relatively new to his chancellorship. Merz's agenda included strengthening U.S.-German relations, addressing tariffs, discussing support for Ukraine, and promoting higher NATO defense spending. He also presented Trump with his grandfather's birth certificate to highlight the historical ties between the U.S. and Germany. The article suggests a sense of relief that Merz navigated the meeting without major conflict.</p>
