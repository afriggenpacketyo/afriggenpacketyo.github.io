          <p>All flights operated by SkyWest Airlines, the largest US regional carrier, were temporarily grounded for 21 minutes nationwide on Friday night, following a request from the airline itself. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a ground stop advisory, which was later lifted. The specific reason for this widespread grounding was not immediately disclosed by either the FAA or SkyWest. This incident caused a brief but notable disruption to air travel, as SkyWest operates a significant number of flights for major partners such as United, Delta, American, and Alaska Airlines. The article notes the swift resolution of the issue after the initial advisory.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans living and working in the US. The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's ruling, finding that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked authority to vacate a prior TPS extension. The court emphasized that Congress designed TPS to be "predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics." The article highlights this as a significant legal victory for immigrant rights, though the fate of some already-expired protections remains unclear.</p>

Currently, fewer than two dozen of hundreds of applicants have been reinstated. The proposed change would grant honorable discharges to those whose departures were solely due to vaccine refusal, excluding those with additional disciplinary infractions. The article highlights frustrations among veterans over the slow process and calls for accountability, following President Trump's executive order to reinstate these service members after rescinding the mandate in 2023.</p>
