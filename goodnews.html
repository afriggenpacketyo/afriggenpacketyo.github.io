          <p>AI data center provider CoreWeave saw its stock increase by over 7% following the announcement of a planned $1.5 billion bond sale. The capital raised from the notes, which are due in 2031, is intended for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. This move follows a successful $2 billion debt offering in May and a recent announcement of a $6 billion AI data center project in Pennsylvania. Despite some investor concerns about its debt levels, the company has seen its share price more than triple since its Nasdaq debut in March. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After more than a decade in exile, Syrian refugees, particularly the nearly 3 million residing in Turkey, are contemplating a return to their homeland following the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime. While a transitional government offers a glimmer of hope, significant obstacles remain, including a devastated economy, ruined infrastructure, and security concerns under the new leadership. The article profiles several Syrian families in Turkey, capturing their mixed emotions of hope, fear, and uncertainty. They weigh the pull of their homeland against the life they've built and the challenges of rebuilding in a country scarred by war.</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's football across Europe, as evidenced by the successful Euro 2025 tournament, nations in Eastern and parts of Southern Europe have struggled to keep pace. The article examines the reasons for this disparity, citing a historical lack of investment and infrastructure for the women's game. It also points to cultural and societal norms that have traditionally viewed football as a "man's game," as well as political and economic shifts post-communism that further marginalized women's sports. While UEFA initiatives are starting to show results, experts believe significant changes in investment and mindset are still needed.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has named George Tidmarsh, a former biotech executive and adjunct professor at Stanford, as the new director of its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). This key appointment comes amid significant changes at the FDA under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Tidmarsh, who has been involved in the development of seven approved drugs, is seen as a potentially stabilizing figure for the pharmaceutical industry. His past criticisms of controversial drug approvals suggest he may adopt a more stringent regulatory approach, particularly concerning the agency's accelerated approval process.</p>

          <p>Prominent Kenyan activist and anti-corruption campaigner Boniface Mwangi has been freed on bond after authorities dropped the most serious allegations of terrorism against him. He was instead charged with lesser offenses, including unlawful possession of teargas canisters and a blank round of ammunition, which his lawyer states he never possessed. Mwangi was arrested in connection with recent anti-government protests that turned violent. His case had drawn significant attention, with supporters fearing he was being targeted for his outspoken criticism of the state, and his release was met with celebration outside the courtroom.</p>

Overall, China exported 3,188 tonnes of these magnets in June, marking a 157.5% increase from the previous month but still representing a 38.2% decrease compared to the same period last year.

          <p>The All England Club's plans to nearly triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis grounds can move forward after a High Court judge dismissed a legal challenge from a local campaign group. The proposal, already approved by the Greater London Authority, includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on the site of a former golf club. The campaign group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued the development was unlawful due to protections on the heritage-listed land. The judge, however, ruled that the planning decision was a "rationally exercised" judgment, a decision the All England Club welcomed.</p>

          <p>From elephants with sensitive ears to light-colored pets, some animals are receiving a human solution for sun protection: sunscreen. While wild animals have evolved natural defenses, those in captivity or domesticated breeds can be vulnerable to sunburn and skin cancer. The article explores this unusual practice, noting that zoos apply sunscreen to pigs, okapis, and other creatures, while veterinarians often recommend it for light-colored dogs, cats, and horses. The challenge lies not only in choosing a safe product but also in convincing the animal to accept the application, often requiring extensive training and positive reinforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With many high-rate certificates of deposit (CDs) from 2023-2024 now maturing, financial experts are cautioning savers against common missteps. One major error is allowing a CD to auto-renew without checking the new, often lower, interest rate. Experts also advise against chasing the highest available rate without considering if the term length aligns with one's financial goals and liquidity needs. Instead of letting funds roll over or moving them to a low-yield standard savings account, savers should use the maturity date as an opportunity to reassess their goals and shop around for better options, including high-yield savings accounts.

This approach aims to offer investors more than just price exposure, which is a current limitation of ether ETFs.

          <p>A new analysis from the JPMorganChase Institute reveals a growing trend of Americans shifting money from standard checking and savings accounts into vehicles that provide investment income, such as brokerage accounts and money market funds. This shift helps explain the resilience of U.S. consumer spending despite low growth in traditional cash balances. When these other accounts are included, total household cash reserves are found to be increasing, approaching historical trends. The study indicates that families across multiple income levels are participating in this trend, using these accounts to better manage their cash in a higher-interest-rate environment.
