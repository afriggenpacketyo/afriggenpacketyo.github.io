          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has responded cautiously to Vladimir Putin's offer of direct talks in Istanbul, signaling a potential shift in the ongoing conflict. While Zelenskyy acknowledged Putin's offer as a "positive sign," he emphasized the need for Russia to commit to a 30-day ceasefire. Donald Trump reacted positively to the news, hinting that the war might be nearing its end. Both Putin and Zelenskyy appear mindful of Trump's perspective, not wanting to be seen as obstacles to potential peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>The South China Morning Post reports that Chinese mathematicians have resolved a long-standing problem in topology known as the Kervaire invariant problem. The breakthrough, achieved through advanced computational methods, provides proof that manifolds of Kervaire invariant one exist in dimension 126. This discovery ends a decades-long mystery in the mathematical community and could have implications for further research in the field. The paper detailing the solution was authored by mathematicians from Fudan University and UCLA.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, performer and filmmaker John Cameron Mitchell reflects on his college speaking tour and the need for today's young people to embrace a punk ethos. Mitchell argues that collective action and empathy are crucial in navigating a potentially post-democratic America. He encourages students to stop canceling each other, explore punk culture, and engage in real-world experiences outside of approved systems. Mitchell emphasizes the importance of community, kindness, and connecting with unexpected allies to create meaningful change.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times challenges the traditional "Hero's Journey" narrative, arguing that motherhood and caregiving can also be seen as epic quests filled with challenges and triumphs. The author contends that caring for another person can be a life-altering experience that provides profound insights about ourselves and the world. By reframing motherhood as a Hero's Journey, we can recognize the value and complexity of intimate relationships and honor the wisdom gained from caregiving, while challenging simplistic binaries often applied to motherhood.</p>
