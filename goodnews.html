        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration and Congress are pushing to revive the depleted American shipbuilding industry to compete with China, the world‚Äôs biggest ship maker, with potential subsidies and penalties. Hanwha Philly Shipyard's CEO, David Kim, asserts the American shipbuilding industry is ready but needs a steady stream of orders and government support. Trump issued an executive order and new rules penalizing Chinese ships and requiring certain vessels to be built in the U.S. However, challenges include limited shipyard capacity, longer production times, and higher costs compared to Asian shipyards, and critics are wary of repeating past failures. The efforts aim to create a strategic commercial fleet of American-made vessels operated by American crews.</p>

Medvedev, visibly frustrated, served for the match in the fifth set but could not hold off Norrie's comeback. This win marks Norrie's first victory against a top-20 player since January 2024, and he will now face Federico Gomez in the next round.</p>
