          <p>A father and son involved in a widely circulated video from a Philadelphia Phillies game have shared their experience after a confrontation over a home run ball. Andrew Feltwell caught the ball and gave it to his son, Lincoln, as a birthday gift, only to be accosted by a woman who claimed he took it from her. Although Feltwell ultimately gave the ball to the woman to de-escalate the situation, both the Phillies and the opposing Miami Marlins provided the young fan with gifts, including a signed bat. The incident sparked a discussion about fan etiquette at sporting events.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has returned to the United Kingdom for a series of engagements, starting with an appearance at the WellChild charity awards in London. Upon his arrival, he visited Windsor to lay a wreath at the chapel where his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, is buried, marking the third anniversary of her death. The prince, who is a patron of the WellChild charity, met with children facing serious health issues during the awards ceremony. His wife, Meghan, and their children remained in California, and there is public speculation about whether he will meet with his father, King Charles.</p>

          <p>A new mural attributed to the street artist Banksy has emerged on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in traditional attire striking a protester on the ground, with blood spattering from their placard. Banksy claimed the piece on Instagram, his usual method of authentication, shortly after it appeared. Court officials have covered the mural and stated it will be removed, citing the building's listed status which requires its original character to be maintained. The Metropolitan Police are investigating the incident as an act of criminal damage.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $3,600 per ounce, as investors seek safe-haven assets amidst growing global uncertainty and signs of a weakening U.S. labor market. This represents a significant climb of over 38% since the beginning of the year. Despite the record price, some financial analysts believe there is still room for growth, with institutions like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan forecasting further increases into 2026. The potential for lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve could also make non-yielding assets like gold more attractive to investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have issued an apology after the medals given to 60,000 participants mistakenly featured an aerial view of the nearby city of Sunderland and the River Wear. The half marathon route runs through Newcastle, Gateshead, and South Shields along the River Tyne. In a lighthearted statement, the Great Run Company said, "Wear [sic] sorry!" and acknowledged that no one on their team had spotted the geographical error on the medals and T-shirts. They humorously framed the mistake as making the items unique keepsakes that celebrate the entire North East region, albeit unintentionally.</p>

          <p>Radio host Howard Stern has confirmed he is in discussions with SiriusXM about a new contract, dispelling rumors that his long-running show might be ending. The clarification came after Stern orchestrated a prank where fellow host Andy Cohen briefly took over his show's time slot, leading some listeners to believe he was leaving the platform. Stern, 71, called the stunt a hoax that he masterminded and assured his audience that reports of his or his co-host's departure were false. His current five-year, $500 million contract with the satellite radio company is set to expire at the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation, the UK Labour Party has initiated an accelerated process to elect a new deputy leader. Former deputy leader Baroness Harriet Harman has argued that the role should be filled by a woman from outside of London to broaden the leadership's reach and complement the party leader. The contest was triggered by Rayner's departure after an investigation found she breached the ministerial code. Nominations open this week, with candidates needing the support of at least 80 MPs to proceed, a high threshold that some on the party's left believe will narrow the field of potential contenders.</p>

The focus in France is on the government's struggle to pass significant budget cuts, a situation that could lead to President Macron appointing a fifth prime minister in less than two years.

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously upheld the $83.3 million judgment against Donald Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court rejected Trump's arguments that the damages were excessive and that he should be protected by presidential immunity. The ruling affirmed that the jury's award was "fair and reasonable" given the evidence of the reputational and personal harm Carroll suffered due to Trump's repeated denials of her sexual assault allegation. Carroll's legal team expressed satisfaction with the decision, stating they look forward to justice finally being served.</p>

          <p>Amid signs of a weakening U.S. job market, financial experts are offering guidance for student loan borrowers who have recently lost their jobs. Federal borrowers may be eligible for income-driven repayment plans, which can lower monthly payments significantly, sometimes to zero, based on current income including unemployment benefits. Other options include an Unemployment Deferment or an Economic Hardship Deferment, which can temporarily pause payments, though interest may still accrue on some loans. Those with private student loans have fewer standard options but are encouraged to contact their lenders directly to discuss potential assistance programs available to them.</p>

          <p>Following his dominant victory over Jannik Sinner in the US Open final, Carlos Alcaraz has now won six Grand Slam titles at the age of 22, drawing comparisons to tennis legends.

Alcaraz achieved his sixth title in only his 19th Grand Slam tournament, a pace second only to Bjorn Borg. His performance in New York was particularly notable for his improved serve, which saw him face the fewest break points of any Grand Slam winner since 1991.</p>
