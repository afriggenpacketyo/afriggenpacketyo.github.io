          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 15% after the retailer surpassed Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, despite an overall decline in sales. The company narrowed its full-year sales guidance and revised its earnings per share outlook, reflecting improved financial performance. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed the positive results to progress in strategic initiatives, including inventory reduction, lowered expenses, and better customer engagement. This financial update signals a potential turnaround for Kohl's, which has faced leadership turmoil and a three-year streak of declining annual revenue, indicating efforts to stabilize its market position.

          <p>Republican Rep. Mark Alford of Missouri is distinguishing himself by hosting 15 town halls over four days, defying a trend among GOP lawmakers to avoid such direct constituent engagement. The former broadcast journalist embraces these sessions as opportunities to listen and refine his beliefs, despite acknowledging potential for heated discussions. Alford discussed his work on the Small Business and Appropriations committees, addressing questions about the recent tax and spending bill, and skillfully de-escalated contentious moments. Constituents raised concerns about the Trump administration's policies, including halted solar energy funding and VA hospital hiring freezes, highlighting the local impact of national decisions and the value of direct dialogue.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canada Goose rose over 7% in premarket trading following reports that its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, has received bids to take the winter-clothing maker private. Sources indicate that Boyu Capital and Advent International have made verbal offers, valuing the company at approximately $1.35 billion, based on its 12-month average earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Bain Capital is reportedly awaiting further offers before making a decision, with due diligence expected to be swift once a buyer is selected. This potential privatization move highlights a significant financial development for Canada Goose, whose market value has seen fluctuations since its 2017 public offering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Grrlspot, a monthly pop-up event for queer women in New Orleans, emerged after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, effectively filling a void left by the dwindling number of lesbian bars in the US. Founded by Jenna Jordan and others seeking camaraderie post-storm, it grew from small meetups to large dance parties, now hosting four annual events including during Southern Decadence. The initiative provides a crucial safe space for lesbians and trans women, especially given the financial challenges that prevented many queer individuals from returning to the city and rebuilding. Grrlspot's success underscores the community's resilience and ongoing desire for dedicated spaces for connection and celebration.</p>

          <p>Argentine police have raided a villa in Mar del Plata in search of "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi, a 17th-century Italian painting believed to have been looted by Nazis during WWII. The artwork, originally owned by a Jewish art dealer, was reportedly spotted in a real estate ad for a home belonging to descendants of Nazi fugitive Friedrich Kadgien. This investigation reopens a dark chapter in Argentina's history of sheltering Nazi war criminals and their plundered property. While the painting was not found during the raid, officers seized other potentially useful items, highlighting ongoing international efforts for the restitution of stolen art.</p>

          <p>Democrats are gathering for their DNC summer meeting in Minneapolis, aiming to redefine their platform and aggressively counter President Trump amidst lagging fundraising and voter registration. Party members express eagerness to fight back, particularly against Republican efforts for mid-decade redistricting and the impacts of Trump's spending and policy bill on healthcare costs. Despite internal challenges and leadership scrutiny, there is a growing consensus and renewed energy to move past recent election losses and unify the party. The Democrats plan to focus on core issues like affordability and engage voters in non-political spaces, with members emphasizing the need for a more assertive and unified approach to regain political footing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese semiconductor firm Cambricon reported a record profit and a staggering 4,000% year-on-year revenue surge to 2.88 billion Chinese yuan ($402.7 million) in the first half of the year. This impressive growth highlights the increasing traction of local alternatives to Nvidia as Beijing seeks to bolster its domestic AI chip industry amidst continuous threats of being cut off from American technology. Despite its significant growth, Cambricon's figures remain considerably smaller than Nvidia's $44 billion quarterly revenue, indicating the scale of the challenge. The company is also enhancing its software offerings and developing next-generation hardware, though it faces long-term obstacles due to export controls on advanced chipmaking techniques.

          <p>Crystal Palace has reportedly agreed a deal in principle worth up to £26 million with Villarreal for Spanish winger Yeremy Pino, following the departure of Eberechi Eze. The 22-year-old is expected to undergo a medical in the coming days, indicating his openness to moving to Selhurst Park. This transfer move comes after Crystal Palace's key player, England forward Eberechi Eze, completed a significant £60 million move to Arsenal last week. Pino, who scored four goals in 34 league games last season for Villarreal, is set to become one of Crystal Palace's few new signings this summer as the club aims to strengthen its squad.</p>

          <p>Beijing is intensifying its infrastructure development and investment efforts in Tibet, marking the 60th anniversary of the region's establishment, aiming to boost local industries. The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (Sasac) is advocating for increased capital flow into grassroots projects and a greater promotion of cultural and tourism sectors to benefit local communities. Tibet, located on China’s southwestern frontier and bordering four Asian countries, possesses distinct advantages in agriculture, animal husbandry, and clean energy. Despite significant prior advances in infrastructure, transport and environmental conditions in the high-altitude region continue to pose development barriers, necessitating targeted measures to overcome these challenges and ensure sustainable growth.</p>

          <p>A Utah district court has ordered the state to redraw its congressional map for the 2026 midterm elections, potentially making one of its four Republican-held seats competitive for Democrats. Judge Dianna Gibson declared the current map unlawful, finding that the state legislature circumvented a voter-approved independent redistricting commission designed to prevent partisan gerrymandering. The ruling comes as President Trump encourages Republican-led states to create more GOP-favorable congressional seats through mid-decade redistricting. Lawmakers have until September 24 to adopt a compliant map, with the decision highlighting the ongoing national battle over fair electoral boundaries and the integrity of the democratic process.</p>

          <h2>Brain's Map of Lost Limb Remains Intact, Challenging Prior Beliefs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Nature Neuroscience challenges previous beliefs about brain reorganization after limb amputation, suggesting that the brain's map of a lost limb remains largely intact. Researchers, using MRI scans before and after amputations, found that the "phantom hand representation" in the somatosensory cortex was similar to the pre-amputated state, even years later. This finding contradicts the idea that neighboring brain areas expand to fill the void and offers significant hope for brain-computer interfaces, which rely on stable neural circuits for controlling prosthetic limbs. The research also proposes that phantom limb pain may stem from the brain still expecting signals from the missing body part, rather than brain map changes.</p>
