        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A planned weekend-long bus strike that threatened to disrupt dozens of routes across London has been largely called off after most workers accepted a new pay deal. Members of the Unite union employed by London United, the larger of two bus operators involved, voted to accept an above-inflation pay offer. This action averts a major walkout that was scheduled to affect services in north-west and south-west London. However, negotiations are still pending with the smaller operator, London Transit, meaning some limited industrial action could still proceed on a handful of routes if an agreement is not reached.</p>

          <p>Boeing has reached a tentative five-year labor agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union, potentially ending a strike that began in early August. The deal, which includes improved wages and a restored signing bonus, will be voted on by the more than 3,000 union members this Friday. These employees, based primarily in St. Louis, are responsible for assembling and maintaining critical defense products like F-15 fighter jets and missile systems. The strike was the first in nearly three decades for this unit, which saw Boeing hire replacement workers to meet demand.</p>

          <p>A new documentary reveals that actor Clint Eastwood was instrumental in convincing Charlie Sheen to seek treatment for substance abuse during a family-led intervention in the early 1990s. Organized by his father, Martin Sheen, the intervention gathered close friends and family to confront the actor about his addiction. After the group presented their case, Sheen's father handed him the phone to speak with Eastwood, who offered powerful words of encouragement. Sheen recalled that Eastwood's message, urging him to get his life back on track, was the final push he needed to agree to go to rehab.</p>

          <p>With average 30-year mortgage rates dropping to an 11-month low of 6.50%, prospective homebuyers may be able to secure a rate below 6% through strategic actions. The article suggests considering an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), as the average rate for a 7/1 ARM is currently just under 6%. Additionally, diligently shopping around and comparing offers from multiple lenders can often yield a rate significantly lower than the national average. Finally, timing the market around anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts could present brief windows of opportunity for locking in a more favorable interest rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock experienced a historic surge, climbing over 35% for its best performance since 1992, after the company reported an astounding backlog of future business. The company's remaining performance obligations reached $455 billion, far exceeding analyst expectations and signaling massive demand for its AI-related cloud infrastructure. This significant growth, driven by deals with major AI companies, has pushed Oracle's market capitalization towards the $1 trillion mark. The strong forecast overshadowed a slight miss on quarterly earnings and revenue, highlighting investor confidence in its AI strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates, savers should consider the different impacts on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. Because CDs have a fixed interest rate, locking in a rate now will protect earnings from subsequent Fed-driven declines for the duration of the term. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts have variable rates that will likely fall shortly after any central bank rate reduction. While savings accounts offer greater flexibility for withdrawals, CDs provide predictability and are better positioned to preserve higher returns in a cooling rate environment.

          <p>A new study by the China-Brazil Business Council found that Chinese imports supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil, more than double the number linked to the country's exports to China. This data highlights the profound economic integration between the two nations but also underscores the risks of dependency on a single trading partner. In 2024, China accounted for 28% of Brazilian exports and 24% of its imports. While this trade generated a massive surplus for Brazil, the report notes that exports are highly concentrated in just a few commodities like soybeans and iron ore, creating economic vulnerability.</p>

The samples, from a former river channel, contain the minerals vivianite and greigite, which on Earth are often formed through biological processes involving organic matter. While scientists emphasize this is not definitive proof and that non-biological formation cannot be ruled out, it is considered the closest discovery yet to a potential biosignature on Mars.

Lasry, who sold his Bucks stake in 2023, stated that he has always known Ballmer to follow the rules and that there is not pressure in the league to skirt them.

Meanwhile, stock in Tesla, a major component of Musk's wealth, has declined this year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite September 10 being the historical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, activity has been notably subdued this year. Meteorologists attribute the quiet season primarily to persistent Saharan dust moving across the Atlantic, which inhibits the thunderstorm development necessary for cyclone formation. Additionally, the current "ENSO Neutral" climate pattern, with neither El Niño nor La Niña present, contributes to atypical conditions. Forecasters at NOAA still predict an above-average season overall, noting that 60% of the season remains and conditions are expected to transition to a more active La Niña pattern in the coming months.</p>
