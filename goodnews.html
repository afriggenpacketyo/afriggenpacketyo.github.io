          <p>Mexican business leaders and executives are praising statements from Apollo Global Management Inc. CEO Marc Rowan, who emphasized the need for a trade partnership between the U.S. and Mexico. Rowan suggested that resolving trade issues with Mexico and Canada first would put the U.S. in a stronger position to reset global trade terms, which has been perceived as a strategic opportunity due to Mexico's proximity to the U.S., its young demographics, and its large pension system. Executives believe that trade turmoil presents an opportunity for more integration between the U.S. and Mexico, especially as companies seek alternatives to China for manufacturing.</p>
