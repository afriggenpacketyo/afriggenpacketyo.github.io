        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has been temporarily exempted from Donald Trump's executive order that doubles tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%. While the order raises import taxes for US-based firms buying from other countries, the levy remains at 25% for the UK due to the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal signed last month. However, this agreement is yet to fully come into force, meaning UK steel exporters will still face tariffs until it does, and could face the higher amount if the pact falters. The UK government has stated its commitment to protecting British business and jobs and will continue to work with the US to fully implement the agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 4-year-old girl from Mexico, identified as Sofia, who is receiving lifesaving medical treatment in the United States, has been granted humanitarian parole for one year, allowing her and her mother to remain in the country. Sofia suffers from "short bowel syndrome," which prevents her from properly absorbing nutrients and fluid from food on her own. Her lawyers at Public Counsel expressed gratitude to USCIS for acting swiftly to ensure she can continue receiving her specialized IV treatments, which can only be administered in the United States, according to the equipment manufacturer. The lawyers also emphasized the need for systemic changes to protect other immigrants facing life-threatening harm.</p>

          <p>South Korea's new President, Lee Jae Myung, vowed to prioritize pragmatism and unity to address the crises facing the nation, particularly those resulting from his predecessor's imposition of martial law. In his inaugural address, Lee emphasized a practical approach to diplomacy and a commitment to strengthening cooperation with the United States and Japan. He also addressed the need to be prepared for North Korea's nuclear threats while maintaining open communication channels for dialogue and cooperation. Lee's term began immediately after the snap election, which was triggered by the removal of Yoon Suk Yeol following a Constitutional Court ruling.</p>

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has entered a fuel-efficient orbit synchronized with the Earth and moon's motion, a 3:1 resonant orbit seen as a breakthrough for lunar infrastructure. The Deep Space Exploration Laboratory claims Tiandu-1 is the first spacecraft to achieve this round-trip 3:1 Earth-moon resonant trajectory. However, experts in the US and Canada dispute this claim, pointing to NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) probe, which entered a near-identical orbit in 2011.</p>

          <p>At Japan's only seal sanctuary, the Okhotsk Tokkari Center, staff avoid naming the rescued seals to minimize heartbreak when releasing them back into the wild. The center rescues injured or weakened seals found on the shore and rehabilitates them for release. Despite efforts to maintain emotional distance, staff develop bonds with the animals, especially after months of care. The center has rescued over 200 seals since its establishment in the 1980s, and though survival is not guaranteed, the staff find satisfaction in returning them to the sea.</p>
