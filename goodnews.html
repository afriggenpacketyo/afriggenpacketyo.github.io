          <p>A wave of younger Democratic candidates is launching primary challenges against established, long-serving incumbents, arguing that the party's leadership has become complacent and out of touch. Citing a need for new energy and a more urgent response to the current political climate, these challengers believe the party is failing to connect with voters, especially younger generations and minority groups. While incumbents defend their records by pointing to their experience and seniority, the insurgents contend the issue is not about ideology but about a willingness to fight for democratic values. This generational clash is forcing a broader debate within the party about its future direction and leadership.</p>

          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old man, has received his high school diploma decades after his education was cut short by severe abuse at the notorious Dozier School for Boys in Florida. Horne attended the brutal reform school in the mid-1960s and later dropped out of high school to support his family, but he never gave up on his goal of graduating. He was able to complete his studies through a new compensation program established by the Florida legislature for victims of abuse at Dozier and a similar institution. Horne's graduation from St. Petersburg High School fulfills a lifelong promise to himself and serves as an inspiration for overcoming profound adversity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent dermatological research highlights the superior performance of tinted sunscreens in protecting against visible light, a factor linked to hyperpigmentation and melasma, conditions more common in people of color. While standard sunscreens primarily block UV radiation, tinted versions containing iron oxide offer a crucial defense against this deeper-penetrating light. Experts emphasize that this protection addresses significant psychosocial and emotional impacts of skin discoloration. The article notes that while the industry is improving, finding a suitable range of tints for diverse skin tones remains a challenge for many consumers, limiting accessibility for some.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruptive activity, shooting lava fountains up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. This latest display is part of an ongoing eruption series that began in December and is contained within Halemaumau Crater, posing no threat to nearby homes. The U.S. Geological Survey is closely monitoring the activity, which provides a spectacular show for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain the fountains are caused by gas-rich magma rising through narrow vents, a pattern observed in previous Kilauea eruptions.</p>

          <p>Coventry City Football Club has successfully purchased the Coventry Building Society (CBS) Arena, its home stadium, from Frasers Group. Club owner Doug King described the acquisition as a "pivotal moment" that ensures the club's long-term stability and safeguards its future for generations of supporters. The move ends years of uncertainty for the club and its fans, who have endured multiple stadium owners and periods of playing at different grounds since leaving Highfield Road in 2005. This ownership allows the club to invest directly in facilities and fan experience, marking a new era of ambition and stability.</p>

          <p>Japan is actively broadening its defense collaborations with nations like the United Kingdom, Australia, and others, a move analysts attribute to perceived mixed signals from the United States regarding its commitment to Indo-Pacific security. A recent multinational exercise saw British and U.S. F-35B fighter jets conduct flight operations from the Japanese destroyer-carrier JS Kaga, showcasing growing interoperability. This strategic diversification aims to build a more resilient security network in the region, particularly with an eye on China's military advancements. The exercises signal a deliberate effort by Japan to create a stronger, more integrated allied presence in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

          <p>A central Berlin street with a name considered racist will be officially renamed in honor of Anton Wilhelm Amo, the first African-born scholar to earn a European doctorate in the 18th century. The name change for Mohrenstrasse, or "Moor Street," was approved in 2020 but was delayed by a lawsuit from residents. After Germany's higher administrative court upheld the decision, the renaming is set to proceed, marking a victory for civil society groups who have campaigned for decades to remove the derogatory term. The new name honors a significant but often overlooked figure in European intellectual history and symbolizes a step toward decolonizing public spaces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The current season of "South Park" is being lauded as a rare example of effective political satire in the era of Donald Trump's second presidency. While many comedies have struggled to parody an administration that often defies caricature, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have succeeded by avoiding preachy moralizing and instead using their signature mean-spirited humor. The show depicts Trump not through imitation but as a photo cutout voiced like Saddam Hussein, drawing a direct line to authoritarianism. By focusing on gratifyingly harsh caricatures of figures like Trump and Kristi Noem, the show has managed to land punches where others have failed.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Suggest Japan Should Cooperate with China on Infrastructure Instead of Competing</h2>

          <p>Japan's recent announcement of a major infrastructure initiative spanning the Indian Ocean and Africa could position it in direct competition with China's Belt and Road Initiative, potentially leading to wasted resources and conflicting standards. The article argues that instead of engaging in an "infrastructure war" for geopolitical influence, cooperation would be more beneficial. With the U.S. seemingly less involved and Europe distracted, the rivalry between Japan and China in this sphere is intensifying. Utilizing multilateral development banks is proposed as a more effective way to finance and manage large-scale international projects, avoiding the pitfalls of nationally sponsored, competitive endeavors.</p>

          <p>As the US Open begins, Iga Swiatek enters as the women's favorite, having built significant momentum with a surprising Wimbledon victory and a strong hard-court season. Her main rivals include world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who is seeking to overcome a series of near misses in major tournaments, and Coco Gauff, who has struggled with her serve since her French Open triumph. In the men's draw, the dominance of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner continues, with the two having contested the last two Grand Slam finals. The primary question is whether any other player can break their hold on the top of the sport.</p>

          <p>The Turkish government is exploring new regulations aimed at reducing food waste, with a particular focus on the large all-you-can-eat buffets and elaborate breakfasts common in the country's hotels and restaurants. Advisors to President Erdogan are drafting proposals after a report revealed that Turkey wastes approximately 8.7 million tons of food annually. Critics of the current system, like restaurateur Ramazan Bingol, argue that the traditional multi-dish "Serpme Kahvalti" breakfast leads to immense waste. Proposed changes include allowing guests to customize their meals and moving toward more à la carte dining instead of fixed-price buffets.</p>

          <p>Paige Louise Williams, a 32-year-old from Greater Manchester, has built a multi-million-pound beauty empire, P.Louise, from a £20,000 loan from her grandmother. Starting with a small salon a decade ago, Williams leveraged her unique makeup style and early adoption of online classes to grow her brand. A key turning point was the success of her eyeshadow base, which gained viral attention, and her strategic use of TikTok Shop, where she broke a UK sales record. The company, which generated £71 million last year, is now expanding into its first retail store in a major shopping center.</p>
