          <p>HSBC's co-CEO, David Liao Yi-chien, stated that multinational companies are increasing their investments in China's high-end manufacturing, healthcare, and consumer goods sectors, reflecting optimism about China's innovation and growth potential. According to HSBC's Global Trade Pulse Survey, China is the top target market for companies looking to expand their global trade capabilities, with many planning to increase manufacturing in the country. China continues to attract international investment due to its vast market size, comprehensive industrial facilities, dynamic innovation ecosystem, and abundant talent. Liao emphasized that China's capital markets provide essential investment opportunities for international investors, driven by innovation-led economic growth.</p>

          <p>Following the resignation of Japan's leader, analysts anticipate that Tokyo will continue to view Beijing as a strategic competitor, navigating the complex China-Japan relationship. The previous leader cited the conclusion of trade negotiations with the United States, which reduced tariffs on Japanese car imports, as his reason for stepping down. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman declined to comment on the resignation, calling it an internal matter for Japan. The new leader will need to manage the ongoing tensions and strategic competition between the two countries, which has been a persistent challenge in recent years.</p>

          <p>Mistral AI, backed by Nvidia, has achieved a valuation of $14 billion in a Series C funding round, with ASML, a Dutch chip equipment maker, securing a significant stake in the French company. ASML invested 1.3 billion euros in Mistral AI's 1.7 billion-euro funding round, gaining an 11% shareholding. This investment more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation of 5.8 billion euros, driven by substantial investments in the rapidly growing AI industry. Mistral, a leading European tech startup and OpenAI rival, is developing large language models for AI applications like chatbots, requiring significant infrastructure investments, with the company launching its first reasoning model to compete with OpenAI and DeepSeek.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has called on BRICS members to address trade imbalances with New Delhi, as the bloc collectively opposes U.S. tariffs. India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar noted that India's largest trade deficits are with BRICS partners. This stance contrasts with Brazil's criticism of the U.S., while China cautioned against unilateralism and protectionism, urging BRICS nations to unite against higher tariffs. India views BRICS primarily as an economic initiative, while China and Russia consider it a geopolitical grouping, with India's trade deficit with China reaching a record high, prompting calls for solutions to address these imbalances. The tone suggests a complex dynamic within BRICS regarding trade and geopolitical strategy.</p>

          <p>European stocks are expected to remain steady or decline as investors focus on political instability in France following the ousting of Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, creating uncertainty in the region. Bayrou's government lost a confidence vote due to a lack of support for the 2026 budget plans aimed at reducing France's budget deficit, prompting President Emmanuel Macron to appoint a new prime minister. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific markets traded mostly higher, and U.S. stock futures remained relatively unchanged as investors await key inflation reports, which could influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. This week's inflation data follows weaker-than-expected hiring data, fueling hopes for potential interest rate cuts.</p>

          <p>England's World Cup preparations under coach Thomas Tuchel face a significant test against Serbia in Belgrade, with the team seeking to solidify their qualifying position. Despite flawless results in qualifying matches, England's performances have lacked inspiration and a clear identity since Tuchel took over. The match in Belgrade presents a hostile environment and a test of temperament for the team, with Serbia aiming to challenge England's progress. Tuchel views the game as a "proof of concept" and an opportunity to demonstrate progress, while acknowledging the emotional sporting environment and the quality of the Serbian team.</p>

The construction of the dam, funded through government bonds and public donations due to geopolitical sensitivities, has raised concerns about its impact on water supplies. The Ethiopian government has dismissed these claims, stating it has adhered to the 2015 Declaration of Principles and shared updates with neighboring countries. The project has united Ethiopians but remains a point of contention in the region, with negotiations ongoing regarding water-sharing agreements.</p>
