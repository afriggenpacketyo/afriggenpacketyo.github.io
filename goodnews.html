          <p>Chime, a financial technology company, has filed paperwork to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "CHYM", clarifying that it is a technology company, not a bank, and picks up revenue from interchange fees associated with purchases that members make with Chime debit cards and credit cards. In the March quarter, Chime generated $12.4 million in net income on $518.7 million in revenue, and has 8.6 million active members. Chime offers services including high-yield savings accounts, free tax filing, and early access to earned pay, but the company, along with other platforms, delayed their plans following Trump's tariff announcement in April. </p>

          <p>Airbnb has launched a redesigned app to showcase its expansion into services like catering and personal training for home rentals. The company plans to invest $200 million to $250 million in this new business, aiming to drive future revenue growth. This marks Airbnb's renewed effort to move beyond home stays, after scaling back previous attempts in 2020 due to the pandemic. CEO Brian Chesky noted the rebuilt app allows for faster innovation and offering more than just homes, and the company's business chief, Dave Stephenson, said that they now feel they have such a strong foundation that they are capable of building and expanding.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily reduce prescription drug costs within 30 days or face new restrictions on government payments. The order directs the Department of Health to negotiate new drug prices, potentially linking U.S. prices to those in other countries. The pharmaceutical industry opposed the order, arguing it could harm research and development. Trump threatened federal investigations and opening the U.S. market to more imported drugs. Experts noted that the order's impact on consumers may be slow, and the department of health has limited power to manipulate the prices paid by millions of Americans covered by private insurance.</p>

          <p>C√©line Dion made a rare appearance during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest with a brief, pre-recorded message, as Switzerland will forever hold a special place in her heart. The semi-final saw 10 acts qualify for Saturday's grand finale, including Swedish entrants KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is the runaway favourite. Fifteen acts performed at Tuesday's semi-final in Basel's St Jakobshalle, and Dion's video message came during the ceremony's interval, as votes were being cast. The singer has stepped away from the limelight in recent years due to health issues related to stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a neurological condition that causes muscle spasms and makes it difficult for her to walk.</p>

Douthat argues that both right-wing and left-wing perspectives can capture truths that can be portrayed non-propagandistically. He uses examples like V.S.
