          <p>The second-largest Powerball jackpot in U.S. history, nearly $1.8 billion, was won by two tickets sold in Missouri and Texas after 42 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner.

The lucky ticketholders can choose between a $410.3 million lump sum cash payment or $893.5 million distributed over 30 increasing annual payments.

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, where they addressed the growing threat of oligarchic control and rallied support for Mamdani's progressive campaign. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, has garnered significant backing for his pledges to freeze rent, increase housing, and raise taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers. Sanders praised Mamdani's grassroots movement as a "test case of whether democracy is still able to prevail" against billionaire donors and media oligarchs. The event highlighted a divide within the Democratic party, with mainstream leaders showing reluctance to embrace Mamdani's platform.</p>

Despite the offensive dominance, the article notes some defensive breakdowns and penalties, suggesting the team is still "a long ways off from its best." The game marked a return to the Coliseum for former USC coach Helton, who received boos from fans.</p>

          <h2>US-China Research Team Develops Novel Robot Launch Method Using Bubble Cavitation</h2>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimetre-scale robots up to 1.5 meters into the air by harnessing the energy of rapidly collapsing vapour bubbles. The technique involves heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles, which then suddenly collapse, releasing a powerful launching force. This controlled cavitation mechanism allows scientists to precisely manipulate the launch and even swimming of these small devices. The study, published in Science, demonstrates the efficiency of this bubble-popping energy for robotic applications.</p>

          <p>Schools across 35 U.S. states are adopting locked magnetic pouches, like those from Yondr, to enforce statewide cellphone bans in classrooms, affecting at least 2.5 million students. Yonkers Middle High School, for example, purchased 11,000 pouches to comply with New York's mandate, aiming to reduce distractions and foster in-person engagement. While some students appreciate the change, others remain skeptical or attempt to bypass the system. Educators and Yondr's CEO believe these "phone-free spaces" create a better learning environment, despite debates over the cost and implementation challenges.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received special baseball treats, including a gift bag and a meeting with player Harrison Bader, after an adult woman controversially took a home run ball from him. During a Phillies-Marlins game, the ball landed in the stands, and after a man (the boy's father) initially gave it to the child, a woman claimed it was hers and took it. The incident went viral, prompting both the Phillies and Marlins organizations to ensure the young fan received a memorable experience, including an autographed bat from Bader, who hit the home run.</p>

These candidates are being promoted to expand the party's electoral footprint and attract more members, with ambitions to contest numerous elections in the coming years. While Farage remains central, the party is implementing more rigorous vetting and training processes for its growing "people's army."</p>
