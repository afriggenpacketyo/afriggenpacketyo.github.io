          <p>Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, are strategizing to offset the impact of additional U.S. tariffs on cars. With projected profit declines due to the tariffs, the companies are considering strategies such as focusing on sales of popular fuel-efficient models and potential price increases, though they are wary of alienating customers. While increasing local production is an option, it would require significant reorganization of supply chains and may take years. The automakers aim to maintain competitiveness in the U.S. market despite the financial challenges posed by the tariffs.</p>

          <p>HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. argues that American patients pay disproportionately more for prescription drugs compared to citizens of other wealthy nations. He cites examples of GLP-1 drugs costing significantly more in the U.S. than in London, even though they are identical medications from the same companies. Kennedy asserts that the Trump administration is committed to ensuring Americans pay no more for medications than other developed nations and is prepared to take decisive action if necessary. He emphasizes the need for both affordable access to therapies and continued innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Felix, a police violence case, criticizing the lower court's narrow approach to excessive force claims.

This decision requires the Fifth Circuit to reconsider the case, potentially impacting how police violence cases are evaluated, though the ultimate outcome remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement between the UK and the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. The proposal aims to facilitate reciprocal arrangements, similar to existing schemes with countries like Australia, while avoiding a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement. The UK government is considering the scheme to enhance opportunities for young people, but details on eligibility and quotas are still under discussion. There are also concerns from the Conservative Party about the arrangement amounting to a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement.</p>
