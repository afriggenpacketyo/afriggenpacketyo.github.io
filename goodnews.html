          <p>Indirect talks are ongoing in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, aimed at finalizing a US peace plan to end the Gaza conflict, focusing on creating conditions for a hostage-prisoner exchange. President Trump expressed optimism about reaching a lasting agreement, while Hamas has partially agreed but remains hesitant on key demands like disarmament. The discussions coincide with the second anniversary of the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel and the subsequent Israeli military campaign in Gaza. The plan proposes an immediate end to fighting, the release of hostages, and full aid to Gaza, but Netanyahu has reaffirmed his opposition to a Palestinian state. These talks are crucial in determining whether a path toward ending the conflict is within reach. Optimism surrounds the prospects of these talks and the potential for a lasting resolution. </p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index achieved a record high for the second consecutive day, fueled by a tech rally on Wall Street driven by a significant deal between OpenAI and AMD. Chip stocks experienced notable gains, with Advantest and Tokyo Electron leading the surge. The index previously hit a fresh high following the election of Sanae Takaichi as the new leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Meanwhile, Japanese Government Bond yields rose to all-time highs, and the yen weakened against the dollar. This market activity reflects broader trends in the tech sector and investor confidence in Japan's economic outlook. The positive momentum reflects the market's positive reaction to technological advancements and leadership changes. </p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden attended Game 2 of the National League Division Series between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Los Angeles Dodgers, witnessing a narrow 4-3 defeat for the home team. The Phillies mounted a late comeback in the ninth inning, scoring two runs but ultimately falling short. The Dodgers now lead the best-of-five series 2-0, heading back to Los Angeles for Game 3. Biden's presence at the game marked a rare public appearance at a sporting event since leaving office. The outcome of the game sets the stage for a critical Game 3 as the Phillies look to stay alive in the series. </p>

          <p>Hong Kong is aiming to strengthen its role as a superconnector, not just between mainland China and the world, but also within the Asia-Pacific region. The city's deep fundraising pool, capital freedom, and unique advantages under the "one country, two systems" principle make it ideal for connecting Chinese and Asian companies with global markets. This initiative seeks to attract listings and capital for top-tier companies across India, Southeast Asia, and developed markets like Japan and Singapore. The city's efforts come as mainland capital increasingly flows into Hong Kong amid US-China decoupling. The strategic shift underscores Hong Kong's ambition to remain a key financial hub in Asia. </p>

          <p>Bill Nye and other advocates protested proposed budget cuts to NASA, arguing that the United States would cede leadership in space exploration to countries like China. Nye emphasized that NASA's budget is a small fraction of the federal budget with an extraordinary return. A White House proposal would cut NASA's funding by about 25% for fiscal year 2026, potentially impacting missions like the Perseverance Mars rover and the Artemis program. Nye highlighted that investing in NASA yields significant economic benefits and technological advancements. The proposed cuts could hinder U.S. progress in space exploration and scientific discovery. </p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla is intensifying over the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southwest Mexico, with the National Hurricane Center forecasting heavy rains and gusty winds for the region. The Mexican government issued tropical storm watches for Baja California Sur and parts of mainland Mexico. Priscilla is expected to become a category 2 hurricane and could approach major hurricane status. While the storm is forecast to remain offshore, it will likely bring heavy rain, tropical storm-force winds, and swells to coastal areas. Residents are urged to monitor updates and take precautions against potential flash flooding and dangerous surf conditions. </p>

          <p>Hong Kong's role as a market connector should extend beyond mainland China to encompass the entire Asia-Pacific region, according to Citic's leadership. Hong Kong is well-positioned to become Asia's financing hub, attracting listings and capital for top-tier companies across India, Southeast Asia, and developed markets like Japan and Singapore. The city's deep fundraising pool, high degree of capital freedom, and unique advantages under the "one country, two systems" principle provide a unique platform. Mainland capital is increasingly flowing into the city amid US-China decoupling. The city's ambition to broaden its financial influence reflects its strategic importance. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is considering a significant financial aid package for U.S. farmers, potentially exceeding $10 billion. The focus is on soybean farmers, who have been particularly affected by the Chinese boycott of American soybeans. Discussions are in early stages, with the Treasury Department and Agriculture Department involved. The administration is exploring using tariff revenue to fund the aid. China, previously a major buyer of U.S. soybeans, has made no purchases this harvest season. The potential aid package underscores the administration's efforts to support farmers amid trade disputes. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Renewable energy sources, including nuclear power, have jointly surpassed coal as the world's leading source of electricity for the first half of the year, according to data from Ember. Growth in solar and wind energy met 100% of the extra electricity demand, leading to a slight decline in coal and gas use. Developing countries, especially China, led the clean energy charge, while richer nations relied more on fossil fuels. Solar power delivered the lion's share of growth, meeting 83% of the increase in electricity demand. This shift marks a crucial turning point in the global energy transition. </p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed optimism about Take-Two Interactive, citing its potential to dominate the video game space following the acquisition of Activision and the take-private deal involving Electronic Arts. With fewer major publicly-traded American video game companies, Take-Two has scarcity value. The company is known for popular series like Grand Theft Auto, with the highly anticipated "Grand Theft Auto VI" set for release in May 2026. Take-Two's recent financial results beat Wall Street estimates, and its mobile business is growing. The analysis suggests strong growth potential for Take-Two, even with possible delays in the release of "GTA VI." (not investment advice)</p>

Threets, a former Bay Area librarian, gained online popularity for his videos promoting reading and sharing stories from working in a library. He was raised to be proud of his heritage and looks up to his grandfather and mother as examples of what it means to be Latino. The reboot of "Reading Rainbow" has mostly stayed true to its roots with a new rerecorded theme song and a trivia segment. Threets's heritage will be reflected in his appearance on the show. </p>

          <p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) is directing its members to continue working during the government shutdown, warning that failure to report for duty could lead to termination. This came as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers calling in sick since the shutdown began. The Federal Aviation Administration defines air traffic controllers as essential workers, requiring them to stay on the job during government closures despite going unpaid. The directive underscores the importance of maintaining air safety during the shutdown. </p>

He says he was not sure how he would react after ending his trophy drought, but now believes it has made him hungry for more. His comments suggest a commitment to his current club. </p>

          <p>China is drafting its 15th five-year plan, a document summarizing the country’s development goals through the coming half-decade. Many of the country’s entrepreneurs may be entering the new cycle with a sense of fatigue. Though the government has launched a barrage of measures intended to make life easier for private businesses, more than 60 per cent of them still describe the climate as “difficult.” With the 15th five-year plan set to shape China’s trajectory for the rest of the decade, one question looms large: can the country’s leaders restore the confidence of the private sector? The plan may provide some relief to private firms. </p>
