          <h2>Single-Stair Housing Reform Gains Momentum Amidst Housing Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 06:08:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A deceptively simple reform is gaining traction in the US that could unlock more housing. This reform would allow single-staircase apartment buildings up to six stories, potentially cutting construction costs and increasing housing density. Advocates argue that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair buildings as safe as those with two staircases, and note that many countries already permit this design. While fire safety officials raise concerns, several states are considering or have already passed legislation to allow single-stair construction, aiming to ease the housing crunch and provide more varied unit layouts.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a significant jump in premarket trading following a strong earnings report, which triggered a rally in global semiconductor stocks. Despite facing headwinds from U.S. semiconductor export restrictions to China, Nvidia's financial results exceeded market expectations. The company wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory due to these restrictions, but investors view Nvidia as a bellwether for the semiconductor industry and AI-related stocks. The positive earnings also lifted shares of other U.S. companies like Marvell and Qualcomm, indicating continued demand for graphics processing units used in training AI models.</p>

          <p>Following their Olympic gold medal win led by the 'Triple Espresso' trio of Mallory Swanson, Sophia Wilson, and Trinity Rodman, the USWNT now faces a new chapter. With Wilson and Swanson pregnant, and Rodman dealing with back issues, coach Emma Hayes is focused on building depth and experimenting with the team for the 2027 World Cup. The absence of the trio provides an opportunity for players like Alyssa Thompson to step up and for Hayes to mold a broader player pool.

The renovation, designed by Walter Hood and Weiss/Manfredi, includes a new amphitheater, tiered gardens, and a pool, responding to community desires. The project seeks to address the historical division created by Lincoln Center's construction, which displaced a largely Black and Puerto Rican neighborhood.
