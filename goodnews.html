          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital rules for UBS that would require the banking giant to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023. These measures are designed to bolster UBS's resilience and reduce the likelihood of government bailouts in future crises. The Swiss National Bank supports the proposal, stating that it would significantly strengthen UBS's stability and ability to stabilize itself during times of financial distress. The new regulations would also necessitate UBS to fully capitalize its foreign units and reduce its share buybacks, ensuring greater financial prudence and stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its interest rates from 21% to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, signaling that inflationary pressures are beginning to ease. Inflation in April was seasonally adjusted to 6.2%, a decrease from the 8.2% average in the first quarter of 2025. The central bank stated that while domestic demand still exceeds the supply of goods and services, the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path. Monetary policy will remain tight for an extended period to reach the 4% inflation target, as Russia's economy has faced immense strain since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

          <p>The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing to reverse its ban on offering crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail investors, aiming to position the U.K. as a global hub for digital assets. Crypto ETNs are debt instruments linked to cryptocurrencies, allowing investors to gain exposure through regulated exchanges. The FCA initially banned these in 2019 due to consumer harm concerns, but now seeks to support U.K. growth and competitiveness by lifting the ban, while restrictions on crypto derivatives will remain. This move is praised by crypto firms as a significant step for the U.K.'s crypto industry, which has lagged behind the U.S. and EU. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite his popularity and skill, Grealish's playing time has diminished, and the club's potential signings suggest his departure. Grealish is open to various options, preferring a permanent move to a loan, and would consider staying in the Premier League with interest from Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle, Everton, and Aston Villa. He is also open to moving to clubs in Europe, such as Barcelona, AC Milan, or Borussia Dortmund, though a move to Saudi Arabia would be a last resort.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates are currently high, but potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance can still secure favorable rates, particularly with a strong credit score. As of June 6, 2025, the average rate for a 15-year mortgage is 6.14% and 6.97% for a 30-year mortgage, while refinance rates are 6.17% and 6.90% respectively. Experts suggest that if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, mortgage rates may stabilize, providing relief to borrowers. Improving credit profiles and shopping around for different lenders can also help secure better terms, so consider all the details of any new loan against your existing mortgage to ensure long-term savings.

From the carefree partying in 'Dazed and Confused' to the stark realities in 'Eighth Grade,' these films reflect changing societal concerns. Early films focused on youth delinquency, while more recent movies address issues like social media's influence and mental health. Teenagers now create their own content, potentially making traditional teen movies less relevant, but the genre continues to evolve alongside adolescent culture.</p>

          <p>Wes Anderson's new film, 'The Phoenician Scheme,' centers on tycoon Zsa-zsa Korda, played by Benicio del Toro, and his evolving understanding of human truths. The film follows Korda's madcap journey to save his fortune, prodding at the preening foolishness of today‚Äôs mega-rich land barons. Through encounters with his estranged daughter and near-death experiences, Korda's heart grows, quietly moderated by his daughter and his unspoken fear of death. Anderson's film strikes a balance between screwball energy and a poignant exploration of fatherhood and morality.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a strategic railway project linking the Kashmir Valley to the Indian mainland by train for the first time. This visit marks Modi's first to the contested region since recent military clashes between India and Pakistan. The project, including the Chenab Rail Bridge, aims to enhance Kashmir‚Äôs connectivity with the rest of India. The railway is expected to improve transportation and boost spiritual tourism, although tensions between India and Pakistan remain high following recent attacks and border skirmishes.</p>
