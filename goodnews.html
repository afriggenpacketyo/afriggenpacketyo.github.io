          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made significant strides in trade discussions held in Geneva, with further details expected to be revealed on Monday. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated that an agreement had been reached, addressing national security concerns related to China's trade practices, although it remains unclear whether tariff reductions were part of the accord. These talks aim to de-escalate trade tensions that have disrupted global supply chains, with economists warning of potential recessionary impacts. The meetings took place in Geneva, a historically neutral location, with both sides expressing a desire to lower tariffs.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, "Who Knew," TV, film, and media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct over excessive data in decision-making, particularly in creative fields. Diller recounts his experiences at ABC, where he championed the "Movie of the Week," emphasizing that predicting public appetite is impossible and that instinct is crucial. He cites the success of "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" as examples of projects greenlit based on gut feeling rather than extensive research. Diller argues that over-reliance on data can hinder true understanding and that human instinct remains essential for effective decision-making.</p>
