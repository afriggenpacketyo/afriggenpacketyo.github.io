          <p>Martin Rafferty, a musician from County Armagh, Northern Ireland, has broken the Guinness World Record for the longest busk, performing for 24 hours straight. Despite breaking his thumb last week, Rafferty continued his performance, ultimately ending his set after 27 hours due to a fading voice. His impressive feat, which surpassed the previous unofficial record, was undertaken to raise money for a local Christmas toy appeal. The event required adherence to strict rules, including not repeating songs within four hours and a 30-second break between each track.</p>

          <p>An Alabama death row inmate, Christopher Barbour, has been granted a new trial after 31 years, following recent forensic tests that found another man's DNA on the victim's body. Barbour, 56, was convicted in the 1992 fatal stabbing of Thelma Bishop Roberts, with his confession being a key part of the original case, which he later recanted, alleging police coercion. New DNA testing in 2021 linked semen on the victim to her neighbor, who is currently incarcerated for an unrelated murder. The federal judge ruled that prosecutors failed to disclose initial forensic notes excluding Barbour, violating his constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock saw fluctuations as the company released its latest earnings report, revealing strong AI demand but offering limited clarity on its China business. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that the AI revolution is in "full steam," projecting $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. Sales surged 56% to $46.74 billion, with data center revenue also growing significantly. Analysts view the results as consistent with Nvidia's objectives, indicating continued industry-wide AI investment, despite the modest upside to elevated expectations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a stronger-than-expected 3.3% annualized rate in the second quarter, according to the Commerce Department's revised estimate. This growth, up from an initial 3.0%, was driven by robust consumer spending and business investment, despite tariff volatility. A significant decline in imports, partly due to pre-tariff stockpiling, also contributed to the GDP increase. While the economy shows resilience, experts anticipate a slower growth pace going forward as tariffs become more visible to consumers.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Banking System Shrinks as Canada's Concentrated Model Shows Stability</h2>

          <p>The U.S. banking industry is experiencing significant consolidation, with the number of FDIC-insured banks nearly halved since 2005 due to large banks acquiring regional and community institutions. In contrast, Canada's highly concentrated banking system, with only 79 banks, was lauded as the soundest in the world during the 2008 financial crisis. While Canada's model offers stability through its large players, critics warn that market domination in the U.S. could lead to reduced competition, innovation, and competitive pricing. Proposed lower capital requirements for big U.S. banks are expected to accelerate this consolidation trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates are currently offering attractive returns, surpassing the inflation rate and providing a secure investment option for savers. Top accounts are yielding significantly higher than the national averages, with short-term CDs often providing the best rates due to an inverted yield curve. Investors can lock in these high rates for the term of the CD, and accounts are generally protected by FDIC or NCUA insurance up to $250,000. Online banks are a prime source for competitive CD rates, making them an ideal choice for maximizing savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold currently stands at $3,398.79 per ounce, reflecting its status as a traditional safe-haven asset and inflation hedge during periods of market or economic uncertainty. Gold prices are influenced by various factors, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical stability. Interest rates also play a role, with lower rates making non-yielding gold more attractive. Investors often turn to physical gold, such as bars and coins, as it has historically maintained its value over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Theory Places Parenting at the Core of Human Language Evolution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "The Origin of Language" by Madeleine Beekman, proposes that the prehistoric need for assistance in child-rearing was a primary catalyst for the development of human language. Beekman argues that the demands of vulnerable infants, combined with biological changes allowing for a wider range of sounds, drove early humans to develop complex communication. This theory challenges traditional male-dominated evolutionary perspectives by emphasizing familial care and cooperation. The article highlights how the intricate work of raising children may have pushed humans to discover new internal capacities and modes of connection, shaping our species in fundamental ways.</p>
