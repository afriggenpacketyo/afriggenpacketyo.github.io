          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who has a congenital disability affecting all four limbs, has described the UK's Houses of Parliament as largely inaccessible, hindering her ability to perform her duties effectively. Tidball points out numerous physical barriers, from difficult-to-use door handles and long distances to accessible toilets to the design of the Commons Chamber benches themselves. While some minor changes have been made and a modernization committee is reviewing the issues, she argues that significant improvements are needed to ensure Parliament reflects the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities. She advocates for a more inclusive environment for future disabled politicians and constituents.</p>

While declining to provide details, he described the experience as humbling and confirmed the injury was superficial, expressing gratitude that the situation wasn't more severe. Having been cleared for contact, Harris expects to play in the upcoming season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs, although coach Jim Harbaugh has described his participation as a "possibility." Harris is focused on his recovery and reintegration with the team.</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, is highlighted as a masterpiece of national park architecture and the largest log cabin in the world. Built in 1904 using uniquely twisted trees described as "freaks of the forest," the lodge established a rustic style that influenced the design of other famous park lodges across the United States. For over a century, it has hosted millions of visitors, including presidents and royalty, surviving natural disasters and the passage of time. The article emphasizes its historical significance and the ongoing efforts to preserve its unique, handcrafted character for future generations.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala unless they have a formal deportation order. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly preparing to take off, following an emergency request from lawyers who argued the government was circumventing legal protections for minors. The administration contended it was repatriating the children at the request of their families and the Guatemalan government, but the judge cited the rushed nature of the plan on a holiday weekend as justification for the "extraordinary" order. The decision halts the removal of hundreds of children.</p>

          <p>Fernando Goldsztein, whose son Frederico was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, has launched a global effort to find a cure after being told there were no further treatment options. He co-founded the Medulloblastoma Initiative (MBI), which unites over a dozen international labs to collaborate on research, breaking down traditional silos to accelerate progress. The initiative has successfully fast-tracked clinical trials, including one that programs a patient's own white blood cells to attack tumors, which has shown promising results. Fernando's mission is driven by the urgency of his son's condition and the need to save thousands of other children battling the rare cancer.</p>

Now independent from his former label, he discusses his new album, "A Wonderful Life," which explores personal vulnerability and anxiety amid global uncertainty.

          <p>Premier League clubs have set a new spending record during the summer transfer window, with a total outlay of £3.087 billion. This figure, driven by deadline-day deals like Alexander Isak's £125 million move to Liverpool, significantly surpasses last summer's £1.96 billion and is more than the combined spending of the top leagues in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. Liverpool led the spending with a record £415 million for a single club in one window. The article notes that this financial dominance is turning other major European leagues into "feeder leagues" for England's top flight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of Liverpool's unprecedented £415 million summer spending spree, a stark contrast to former manager Jurgen Klopp's previous comments about the club having "ceilings." The shift in transfer policy is attributed to a combination of factors, including a buildup of funds from a quiet previous window, significant commercial growth, and over £200 million in player sales. The club's recent Premier League title win under new manager Arne Slot also created a strategic moment to capitalize on their success and attract top talent. The tragic death of Diogo Jota also necessitated signing replacements, contributing to the record outlay.</p>

          <p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is earning early Oscar consideration for his transformative role as UFC fighter Mark Kerr in the new film "The Smashing Machine," which premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Johnson stated he had a "burning desire" to take on a more intense and raw role after years of feeling "pigeon-holed" by his blockbuster action-movie career. Early reviews praise his performance as a "revelation," noting his sincere and ego-less portrayal of the fighter's life, including his struggles with substance abuse. The film, directed by Benny Safdie, represents a significant dramatic departure for one of Hollywood's most bankable stars.</p>

          <p>A new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave over 60 years ago, to be at least 286,000 years old. Using advanced uranium-series dating techniques, researchers established a reliable minimum age, placing the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and resolving decades of conflicting estimates. The fossil, likely belonging to the species Homo heidelbergensis, suggests that more primitive human populations coexisted alongside emerging Neanderthals in southeastern Europe. This finding provides crucial context for the complex, branching history of human evolution in the region during that period.</p>
