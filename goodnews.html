          <p>Rising temperatures and extreme weather events are prompting significant shifts in holiday planning, with 81% of Europeans altering their travel arrangements due to climate change. Many are opting for destinations with milder weather or traveling during cooler months, leading to potential changes in the traditional "high season" for Mediterranean resorts. Destinations are adapting by investing in year-round tourism and offering indoor activities, while some regions are introducing climate crisis resilience taxes to support rebuilding efforts after climate-related disasters. The trend is also driving increased interest in staycations and less traditional European destinations like Scandinavia, as travelers seek alternatives to the increasingly hot Mediterranean summers. This article explores the changing trends in the travel industry and how the industry is adapting.</p>

          <p>Following controversy over singer Nezza performing the national anthem in Spanish at Dodger Stadium, the team clarified that she is welcome back and not banned. The incident occurred after a team employee asked Nezza to sing the anthem in English, but she proceeded with the Spanish version in solidarity with the Latino community amidst recent ICE raids. While initial reports suggested a ban, the Dodgers have since stated there are "no hard feelings" and she is welcome to perform again.

          <p>California farmers are experiencing confusion and uncertainty as the summer harvest season begins, due to contradictory signals from the Trump administration regarding immigration enforcement. Initial raids on farmworkers in Oxnard sparked widespread concern about potential labor shortages, prompting lobbying efforts from growers. President Trump initially appeared to respond by suggesting changes to immigration policies, but subsequent reversals have left farmers unsure of the administration's stance. Despite the uncertainty, workers have largely continued to show up for work, and employers are seeking guidance on how to protect their employees, highlighting an unusual alliance between farmers and worker advocates.</p>
