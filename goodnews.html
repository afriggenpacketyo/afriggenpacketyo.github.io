          <p>Bank of America announced mixed financial results for the second quarter, surpassing earnings expectations but falling short on revenue. The bank's profit saw a modest increase to $7.12 billion, while revenue grew to $26.61 billion, slightly below analyst predictions. A key factor was the net interest income, which missed estimates despite climbing for the fourth consecutive quarter amid loan and deposit growth. CEO Brian Moynihan highlighted consumer resilience and strong performance in the bank's markets businesses.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a notable upswing, with Bitcoin and Ether prices rising, driven by renewed investor optimism. This positive sentiment follows a temporary setback in the U.S. House, where key crypto-related bills, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, failed to advance. Despite the legislative snag, market analysts and a statement from President Trump suggest the bills will eventually pass, fueling a recovery in crypto-related stocks. The potential regulation is seen as a significant step toward legitimizing the digital asset ecosystem in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the differences between 401(k) plans and annuities as tools for retirement savings, highlighting their distinct approaches to financial security. A 401(k) offers investment growth potential and flexibility, but its value is subject to market performance. In contrast, an annuity provides a guaranteed income stream, shifting risk to an insurance company but often involving higher fees and less flexibility. For many retirees, a hybrid strategy that combines the growth potential of a 401(k) with the stable income of an annuity may offer a balanced approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. If passed, the legislation would create clear rules and consumer protections for the $250 billion market, potentially allowing banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins. Proponents argue this would enable faster, cheaper financial transactions, while critics point to risks such as the potential for stablecoins to lose their peg to the underlying asset. The bill is part of a broader push to provide clarity for the crypto industry.</p>

This innovative approach helps vulnerable populations cope with the economic impacts of climate change without requiring them to file complex claims.

          <p>Westinghouse's interim CEO, Dan Sumner, has announced a plan to construct ten new large-scale AP1000 nuclear reactors in the United States, with the goal of beginning construction by 2030. The announcement was made to President Donald Trump during a roundtable on energy and AI in Pittsburgh. This ambitious plan aligns with the Trump administration's executive orders aiming to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050. The project is projected to generate significant economic value, though it follows the troubled construction of the last two U.S. reactors, which faced major delays and cost overruns.</p>

          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, showed no change in June, coming in below economists' expectations of a 0.2% increase. This data suggests that inflationary pressures at the producer level may be moderating, providing a potential sign of relief for the broader economy. On a year-over-year basis, the headline PPI increased by 2.3%, its lowest level since September 2024. The flat reading, combined with other recent data, indicates that the impact of tariffs on U.S. prices has been marginal so far. (not investment advice)</p>

While national average rates for various terms are relatively low, online banks are offering significantly more competitive annual percentage yields (APYs), particularly on short-term CDs. The phenomenon of an "inverted yield curve" means that CDs with terms of one year or less often have higher rates than those with three or five-year terms.
