The facility employs over 2,000 specialists across 26 departments, including flight dispatch, crew scheduling, and an in-house meteorology team. These teams work around the clock to monitor and coordinate every aspect of the airline's network, proactively addressing potential disruptions like mechanical issues or weather delays.

          <p>The British and Irish governments have announced a new agreement to address legacy cases from the Northern Ireland Troubles, aiming to mend a diplomatic rift caused by the UK's controversial Legacy Act. As part of this "new framework," Ireland will pass legislation to ensure full cooperation with a reformed UK legacy body, which will be renamed the Legacy Commission. The deal also includes the establishment of a dedicated legacy unit within the Irish police force and a €25 million support fund for victims. This joint effort seeks to replace the previous UK law, which was widely opposed by victims' groups and political parties.</p>

This makes it the second-largest IPO in the city for the year, coming at a time when gold prices have surged nearly 40%. The offering has already attracted significant interest, with 29 cornerstone investors, including Singapore's GIC and private equity firm Hillhouse, subscribing to about half of the available shares. The strong demand reflects investor confidence in the gold market amid global economic uncertainty and a rush to safe-haven assets.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan has decided to keep its policy rate steady at 0.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision coincides with new data showing Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, fell to 2.7% in August, its lowest point since November 2024. While headline inflation has remained above the bank's 2% target for over three years, the central bank is maintaining a cautious stance amidst global uncertainty, prioritizing stability over premature tightening. Analysts note this strategy supports Japan's emerging reflationary cycle, contrasting with rate cuts in the U.S. and Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the San Francisco Giants 2-1, with their often-unreliable bullpen managing to protect a slim lead. Starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5⅓ scoreless innings but struggled with his command, issuing a career-high six walks before being pulled. The Dodgers' relievers, who have posted a high ERA in September, successfully navigated a tense seventh inning to preserve the win. This victory extends the Dodgers' lead in the National League West division to three games and provides a much-needed confidence boost for the team's relief corps heading into the final stretch of the season.</p>

The vehicles use high-pressure water jets to clear foliage and apply a sand-laced solution to improve wheel grip on the tracks.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has developed and publicly released a comprehensive global dataset and detection algorithm for ocean fronts, which are biodiversity hotspots crucial for fisheries. These fronts, where distinct bodies of water meet, facilitate a strong exchange of energy and nutrients, making them prime fishing grounds. The dataset covers the past 42 years and is expected to have significant applications in oceanography, ecology, and fisheries research. This free resource could provide a breakthrough for fishermen and researchers by helping them more effectively locate and study these productive marine areas.</p>

The funding was suspended amid allegations of campus antisemitism violations, endangering research on Parkinson's disease, cancer recovery, and nerve regeneration. U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin suggested the administration's "un-reasoned mass terminations" likely violated federal procedure by using generic form letters without specific justification.

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut could create more leeway for Asian central banks to implement their own easing policies. As the region grapples with trade headwinds and currency pressures, the Fed's signal of more reductions may allow countries to lower their rates without fearing significant capital flight. Some nations, like South Korea and Australia, had already cut rates to counter the effects of U.S. tariffs. However, economists note that policy will vary across the region, with countries like China and Japan defying the rate-cutting trend due to their unique domestic economic conditions.
