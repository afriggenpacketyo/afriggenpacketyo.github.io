          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 16:37:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has processed 2.5 million retroactive payments for public pension holders, addressing previous benefit restrictions under the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO). These payments are a result of the Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law by President Biden in January 2025, which aims to adjust benefits for 3.2 million individuals. Beneficiaries should have received a one-time retroactive payment by the end of March 2025, with new monthly benefits reflecting increases starting in April. Those who have not received their payments can check their account online or call the SSA to ensure their information is up-to-date. Optimism is present as most cases have been processed, but some complex cases will take longer. The article provides information about eligibility and how to apply for retirement benefits if one has not already done so.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 16:30:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court is considering a novel approach to protect federal civil servants from political firings by the Trump administration. Due to Trump's actions, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which safeguards civil servants, lacks a quorum and cannot operate. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals suggests that if the MSPB cannot fulfill its role, federal courts should step in to hear cases of illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole that has left civil servants unprotected, potentially challenging the "unitary executive" theory embraced by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Amazon has established a new group within its consumer product-development division, Lab126, focused on agentic artificial intelligence. This team will develop an agentic AI "framework" for use in its robotics operations, often referred to as "physical AI," enabling robots to understand and act on natural language commands. Amazon's AI lab previously released a web browser-based agent, and its cloud unit has also formed its own agentic AI group. The Alexa+ update is also expected to have some agentic capabilities.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on how Jacinda Ardern broke the typical political mold during her time as Prime Minister of New Zealand. It highlights her history-making win in 2017 and her decision to step away from power after leading New Zealand through numerous crises. Ardern's leadership style emphasized kindness and empathy, rejecting traditional approaches to politics. The article underscores her unique position as only the second woman elected to lead a country to give birth while in office.</p>

          <h2>Tariffs Could Reduce Deficit by $2.8 Trillion Over Decade, CBO Says</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congressional forecasters estimate that President Trump's tariffs could reduce the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion over the next decade if they remain in place. This could potentially offset the $2.4 trillion increase in the deficit projected from the House-passed budget bill. However, the forecast includes caveats, such as uncertainty about the impact of high taxes on imports and the potential for retaliatory measures. The tariffs are also projected to result in higher inflation and slower economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The museum purchased the rare artifact at auction and believes it was a "luxury souvenir" from a French brothel. The article details the condom's unique features and its historical context.</p>
