          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump underwent vascular testing due to mild swelling in his lower legs. According to the press secretary, the comprehensive examination revealed chronic venous insufficiency, which was described as a benign and common condition for his age. All test results, including an echocardiogram, were within normal limits, and there was no evidence of more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis. The administration stated that the president remains in excellent health and attributed minor bruising on his hand to frequent handshaking.</p>

          <p>The concept of long-term underwater living is gaining traction, moving from historical experiments like Jacques Cousteau's modules to modern, technologically advanced projects. British company DEEP is at the forefront, developing modular habitats like the Sentinel system, designed to support researchers for up to 28 days at depths of 656 feet. These innovations are making sustained human presence beneath the sea a more realistic possibility. Recent experiments have shown that extended underwater stays can even have positive health benefits, suggesting a new frontier for human exploration and scientific discovery.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Potential Political Impact of Lowering UK Voting Age to 16</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 13:55:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's plan to lower the voting age to 16 has sparked a debate about its potential political consequences. While polls suggest younger voters lean left, favoring parties like Labour and the Greens, experts caution that the actual impact on a general election may be negligible. Sixteen and 17-year-olds represent a small fraction of the electorate, and their turnout is uncertain. Furthermore, with the political landscape fracturing, their votes could be split among various parties, ultimately having a minimal effect on the overall outcome, though it could be decisive in tightly contested constituencies.</p>

          <p>A fire completely destroyed the main stage of the Tomorrowland electronic dance music festival in Belgium just one day before it was set to begin. Organizers have announced an ambitious plan to build a new stage in time for the event, which is expected to draw 400,000 attendees over two weekends. While the cause of the fire is under investigation, no one was injured. In the event a new stage is not ready, the festival will proceed with a revised schedule, demonstrating a resilient response to the significant setback.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The six largest U.S. banks reported a collective second-quarter profit of approximately $39 billion, exceeding analyst expectations and demonstrating surprising strength. This robust performance is attributed to a boom in stock and bond trading, a pickup in corporate mergers, and the continued resilience of American consumers. Despite initial market shocks from tariff announcements, banks like JPMorgan Chase saw a rebound in investment banking, suggesting that the corporate world is adapting to the uncertain environment. The results signal a 'soft landing' for the economy, at least for the time being.</p>

          <p>A mother and her nine-year-old son were successfully rescued after getting lost in a remote California forest when their GPS led them onto old logging roads. The pair, who were reported missing after failing to arrive at a Boy Scouts camp, left handwritten notes with "HELP" written on them, which were discovered by a volunteer search team. The notes guided rescuers to their location, where they were found safe in their stuck vehicle. Authorities praised the pair for their preparedness, including having supplies and staying put, which greatly aided in their recovery.</p>

          <p>Hadrian, a defense manufacturing startup, has successfully closed a $260 million Series C funding round led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Lux Capital. The company, which uses AI and robotics to automate factories for machine parts, plans to use the capital to build a large new factory in Arizona and expand its California operations. Hadrian aims to disrupt the traditional defense contracting industry by supercharging American workers with technology, which it claims can make them ten times more productive. The investment reflects growing demand for advanced, U.S.-based defense production capabilities.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement about Coca-Cola, health experts are weighing in on the differences between cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup. While their chemical compositions are slightly different, with corn syrup having a higher fructose content, experts state that both have similar negative health impacts when consumed in excess. Some research suggests high-fructose corn syrup may be linked to higher levels of inflammation. Ultimately, dietitians emphasize that both are empty-calorie added sugars, and the key to good health is to limit the consumption of both.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Repeal of Some Green-Energy Subsidies is a Positive Step for Tax Reform</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent repeal of many green-energy subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act is a positive development for the economy. The author contends that such subsidies distort the tax code, misallocate capital, and favor established companies over new innovators, leading to cronyism rather than true energy abundance. While acknowledging that some fossil-fuel subsidies also exist and should be eliminated, the piece asserts that green-energy subsidies are vastly larger in scale. The partial rollback is presented as a significant victory against special-interest politics.</p>
