          <p>UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond discussed the university's plans following the House settlement agreement, which allows direct payments to athletes. UCLA will allocate $20.5 million in revenue sharing while preserving Olympic sports programs and staff. Scholarship limits will remain at current levels for at least a year to provide a larger share of revenue to each player. The athletic department aims to reallocate staff to better serve the program's needs in the changing landscape of college sports, with a focus on securing NIL opportunities for athletes in the Los Angeles market.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren is seeking information from Secretary of State Marco Rubio regarding contingency plans for national security in light of the public fallout between President Trump and Elon Musk. Warren expressed concern that their disagreements could impact U.S. national security, particularly concerning SpaceX and Starlink. She requested details on the potential impact on U.S. agencies' satellite communications if Starlink were to be turned off. Warren also asked for an analysis of the administration's authorities under the Defense Production Act to address vendor lock, monopolies, or contractor refusal to meet national security needs.</p>

          <p>Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, has taken her first flight from the nest. After some initial hesitation, Gizmo successfully soared into the air, joining her sister Sunny, who fledged earlier in the week. Both eaglets, born in March, have been practicing for their first flights for several days. While it is unclear where they will go, young eagles typically return to the nest soon after their first flight before eventually leaving on their own in the fall.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Edwards and Nat Sciver-Brunt secured a clean sweep over the West Indies in their first series as head coach and captain, respectively. While the victory provides a positive start, it comes with caution, as England has historically dominated home series but struggled in major tournaments. World Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley notes that England is in a "good place" due to their dominant wins, but questions whether this series indicates a change in their ability to perform under pressure. Tougher tests await, including a series against India and the 50-over World Cup.</p>
