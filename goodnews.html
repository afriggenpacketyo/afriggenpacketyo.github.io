          <p>Walmart cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on China, the company may soon be forced to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that President Trump's trade levies are hindering Walmart's ability to maintain low prices, despite the retailer's efforts to absorb some costs. The price hikes are expected to take effect later this month, joining other large retailers in warning about increased prices due to tariffs. Walmart also pulled its quarterly profit outlook amid global economic uncertainty, reporting a decrease in earnings compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy uncertainties. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, citing the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks. He cautioned that policy changes could create a difficult balancing act for the Fed between supporting employment and controlling inflation. While not directly mentioning President Trump's tariffs, Powell has previously noted their potential to slow growth and boost inflation.</p>

          <p>The UK economy is 'beginning to turn a corner' after growing more than expected in the first three months of the year, according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The 0.7% growth in the January-to-March period was attributed to increased consumer spending and business investment. However, analysts warn that the strong rate of growth is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. The Labour government aims to boost the economy but faces criticism over its decision to increase employers' National Insurance contributions.</p>

Dramatic key changes are now discouraged, but going all-out on staging with fire or pyrotechnics is beneficial.

          <p>The New York Times reports that the recent US-UK trade agreement, aimed at increasing American agricultural exports to Britain, faces challenges due to differing food production standards. While the US Secretary of Agriculture promotes the agreement, British consumers are wary of American meat, citing concerns over hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken. British regulations emphasize animal welfare and environmental protections, leading to higher costs and public resistance to changing these standards.

          <p>A new analysis from the National Association of Realtors reveals that homeownership is increasingly out of reach for middle-income families due to a shortage of affordable homes. Only about 1 in 5 listed homes are affordable for households earning $75,000 annually, a significant drop from pre-pandemic levels. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes beyond the price range of middle-class households. The lack of affordable homes is partly responsible for driving up prices, as buyers bid up prices to secure properties.</p>

However, proposed cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis, could jeopardize this progress.

          <p>House Republicans, particularly those from New York, are in conflict with party leadership over raising or abolishing the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The SALT deduction has become a major obstacle for Republicans trying to pass a tax proposal that extends President Trump's 2017 tax cuts. Some Republicans from high-tax states insist on raising the cap to provide relief to their constituents, while others oppose it. The House Ways and Means Committee approved a measure to raise the cap to $30,000, but the issue remains unresolved.</p>
