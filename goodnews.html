          <p>President Trump announced he "made progress" on a deal concerning TikTok's ownership during a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. In a social media post, Trump stated he would visit China early next year and that the two leaders would first meet at the upcoming APEC Summit in South Korea. The conversation comes as the White House navigates a federal law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest from the app or face a US ban, a law Trump has repeatedly delayed enforcing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and China over TikTok's ownership may center on a licensing agreement for the app's highly valued recommendation algorithm. This approach could resolve the stalemate, as Chinese law prohibits the export of such technology without government approval, while US officials have national security concerns about Chinese access to user data. Experts suggest a deal might involve a U.S. entity effectively 'renting' the algorithm, but questions remain about whether this would fully sever ties with its Chinese parent company, ByteDance.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B has released her highly anticipated sophomore album, "Am I The Drama?", her first full-length project since her 2018 debut. The album features bracingly honest lyrics that address her recent divorce from rapper Offset and her ongoing public feud with fellow rapper Bia. Critics have generally praised the record for its witty and vigorous lyrical content, though some have noted that its 23-song tracklist makes for an overly long listening experience.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran has expressed a minority view on the Federal Open Market Committee, stating he is not concerned that President Trump's tariffs will have a significant inflationary effect on the U.S. economy. Miran, who was the lone dissenter in the recent rate-cut decision, argued for a larger half-point reduction and cited a lack of evidence that tariffs are driving up prices for import-intensive goods. He believes other factors, such as immigration policy changes, could have a more disinflationary impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Rate Cut Reduces Monthly Costs for Home Equity Lines of Credit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 12:24:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent interest rate reduction by the Federal Reserve has made borrowing cheaper for homeowners, specifically lowering the monthly payments on Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). An analysis shows that a $50,000 HELOC is now significantly less expensive than it was in previous months, providing financial relief for those tapping into their home's equity. Unlike fixed-rate home equity loans, HELOCs have variable rates that adjust automatically, allowing borrowers to benefit from the current cooler rate climate without needing to refinance.

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Donald Trump's suggestion that the military should be used to stop asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle clarified that the UK Border Force is specifically tasked with policing the nation's borders and has been reinforced with new powers. He emphasized that the military's primary focus must remain on national defense, particularly given the current global security landscape, rather than being diverted to handle illegal migration.</p>

          <p>Amid heightened scrutiny over the Federal Reserve's political independence, newly confirmed Governor Stephen Miran stated that President Trump did not pressure him on how to vote in this week's interest rate decision. Miran told CNBC that he had a brief congratulatory call with the president but did not discuss his policy vote. He affirmed that his dissenting vote in favor of a larger rate cut was his own independent decision, and he described the atmosphere at his first FOMC meeting as collegial and welcoming.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a drop to a three-year low, mortgage rates could fall further by the end of 2025, depending on future Federal Reserve actions and inflation trends. Market analysts predict that if the Fed continues its rate-cutting campaign, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage could potentially settle in the high 5% range. Such a decline would offer substantial monthly savings for homebuyers and could further energize the housing market, though experts caution that persistent economic concerns could limit how far rates can actually drop.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new Jordan Peele-produced horror film "Him" explores the intense, almost religious devotion of football culture through a satanic lens. Starring Marlon Wayans as a legendary but sinister quarterback who mentors a rising star, the movie is praised for its stunning visual style, menacing production design, and a thundering musical score. However, critics suggest the film's stylish execution cannot fully compensate for an underdeveloped plot and a passive main character, leaving its ideas about pain and devotion feeling half-formed.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified aerospace giant Boeing as his "new favorite stock," advising investors to buy it aggressively during its recent pullback in share price. Despite his bullish stance on Boeing, Cramer issued a broader market warning, expressing concern over the rising 10-year Treasury yield. He cautioned that if long-term yields do not come down, they could create significant headwinds for many stocks, similar to the market pressures seen last fall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is implementing new strategies to attract the energy trade it lost during recent years of severe drought. Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking slot system for liquified natural gas (LNG) carriers and are developing an ambitious "Interoceanic Energy Corridor" pipeline project. This pipeline would transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus, freeing up canal transit slots and providing energy companies with a more efficient alternative for moving their products between the Atlantic and Pacific.</p>

Speaking at the new phone's launch, Cook was clear that tariffs were not a factor in the price change. To mitigate the impact of trade levies, Apple has been actively diversifying its supply chain, increasing production in countries such as India and Vietnam to reduce its reliance on China.</p>

This is part of a multi-year deal between Major League Baseball and the streaming service for a package of Friday night games, which has previously meant other historic moments were also not available on traditional television.</p>
