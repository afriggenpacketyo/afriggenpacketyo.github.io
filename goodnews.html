        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new impact assessment suggests that assisted dying cases in England and Wales could exceed 4,000 per year within a decade if MPs vote to legalize it. The report estimates initial savings for the NHS but also substantial costs for staffing and training, with each case involving multiple healthcare professionals. The government remains neutral on the issue, while proponents emphasize the importance of choice and compassion, opponents raise concerns about risks to vulnerable individuals. The bill is set to return to the House of Commons for a crucial vote later this month.</p>

          <p>Singapore held its general election, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong facing his first major test against a rejuvenated opposition. The ruling People's Action Party (PAP) is expected to retain power, but the opposition hopes to increase its representation in Parliament. Key issues include the potential impact of US tariffs on Singapore's exports and rising living costs. The PAP highlights its efforts to address cost of living concerns, while the opposition calls for greater scrutiny and alternative voices in government.</p>

          <p>Australian voters are participating in a general election to decide who will address inflation, housing affordability, and relations with the United States. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton are focusing on cost-of-living issues, with voters expressing concerns about rising prices. While global turmoil and the U.S. election loom, voters prioritize bread-and-butter issues, leading both parties to offer small-scale economic measures. The election also reflects a shift away from major parties towards independent candidates.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snake species. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's efforts could lead to a universal antivenom. He endured over 200 bites and 700 injections of venom from some of the world's deadliest snakes, driven by a desire to develop better therapies for snakebite victims.</p>
