          <p>China is reportedly easing export restrictions on rare earth elements for U.S. and European auto manufacturers, offering a "green channel" for export license applications. This move follows warnings from industry groups about potential production disruptions due to a rare earth shortage. China's Ministry of Commerce expressed hope for reciprocal steps from the EU to promote compliant trade of high-tech products. The restrictions were initially imposed in response to U.S. tariffs, impacting components critical for both combustion engines and electric vehicles. While this is a positive development, uncertainty remains regarding the scope and implementation of the expedited approval process, and the EU will likely be pushed to increase diversification of supply chains.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced a goal to boost Japan's economy to 1,000 trillion yen in nominal terms by 2040. This target, included in a pledge for this summer's nationwide election, represents a significant increase from the current nominal GDP of around 600 trillion yen. Ishiba also aims to achieve over 50 percent growth in average income within the same timeframe, prioritizing wage growth that consistently outpaces inflation. The announcement comes as major political parties seek to attract voters with campaign promises, with opposition parties advocating for consumption tax reductions to alleviate inflation's impact on households. This goal reflects Japan's ambition to revitalize its economy and improve living standards amidst global economic challenges (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A Chinese military drone factory has successfully replaced master technicians with robots in the production of carbon-fiber drone bodies. The robots, equipped with real-time sensors, perform drilling tasks with greater speed and precision, reducing errors to a mere 0.04-0.1mm. This breakthrough from the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) has transformed the production line, increasing efficiency and lowering costs. The shift reflects a global trend towards unmanned and intelligent military operations, as highlighted by CAST researchers. This transformation challenges traditional stereotypes of Chinese manufacturing, showcasing advanced automation and technological innovation.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly considering Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new head coach following the dismissal of Ange Postecoglou. Brentford anticipates a formal approach from Tottenham for Frank, who has successfully led the team into the Premier League and established them as a top-flight club. Appointing Frank would require Tottenham to pay Brentford compensation, potentially exceeding ¬£10 million. Postecoglou's departure followed a disappointing Premier League season, despite leading the team to victory in the Europa League final.

The city aims to plant 2,000 trees annually, focusing on drought-tolerant species.
