          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, has won the 100th Scripps National Spelling Bee, after being last year's runner-up. The competition was tight, with multiple finalists misspelling words in the final rounds, adding to the drama. Faizan won by correctly spelling "√©claircissement," a word meaning a clearing up of something obscure. The first National Spelling Bee was held in 1925, and this year's winner marks the 110th champion due to ties in previous years.</p>
