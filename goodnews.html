          <p>Robert Eugene Brashers, a deceased serial killer and perpetrator of multiple sexual assaults and murders, has been identified as a suspect in the infamous 1991 Austin, Texas, yogurt shop murders. Retired detective John Jones, an original investigator, revealed the connection was made through DNA evidence, specifically a bullet casing found in the shop's drain consistent with the gun Brashers used to die by suicide in 1999. This significant breakthrough offers a potential resolution to the brutal killings of four teenage girls, a cold case that has remained unsolved for over three decades despite previous arrests, overturned convictions, and extensive investigative efforts. The identification provides a crucial step towards long-awaited closure for the victims' families.</p>

          <p>Europe has established a commanding three-point lead against the USA on the opening day of the Ryder Cup in New York, marking their first such lead on American soil in 21 years. Captain Luke Donald's team dominated, winning two out of two sessions and securing five of the first six matches. Despite US captain Keegan Bradley's defiant stance, Europe's strong performance, highlighted by Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood, positions them as strong favorites for the upcoming Saturday foursomes. The visitors are clearly delighted with their early momentum, while the US team faces considerable pressure and internal criticism regarding their captain's strategic decisions.</p>

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, analysts are examining how Hong Kong's crucial role as a "superconnector" between the mainland and global markets could evolve. Despite previous doubts about its resilience, Hong Kong has recently experienced a rising stock index, a surge in fundraising, and growing appeal to international businesses and talent. Raymond Yeung, Chief Economist for Greater China at ANZ, emphasizes that Hong Kong's specific position within this national blueprint will directly dictate the policies and resources Beijing allocates to the special administrative region. The city's economic trajectory has historically been, and will continue to be, significantly shaped by Beijing's high-level policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>
