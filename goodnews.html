          <p>South Korea's new progressive president, Lee Jae-myung, is expected to take a more cautious approach to Taiwan and prioritize strengthening economic ties with China. This shift follows the impeachment of his predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, and signals a potential change in Seoul's foreign policy. While Lee's party is viewed as more amicable towards China and North Korea, analysts anticipate continued trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan. Under Yoon, South Korea emphasized its alliance with the US and expressed concerns about Chinese military activities in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>While individual efforts to optimize health are important, public health scientist Devi Sridhar argues that public policy, infrastructure, and community factors play a more significant role in longevity. Sridhar emphasizes the need for policies that promote nutritious food, active cities, clean air, preventive healthcare, and public provision of water. She contrasts the focus on individual responsibility in countries like the UK with the government and culturally supported healthy lifestyles in places like Japan.

          <p>Facing public concerns over rising rice prices, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is targeting Japan's rice policy, a politically sensitive agricultural issue. Rice prices have doubled, prompting Ishiba to consider overhauling the production adjustment system. The aim is to boost rice production and counter opposition parties advocating for consumption tax cuts. While Ishiba has long prioritized rice policy reform, challenges remain, including the risk of price drops due to oversupply.</p>

          <p>Labubu, a monster character created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, has become a global hit, driven by celebrity endorsements and strategic marketing. The rabbit-like plush toy, sold in "blind boxes," has attracted a large following, with limited-edition items reselling for high prices. The success of Labubu reflects China's transformation in the toy market, shifting from subcontracting to creating original products.
