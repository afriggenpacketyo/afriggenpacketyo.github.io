The company also raised its full-year outlook, reflecting confidence in its value-driven model amid ongoing inflation and tariffs, as it sources 90% of goods from third parties.

During his Asia tour, Wadephul expressed optimism about the latest push for negotiations, acknowledging U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to bring Russian President Vladimir Putin to the table. However, he noted Putin's current reluctance to commit to talks, warning that continued refusal would lead to further sanctions from Europe and the U.S. Wadephul also connected the Ukraine conflict to broader global stability, including the Taiwan Strait, and discussed Germany's strategy to diversify trade partners away from China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New robotic technology is significantly enhancing the efficiency of solar farm construction, even as government support for renewable energy projects wanes. California-based Civ Robotics has developed CivDot, a four-wheeled robot capable of marking up to 3,000 layout points daily with high precision, even on rugged terrain and in adverse weather. This innovation streamlines the meticulous planning and surveying required for solar farms, saving considerable time and labor costs compared to manual methods. The technology is primarily used by renewable energy companies, with over 100 robots currently deployed, demonstrating its impactful role in modern infrastructure development.</p>

However, their initial actions also included the controversial sacking of manager Derek Adams, replacing him with a 30-year-old youth coach. The new ownership is now focused on rebuilding the squad and preparing for the upcoming season, with urgent preparations underway to ensure Saturday's match proceeds.</p>

          <p>The film "Lurker," directed by Alex Russell, is a dramedy that delves into the tense and cutthroat world surrounding a rising emo-pop musician, Oliver, and his entourage. The story centers on Matthew, an obsessive fan who cleverly infiltrates Oliver's inner circle, only to find himself in a paranoid power struggle with other "friends-slash-employees." The article highlights the film's sharp commentary on modern fame culture, the pretense of nonchalance, and the blurred lines between authenticity and manufactured brand. It questions what truly separates a real artist from a fake in today's image-first industry.</p>

          <p>Six individuals, including prominent rhino breeder John Hume, have been arrested in South Africa in connection with a $14.1 million international rhino horn trafficking network. This follows a seven-year investigation into the smuggling of 964 horns to illegal markets in Southeast Asia. The suspects face charges including fraud and theft, violating South Africa's biodiversity law which prohibits horn export despite legal domestic trade. Hume, former owner of the world's largest rhino conservation farm, had previously sparked controversy by auctioning horns to prevent poaching. Conservation groups like Save the Rhino praised the arrests as crucial for disrupting organized crime.</p>

          <p>Over 30 major crypto firms have urged the U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves to establish a national stablecoin strategy, emphasizing the need to embrace the technology responsibly and avoid falling behind the U.S. The open letter argues that a proactive strategy would strengthen the U.K.'s role as a global financial center and generate new revenue streams. Industry insiders criticize Britain's current regulatory definition of stablecoins as too focused on "form rather than function." While stablecoins offer a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets, regulatory issues remain the biggest hurdle to their broader adoption. (not investment advice)</p>
