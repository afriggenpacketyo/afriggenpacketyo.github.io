          <p>A previously overlooked manuscript in Harvard Law School's library has been identified as an original 1300 version of the Magna Carta, a foundational document for modern liberties. Two British academics authenticated the manuscript, which was purchased for a mere $27.50 after World War II, using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging. The discovery is particularly timely given the ongoing pressures faced by Harvard from the Trump administration, underscoring the document's enduring relevance in safeguarding against unjust rule. This finding brings the total number of extant original copies from 1300 to seven, highlighting the significance of preserving historical artifacts.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the key elements that contribute to winning performances at the Eurovision Song Contest. It suggests that successful acts often sing about personal liberation, preferably in English, and incorporate elements of folk music without being strictly folk songs. The article also highlights the importance of elaborate staging, including the use of fire and pyrotechnics, while cautioning against novelty acts and dramatic key changes. The piece uses past winners as examples to illustrate these points, offering a guide for future Eurovision hopefuls.</p>

          <p>According to a Communist Party journal, China possesses the financial capabilities to establish a market stabilization fund, which would help mitigate volatility stemming from global economic uncertainties and trade tensions. The article emphasizes the importance of such a fund in protecting investors and preventing systemic financial risks, especially in light of aggressive trade tactics employed by the US. The journal highlights Hong Kong's successful interventions during the 1997 Asian financial crisis as a model for effective market stabilization.</p>

          <p>Shao Chun Chen, a 39-year-old former Google employee, now lives in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and "supercommutes" to Singapore once a week to teach a three-hour digital marketing class at the National University of Singapore. Chen realized he was financially independent after a layoff, having built a seven-figure investment portfolio over nearly a decade. He now earns enough from his teaching job to cover his living expenses in Thailand, taking advantage of geographical arbitrage and a lower cost of living. He also supplements his income through YouTube content creation and coaching, working a total of four to eight hours per week.</p>

          <p>Three House committees advanced major legislation aimed at enacting President Trump's domestic agenda, including cuts to taxes, Medicaid, and food assistance. The votes, which followed lengthy drafting sessions, represent a significant step towards passing the "big beautiful bill" through the House. However, Republican leaders are facing dissent within their party, with conservative lawmakers arguing the proposed cuts are insufficient and Republicans from high-tax states expressing concerns about the state and local tax deduction. The plan also faces Republican opposition in the Senate.</p>

The judge refuted the government's claims he had ties to Hamas through his wife, whose father was a government official in Gaza.

The revival of the thrusters, which had been out of action since 2004, ensures that the probe can maintain its orientation and continue sending data back to Earth. The team had to take a risk by switching Voyager 1 to its primary roll thrusters and turning them on before attempting to fix and restart the heaters.</p>
