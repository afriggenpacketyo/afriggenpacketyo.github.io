        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article profiles the challenging journey of Indian cricketer Akash Deep, who recently achieved a five-wicket haul against England. Hailing from a small village in Bihar, he overcame significant personal tragedy, including the deaths of his father and brother, which forced him to temporarily abandon the sport to support his family. After relocating to Bengal, his raw talent was recognized, and with mentorship, he honed his skills, eventually earning a spot in the IPL and the national Test squad. His recent on-field success is dedicated to his sister, who is battling cancer.</p>

          <p>The European Union is launching a major initiative to build AI "gigawatt factories" to bolster its competitive standing against the U.S. and China in artificial intelligence. These facilities are designed to be one-stop ecosystems combining computing power, data, and talent to accelerate AI development for startups and researchers. The EU has committed an initial €20 billion and has received significant interest from member states, aiming to overcome obstacles like limited computing capacity. However, challenges remain, including securing massive private investment and addressing the enormous power consumption required for such large-scale operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Volunteer crew members for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) are defending their life-saving operations in the English Channel amid accusations of acting as a "taxi service" for migrants. The charity emphasizes its humanitarian duty to rescue anyone in distress at sea, regardless of their circumstances, as directed by the Coastguard. Crew members shared harrowing accounts of rescues, including pulling 19 people from the water after their dinghy capsized, to highlight the human reality of their work. They maintain their focus is on compassion and saving lives, not politics.</p>

          <p>For the first time, India has overtaken China as the top exporter of smartphones to the U.S., according to new market research. In the second quarter, Indian-assembled smartphones accounted for 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year. This shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to diversify its manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade tensions and tariff uncertainties. While other manufacturers like Samsung and Motorola are also increasing production in India, Apple's move has been the most significant factor in this manufacturing realignment.

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on South Korea to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling" in his first official communication with his new counterpart, Cho Hyun. The discussion reflects Beijing's effort to reset relations with Seoul's new administration, which is perceived as less aligned with the U.S. than its predecessor. Both ministers affirmed a commitment to advancing their strategic partnership in a stable and mature manner. The call signals a potential thaw in relations and a desire for pragmatic cooperation between the two neighboring countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate and looming demographic crisis, the Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy for parents. The policy offers families an annual payment of 3,600 yuan ($500) for each child under the age of three, a program expected to benefit around 20 million families. This move follows various local initiatives and comes as China faces the reality of being one of the world's most expensive places to raise a child. Official figures show China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, intensifying concerns about its aging workforce.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has reportedly placed new orders for 300,000 of its H20 AI chipsets with manufacturer TSMC, driven by robust demand from China. This move comes after the Trump administration reversed a ban and allowed sales of the H20, a GPU specifically designed for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export restrictions. The new orders suggest a change in strategy for Nvidia, which had previously indicated it might rely on existing inventory. The company still requires export licenses from the U.S. government, which have not yet been approved, highlighting the chip's key role in U.S.-China trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a masterful performance in a 5-2 win against the Cincinnati Reds, signaling a strong return to his early-season form.

After a brief mid-season slump, Yamamoto has been dominant in his recent starts, showcasing a versatile mix of pitches that kept the Reds' offense off balance. His performance is a key part of what the Dodgers hope will be a stretch of strong starting pitching as they head into the latter part of the season.</p>

The interactions, which included a free-wheeling press Q&A, highlighted the unique and often unpredictable nature of Trump's diplomacy. For Starmer, this proximity offers a chance to build a solid relationship but also carries the risk of being associated with the president's off-the-cuff style. Downing Street appears to view the access as a net positive, particularly in aligning views on critical issues like the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>
