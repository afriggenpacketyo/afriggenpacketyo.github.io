          <p>JPMorgan Chase is introducing new tools to its mobile app that will allow investors to research and purchase bonds and brokered certificates of deposit. This move is part of the bank's strategy to attract more investors and increase its assets under management, with a target of reaching $1 trillion. The updated app will enable users to compare bond yields and set up customized screens, simplifying the process of buying fixed-income products similar to purchasing stocks and ETFs. While JPMorgan is a leader in many areas of finance, it lags behind online investing giants like Charles Schwab and Fidelity, making this a significant step in its efforts to compete in the online brokerage space.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Offer in Compromise (OIC) program is a tax relief option offered by the IRS that allows eligible taxpayers to settle their tax debt for a lower amount than what they originally owe. To qualify, taxpayers must demonstrate an inability to pay their full tax bill without facing financial hardship. The IRS assesses eligibility based on factors such as the taxpayer's ability to pay, income, expenses, and asset equity, and the application process involves substantial paperwork and documentation, including financial statements and supporting documents. The IRS accepts less than half of all applications, making it essential for applicants to be honest, patient, and well-prepared, and it is advisable to consult with a tax professional to navigate the complexities of the process.

          <p>Kroger's shares experienced a significant rise after the supermarket chain increased its full-year sales outlook, driven by consumers seeking lower prices and opting to cook at home more often. The company now anticipates identical sales growth between 2.25% and 3.25%, surpassing previous expectations, as shoppers increasingly purchase store brands and promotional items. Despite challenges such as a blocked acquisition of Albertsons and leadership changes, Kroger is focusing on catering to value-conscious customers by simplifying promotions and lowering prices on over 2,000 products. Kroger's private label brands, particularly Simple Truth and Private Selection, have also been key growth drivers, and the company is planning to launch new protein products to capitalize on health trends.

Circle's market capitalization has increased significantly since its initial public offering, reflecting growing investor interest in stablecoins due to potential regulatory clarity and their use in faster, cheaper payments.

          <p>As the cost of higher education continues to rise, securing student loans with the best rates is crucial for managing expenses. Federal undergraduate loan rates are decreasing slightly for the 2025-2026 academic year, offering some relief. To obtain the lowest possible rates, it's advisable to start with federal loans first, then compare options among private lenders, optimizing your credit profile before applying, and considering using a cosigner. Taking advantage of rate discounts and incentives, along with opting for shorter repayment terms, can further reduce borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing a new national priority voucher plan aimed at significantly reducing drug review times for companies supporting "U.S. national interests." This initiative seeks to cut review times to one to two months by allowing companies to submit drug applications before final clinical trial results are available. The FDA plans to issue a limited number of vouchers in the program's first year, focusing on companies addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, meeting unmet public health needs, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing. While the plan aims to accelerate the availability of treatments, concerns remain about the potential risks of expedited reviews and whether vouchers will be offered based on political considerations.</p>

Silver has risen from $28.92 per ounce to $37.12 per ounce since January, marking a 28% increase. While silver isn't necessarily a "better" investment than gold, it can be more attractive for certain investors due to its lower entry price point, its ability to hedge against inflation, and its portfolio diversification benefits. Investors may find that silver is worth a second look due to powerful demand for industry usage in items like solar panels. (not investment advice)</p>
