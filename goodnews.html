          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 16:24:49 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump announced he wants to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the U.S., which came after a meeting with actor Jon Voight, who presented a plan to "rescue" the American film industry with federal tax incentives. Trump later appeared to hedge on his initial plan, saying he wants to meet with entertainment business leaders to ensure they're happy with his plan to bring back movie jobs. The announcement has led to speculation in the film industry and caused stock shares of major entertainment companies to dip briefly, though some labor unions have applauded the idea.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

They urged the secretary to ensure that IHS programs have the necessary resources and staffing to fulfill their missions, and to halt any further actions affecting Tribal health care delivery without meaningful Tribal consultation.</p>

The Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) declined to comment on the article, but told Danish media that it had "naturally" taken note of US interest in Greenland.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares rose on Wednesday following a report that the Trump administration plans to rescind the "AI diffusion" rule, which restricts chip exports. The rule, proposed in the last days of the Biden administration, organizes countries into different tiers with varying restrictions on shipping advanced AI chips. Chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD have opposed the rule, with Nvidia's CEO stating that being locked out of the Chinese AI market would be a "tremendous loss." AMD's CEO has said the U.S. should strike a balance between restricting access to chips for national security and providing access to boost the American chip industry.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Neurology found that people who consumed a lot of ultraprocessed foods were more likely to develop early signs of Parkinson's disease, such as constipation, sleep disturbances, and reduced ability to smell. The study analyzed diet questionnaire data from nearly 43,000 health professionals over several decades. Researchers suggest that certain additives in ultraprocessed foods or chemicals in their packaging may cause inflammation or cell damage that harms brain cells. Experts recommend focusing on a diet rich in whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and legumes to reduce the risk.</p>

Specifically, should you renew your maturing CD account if rate cuts look likely? In many circumstances, it can still be the smart and cost-effective move. The rate cut trajectory could easily change, so avoiding a high-rate CD account on a "maybe," particularly when rates are still available close to 5% now, doesn't make sense for savers.</p>
