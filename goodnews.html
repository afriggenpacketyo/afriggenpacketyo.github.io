          <p>The Japanese government is planning to increase rice exports to counter a projected long-term decline in domestic consumption, according to the annual white paper on food and agriculture for fiscal 2024. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is recommending exploring new overseas markets and supporting more efficient production. Target markets include China, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and the government aims to increase rice exports nearly eightfold by 2030. This strategy is part of a broader effort to reach record agricultural exports, but the government is also introducing measures to curb soaring domestic prices, driven in part by shortages.</p>

          <p>Paris will deploy 5,400 police officers for the UEFA Champions League final between Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan, even though the match is being held in Munich. The deployment is in anticipation of potential celebrations in Paris should PSG win, which could lead to public disturbances. Following an incident in Liverpool where a car struck soccer fans, traffic around the Arc de Triomphe will be blocked, and the Champs-√âlys√©es boulevard will be closed. This increased security is also a response to previous unrest in Paris after PSG's victory over Arsenal, which resulted in numerous arrests and injuries.</p>

          <p>A Harris's hawk that had been attacking residents of Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has found a permanent home with a local falconer. The hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," was responsible for dive-bombing attacks on approximately 50 people, leading to injuries and disrupted postal deliveries. Falconer Wayne Housden captured and trained the bird, noting that its behavior was likely due to hormonal or territorial reasons. Housden has built an aviary for the hawk and plans to include it in the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival, ensuring the bird will not be abandoned again.</p>

At age 12, Musk created a video game called Blastar, and later, he co-founded Zip2, which sold for $300 million. Musk also launched a perfume called Burnt Hair and was the original founder of X.com, which later became PayPal. His life and personality inspired Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark, and while he didn't start Tesla, he propelled it onto the global stage.

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Dallas, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee, overcoming a shocking moment of overconfidence. After finishing as runner-up last year, Faizan was the favorite but nearly jeopardized his chances by prematurely attempting to spell "commelina" without asking clarifying questions. Despite the error, he recovered and correctly spelled the winning word, "eclaircissement." Faizan's joyful and enthusiastic approach to spelling, in contrast to more traditional, stoic spellers, made him a memorable champion, despite his near-miss. The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the vital role of UK saltmarshes in locking away climate-warming greenhouse gases in layers of mud. Saltmarshes, which have been significantly reduced due to agriculture, are recognized as important "sinks" for carbon dioxide. The charity is advocating for these tidal habitats to be included in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. Research conducted on Hesketh Out Marsh revealed that plants absorb more carbon dioxide in the summer than they release in the winter, underscoring the importance of preserving and restoring these ecosystems.</p>

CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential multibillion-dollar licensing agreements for its drug candidates, including a targeted cancer therapy, with potential payments reaching up to US$5 billion per candidate.

          <p>Mary Earps' recent international retirement has sparked reflection on her journey and legacy in women's goalkeeping. From juggling multiple part-time jobs in the amateur era to becoming a global brand, Earps has helped transform the perception of women's goalkeeping. Her presence on the pitch and willingness to embrace platforms like TikTok have made her an influential figure. Earps aims to leave the game in a better place, making goalkeeping "cool" and inspiring others through her resilience and success.</p>

          <p>The SEC has formally dismissed its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the last major crypto enforcement actions initiated by the agency. The original complaint, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal marks a symbolic end to aggressive crypto crackdowns and coincides with the Trump administration's pro-crypto stance. Binance has recently forged ties with World Liberty Financial, a crypto bank project linked to the Trump family.</p>
