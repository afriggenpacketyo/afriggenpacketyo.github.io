          <p>After more than a week on the run, eight of the ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans have been apprehended. The inmates escaped by climbing through a hole behind a toilet, leading to a massive manhunt and the arrest of seven people suspected of aiding their escape. Authorities have commended the collaboration between local, state, and federal agencies in the successful capture of the escapees, who now face additional charges related to the escape itself. Two fugitives remain at large as the investigation continues, with authorities urging anyone with information to come forward.</p>

His winning film, depicting torture in Iranian jails, has sparked a diplomatic row between French and Iranian officials, with France praising it as resistance against oppression. Upon his return, Panahi was met with cheers and flowers, with some shouting "woman, life, freedom," the slogan of protests following Mahsa Amini's death in 2022. Panahi's return fulfills a pledge he made at Cannes, where he emphasized the importance of freedom for his country.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits rose for the second consecutive month in April, with cumulative profits climbing 3% compared to the previous year, despite U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures. The growth was bolstered by stronger earnings in equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors. Despite recent trade tensions, Chinese exports have found other markets, minimizing the impact of tariffs. The profit growth is attributed to the industrial sectors' resilience and ability to withstand shocks, though concerns persist about insufficient demand and external uncertainty.

          <p>The Japanese government has allocated 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize household and business energy bills during the summer, addressing inflation partly caused by U.S. tariffs. The subsidies are part of a larger relief package to counter the adverse economic impact of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The measures aim to reduce household energy bills and support small and medium-sized companies affected by the tariffs. Critics suggest the subsidies are intended to boost support for the government ahead of elections. (not investment advice)</p>
