          <p>Tommy Paul triumphed in his first-round match at the French Open against Elmer Moller, overcoming a first set loss to win the next three. Following the victory, Paul recounted an incident where his truck was repossessed due to missed payments after he switched banks and forgot to update his automatic payment settings. He humorously described watching security camera footage of the repossession while in Europe and has since regained possession of the vehicle. Paul joked about now watching 'repo' shows and career earnings of $10.8m.</p>

          <p>This week's "CBS News Sunday Morning" featured a segment on Julie Moore, an Army spouse who played a pivotal role in changing how the U.S. military informs families about the deaths of service members. Moore, whose husband served during the Vietnam War, led efforts to replace telegrams with in-person notifications and support for next of kin. The broadcast also covered other stories, including a profile of BBC's Steve Rosenberg reporting from Russia, food-inspired art, an interview with novelist Anne Tyler, and the 100th anniversary of Delta Air Lines. The show included segments on summer entertainment previews, the cartoon art of Barbara Shermund, and commentary on medical research cuts.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris won the Monaco Grand Prix, followed by Charles Leclerc and Oscar Piastri. A new rule implemented to increase the race's jeopardy and predictions of chaotic strategies didn't materialize. The only intervention by the safety car was an early virtual one after a crash for Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto on the first lap. Verstappen, at a disadvantage with limited tire options, finished fourth after a late pit stop. Red Bull's strategy of delaying Verstappen's final pit stop in hopes of a crash and red flag ultimately failed.</p>

          <p>Hikers in the Krkono≈°e Mountains in the Czech Republic discovered a mysterious cache of gold bracelets, cigar cases, a powder compact, and hundreds of coins. Experts at the Museum of Eastern Bohemia are studying the pieces, which are not of local origin. Speculations range from connections to pre-World War II departures of Czech and Jewish populations to the post-war German exodus in 1945, but the most recent coin dates to 1921, adding to the mystery. The discovery has prompted community residents to share their theories about the trove's origins.</p>
