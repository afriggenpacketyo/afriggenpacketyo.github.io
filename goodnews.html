          <p>A parenting expert and author discusses ways to support fathers, particularly those facing challenges such as divorce or mental health issues. The article highlights the importance of acknowledging fathers' efforts and offering support rather than judgment, emphasizing that no father dreams of being away from their child. It suggests that parenting is a team sport and that fathers benefit from supportive communities and understanding. The article also touches on the impact of parental separation on children and encourages reframing negative self-perceptions. The author advocates for compassion and rewriting the narrative surrounding fathers, reminding them that their roles matter and they are not alone.</p>

          <p>USA Fencing has amended its policies, removing the prioritization of states with LGBTQ-friendly laws for competition host sites and revising the policy on playing the national anthem at events. This decision follows criticism after a fencer was penalized for refusing to compete against a trans opponent. The organization will now prioritize cost, safety, and convenience for national event bids across all states. The new national anthem policy aims to provide consistent guidance for honoring the flag and anthem at national tournaments, set to begin at the 2025 Summer Nationals.</p>

          <h2>Why Iran Is Unlikely to Block the Strait of Hormuz Despite Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite rising tensions with Israel, analysts believe it is unlikely that Iran will block the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Blocking the strait could trigger further retaliation and draw backlash from China, Iran's largest oil customer. The Strait of Hormuz sees roughly 20 million barrels per day of oil pass through, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments. Experts suggest that a full-scale disruption of global oil flows is unlikely and might even be physically impossible. The presence of the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain makes it difficult for Iran to close the strait for an extended period.</p>

          <p>Summer Fridays, once a popular perk, are becoming less common as more companies adopt hybrid work schedules. While employees value summer Fridays as a way to prevent burnout and boost morale, most workers are not offered any summer-specific benefits. Experts suggest that the shift towards work-from-home Fridays has contributed to the decline of summer Fridays. The perk "can go a long way in showing employees they're valued, which can help prevent burnout, boost morale, and improve retention during a season when disengagement can run high."</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a breakthrough in the commercial extraction of rubidium directly from salt lake brine. This could potentially reduce China's dependence on imports, mostly from Canada. The new method produces ultra-pure rubidium chloride from ultra-low concentrations, providing a new domestic source for this strategically vital material. Rubidium is used in electronics, specialty glass, and aerospace, with military, technological, and civilian applications.</p>
