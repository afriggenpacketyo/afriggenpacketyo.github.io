          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, mediated by the United States, following heightened tensions stemming from an attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir. President Trump announced the agreement on social media, with Secretary of State Rubio confirming the U.S. role in brokering the ceasefire. Prior to the agreement, Indian officials reported attacks by Pakistan across multiple locations and troop movements into forward areas, which India perceived as offensive. India has denied causing any damage to Pakistan's military infrastructure and has rejected claims of destroying Indian systems. The tensions arose after an April attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, which India attributed to Pakistani-backed militants.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered military leaders to review and remove books related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and 'gender ideology' from their libraries. Leaders must identify materials promoting 'divisive concepts' that are incompatible with the department's core mission, with a deadline of May 21 for removal. A separate memo instructs military training academies to disregard race, ethnicity, or sex in admissions, focusing exclusively on merit, with certification of these standards due by mid-June. This action follows a similar order given to military academies, including the US Naval Academy, which removed nearly 400 books from its library.</p>

          <p>Ric Edelman, a personal finance expert, is cautioning that America is failing its youngest investors due to inadequate financial literacy education. He highlights the increasing trend of young investors engaging in risky, get-rich-quick schemes, often influenced by social media platforms like TikTok. Edelman emphasizes the need for credible sources of financial information and warns against overly complex and expensive financial products. He notes the lack of mandatory personal finance courses in high schools as a significant challenge, but expresses optimism that younger generations are motivated to avoid the financial pitfalls of their parents.</p>

Companies that fail to demonstrate efforts to recruit UK-based staff may lose their right to sponsor foreign workers. The proposals also aim to change how judges apply Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, and the immigration system should be fundamentally linked to the labor market.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a spacecraft launched by the Soviet Union in 1972 with the intention of reaching Venus, has crashed back to Earth after 53 years in orbit. The spacecraft, which was designed to land on the surface of Venus, may have remained intact during its plunge, and is said to have splashed down in the Indian Ocean west of Jakarta, Indonesia. The event serves as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the broad ambitions of superpowers exploring the solar system. Despite the technological advancements of the time, this particular mission was unsuccessful in reaching its intended destination.</p>
