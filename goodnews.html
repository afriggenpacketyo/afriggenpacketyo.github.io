          <p>The search for the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, declared extinct in 1986, has become a national obsession in Australia, fueled by thousands of reported sightings. While enthusiasts use trail cams and search for physical evidence, scientists are pursuing a different path through de-extinction. A lab at the University of Melbourne, in partnership with Colossal Biosciences, is working to engineer the genome of a related marsupial, the dunnart, to recreate the thylacine. Despite skepticism from some experts who deem the project impossible, the efforts reflect a deep-seated hope and perhaps remorse for the animal's extinction.</p>

          <p>Esteemed German director Werner Herzog, now 82, reflects on his six-decade career, known for films that explore the extremes of nature and human sanity. In a wide-ranging interview, he discusses his impoverished childhood, his belief in "good criminal energy" for filmmaking‚Äîincluding stealing a camera to start his career‚Äîand the grueling production of his classic film "Fitzcarraldo." Herzog, who narrates his own documentaries with a distinctive tone, maintains that he is the "only one who is clinically sane" in the film industry. He continues to work, teaching his "rogue film school" and insisting his prose will outlive his extensive filmography.</p>

          <p>Sealand, a former British anti-aircraft fort in the North Sea, stands as the world's smallest self-proclaimed state, established in 1967 by "pirate radio" broadcaster Roy Bates. Now run by his son, Prince Michael, the micronation has its own constitution, currency, and a history of fending off coups and rival invasions. Its claim to statehood is bolstered by a 1978 incident where a German diplomat visited to negotiate a citizen's release, arguably constituting de facto recognition. To stay afloat financially, the royal family now sells noble titles online, continuing the unique legacy of their tiny, concrete nation.</p>

          <p>Visual artist and photographer Lena Herzog offers insights into her husband, filmmaker Werner Herzog, particularly his acting career and the public's perception of him. She reveals that when they first met, he pretended to be a stuntman, a ruse he maintained for months. Lena believes his roles as villains in projects like "The Mandalorian" and "Jack Reacher" play into the caricature of him as a "wild man." However, she emphasizes that this persona is misleading, describing the famously intense director as a "really, really sweet, good man" in his private life.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Werner Herzog's documentary process eschews traditional methods like storyboarding, instead relying on instinct and a search for poetic truth. He and his editor watch all raw footage only once, with Herzog marking compelling shots with exclamation points to build the film's structure. He is known for his unique, philosophical narration, which he writes spontaneously to elevate images beyond mere information and into something memorable for the audience. Herzog believes this approach, which he demonstrated while working on his film "The Ghost Elephants," creates a dreamlike reality that will be remembered for decades.</p>

However, this growth has a dark side, with reports of exploitation in the AI sector where workers face low pay and poor conditions.
