          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction against the Trump administration's order to stop construction on the Revolution Wind farm off the coast of New England, allowing work to resume. The project's developer, Orsted, had sued the Interior Department, arguing the stop-work order was unlawful and issued in bad faith for a project that is already 80% complete. This ruling represents a significant setback for the administration's stated goal of shutting down the offshore wind industry in the United States, which it has described as too expensive and unreliable.</p>

The iconic apparel brand has struggled since late 2021 with challenges in China and increased competition, which led to a CEO change last year. New leadership is refocusing on core sports categories, rebuilding retail partnerships, and working to clear excess inventory, with recent analyst upgrades suggesting growing confidence in the company's recovery ahead of its next earnings report.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly payments for home equity loans have become slightly more affordable for homeowners. For a $100,000 loan, current rates result in monthly payments of approximately $1,236 for a 10-year term and $974 for a 15-year term, a modest decrease from earlier in the year. While the savings are not substantial yet, further anticipated rate cuts could make these borrowing options even cheaper, though variable-rate HELOCs may see more immediate benefits from future reductions.

          <p>Bruce Pearl, the head coach of Auburn University's men's basketball team, is reportedly expected to retire before the 2025-26 season, with his son and associate head coach, Steven Pearl, anticipated to take his place. The news comes amid speculation that Pearl may consider a political career, potentially running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Tommy Tuberville. Pearl has been an outspoken advocate for Israel and has been a prominent voice on political issues, though he has previously questioned if he could make a greater impact in Washington than as a coach.</p>
