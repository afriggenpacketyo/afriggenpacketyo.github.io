          <p>The UK government is set to announce its first-ever sanctions targeting individuals and companies involved in people-smuggling operations across the English Channel. This new strategy will freeze the assets of gang leaders, corrupt officials, and suppliers of small boat equipment, while also banning them from the UK. The move is part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's pledge to disrupt the criminal networks organizing the crossings. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the goal is to target those who prey on vulnerable people for profit where traditional law enforcement cannot reach.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, Slovenian writer Ana Schnabl critiques the expectations placed upon authors from the Balkans by the Western publishing industry. She recounts being advised by a US publisher to focus on themes of cultural trauma and historical conflict, suggesting a preference for stories that exoticize the region. Schnabl argues that this limits Balkan writers to narratives of victimhood and post-socialist disillusionment, overlooking a diverse range of contemporary stories. She calls for publishers to embrace a wider variety of voices and narratives that challenge, rather than reinforce, preconceived notions about the region.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Announces Significant Changes to Infected Blood Scandal Compensation</h2>

          <p>The British government has committed to "substantial changes" in the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, which affected an estimated 30,000 people. The move follows a critical report from the public inquiry chair, who described the payment process as "profoundly unsatisfactory." Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a victim's estate if they die before their claim is settled, a reversal of the previous rule. Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds stated the goal is to restore trust, though victims' groups, while welcoming the news, noted some issues still require further consultation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, President Trump's universal tariffs have a potential silver lining. They expose the hypocrisy of countries and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union, which have maintained their own self-defeating internal trade barriers for years. The economic pressure from US tariffs is creating an incentive for these nations to streamline their domestic economies by removing long-standing obstacles to commerce and regulation. The author suggests this forced self-reflection could lead to significant long-term economic benefits that might otherwise have been ignored. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas officials have successfully accounted for the vast majority of people reported missing after the catastrophic July Fourth floods, with only three individuals still unfound. Initially, more than 160 people, mostly tourists in hard-hit Kerr County, were reported missing, sparking a massive verification effort. The sharp revision in the numbers is common after large-scale disasters, as initial reports are often chaotic. The flash floods killed at least 135 people in Texas, with most fatalities occurring along the Guadalupe River, where fast-moving water washed away buildings and caught many campers and residents by surprise.</p>
