          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, including Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and prompting warnings from the National Weather Service. The storm, driven by strong winds from thunderstorms, lifted dust from dry farmland, creating a dramatic scene and hazardous driving conditions. Such dust storms are uncommon in the region, with the last significant event in Chicago occurring during the Dust Bowl era. The Weather Service attributes the storm's intensity to exceptionally dry soil conditions. </p>

          <p>A recent aerial clash between India and Pakistan reportedly saw the Chinese-made J-10C fighter jet demonstrate its capabilities, shooting down at least two Indian jets. This marks the first combat success for Chinese aircraft using domestic systems, indicating a shift from imitation to innovation. The J-10C's advanced radar system and ecosystem-centric warfare approach highlight China's growing air power. These developments suggest that China is evolving from regional ambition to global competition. </p>
