          <p>Inflation in the euro zone held steady at 2% in July, a figure higher than the 1.9% anticipated by economists. This data comes as the region's economy showed surprising resilience with 0.1% growth in the second quarter, despite a significant slowdown from the previous period. The stability is seen as a positive sign amidst the economic pressures of U.S. tariff policies. The full impact of the recent EU-U.S. trade agreement on European inflation and economic growth remains a key point of uncertainty for analysts. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that a second Trump administration could revitalize the federal civil service by introducing "moonshot" missions to inspire top talent, similar to the Apollo program. The author suggests changing incentives to reward efficiency and risk-taking rather than budget size, and fostering a high-performance culture focused on merit over equity. The piece also calls for greater adoption of private-sector technology and building stronger public-private partnerships to attract skilled individuals. The goal is to shift the government from preserving the status quo to embracing innovation and transformational projects.</p>

By partnering with AI music platform Suno, the foundation can create music in older styles that are difficult to replicate with human songwriters. While this technological embrace allows them to reach a wider audience, it has sparked debate among some contributors and other non-profits who worry about losing the essential human connection and the potential for copyright issues.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, reported strong second-quarter results driven by its Google Cloud division, which saw a 32% revenue increase. This growth is fueled by surging demand for AI services, leading to a massive $106 billion order backlog for data center capacity. Consequently, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai raised the company's 2025 capital expenditure forecast to $85 billion. This increased spending is considered excellent news for Nvidia, the primary supplier of the high-performance GPUs essential for building and operating these advanced AI data centers.

          <p>Nintendo announced that its revenue more than doubled in its fiscal first quarter, largely due to the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console. The company sold 5.82 million units of the new device, which was released on June 5, helping drive video game platform sales up 142.5% year-over-year. Despite the strong performance, Nintendo has maintained its full-year financial forecast, a move some analysts consider conservative. The company stated that potential impacts from new U.S. tariffs are not expected to significantly affect its current earnings forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany has reported a "favorable" conservation status for its wolf population in the country's northern Atlantic region for the first time, with numbers growing to around 1,600 animals. This positive development has prompted plans to potentially allow controlled hunting in the area to manage the population. In separate news, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is visiting the Israeli-occupied West Bank for talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. The diplomatic mission is focused on addressing rising settler violence and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reforming its main civil service internship program to exclusively accept students from "lower socio-economic backgrounds." This change, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase the representation of working-class individuals in Whitehall to better reflect the country. Successful interns on the paid summer program will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program. The move has been framed by Labour as a way to ensure government harnesses the broadest range of talent, while a Conservative shadow minister criticized it as social engineering.</p>

          <p>A new law named after Ronan Kanda, a 16-year-old who was fatally stabbed with a ninja sword, has come into effect in the UK. "Ronan's Law" outlaws the manufacture, sale, and possession of these weapons, which were previously easy to purchase online. The campaign was led by Ronan's mother, Pooja Kanda, after her son was killed in a case of mistaken identity by a teenager who had legally bought the weapon. The new legislation is part of a broader government effort to combat knife crime, which includes stricter age verification and a surrender scheme.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new anti-poaching initiative in South Africa, the Rhisotope Project, involves injecting rhino horns with harmless radioactive isotopes. The project, a collaboration between the University of the Witwatersrand and conservationists, aims to make the horns easily detectable by radiation scanners at borders and airports. This would help identify and arrest traffickers, thereby devaluing the horns on the black market. After successful trials confirmed the process is safe for the animals, the project officially launched with the injection of five rhinos, hoping to expand it to the wider population.</p>

National agencies in China and Europe have also set ambitious timelines for sending humans to Mars. This pivot is leaving lunar projects more in the domain of private companies, which are capitalizing on lower costs to deliver payloads and technology to the Moon's surface.
