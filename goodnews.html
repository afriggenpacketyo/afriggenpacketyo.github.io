          <p>The skulls of 19 Black New Orleanians, dismembered in the late 1800s and sent to Leipzig University in Germany for racist research aimed at proving the debunked theory of smaller Black brains, have been repatriated. Dillard University's president emphasized the restoration of humanity and dignity for these individuals, who were stripped of their identities. A cultural repatriation committee attempted to contact descendants and discovered the names and backgrounds of most of the deceased. The skulls will be memorialized and laid to rest in a jazz funeral, a New Orleans tradition, symbolizing their return home and honoring their lives.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a press event to celebrate Elon Musk's tenure leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is ending after four months. Trump lauded Musk's contributions, while Musk acknowledged that DOGE had not yet achieved its goal of cutting trillions in government spending. Musk has publicly disagreed with Trump on tariffs and criticized White House advisors, and also expressed disappointment with the recent spending bill. Despite these disagreements, Trump praised Musk and stated that he would continue to help, and Musk will continue to visit the White House as a friend and advisor.</p>

          <p>U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger is retiring with concerns about the significant increase in threats against members of Congress, which have quadrupled in recent years. Manger highlighted the department's expanded jurisdiction to address threats nationwide and the challenges of securing adequate funding to protect lawmakers in their home states. He noted the staffing shortages faced by the Capitol Police prior to the January 6th attack and the ongoing efforts to recruit and hire officers, and the budget request for 2026 is nearly $1 billion to bolster security and investigations. The department is working to ensure the safety of lawmakers as they travel and meet with constituents.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer commented on the stock market's performance despite the chaos created by President Trump's tariffs, noting that the market is up despite trade policy confusion. Trump accused China of violating their trade agreement and considered broadening restrictions on Chinese tech companies, but also expressed openness to talking with President Xi Jinping. Investors are focusing on the resilience of the U.S. economy, including strong job growth and slowing inflation, rather than the trade headlines. Cramer highlighted the efforts of companies like Costco to mitigate tariff impacts and the continued spending by consumers, and the president should acknowledge the hard work and success of these companies.</p>

She starred on stage and screen, but her role on "M*A*S*H," which aired for 11 seasons on CBS, was her most notable role. The show was adapted from Robert Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 film and maintained the movie's anti-establishment ethos.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), while Musk said he expects it will achieve $1 trillion in cuts "over time". The White House has said DOGE's efforts have saved roughly $170 billion, though some analyses suggest DOGE's actions could cost the government $135 billion. Musk defended DOGE's work, and Trump said his administration is "committed" to making the cuts permanent and will seek codification by Congress. Musk has publicly split from Mr. Trump over his sweeping domestic policy package, which the president calls his "big beautiful bill."</p>

Investors and union members are seeking clarity on the structure of the deal, which Trump described as a "partnership" that would keep U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh and involve a $14 billion investment by Nippon. The deal is structured as a "merger" in which it will become a "wholly owned subsidiary" of Nippon Steel North America but continue to operate as separate company, and it is expected to close its acquisition of U.S. Steel at $55 per share.</p>

          <p>The CDC has contradicted Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. by maintaining its advice that children "may receive" COVID-19 vaccines, despite Kennedy's announcement that the agency would stop recommending the shots for healthy children. The CDC's updated childhood immunization schedule states that children 6 months and older may receive the vaccine with informed consent from a healthcare provider. The agency still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for immunocompromised children and most adults, and the change means that health insurance companies will continue to be required to broadly cover the shots for now in this age group.</p>
