          <p>Artificial intelligence advances could significantly alter entry-level jobs for recent college graduates, potentially eliminating positions or reshaping them, according to experts. The CEO of Anthropic predicts AI could cut U.S. entry-level jobs by half within five years, and some companies are already investing heavily in AI to increase efficiency. While some analysts believe economic conditions are also contributing to current job woes, they acknowledge that AI poses a serious risk to white-collar entry-level tasks. Experts suggest that graduates may need to adapt by focusing on problem-solving and analysis skills and learning to use AI tools effectively.</p>

          <p>The U.S. job market showed resilience in May, adding 139,000 jobs, but hiring slowed as businesses expressed concerns about uncertainty related to President Trump's tariff policies.

While President Trump's tariffs on new imported vehicles don't directly impact used car sales, they influence the used car market through changes in new vehicle prices and demand. Demand for used vehicles remains strong due to low inventory levels and consumers holding onto their vehicles longer. (not investment advice)</p>
