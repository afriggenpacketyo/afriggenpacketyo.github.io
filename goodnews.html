Due to rising prices caused by tariffs, Geng had to remove a popular dish of American-imported salt-baked chicken feet from the menu. While Geng can source chicken feet from other countries, he notes that they don't match the quality of the American ones, and he hopes to serve the American phoenix talons again if the political situation improves.

          <p>This ABC News article reports that Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to run against Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026. Scholten's decision was partly motivated by Ernst's remarks at a town hall meeting regarding potential Medicaid cuts, where she responded to concerns about people dying with the statement, "Well, we're all going to die." Scholten, who has previously run for higher office, intends to make the race a referendum on President Donald Trump's trade policies, particularly their impact on Iowa soybean farmers. The article notes that while some House seats in Iowa are considered competitive, Democrats have not won a Senate race in the state since 2008.</p>

          <p>This Yahoo News article details President Donald Trump's pardon of two Florida shark divers, John Moore Jr. and Tanner Mansell, who were convicted of theft for cutting 19 sharks and a goliath grouper free from a fisherman's longline. Moore and Mansell believed the longline was illegal and reported it to state wildlife officers, taking photos as they freed the sharks. The longline belonged to a vessel permitted by NOAA to harvest sandbar sharks for research, and the divers were found guilty despite their belief that they were doing the right thing. The article highlights the controversy surrounding their prosecution, with a judge comparing it to the relentless pursuit in "Les Mis√©rables."</p>
