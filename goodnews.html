          <h2>Dodgers Pitcher Tyler Glasnow Shows Promising Performance Despite Team's Loss to Brewers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 00:39:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Dodgers' 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers, pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong and encouraging performance, signaling a potential return to form after a season plagued by injuries. He pitched six innings and allowed only one run, showcasing increased fastball velocity and effective control, a significant step forward for the high-profile acquisition. Despite his solid outing, the Dodgers' offense was shut out, and a relief pitcher gave up a crucial home run. Glasnow's dependability is seen as vital for the team's championship aspirations, making his recent progress a positive development.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Army Scientists Propose Advanced X-Railgun Design to Overcome Power Limitations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 23:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists with the Chinese army have proposed a new "X-railgun" design that could significantly increase the power of electromagnetic weapons, addressing a key limitation of the navy's current model. The existing naval railgun, a global first, is hampered by its inability to fire projectiles heavy enough for major combat scenarios. The proposed solution involves cross-stacking two railguns, which would nearly double the force and allow for firing much heavier shells at hypersonic speeds. This innovation aims to advance the military application of railgun technology, which has been stalled by power constraints.</p>

          <h2>Poll Shows Strong Public Support for U.S. Return to the Moon and Mars Exploration</h2>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a majority of Americans, about two-thirds, favor the United States returning to the moon and undertaking a future mission to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The 1969 lunar mission is still widely viewed as a worthwhile achievement, a sentiment consistent with polling from previous anniversaries. The survey suggests that the U.S. space program is generally seen as a source of national pride and a contributor to beneficial technological advancements.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology companies are increasingly challenging the dominance of U.S. firms like OpenAI and Google by championing open-source artificial intelligence models. Companies such as DeepSeek have released powerful, free-to-use large language models that are gaining global support from developers as a viable alternative to the closed, proprietary systems of Silicon Valley. This open-source movement not only fosters a collaborative approach to AI development but also helps Chinese firms bypass restrictions placed on them by U.S. tech giants. Analysts suggest this trend could redefine the global AI landscape.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly," as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The current ceasefire proposal includes the return of these 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 others in exchange for the release of an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes amid ongoing diplomatic efforts, including a recent visit to Washington by the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency. Hamas has indicated it favors an interim truce but may revert to demanding a full deal.</p>

          <p>Retired Marine Cpl. Scott Harrison, who endured the horrors of the Vietnam War, has brought to life a vision that helped him survive: a beautiful carousel. During the war, a small music box from his sister inspired daydreams of a carousel in a peaceful mountain meadow, an image that provided a crucial mental escape. After battling PTSD for years, Harrison began building that carousel in 1986, hand-carving the animals over 26 years. Now, the "Carousel of Happiness" in Nederland, Colorado, has delighted over a million visitors and provided its creator with profound healing and a new mission to spread joy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act, a landmark piece of legislation that creates the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States.

Supporters hail the law as a revolutionary step for financial technology that will strengthen the dollar and modernize the financial system. The signing ceremony was attended by crypto industry executives, who have heavily supported pro-crypto candidates and view the law as a massive validation for the industry.

Stocks often rally upon being added to a major index, as index funds must purchase the shares to rebalance their portfolios. Despite being down 14% for the year, Block's inclusion adds more technology weight to the benchmark index and reflects the company's significant market capitalization of about $45 billion.

          <p>The White House physician has diagnosed President Trump with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after he experienced mild swelling in his lower legs. The condition, described as "benign and common" in people over 70, occurs when veins struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool in the legs. According to medical experts, CVI affects about one in three U.S. adults and can cause aching, heaviness, and swelling. Treatment often involves lifestyle changes like exercise and compression stockings. The president's doctor has assured that the condition is mild and that Trump remains in "excellent health."</p>

          <p>The "California Forever" project, a controversial plan by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city in Solano County, has announced its next phase: a large-scale manufacturing hub. The proposed 2,100-acre "Solano Foundry" aims to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other high-tech industries, with the goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state. This follows an earlier proposal for a shipbuilding hub on the more than 65,000 acres of farmland the group has acquired. While proponents tout job creation, local community groups remain skeptical, viewing it as hype to generate support for the contentious development.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has changed its support practices to prevent engineers based in China from providing technical assistance for its U.S. Department of Defense cloud clients. The move is a direct response to national security concerns raised in a recent ProPublica report. The report detailed how Microsoft's Azure cloud services for the Pentagon were being supported by engineers in China, albeit supervised by U.S.-based "digital escorts." This arrangement was seen as a potential cybersecurity vulnerability, prompting Microsoft to revise its protocols to ensure U.S. government customer support is handled without involving its China-based teams.</p>
