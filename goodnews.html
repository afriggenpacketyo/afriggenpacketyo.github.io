          <p>Receipts from U.S. tariffs hit a record $16.3 billion in April, an 86% increase from March and more than double the amount from a year prior, according to the Treasury Department. This surge in revenue is attributed to President Trump's trade war policies, including the 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.S. imports initiated on April 2. While the U.S. continues to operate with a substantial budget deficit, the tariff influx helped to reduce the imbalance in April, a month typically seeing a surplus due to income tax filings. High interest rates continue to pose a significant budgetary challenge, with net interest on the national debt totaling $89 billion for the month.</p>

          <p>According to President Trump, China has agreed to "open itself up to American business" following trade negotiations between Washington, D.C., and Beijing. Trump told reporters at the White House that the arrangement was arguably the most significant development stemming from the trade negotiations. Plans have yet to be finalized, but Trump said that China is on board with the agreement. He said that it would be fantastic for American businesses if they could compete with China, creating jobs for both countries. Other topics covered in the Fox News Politics newsletter include the release of American hostage Edan Alexander, Trump's defense of Qatar's jumbo jet offer, and a plunge in southern border apprehensions.</p>

          <p>Six Bulgarians have been sentenced to prison in the UK for operating a Russian spy ring, conducting "industrial-scale" surveillance on behalf of the Kremlin. The sentences range from just over five to nearly 12 years. The ringleader, Orlin Roussev, was sentenced to 10 years and eight months for posing a serious risk to Britain's national security. The spies operated across borders, surveilling journalists, dissidents, and Ukrainian soldiers being trained at a US military base in Germany. They were motivated by money and found spying for the Kremlin "exciting and glamorous."</p>

          <p>A plane carrying White South Africans arrived at Dulles International Airport after the Trump administration granted them refugee status in the United States. The group, including families with children, was greeted by U.S. officials who cited "egregious discrimination" against them in South Africa, which the country's government denies. The Trump administration alleges that White South Africans, particularly Afrikaners, have faced discrimination, including through a controversial land seizure law. The South African government argues that the law respects private property rights and targets unused land. A refugee group, Episcopal Migration Ministries, declined to help resettle the South Africans, citing moral opposition.</p>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu credited Alexander's release to Israel's military and political pressure exerted by President Trump.

The 59 Afrikaners underwent expedited reviews, were brought to the U.S. on a government-chartered flight, and were greeted by federal officials. Their admission has drawn scrutiny from resettlement agencies facing budget cuts. The Episcopal Church announced it would terminate its partnership with the government to resettle refugees, citing moral opposition to resettling white Afrikaners.

These auroras are triggered when high-energy particles from space collide with atoms of gas in the atmosphere near Jupiter's magnetic poles. Scientists analyzing the photos, taken on Christmas in 2023, observed the auroral region fizzing and popping with light, sometimes varying by the second. The images have also opened doors to new questions about the universe, as certain bright spots seen in Webb's images did not appear in Hubble's counterparts.</p>

Experts noted that the letters largely look the same, so it‚Äôs difficult to make out the individual characters in his signature, implying that he keeps the real him more private. The angles in his signature show that he‚Äôs analytical and intelligent, but it also signifies a sharpness and shortness.</p>

However, as some of the levies have been suspended rather than cancelled altogether, they might rise again in three months if no further progress is made.
