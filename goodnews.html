          <h2>Experts Analyze Kris Jenner's Apparent Cosmetic Transformation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kris Jenner's recent youthful appearance has sparked speculation about a possible deep plane facelift, which her representative confirmed was performed by Dr. Steven Levine. Experts suggest that Jenner's natural-looking rejuvenation is indicative of a well-executed procedure that reset her facial tissues. A deep plane facelift involves a wider dissection under the structural elements of the face, allowing for a more natural and durable result. While any surgery carries risks such as infection and nerve damage, a deep plane facelift's main risk is potential facial paralysis, and the recovery time is approximately six months for full results.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been proactively building supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth minerals, after experiencing a targeted export ban from China in 2010. Since then, Japan has invested in stockpiling, recycling, and non-China rare-earth projects, notably Australia's Lynas, reducing its dependence on Chinese rare earths from over 90% to below 60%. Despite these efforts, Japan still has a long way to go in cutting its dependency on China in key areas, especially for heavy rare earth elements. Western auto industry groups have been particularly hard hit by China's export curbs, raising concerns about production outages.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is appealing to the House of Lords to support the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would give terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. This appeal comes after the bill was backed by MPs in the House of Commons. Critics of the bill, including some in the Lords, express concerns that it could lead to disabled and vulnerable people being coerced into ending their lives. Dame Esther, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, insists the bill has rigorous safeguards in place and is only for those with six months to live who choose to ask for help.</p>
