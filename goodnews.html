        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several New York City beaches in Queens were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings were reported dangerously close to swimmers. The sightings occurred in Far Rockaway, with one video on social media showing a shark swimming near beachgoers. City officials, including the deputy mayor for public safety, confirmed the closures and noted that drone technology was being used to monitor the situation. This event comes as New York state officials had already increased shark surveillance measures along Long Island beaches ahead of the holiday weekend to ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>As the United States takes aim at China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry, rivals South Korea and Japan are stepping up efforts to revitalize their own sectors. South Korea's new presidential administration has labeled the domestic industry as being in a "major crisis" and has outlined policies to support it. The government's growth guidelines focus on developing future vessels, such as autonomous and eco-friendly ships, through enhanced digitalization and automation. These measures are intended to help South Korea create a maritime power that can effectively compete with and lead the global market.</p>

          <p>Although visibly disappointed after her Wimbledon exit, Emma Raducanu expressed pride and motivation following her intense match against top seed Aryna Sabalenka. The former US Open champion reflected that the performance demonstrates she is closing the gap with the world's elite players, a significant step in her comeback journey. This progress is attributed to a more positive on-court demeanor and the influence of her coaching team, which has helped her find joy in her game again. Raducanu emphasized that while the loss is hard to take, it motivates her to continue improving and solidifying her game for future high-stakes moments.</p>

          <p>A recent feature from the BBC delves into the evolving perceptions of crying in the workplace, questioning whether it is a career-damaging sign of weakness or an acceptable display of humanity. The article includes anecdotes from various professionals, both men and women, who have cried at work due to stress, frustration, or personal issues. Executive coaches and career experts weigh in, with many arguing that showing emotion reflects emotional intelligence, a modern strength. However, some acknowledge a lingering bias in certain organizations where composure is still equated with stability, potentially affecting promotion prospects.</p>

          <h2>Research Reveals Tiny Zooplankton Play a Major Role in Storing Ocean Carbon</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:10:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research highlights the crucial role of tiny, often overlooked sea creatures called zooplankton in mitigating global warming. These animals engage in an epic annual migration in the Southern Ocean, gorging on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface before sinking deep into the ocean to burn their fat reserves. This process effectively locks away vast amounts of carbon, equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55 million cars, preventing it from entering the atmosphere. Scientists describe these creatures as "unsung heroes," but warn that their populations are facing growing threats just as their significant contribution to the planet's health is being fully understood.</p>

          <p>A pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom. This marks a bumper breeding year for the zoo's colony of Humboldt penguins, which are a vulnerable species with declining population numbers. Zoo experts entrusted one of two eggs laid by another penguin pair to Scampi and Flounder to improve the chances of both chicks surviving. Same-sex penguin parenting is not uncommon, and like heterosexual pairs, the two males will share all incubation and feeding duties for their new chick.</p>

          <p>Oasis launched their highly anticipated reunion tour in Cardiff with a performance that critics are calling refreshed, rejuvenated, and their best since the 1990s. The band, fronted by brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, tore through classics like "Wonderwall" and "Live Forever" for a crowd of 70,000 fans, burying a decades-long feud. Liam Gallagher's vocals were noted as particularly powerful, putting to rest concerns about past vocal issues. While maintaining their characteristic stoic stage presence, the emotional weight of their reconciliation was palpable, culminating in a brief hug between the brothers as they left the stage after a two-hour show.</p>

          <p>Hamas has reportedly delivered a "positive response" to the latest Gaza ceasefire and hostage release proposal, stating it is ready to enter negotiations. According to a senior Palestinian official, the group accepted the general framework but has requested key amendments. These include a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail, and a demand that all humanitarian aid be distributed exclusively by the UN. The US-backed plan is believed to involve a 60-day ceasefire and the staggered release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, though Israel has not yet formally responded to Hamas's latest position.</p>

          <p>India is leveraging its position within Global South alliances like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to challenge China's regional leadership. During a recent meeting of SCO defense chiefs, India's refusal to agree on the language regarding terrorism in a joint statement prevented a consensus, highlighting a key point of divergence with China. Because organizations like the SCO and BRICS require consensus for decision-making, India can effectively block initiatives and assert its own foreign policy priorities. This dynamic complicates China's efforts to project undisputed leadership across these significant international forums.</p>

          <p>An interventional cardiologist with over 20 years of experience has shared a list of five common foods he avoids feeding his children to promote long-term heart health. The list includes microwave popcorn, due to chemicals in the bag lining; flavored yogurts, for their high sugar content; and processed meats like bacon and deli meat, which are loaded with sodium and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can fuel inflammation. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and using an air fryer for a crispy texture.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team kept their T20 series against India alive with a dramatic five-run victory in the final moments at The Oval. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the last ball, but England seamer Lauren Bell secured the win by having captain Harmanpreet Kaur caught. The match was a rollercoaster, with England initially racing to 137-0 thanks to half-centuries from Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge, before a stunning collapse saw them lose nine wickets for just 31 runs. Despite a chaotic fielding performance with multiple dropped catches, England's bowlers held their nerve to narrow the series deficit to 2-1.</p>
