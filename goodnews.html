          <p>Shanghai-based Wuxi AppTec has successfully raised US$981 million through a new share placement on the Hong Kong stock exchange, signaling robust investor confidence in China's biotechnology sector. The company sold 73.8 million new shares to institutional investors, with the substantial proceeds earmarked to accelerate its global expansion and increase its manufacturing and research capacity for long-term growth. This fundraising follows a trend of successful capital-raising efforts by other Chinese drug developers. According to industry analysts, this bullish sentiment is largely fueled by mainland investors actively buying shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese biotech firms. (not investment advice)</p>

She expressed her immense joy and gratitude, describing the public recognition as a "beautiful reprieve and reward" after enduring a difficult period with her health.

          <p>An F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field near Naval Air Station Lemoore in Fresno County, California, during a training exercise. The pilot of the advanced aircraft was able to eject safely before the impact and was confirmed to be uninjured. The jet was part of the VFA-125 "Rough Raiders" squadron, which is responsible for training Navy pilots on the F-35 platform. The crash caused a small grass fire that was quickly contained by emergency responders. No other personnel were harmed in the incident, and the cause is now under official investigation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has officially opened its first permanent office in New Zealand, situated within the US embassy in Wellington. FBI Director Kash Patel described the move as an historic moment that demonstrates a commitment to strengthening the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance. The new office will focus on key global security issues, including countering China's activities in the Indo-Pacific region, combating international narcotics trafficking, and cracking down on cyber intrusions and ransomware operations. This elevates the FBI's presence from a sub-office to a full legal attaché office with a broader regional mandate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has enacted a new law that significantly increases the penalties for individuals who solicit minors for sex. Signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill allows prosecutors to charge a first-time offender with a felony instead of a misdemeanor if they are at least three years older than the 16- or 17-year-old minor they solicit. The legislation, AB 379, was the subject of some controversy, but a compromise was reached to include the age-gap provision, specifically targeting older predators. The new law also establishes a dedicated support fund for survivors of trafficking.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced that she will not seek the governorship of California in the upcoming election. In a public statement, Harris said that after extensive reflection, she has decided that her path in public service will not be through elected office at this time, though she plans to remain actively engaged in national politics. Sources close to Harris revealed that while she gave the gubernatorial run serious thought, she ultimately concluded her efforts would be more impactful on the national stage. This decision effectively keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami waves and prompting emergency alerts across the Pacific Ocean. Tsunami warnings and advisories were issued for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, Japan, and several other Pacific nations, leading to evacuations in some coastal areas. The quake caused localized flooding on the Kamchatka Peninsula itself, but initial reports indicated no major damage or grave injuries elsewhere. While the most severe warnings were later downgraded as wave heights were less destructive than feared, the event demonstrated the reach and power of undersea seismic events.</p>

          <p>As the Major League Baseball trade deadline approached, a flurry of activity saw several contending teams make significant moves to strengthen their pitching staffs for the postseason push. In one of the biggest deals, the Philadelphia Phillies acquired hard-throwing closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins. The New York Mets also made a splash by adding two key relievers, Tyler Rogers and Ryan Helsley, to fortify their bullpen. In another notable trade, the Cincinnati Reds acquired Gold Glove-winning third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes from the Pittsburgh Pirates, signaling an active market for high-impact players.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have successfully negotiated a trade agreement just ahead of a critical deadline, establishing a 15% tariff rate on South Korean imports. This rate is notably lower than the 25% that the Trump administration had initially threatened and aligns with the deal recently secured by Japan, a key competitor. As part of the pact, South Korea has committed to a $350 billion investment in the U.S., particularly in the shipbuilding industry. Seoul also achieved a major victory by successfully resisting U.S. demands to further open its highly sensitive rice and beef markets.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has formally submitted a competing proposal for the long-debated expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, directly challenging the plan put forth by the airport's current owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, a design choice that would notably avoid the extremely costly and disruptive process of diverting the M25 motorway. The company asserts that its proposal, estimated to cost under £25 billion, offers a lower-risk and more cost-effective path to increasing the airport's capacity. This development introduces the first-ever competing bid for the massive infrastructure project.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani had to be removed from his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning due to cramping. On a hot and humid night, Ohtani looked visibly uncomfortable on the mound, prompting a visit from the manager and a trainer that created a moment of concern. The team later confirmed the issue was not a serious injury, and Ohtani was able to remain in the game as the designated hitter. Despite the scare being alleviated, the Dodgers were unable to mount a comeback and ultimately lost the game 5-2.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has opted to maintain its key interest rate at its current level, choosing a path of caution amid economic uncertainty and resisting public pressure from President Trump for a rate cut. The decision left the benchmark rate in the 4.25% to 4.5% range. In an unusual development signaling a potential shift in thinking, two members of the Federal Open Market Committee dissented, stating they would have preferred a reduction. The Fed's cautious stance comes as it continues to assess the unpredictable effects of new tariffs on growth and inflation, which remains above the central bank's 2% target.

The company's optimistic guidance for the third quarter further fueled investor confidence. This impressive performance was driven by strong user engagement, with a 6% year-over-year increase in daily active people across its Family of Apps, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed to successful investments in artificial intelligence.
