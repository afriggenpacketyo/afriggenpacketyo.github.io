          <p>Gemini Space Station, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss brothers, saw its shares surge over 20% on its Nasdaq debut after an initial public offering that raised $425 million. The IPO priced above the expected range, valuing the company at approximately $3.3 billion before trading began. Despite reporting significant net losses in 2024 and the first half of this year, the company, which also offers a stablecoin and custody services, demonstrated strong market interest. The Winklevoss brothers, early Bitcoin investors, continue to advocate for smart regulation and predict Bitcoin will reach $1 million in a decade. (not investment advice)</p>

While Alvarez's experience at this weight class is a factor, many pundits are tipping Crawford to win, praising his adaptability and ring intelligence.

          <p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte announced the launch of "Eastern Sentry," a new mission to protect the alliance's eastern flank after Russian drones violated Polish airspace. Rutte condemned the incursions as "dangerous and unacceptable," regardless of intent, noting similar past violations in other Baltic states and Romania. The operation will integrate air and ground assets from multiple allied nations, including Denmark, France, the UK, and Germany, reinforcing NATO's commitment to defend its territory. This initiative underscores heightened tensions and a strengthened defensive posture against perceived Russian aggression.</p>

China, the largest overseas market for American farmers, is perceived to be reducing purchases from the U.S. The delegation, comprising state representatives, agricultural associations, and exporters, will feature an American pavilion at the import expo, aiming to foster trade relations.</p>

          <h2>Should You Renew a $10,000 CD Account Maturing This September?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 14:01:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With multiple interest rate cuts already issued and more expected from the Federal Reserve, the article explores whether renewing a $10,000 certificate of deposit (CD) account is a wise decision this September. Despite rates not being as high as last year, current CD rates around 4.50% still offer significant earnings and crucial protection against rate volatility, unlike variable savings accounts. Renewing now may be a final opportunity to lock in a competitive high rate before further Fed cuts potentially reduce yields across the board. This strategy helps protect funds for an extended period, making it a potentially strong option for savers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has initiated a pilot program to expedite the deployment of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, commonly known as air taxis. Major industry players Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation are participating, with supervised trials potentially starting as early as next year. This program, which will establish public-private partnerships, follows a presidential executive order aimed at fostering safe development and deployment in the U.S. Proponents believe eVTOL technology can reduce emissions and traffic, and this initiative is seen as a crucial step towards widespread commercial air taxi services, cementing American leadership in advanced aviation.</p>

          <p>Nepal's President Ram Chandra Poudel has appointed former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as the interim prime minister, making her the first woman to lead the Himalayan nation's government. Karki, 73, known for her anti-corruption stance during her tenure as chief justice, takes office following violent protests that led to the resignation of the previous administration. The unrest, initially sparked by a social media ban, escalated into broader grievances over political corruption and youth unemployment, resulting in 51 deaths. Karki's appointment signals a move towards stability amidst ongoing challenges.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years in prison for leading a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2022 elections and "annihilate" democracy. Four of five judges found Bolsonaro guilty of a sprawling plot that included online disinformation and plans to assassinate the newly elected president. Seven close allies were also convicted, with the coup failing due to military and air force chiefs' refusal to participate. This landmark conviction is a significant moment for Brazilian democracy, challenging historical norms of impunity and sending a powerful signal about accountability for undermining democratic norms.</p>

          <p>"Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale" offers a fine send-off for the acclaimed British costume drama, concluding the saga of the aristocratic Crawley family and their staff in 1930. The film skillfully grounds itself in smaller social and familial dramas, using the period setting to comment on contemporary issues like tabloid scandals and generational shifts in management. It features returning beloved characters and new guest stars, delivering mischievous humor and poignant observations. While some character development is limited, the film provides a pleasurable last visit, illustrating how much society has changed and how some human dynamics remain constant.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve preparing its first interest rate cuts in a year, potentially by 50 basis points, attention is turning to the record $7.6 trillion parked in money market funds. While some on Wall Street speculate this "wall of cash" could fuel a stock market rally, experts like Peter Crane argue that money fund assets typically only decline during periods of extreme economic calamity. Most of this cash is institutional, not retail, and unlikely to shift dramatically into riskier assets unless rates hit near zero. Investors are advised to consider moving to treasury ETFs or assessing equity portfolio holes, as money market yields become less attractive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko is confident that a new inquest into his 1977 death will finally lead to the prosecution of those responsible. Biko, a Black Consciousness Movement founder, died from a brain injury in police detention, with former officers later admitting to assault, though no one was prosecuted under apartheid. His son, Nkosinathi Biko, emphasized the country's need to address its violent past for democracy to take root, stating the evidence clearly points to his murder by five implicated policemen. This new inquest comes 48 years after his death and five months after a judicial inquiry into apartheid-era crimes was announced.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the 1985 congressional hearing where musicians like Dee Snider of Twisted Sister and Frank Zappa opposed mandatory warning labels on albums with explicit lyrics. Co-founded by Tipper Gore, the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) argued for "truth in packaging" to aid parental guidance, presenting provocative lyrics and album art. Despite musicians' arguments against censorship, the PMRC succeeded, leading to the "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" stickers. These voluntary labels, nicknamed "Tipper stickers," sometimes paradoxically boosted sales for artists, but also led stores like Wal-Mart to stop carrying labeled records, shaping music distribution and content for decades.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts and players acknowledge a departure from their usual cohesive play, prompting renewed emphasis on plate discipline and situational hitting. With the postseason approaching, the Dodgers are implementing "NFL-style" film sessions and internal accountability to rectify their ailing offense and avoid past playoff failures.</p>
