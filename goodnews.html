          <p>The Trump administration is set to revoke the "AI diffusion rule," effectively ending restrictions on U.S. chip exports, a move celebrated by Nvidia. The rule, proposed by the Biden administration, categorized countries into tiers with varying restrictions on AI chip shipments. Nvidia's CEO expressed enthusiasm, stating the decision offers America a unique chance to spearhead the next industrial revolution, generate well-paying jobs, enhance U.S. infrastructure, and reduce the trade deficit. Nvidia shares rose following the announcement, reflecting investor optimism regarding the change in AI policy.</p>

          <p>First Minister John Swinney has declared his opposition to a bill legalizing assisted dying in Scotland, citing concerns about its impact on patient-clinician relationships and the potential pressure on vulnerable individuals. Swinney, influenced by his faith and his wife's terminal condition, believes the bill could lead some to feel like a burden and prematurely end their lives. The legislation, proposed by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, would allow terminally ill, mentally fit patients to request medical assistance to end their lives. While Swinney's opposition may sway undecided MSPs, the Scottish government will allow a free vote on the matter. The stage one vote will be held on May 13.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his nomination of Dr. Casey Means, an ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the U.S. Surgeon General. Means, replacing Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, is a proponent of Kennedy's "Make America Healthy Again" agenda, emphasizing the influence of food and lifestyle on health. She co-founded Levels, a health app, and co-authored "Good Energy," advocating for addressing the root causes of health issues. While Means supports vaccine safety and has expressed concerns about the vaccine schedule, her nomination has faced skepticism from some in Kennedy's anti-vaccine base. Her brother, Calley Means, now advises Kennedy, backing state bills promoting his agenda.</p>

          <p>A Florida federal judge has dismissed most claims against celebrities who promoted the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, including Tom Brady, Gisele B√ºndchen, and Stephen Curry. The judge ruled that investors failed to demonstrate the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX's misconduct to be held liable. The lawsuit stemmed from FTX's collapse in November 2022, which wiped out billions of dollars in customer funds. The celebrities were accused of endorsing FTX without disclosing their financial incentives. Shohei Ohtani, Larry David, and Naomi Osaka were also excluded.</p>

          <p>Experts offer differing perspectives on whether gold investment allocations should change in today's economy, with some suggesting an increase due to economic uncertainty and others recommending maintaining traditional levels for long-term diversification. Key factors to consider include debt levels, inflation trends, currency strength, and global instability. While some experts see few reasons to decrease gold holdings, others suggest rebalancing to capture gains. Recommended ways to invest in gold include physical gold, gold IRAs, and gold ETFs.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States is expected to provide some economic relief but is unlikely to significantly boost the British economy, which remains vulnerable to global economic uncertainty. While the deal is expected to ease the impact of recent U.S. tariff increases and support sectors like the auto industry, its overall impact is limited by the skew towards services in trade flows. The agreement is likely to improve consumer and business sentiment, but economists caution that larger gains would require closer ties with the European Union.

          <p>The Bank of England has cut UK interest rates for the fourth time in a year, reducing them to 4.25% from 4.5% due to a slowdown in inflation. Governor Andrew Bailey cited inflation as the reason for the cut but cautioned about the unpredictability of the global economy, particularly U.S. tariffs. The bank considered a larger cut but decided against it due to concerns about the global trade war. Future rate cuts are expected to be gradual. The decision comes as a tariff deal between the UK and US is set to be announced.</p>

Inspired by Andrew Carnegie's essay "The Gospel of Wealth," Gates aims to address urgent global problems, focusing on preventing deaths of mothers and children, eradicating infectious diseases, and improving education. He expressed concern that U.S. and European aid cuts could stall progress. The Gates Foundation, originally intended to operate beyond his lifetime, will now close in 2045, marking the "last chapter" of his career.</p>

          <h2>New York Times: Trump Tariff Treatment for Hollywood</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 09:44:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent consideration of tariffs on movies made outside America highlights the economic challenges facing Hollywood. While Hollywood remains a dominant force in filmmaking, fewer movies are being made in Los Angeles due to cheaper labor and tax credits overseas. A 100 percent tariff on movies made outside America would hurt U.S. filmmaking and potentially backfire through retaliatory measures from other countries. The industry prefers tax credits to lure back moviemakers.</p>
