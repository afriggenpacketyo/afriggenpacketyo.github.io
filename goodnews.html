          <p>Hainan, China's southernmost island, has become a hub for experimental medical treatments. The town of Lecheng is a medical special zone where patients can access therapies still in clinical trials, including cutting-edge stem cell treatments and gene therapies. A 50-year-old woman with early-stage lung cancer is among the first in China to receive the LK101 injection, a personalized mRNA vaccine designed to reduce the risk of relapse. The West China Lecheng Hospital offers luxurious suites overlooking tropical gardens, a stark contrast to typical mainland public hospitals, offering a unique opportunity for patients seeking innovative treatments.</p>

          <p>The government is considering new regulations to address the housing crisis by reclaiming unfinished housing sites from developers who fail to meet deadlines. Housebuilders will be required to commit to delivery time frames before receiving planning permission and submit annual progress reports to local councils. Developers who repeatedly miss targets could lose their land, face penalties, and be denied future permissions. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner emphasized the government's support for builders and its commitment to accelerating housing construction to meet the target of 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.</p>

          <p>Scientists have captured unprecedented high-definition images of the USS F-1, a World War I-era submarine that sank off the coast of San Diego in 1917, killing 19 crew members. The images were taken using advanced deep-sea imaging technology during an expedition by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The USS F-1 collided with another submarine during training exercises and was lost for nearly 60 years before being rediscovered in 1972. The team also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed in the same area in 1950, and held a remembrance ceremony for the lost crew.</p>

          <p>Tommy Watson, a 19-year-old who recently signed with Brighton and Hove Albion, secured Sunderland's promotion to the Premier League with a dramatic late goal in the Championship play-off final. Watson, who came on as a substitute, scored in added time to seal a comeback win against Sheffield United. His goal ended Sunderland's eight-year absence from the top flight, marking a memorable moment in the club's history. His place in the top flight was assured regardless of what happened in the final, unlike that of his boyhood team.</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, a first-term Democrat, stated he has been shamed into returning to Senate duties after criticism of his absenteeism. Fetterman, who has been open about his mental health struggles, believes his openness has been weaponized against him. He dismisses certain senatorial duties as "performative" and a waste of time, preferring to spend time with family. Despite his efforts to show he can perform the job, questions remain about his interest in the day-to-day work of serving in the Senate.</p>
