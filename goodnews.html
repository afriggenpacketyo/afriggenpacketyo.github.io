          <p>US President Donald Trump has repeatedly made false or misleading claims about wind energy, including allegations that windmills drive whales crazy and kill droves of birds. These claims are amplified on social media, but scientific evidence contradicts Trump's assertions. While whale strandings have occurred, there is no scientific evidence linking them to offshore wind activities. Wind turbines do cause bird deaths, but they are a relatively small factor compared to cats, collisions with buildings, and vehicles. The article concludes that there are efforts to improve wind energy recycling and that wind turbines do not operate at all times. </p>
