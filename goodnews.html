          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most significant event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it introduced the concept of the citizen. He argued that the era was a bloody civil war, far more divided than the U.S. is today, and that understanding its complexities and the founders' flaws makes its achievements more inspiring. Burns emphasized that America is held together by the words of its founding documents, which he believes offer a path to overcome current divisions by reinvesting in shared principles and the responsibilities of citizenship.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen captured pole position for the British Grand Prix with his final lap in a tense qualifying session, narrowly beating out McLaren's Oscar Piastri. Piastri's teammate, Lando Norris, secured third place, followed by Mercedes' George Russell, setting the stage for a competitive race at Silverstone. Lewis Hamilton finished fifth after being unable to improve on his final run. Verstappen noted the windy conditions made the high-speed corners challenging, but his Red Bull car ultimately proved fast enough to lead the grid.</p>

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently explained her decision to raise her two children as a single parent, citing her desire to avoid repeating the tumultuous relationship dynamics she witnessed in her family growing up. Theron shared that she recognized her own tendency to lose herself in relationships and felt she was not capable of being healthy in a partnership while raising children. Relationship experts support her choice, viewing it as a sign of strength, self-awareness, and a conscious decision to break unhealthy cycles rather than a rejection of love.</p>

          <h2>The Rise of 'Tipflation' and Digital Tipping Prompts Customer Confusion</h2>

          <p>The increasing prevalence of digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options is leading to "tipflation," where customers feel pressured to tip in situations where it was not previously expected, such as at self-service kiosks. Experts note that during the pandemic, many businesses adopted these systems, which often default to a tip request, creating social pressure and confusion for consumers. While tipping is often motivated by a desire to reward good service or supplement low wages, this new digital trend is driven by system design that can make it awkward to opt out.</p>

          <p>A non-alcoholic "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on social media with claims that it can lower the stress hormone cortisol, but medical professionals are skeptical. The drink, a mix of coconut water, citrus juice, magnesium, and salt, is seen by endocrinologists as more of a hydrating beverage than a stress reducer. Doctors state there is no scientific evidence that its ingredients can lower cortisol levels, which are naturally highest in the morning. While generally harmless for most people, they advise that stress is better managed through proven methods like quality sleep, exercise, and therapy.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of a revolutionary Chinese typewriter from the 1940s has been discovered, exciting scholars in the U.S., Taiwan, and China. Invented by linguist Lin Yutang, the MingKwai typewriter was a groundbreaking machine that solved the immense challenge of typing a language with tens of thousands of characters instead of an alphabet. Its ingenious design, which breaks down characters by shape rather than sound, is now recognized as a precursor to the predictive text and input methods used in modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean computing today.</p>

          <p>After being banned for over 100 years due to pollution, swimming has officially returned to the Seine River in Paris. Following a $1.5 billion cleanup project linked to last year's Olympics, designated swimming areas have been opened to the public. On Saturday, eager Parisians took the plunge into the iconic waterway, an event celebrated by Mayor Anne Hidalgo as the realization of a "childhood dream." While some residents remain skeptical about the water's cleanliness, officials have confirmed that bacteria levels meet safety standards on most days.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and change the public's negative perception of the creatures. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team catches sharks, examines their stomach contents to assess their diet and water quality, and then releases them. Researchers emphasize that a healthy shark population is a key indicator of a healthy marine ecosystem. Despite public fascination with sharks, the lab has found it challenging to secure financial support for its vital research.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage anger and stress. Based on neuroscientific findings, the rule acknowledges that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, like a surge of cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this brief period, any continued feeling of anger is a choice sustained by replaying the negative thought. Gawdat suggests using this 90-second buffer to consciously decide how to react, rather than unconsciously renewing the emotional cycle, leading to a more fulfilled life.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the hobby-centric culture in Denmark, a business school professor undertook an experiment to try 17 different hobbies in one year, from pottery to rock climbing. She found that engaging in these activities fundamentally changed her life, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit, reduce loneliness by connecting with new communities, and redefine self-care. The author argues that balance is not something to be found but rather created, and that adopting hobbies forces individuals to define their boundaries and leads to a more confident and joyful life.</p>
