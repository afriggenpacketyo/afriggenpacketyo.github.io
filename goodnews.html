          <h2>US Airlines See Rising Revenue From Checked Bag Fees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 19:17:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. airlines are increasingly relying on checked bag fees, generating over $7 billion in revenue last year, surpassing pre-pandemic levels according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Airlines attribute this shift to rising operational costs, including fuel and wages. Southwest Airlines, known for not charging for the first two checked bags for over 50 years, will now charge $35 for the first checked bag, while JetBlue has introduced Uber-style surge pricing for bag checks during peak travel. American, Delta, and United each made over $1 billion from checked bags last year, with revenues climbing since the pandemic-induced travel halt in 2020. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesco has introduced AI-powered cameras at some self-checkouts to combat shoplifting, leading to customer mockery and privacy concerns. The technology identifies when an item isn't scanned properly and shows a replay to the shopper, accompanied by a message prompting them to try again. Some shoppers have jokingly compared the technology to VAR in football, while others worry about increased surveillance. The move comes as shoplifting in the UK has hit record highs, costing retailers billions of pounds annually.</p>

          <p>Arne Slot, Liverpool's new manager, expressed gratitude to the football community for its support following an incident at the club's title parade. Approximately 50 people, including four children, were injured when a car collided with crowds in central Liverpool. Slot received the Sir Alex Ferguson Trophy and Premier League Manager of the Year award at the League Managers Association (LMA) awards, though he withdrew from the event out of solidarity with those affected. Having replaced Jurgen Klopp, Slot led Liverpool to their second Premier League title after signing only one player, Federico Chiesa.</p>

The ruling was celebrated by the firm, which stated it affirmed foundational constitutional rights.

          <p>Skomer Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has recorded a record number of puffins, totaling 43,626, despite global populations of the species declining. Conservationists attribute this success to the island's isolation, which protects the birds from predators and human impact. The island's abundance of food also contributes to the puffins' thriving population. Skomer Island is also home to 350,000 breeding pairs of manx shearwaters and thousands of guillemots and razorbills.</p>
