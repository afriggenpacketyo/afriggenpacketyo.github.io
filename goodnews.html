          <p>Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, marking the end of its nearly three-decade run as a public company. The acquisition price represents a 30% premium to Skechers' current valuation, leading to a surge of over 25% in share prices following the announcement. Skechers' CEO, Robert Greenberg, will remain in his position after the acquisition. The deal occurs during a challenging period for the retail industry, particularly the footwear sector, which faces discretionary spending constraints and supply chain disruptions related to trade policies.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is embroiled in a dispute with neighbors in West Lake Hills, Texas, over unpermitted construction around his $6 million mansion. Residents have complained about the 16-foot chain-link fence, outward-facing camera, and increased traffic caused by security personnel. The construction violated six city ordinances, leading to a Zoning and Planning Commission meeting where retroactive permission was denied. Unless the City Council disagrees, Musk may have to alter or remove the fence and gate to comply with local regulations. This situation highlights the challenges even the wealthiest individuals face when navigating local regulations and neighborhood concerns.</p>

          <p>Skechers, the footwear brand based in Manhattan Beach, is set to go private in a $9.4 billion acquisition by New York investment firm 3G Capital. The transaction is expected to be finalized in the third quarter, reflecting a price of $63 per share for both Class A and Class B shares. This announcement follows Skechers' April decision to withhold full-year guidance, citing macroeconomic uncertainties linked to global trade policies. President Trump's tariffs have significantly impacted trade with manufacturing hubs, including Vietnam and China, where Skechers produces a substantial portion of its footwear.</p>

          <p>Amanda Hess's new book, Second Life: Having a Child in the Digital Age, explores the pervasive phenomenon of Americans seeking to optimize every aspect of parenthood through online resources and technology. Hess argues that while online preparation is common, it cannot truly prepare one for the experience of having a baby. The book critiques the monetization of parental helplessness by experts and the illusion of control sold through apps, gadgets, and courses. Ultimately, Hess suggests that the meaningfulness of parenting lies in its inherent lack of control and the acceptance of its unpredictable nature.</p>

          <p>Following the devastating wildfires in the Los Angeles area in January, cleanup and rebuilding efforts are underway in affected communities. The Palisades fire and the Eaton fire caused significant damage, displacing thousands of households.

The city and county have waived discretionary hearings and zoning reviews for those rebuilding homes of similar size to those destroyed.

Much of the landscape was paved over and built up, including with an ice rink/pool. The city and community has helped bring it back to its former glory.</p>

The article argues that the organization's influence has waned due to the fragmentation of media consumption and a decline in public trust. The author suggests that progressives should focus less on reacting to News Corp and more on setting their own agenda, engaging with the world as it is, and addressing issues such as economic and educational inequality.</p>
