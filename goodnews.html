The holiday originated from the labor movement's fight for better working conditions in the late 19th century. While most government offices, banks, and Costco will be closed, major retailers like Target and Walmart, along with most grocery stores and fast-food chains, are expected to remain open.

          <p>A proposal for a new, large-scale Chinese embassy at London's former Royal Mint site is highlighted as a symbol of China's growing global influence and long-term diplomatic strategy. The opinion article argues that while the project faces some political opposition over security concerns, its approval could signal the UK's continued importance as a global capital. The author contrasts China's investment in its diplomatic presence with the UK's recent sales of prominent embassy properties, suggesting different approaches to international relations and the projection of power.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is said to involve a 60-day truce during which Hamas would release approximately half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, while negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would occur. It remains unclear how Israel will respond, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously stated all hostages must be released at once. The development comes amid intensifying Israeli military operations in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>"Buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services are a popular form of unsecured debt, and like credit card debt, they can potentially be included in debt forgiveness programs. However, eligibility can be complex as BNPL is a newer financial product, and not all providers may be willing to negotiate settlements. For consumers struggling with BNPL payments, other options include direct negotiation with the provider for a hardship plan, debt consolidation loans, or seeking guidance from a credit counseling service to create a comprehensive repayment strategy.

          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction preventing the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from investigating the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America. The probe was initiated after Media Matters published a report alleging that antisemitic content on the social media platform X appeared alongside major brand advertisements. U.S. District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan ruled that the FTC's investigation was a likely violation of the group's First Amendment rights, suggesting it was a form of retaliation for the organization's constitutionally protected speech.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece describes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's White House meeting with Donald Trump as a carefully managed "intervention" by European leaders. The article notes Zelenskyy's more formal attire and collegial approach, contrasting with a previous contentious visit. While Trump focused on his self-proclaimed peacemaking abilities, European leaders gently pushed back on key issues like the need for a ceasefire. The overall atmosphere was less explosive than feared, with Zelenskyy successfully navigating the high-stakes diplomacy without major incident, largely by allowing Trump to control the narrative.</p>

          <p>The musical "& Juliet" offers a modern, feminist reimagining of Shakespeare's classic tragedy, powered by the pop hits of producer Max Martin. The show's premise has Juliet choosing not to die and instead embarking on a journey of self-discovery in Paris with her friends. The review praises the production for its energetic choreography, clever book by David West Read, and powerful vocal performances, particularly from Rachel Webb as Juliet. It is described as a euphoric and witty dance party that successfully turns a tragic tale into a feel-good celebration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there are no federal age limits for purchasing annuities, most insurance companies impose their own restrictions, typically capping buyers at around 80 to 85 years old. The optimal age to buy depends on individual retirement strategy; purchasing in one's late 50s or 60s can allow for growth, while buying an immediate annuity closer to retirement age provides a stable income stream. Waiting until one's 70s can result in higher monthly payouts due to shorter life expectancy calculations, but it also risks reduced product availability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The third-ever observed interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, is exhibiting unusual characteristics, including a glow of light ahead of its motion without a corresponding cometary tail. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has pointed to this as evidence that the object may be generating its own light. He proposed two possibilities: it is either a rare radioactive fragment from a supernova or an artificially powered spacecraft. While acknowledging the need for more evidence, Loeb has successfully encouraged NASA to use its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to observe the object during its close approach this fall.</p>
