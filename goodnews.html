          <p>European stock markets experienced a rebound, opening higher as traders keenly awaited the quarterly earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia, a crucial bellwether for the global technology and artificial intelligence sectors. France's CAC 40 index recovered despite ongoing political concerns regarding Prime Minister Bayrou's proposed austerity budget and a looming confidence vote. The broader pan-European Stoxx 600 also saw widespread gains across various sectors, contributing to its best monthly performance since May. This market optimism also extended to U.S. futures, which edged up, largely undeterred by recent political events, while Asia-Pacific markets showed mixed results following new economic data from China.</p>

          <p>SpaceX achieved a significant milestone with the successful tenth test launch of its Starship rocket, marking a notable comeback after earlier fiery setbacks. The 400-foot vehicle successfully deployed eight dummy Starlink satellites, relit its Raptor engine in orbit, and demonstrated the resilience of its reusable heat shield, a key focus for Elon Musk's reusability goals. This accomplishment is vital for SpaceX's commercial dominance and NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use Starship for crewed lunar landings by mid-2027. Interim NASA head Sean Duffy commended the flight, emphasizing its role in advancing human space exploration and the long-term vision for Mars colonization.</p>

The carousel of five pictures, featuring Kelce's proposal and Swift's new cushion-cut diamond ring, quickly amassed over 18 million likes. The announcement was thoughtfully accompanied by Swift's song "So High School," widely believed to be inspired by Kelce, and included a nod to fans with the "English teacher and gym teacher" caption.

          <p>China's struggling property market is exhibiting tentative signs of recovery, as leading developers China Resources Land and Sunac reported improved interim financial results. State-owned CR Land announced a 16.2% rise in net profit, reaching 11.9 billion yuan, while private developer Sunac successfully narrowed its interim loss by 14.4%. These positive developments are largely driven by a resurgence in mainland China's retail consumption and the government's strategic stimulus measures aimed at supporting the construction and development sectors. The article indicates a potential shift for an industry that previously grappled with substantial debt, weak sales, and limited access to financing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled a remarkable miniature 10th-century ivory figurine, hailed as potentially the first "portrait" of a Viking, challenging traditional perceptions of the era. The 1.2-inch carving depicts a meticulously groomed man with an imperial moustache, braided beard, and a distinct hairstyle, suggesting high status and wealth. Originally found in Norway in 1796 and long overlooked in museum archives, its intricate details and a subtle smiling expression set it apart from typical Viking Age art, which predominantly features animal motifs. Curators speculate the figure could represent a significant individual, possibly even King Harald Bluetooth, offering a rare humanistic glimpse into Viking culture.</p>

          <p>JD Property, the infrastructure investment and asset management platform of Chinese e-commerce giant JD.Com, is reportedly collaborating with Swiss investment firm Partners Group and EZA Hill Property to launch a Singapore-based Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). Sources familiar with the plans suggest the REIT could boast assets valued at over $1 billion and potentially list on the Singapore Exchange as early as next year. This significant venture, which follows a recent joint acquisition of logistics assets, reflects increasing confidence in Singapore's REIT market and highlights the expanding influence of Chinese capital within Southeast Asia. The consortium intends to further scale the REIT by acquiring more industrial and logistics properties across the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a novel passive residual heat removal system designed to make its next-generation, radioactive waste-recycling nuclear power plants more meltdown-proof. This significant breakthrough, announced by the China Institute of Atomic Energy, is pivotal for the development of fourth-generation integral fast reactors, which operate with a closed-loop fuel cycle for enhanced efficiency. Unlike conventional reactors, fast reactors utilize high-energy neutrons and liquid metal coolants, enabling them to be more fuel-efficient and capable of breeding new fissile material from spent fuel. The technology promises to bolster safety and sustainability in nuclear energy, also supporting advanced material research for critical applications like fusion reactors and hypersonic vehicles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits saw a narrowed decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, a notable recovery attributed to Beijing's clampdown on "involution" or excessive price wars. This improvement follows steeper drops in previous months, with manufacturing and utilities sectors showing profit increases, while mining still lags. The government's policies aimed at stabilizing consumer prices and curbing aggressive price-cutting are credited for boosting corporate profitability. However, economists caution that while the anti-involution campaign shows early effects, a sustained recovery in producer prices might require further industry consolidation and the exit of uncompetitive firms.
