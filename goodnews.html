        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liberal, pro-EU mayor Nicusor Dan won the Romanian presidency, defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion after a tense race marked by political turbulence. Simion initially claimed victory but conceded after midnight, following a campaign where he attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Ukraine, while Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine. Dan's victory represents a win for Romanians seeking change, emphasizing unity and dismissing Russian influence, particularly after a prior election was annulled due to Russian interference claims. Simion's support was notable among diaspora voters in Western Europe, reflecting unhappiness with mainstream parties and job opportunities within Romania. The article highlights the divisions and political complexities within Romania's current political landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House Budget Committee advanced President Trump's domestic policy bill after conservatives initially stalled it over insufficient spending cuts. Negotiations led to minor modifications, with four conservative holdouts voting 'present,' allowing the bill to proceed. The legislation aims to extend tax cuts, increase military and border security spending, and cut Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. The bill faces opposition from conservatives seeking stricter Medicaid work requirements and an end to clean energy subsidies, as well as from Republicans from blue states concerned about the state and local tax deduction. The article underscores the challenges in uniting the Republican party behind a unified budget strategy.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing expectations and signaling continued concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. Despite stronger industrial output growth, unstable external factors and persistent deflationary pressures remain a concern. Fixed-asset investment growth also slightly underperformed, with a significant drag from the real estate sector. Although trade-war fears have receded after tariff rollbacks, factory activity had previously fallen, and wholesale prices saw a steep drop. The article highlights the ongoing challenges China faces in maintaining economic growth amid global trade uncertainties.</p>
