While proponents celebrate this as innovation and economic opportunity, critics like former SEC official Amanda Fischer warn that crypto is highly speculative and that the current push for regulation is largely being written by the industry itself, leaving consumers vulnerable.

          <p>An environmental scientist has effectively shut down a common climate change myth by explaining the difference between natural cycles and human-influenced warming. While acknowledging that the Earth does go through long-term warming and cooling periods, she emphasized that the current rate of warming is drastically accelerated by human emissions from burning fossil fuels. Using verified charts from the EPA, she demonstrates that this accelerated greenhouse effect is the scientifically accepted cause of the current climate crisis and its increasingly severe consequences.</p>
