          <p>Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have launched a new platform enabling institutional clients to purchase tokenized money market funds. This initiative digitizes ownership of the $7.1 trillion money market industry on Goldman's blockchain, aiming to increase transaction efficiency and enable 24/7 trading. Major fund companies like BlackRock and Fidelity are already participating, viewing this as a significant step for digital assets. The tokenized funds could eventually be used as collateral, streamlining financial transactions and enhancing capital efficiency in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of former traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rate benchmarks. The court ruled that the directions given to the juries during their original trials were incorrect, making the convictions unsafe. Hayes and Palombo had argued their actions were common practice and known to their superiors. The decision concludes a decade-long legal battle and has prompted calls for a public inquiry into how the Serious Fraud Office handled such prosecutions.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has reopened the case of Choi Mal-ja, who was convicted of grievous bodily harm in 1964 for biting off her attacker's tongue during a sexual assault. At 19, she defended herself but was sentenced, while her aggressor received a lighter, suspended sentence for lesser charges. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 80, sought a retrial to clear her name after decades of living with a criminal record. The prosecution has now asked the court to acquit her, marking a significant moment for victims' rights and the re-evaluation of self-defense laws in South Korea.</p>

          <p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will not run for governor of New York in 2026, opting instead to seek reelection for his Hudson Valley House seat. Lawler, who had been considered a potential challenger to incumbent Governor Kathy Hochul, stated the decision was best for his family and district. His congressional seat is considered a key battleground, and his victory was crucial for the narrow Republican House majority. The decision comes after former President Trump had appeared to endorse Lawler for reelection, potentially influencing the field of Republican gubernatorial candidates.</p>

          <p>Australian rugby player Harry Potter has rejected criticisms from Sir Clive Woodward and David Campese, who claimed the team displayed a "losing mentality" during their first Test defeat to the British and Irish Lions. The critique followed captain Harry Wilson's decision to kick the ball out of play to end the game, despite being behind. Potter defended his team, stating the suggestion was "ridiculous" and that their intention was to win, even if they fell short. Australia now faces a must-win second Test to keep the series alive, with the team focused on learning from their initial performance.</p>

          <p>James Talarico, a 36-year-old Texas state representative and seminary student, has emerged as a potential Democratic star, particularly after a widely discussed appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast. Talarico, known for his progressive Christian viewpoint and viral clips challenging Republican legislation, is now being considered for a 2026 U.S. Senate run. His approach combines religious framing with progressive politics, a rare combination that has resonated with a broad audience. Talarico's rise reflects a potential shift in Democratic strategy, emphasizing authenticity and a willingness to engage in cultural debates on platforms popular with swing voters.</p>

          <p>China maintained its lead in the global shipbuilding industry but saw its market share for new vessel orders decrease to 68.3% in the first half of the year, down from 74.7% previously. Analysts suggest this dip is partly due to caution from shipowners ordering oil and LNG tankers, given the United States' significant role in energy exports and potential trade frictions. Despite the decline in order volume, China is expected to retain its competitive advantage in the sector. The situation highlights how geopolitical and trade dynamics can influence major industrial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team in China claims to have developed new software that overcomes a major challenge in aircraft design known as the "dimensionality curse." This innovation reportedly allows for the optimization of a vast number of design variables simultaneously without a corresponding increase in computational load. To demonstrate their system's capability, the researchers applied it to the design of the cancelled U.S. Navy X-47B stealth drone. They assert their software achieved significant improvements in stealth, aerodynamics, and propulsion, areas where the original project faced unresolved trade-offs.</p>

          <p>A 2025 Bankrate study has ranked New Hampshire as the best U.S. state to retire, with Maine, Wyoming, and Vermont also in the top five. The ranking challenges the traditional notion that warm-weather Sun Belt states are ideal for retirement. The study weighted factors like affordability, healthcare, and neighborhood safety more heavily based on what Americans prioritize, in addition to weather. While New England states scored poorly on climate, they excelled in safety and healthcare, pushing them to the top of the list and suggesting retirement priorities may be shifting.</p>

          <p>The sea slug Elysia chlorotica exhibits a remarkable biological feat by stealing chloroplasts from the algae it consumes and incorporating them into its own body to perform photosynthesis. This process, known as kleptoplasty, allows the slug to sustain itself with sunlight like a plant, blurring the lines between animal and plant kingdoms. Scientists are still working to understand the exact genetic mechanisms that enable this symbiosis. The creature serves as a striking example of how evolution can occur not just through gradual mutation but also through the transfer of capabilities between different species.</p>

Some argue that manager Sarina Wiegman should stick with her successful formula of using them as impact players off the bench.

          <p>The article reviews Ari Aster's latest film, "Eddington," describing it as a dark, surreal comedy that channels the anxiety and conspiratorial thinking of the early COVID-19 pandemic. The movie follows a small-town New Mexico sheriff, played by Joaquin Phoenix, whose paranoia and desire for control escalate as his community changes around him. The film draws parallels to "Taxi Driver," plunging the viewer into the chaotic perspective of its protagonist. "Eddington" uses its neo-Western setting to satirize modern societal tensions before descending into a violent, absurd, and bloody third act characteristic of the director's work.</p>
