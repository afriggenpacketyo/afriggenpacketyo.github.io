          <p>Amid heightened market volatility, an Invesco senior portfolio manager recommends that risk-averse investors consider income funds utilizing options-based strategies for greater stability. These funds are designed to offer more structural protection against downturns and can provide income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes. The manager suggests that such strategies are increasingly important as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates, making non-interest-rate-reliant income sources more attractive. The article advises investors to seek ETFs managed by experienced professionals and be cautious of unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to common stereotypes, a new study from DatingNews.com and the Kinsey Institute reveals that men are more likely than women to want to accelerate relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, found that financial stability was a primary motivator for men seeking to speed up these commitments. Experts suggest this trend is also driven by men's reliance on romantic partnerships for primary social and emotional support, as traditional masculinity often limits their ability to form deep, intimate connections with friends or family.</p>

          <p>Efforts are underway to repair the main power supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, which has been relying on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that both Russian and Ukrainian forces agreed to special ceasefire zones to allow for the complex repairs. Restoring a stable off-site power connection is considered critical for nuclear safety, as it is needed to cool the plant's six shutdown reactors and prevent a potential catastrophic incident. The plant has been under Russian control since early in the full-scale invasion.</p>

Greene also stresses the importance of treating the application essay as a marketing tool to convince committees to invest in one's education.

The term, a grammatically unconventional mix of a German article and an English adjective, is used to express surprise or speechlessness. Selected through an online vote organized by the PONS Langenscheidt publishing house, the phrase narrowly beat out "goonen" and "checkst du."

Despite pushback from the state's attorney general and secretary of state, volunteers say they have already gathered over 100,000 signatures.

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible, ideally until age 16, to promote better mental health and adult success. To prepare for this, she recommends two key strategies starting in late elementary school. First, parents should have open conversations about responsible technology use, online privacy, and the value of real-world engagement. Second, they must establish and enforce firm rules, such as no phones in bedrooms overnight and using parental controls to moderate usage once a device is introduced.</p>
