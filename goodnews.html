          <p>The city of Philadelphia has officially renamed a portion of South Broad Street as "Teddy Pendergrass Way" to honor the late R&B singer. The ceremony celebrated the legacy of the Philadelphia native, who was the lead singer of Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes before a successful solo career. The designated street is located in the Avenue of the Arts neighborhood, near the former Philadelphia International Records studio where he recorded many hits. Mayor Cherelle Parker also presented Pendergrass's family with a replica of the Liberty Bell, the city's highest honor.</p>

          <p>Two artists from American Samoa, Su'a Uilisone Fitiao and Reggie Meredith Fitiao, are creating traditional artworks at the Field Museum in Chicago for a new exhibit. The project aims to expand the museum's Pacific collection beyond its current focus on Hawaiian artifacts. Su'a is carving an outrigger for a 19th-century canoe, while Reggie is creating a "siapo," a traditional artwork on bark cloth using natural dyes. Their work, which will be part of an exhibit opening in 2026, is a way to preserve and share their cultural heritage with a wider audience.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. Forest Service faces a significant staffing shortage, California's firefighting agency, Cal Fire, has opened a new training facility in Atwater. The center, located at a former Air Force base, is the fourth of its kind and will help train about 1,600 firefighters in 2025. This expansion is part of a broader state effort to increase its firefighting workforce, with Cal Fire's budget nearly doubling since 2017. The new facility will provide a 10-week program for entry-level firefighters, including live-fire exercises and leadership training.</p>

          <p>As extreme heat becomes more common globally, experts offer advice on how to stay safe. Key recommendations include staying in air-conditioned spaces, as fans alone do not prevent heat-related illness, and staying well-hydrated with water or electrolyte drinks. It is best to avoid strenuous outdoor activity, especially between noon and 4 p.m. Recognizing the signs of heat exhaustion (heavy sweating, dizziness) and the more dangerous heat stroke (high body temperature, confusion) is crucial for seeking timely medical help. Vulnerable populations like children and the elderly require special attention.</p>
