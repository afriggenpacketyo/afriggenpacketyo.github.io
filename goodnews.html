          <p>Nvidia announced it will soon resume selling its H20 AI chips to China after receiving assurances from the U.S. government that licenses will be granted. This decision reverses a previous halt on sales of the chips, which were specifically designed to comply with earlier export controls. The move is seen as a significant win for the company, which had lobbied against the restrictions, and is expected to serve as a new growth catalyst in the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administration had planned to revoke the protections, arguing the security situation in Afghanistan has improved, but advocacy groups sued, calling the decision part of a broader anti-immigrant agenda. The one-week stay provides a brief reprieve for the approximately 11,700 Afghans enrolled in the program while the court considers the case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, scientists have demonstrated that an animal can respond to sounds produced by a plant, opening up a new field of ecological research. A study from Tel Aviv University found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were making ultrasonic "screaming" sounds associated with distress, such as dehydration. This suggests a previously unknown layer of communication in ecosystems, where animals may use plant-produced sounds to make decisions about their environment.</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts and easing pressure on Beijing to implement further stimulus measures. While this rate is slightly down from the first quarter, it keeps the country on track to meet its full-year growth target of around 5%. However, underlying weaknesses remain, as retail sales growth slowed and the real estate investment slump deepened, prompting some calls for continued economic support. (not investment advice)</p>
