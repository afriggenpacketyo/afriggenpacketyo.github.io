          <p>Neysun Mahboubi, a US expert on Chinese law at the University of Pennsylvania, expresses cautious optimism about the future of US-China relations. Drawing parallels to the post-1989 period, he notes that American students and scholars are slowly returning to China after the pandemic, similar to how they did three decades ago. Mahboubi believes that despite immense changes in China, the warm reception his students received indicates a desire for connection, suggesting that historical patterns point toward the relationship surviving its current rupture.</p>

          <p>A proposal to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been withdrawn from the Republican tax and spending bill following significant bipartisan opposition. Senator Mike Lee, the plan's sponsor, stated he pulled the provision because he could not secure safeguards to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations. The measure had faced backlash from fellow Republican lawmakers, conservation groups, and recreation advocates who celebrated its removal as a victory for public land access.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced in a Fox News interview that he has secured a group of "very wealthy people" to acquire TikTok, following a US law mandating the sale of the popular video-sharing app. Trump, who has repeatedly delayed the enforcement of the ban, stated he believes Chinese President Xi Jinping would approve the sale, with more details to be revealed in the coming weeks. The law was passed over concerns that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, could share US user data with the Chinese government. (not investment advice)</p>
