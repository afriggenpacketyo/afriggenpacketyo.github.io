          <p>China has launched a five-year action plan focused on metrology to drive innovation in chip technology and quantum-scale measurement, aiming to address shortcomings in its measurement capabilities. The plan, released by the State Administration for Market Regulation, prioritizes breakthroughs in over 50 core technologies by 2030. Metrological applications related to chips and rare earth magnets have become key points in the US-China tech rivalry, with the US tightening chip export controls and China leveraging its rare earth metals dominance. The expansion of metrological capabilities is a strategic priority for both countries, given its foundational role in industries dependent on precise measurements. Optimism surrounding China's technological advancement is tempered by the ongoing competition with the US.</p>

While Alphabet faces challenges from platforms like ChatGPT, which may undermine its advertising-based business model, it has been working to reduce its dependence on advertising.

          <p>A new study reveals that while parenthood in Europe provides a deeper sense of meaning, it often leads to lower life satisfaction, especially for mothers. Sociologists Marita Jacob and Ansgar Hudde analyzed data from the European Social Survey, finding that parents feel more fulfilled but not necessarily more satisfied compared to childfree individuals. The level of satisfaction depends on the respondent's living situation and the family policies in their country. Scandinavian countries show smaller differences between parents and child-free people due to robust family support systems and greater gender equality.</p>
