          <h2>Meta Establishes New AI Lab Focused on Achieving 'Superintelligence'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 11:06:47 EDT</div>

          <p>Meta is creating a new artificial intelligence research lab dedicated to pursuing "superintelligence," an AI system that surpasses human intelligence. The lab will include Alexandr Wang, the founder and CEO of Scale AI. Meta is reportedly in advanced discussions to invest over $10 billion in Scale AI. This initiative is part of Meta's broader efforts to gain a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, with the company planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure this year. The optimism score is moderate given the potential benefits of AI development but also the uncertainty surrounding superintelligence. </p>

          <h2>Wealth Concentration Exposes Crisis in US Democracy and Economic Equality</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 11:05:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that unprecedented wealth concentration in the U.S. is distorting democracy and exacerbating societal tensions, citing Elon Musk as an example of unchecked power. It highlights that just 800 families in the U.S. hold nearly $7 trillion, exceeding the wealth of the bottom half of the population. The author proposes a wealth tax on the ultra-wealthy, such as the "Five & Dime tax," to break up this concentration and generate revenue for public investments. The author believes that taxing billionaires could transform American society and grow the economy by discouraging unproductive financial behaviors and promoting fair competition. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting hope for policy changes to address wealth inequality.  (not investment advice)</p>
