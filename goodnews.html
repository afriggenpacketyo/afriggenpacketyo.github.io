          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 recorded detailed observations of a dying star's explosion, providing valuable data for modern astronomers. The record, found in a formal report to the Ming dynasty's Emperor Yongle, describes the star's size, color, and brightness, helping confirm that the event was a nova. This discovery, published in The Astronomical Journal by researchers from China, Germany, and Chile, settles a debate about the nature of the 1408 astronomical event and offers unprecedented insights into the star's position. The detailed historical account enhances our understanding of stellar phenomena and underscores the importance of historical records in scientific research.</p>

          <p>Paris Baguette, a Korean bakery chain, is expanding internationally with plans to open over 1,000 new branches by 2030, particularly in the US. The company, owned by SPC Group, traces its roots back 80 years and emphasizes delivering frozen dough to franchises for efficiency. Paris Baguette partners with Tottenham Hotspur and operates a halal-certified plant in Malaysia. While experts acknowledge the limitations of frozen dough, they see an opportunity for Asian bakeries to succeed globally by adapting tastes and leveraging the popularity of Korean culture.</p>
