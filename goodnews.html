          <p>Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have committed to enhancing cybersecurity cooperation in response to increasing cyber threats. This agreement follows Japan's enactment of a law that allows the government to monitor online communications. Separately, President Trump praised Nippon Steel as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, supporting the Japanese company's $14 billion investment in the struggling American producer. These developments signal deepening collaboration between the two nations across both defense and economic sectors.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist with experience working with young adults shares five parenting rules to help navigate the complexities of modern parenting. The advice emphasizes trusting instincts, following cultural traditions, observing the child's individual interests, focusing on enjoyment rather than strict development, and being authentic as a parent. The psychiatrist suggests that parents should trust their own judgment and cultural heritage rather than relying solely on influencers or clickbait. The key is to prioritize the child's happiness and well-being while fostering a genuine connection.</p>

          <p>Karla Flores, diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, underwent an MRI that revealed a second tumor on her spine. Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center successfully removed the spinal tumor through her eye in a first-of-its-kind surgery. The complex procedure, developed by Dr. Mohamed Labib, involved removing part of Flores' eye socket and cheekbone to access the tumor. Flores has since undergone radiation treatment and is now cancer-free, with doctors hoping the procedure can be used to help others with difficult-to-reach tumors.</p>
