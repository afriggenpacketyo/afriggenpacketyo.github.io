          <p>Experts are working to save Florida's coral reefs by planting over 1,000 nursery-grown elkhorn coral juveniles, a resilient species, in an effort to combat the severe decline in coral cover. The Florida Keys have lost 90% of their healthy coral cover due to climate change, prompting this large-scale restoration project. Marine biologists from the Keys Marine Laboratory and the Florida Aquarium are partnering to cultivate genetically diverse corals that are more resistant to environmental stressors. The project aims to reintroduce these corals to designated offshore sites, monitor their progress, and gather insights for future reef recovery efforts. This initiative represents a critical step in preserving the essential marine ecosystems of the Florida Keys.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Yara Haridy, an evolutionary biologist, discovered that structures in these ancient fish, initially thought to be early vertebrate scales, share similarities with vertebrate teeth. This finding indicates that the ability to sense pressure and temperature, now experienced as tooth sensitivity, evolved from these ancient sensing structures. The research highlights the evolutionary connection between ancient organisms and modern human physiology, offering insights into why we experience toothaches.</p>
