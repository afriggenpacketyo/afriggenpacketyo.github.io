        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area, marking only the second time in history the National Weather Service's Chicago office has issued such a warning. The storm was caused by strong winds blowing over dry farmlands, picking up dust and reducing visibility to near zero in some areas, including major interstates and airports. Showers and thunderstorms accompanied the dust storm, leading to reports of "mud rain" in some locations. Power outages were reported, leading to some school closures as well. Optimism for this article is based on the lack of human injury, and the relative rarity of the event.</p>

          <p>Angels Flight Railway, an iconic funicular in downtown Los Angeles, will raise its fares from $1.00 to $1.50 starting June 1, marking its first price increase since 2017.

          <p>Donald Trump accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination via a coded message in a seashell-themed Instagram post. The post, featuring seashells arranged to spell "8647," was interpreted by Trump supporters as a threat, with "86" meaning to get rid of something and "47" referring to Trump as the 47th president. The Secret Service launched an investigation, and Comey removed the post, stating he opposed violence and didn't realize the numbers' association with violence. This incident highlights ongoing tensions and heated rhetoric in American politics.</p>

Fishing rights are also a potential sticking point, with the EU calling for an extension of the current post-Brexit deal.
