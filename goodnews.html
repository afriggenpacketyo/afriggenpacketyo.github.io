          <p>A recent study reveals that Buddhist and Taoist temples across China have unintentionally preserved tens of thousands of ancient trees for at least 2,000 years.  These temples provide unique protection, contrasting with heavily altered landscapes elsewhere. The article highlights the 1,400-year-old ginkgo tree at the Guanyin Chan Temple in Xian as an example of this phenomenon.  The research was published in Current Biology.</p>

The appeals court upheld the conviction last year, sentencing him to a year of house arrest with an electronic ankle bracelet.  Sarkozy is appealing to the European Court of Human Rights and faces another trial for alleged illegal campaign financing.  He is the second French head of state to be stripped of the award.</p>
