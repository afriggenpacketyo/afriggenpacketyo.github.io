          <p>Coco Gauff triumphed over Aryna Sabalenka in a three-set match to win her first French Open women's title, becoming the first American to do so since Serena Williams in 2015. The match was marked by tension and momentum swings, influenced by windy conditions, with Sabalenka initially taking the first set. Gauff responded by winning the second set decisively and ultimately securing the third set after breaking Sabalenka's serve and maintaining her lead. In her victory speech, Gauff expressed gratitude to the crowd and reflected on her previous defeat in 2022, which she said motivated her to improve and ultimately achieve this Grand Slam victory.</p>

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock in France, there is a growing focus on remembrance policy, with three new initiatives addressing historical injustices. The National Assembly voted to posthumously promote Alfred Dreyfus, recognize returnees from Indochina, and address Haiti's "double debt" dating back to 1825. These initiatives aim to symbolically recognize and heal historical injustices, with some providing financial support to affected groups. While some see this as social maturity, others view it as symbolic gestures in a politically paralyzed legislature.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a massive black hole jet, Quasar J1601+3102, that is three times larger than the Milky Way, spanning nearly 200,000 light-years. The jet is estimated to be 1.2 billion years old and is powered by a black hole believed to have flared out in the early universe. The discovery was made possible by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), which allows astronomers to track both bright and low-frequency sections of the jet. Despite its size, the black hole is not as massive as expected, suggesting the potential for more undiscovered quasars of this type.</p>

The angle of the camera allows scientists to observe dust and water ice cloud layers, enabling them to track seasonal changes. Arsia Mons is roughly twice as tall as Earth's largest volcano and is often surrounded by clouds, especially during aphelion.</p>
