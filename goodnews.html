          <p>Jim Cramer identifies several reasons for market optimism, including the EU's willingness to fast-track trade talks and potential momentum in US-European relations following President Trump's shift in perspective on Russia. The US House's passing of a bill facing Senate resistance and Nvidia's upcoming earnings report with lowered expectations also contribute to this positive outlook. Cramer notes the S&P Oscillator is at a low risk level, further supporting his conviction that investors should have bought more, particularly Capital One and TJX. Cramer still likes Disney and believes Home Depot makes sense, though weather-related concerns exist. (not investment advice)</p>

A six-story facility in Singapore called "The Reserve" has seen an 88% increase in orders to store gold and silver from the start of the year to April, compared to the same period in 2024. The surge is driven by concerns over tariffs, global changes, and potential geopolitical instabilities.
