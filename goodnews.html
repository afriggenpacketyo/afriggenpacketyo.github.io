          <p>President Trump announced a deal with Pfizer to offer discounted drugs directly to consumers via the new TrumpRx.gov website, set to launch in 2026. This initiative aims to align U.S. drug prices with those in other developed countries, with Pfizer pledging 50% average discounts on new drugs and most-favored-nation pricing for Medicaid. However, the agreement lacks specific details on discount calculations, and experts like Harvard's Ameet Sarpatwari express skepticism, suggesting it's "window dressing" rather than a transformational reform. The website will primarily benefit uninsured patients, as insured individuals might still find lower prices through their existing plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Lithium Americas surged over 35% in extended trading after U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced the government would acquire a 5% equity stake in the company and its Thacker Pass project in Nevada. This strategic move aims to bolster North American lithium supply, with the mine expected to become one of the largest sources by late 2027. The investment, which includes substantial debt capital, is deemed "economic common sense" to ensure lithium is mined and refined domestically, marking the White House's latest effort to secure critical mineral supply chains vital for U.S. interests. General Motors also holds a minority stake in the project. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 288, significantly expanding the state's power over workplace disputes and union elections. This legislation allows the California Public Employment Relations Board to intervene when the federal National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is unable to act, a situation exacerbated by the Trump administration's hampering of federal regulators. The new law aims to protect workers' rights, particularly for non-union, foreign-born construction workers vulnerable to exploitation. While the California Chamber of Commerce opposes the bill due to potential conflicts with federal law, proponents argue it restores a historical balance of state enforcement.</p>

          <p>The UN Security Council voted to authorize a significantly larger multinational "Gang Suppression Force" (GSF) to help curb escalating gang violence in Haiti. The resolution, co-sponsored by the United States and Panama, will expand the current Kenya-led mission from 1,000 police officers to a maximum of 5,500 uniformed personnel, including police and soldiers. Laurent Saint-Cyr, leader of Haiti's transitional presidential council, welcomed the vote as a "decisive turning point" against criminal groups terrorizing the nation. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz emphasized that the expanded mission offers Haiti much-needed hope and demonstrates the international community's shared burden in addressing the crisis.</p>

          <p>A 54-year-old man attempting a challenging 20-plus mile marathon swim from Santa Catalina Island to San Pedro was bitten by a 3-to-4-foot shark, sustaining non-life-threatening injuries to his leg and foot. The "rare attack" occurred about 12 miles off Catalina, with the swimmer remaining awake and in mild distress. Los Angeles Fire Department Captain Adam VanGerpen highlighted the extreme rarity of such an event in his 25 years of service, expressing relief that the shark merely "nipped" at the man before swimming away. The swimmer was promptly transported to a non-trauma facility for treatment, making a full recovery likely.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its robotics sector, installing nearly 300,000 new robots last year, more than the rest of the world combined, signaling a direct path to achieving independence in core artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The nation's strategy prioritizes embodied intelligence, or AI-powered robots, as critical infrastructure for future resilience, integrating them across various sectors from manufacturing to healthcare. This approach, characterized by public-private collaboration, fosters massive domestic demand for advanced AI capabilities, thereby cultivating a market for China's own AI chips. Huawei's open-sourcing of its AI computing toolkit and large language models further underscores this commitment to building a self-sufficient and globally influential AI ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is exploring a proposal to raise the minimum wage for residential construction workers to over $32 an hour, plus a healthcare credit, for projects with ten or more units. Councilmembers argue this is necessary to attract workers to the industry, which is experiencing a shortage due to pressures like rebuilding after the Palisades fire and fears of immigration raids. Backers, including construction unions, contend that higher wages and benefits are crucial to protect often non-union, foreign-born workers vulnerable to wage theft and exploitation. This initiative aims to stabilize the workforce and support the city's housing goals.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 53, a bill mandating transparency reports from developers of powerful "frontier" AI models to address potential catastrophic risks. This law requires companies to develop safety frameworks, publish security reports before deployment, and report "critical safety incidents" within 15 days, with penalties up to $1 million per violation. While lauded as a proactive step in AI governance, the article questions if transparency alone can prevent large-scale disasters like AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks. The bill's focus on catastrophic risks, defined as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages, reflects California's role as a regulatory trailblazer in the AI industry.</p>
