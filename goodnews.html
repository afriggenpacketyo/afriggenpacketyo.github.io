        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea's manager, Enzo Maresca, has expressed confidence in Liam Delap's ability to succeed as the team's striker and potentially become England's next prominent number 9. Delap, recently acquired from Ipswich Town, is eager to make a strong impression and compete for a starting position. Maresca emphasized Delap's understanding of the significance of the number 9 role at Chelsea, despite the historical challenges faced by previous players in that position. The team is also looking to bolster their winger options after sending Jadon Sancho back to Manchester United.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales experienced their fastest growth since December 2023, driven by the government's consumer goods trade-in program and the impact of extended holidays. Retail sales increased by 6.4% year-on-year, surpassing analysts' expectations, while industrial output growth slowed slightly. Fixed-asset investment also expanded, although property investment continued to contract. The urban unemployment rate decreased to its lowest level since November, reflecting some improvement in the labor market.</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos, an Australian oil and gas producer, surged following a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion by a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC). The takeover bid, led by ADNOC's investment arm XRG, represents a significant premium over Santos' previous closing price. Santos' board intends to recommend that shareholders vote in favor of the potential transaction, which would give the consortium control of key liquefied natural gas operations in Australia and Papua New Guinea. The move underscores the growing interest of Middle Eastern players in the Australian energy sector.</p>
