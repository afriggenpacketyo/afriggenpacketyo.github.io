          <p>The "Quad" nations‚Äîthe United States, Japan, India, and Australia‚Äîhave announced a new initiative to secure a stable supply of critical minerals. The move is widely seen as an effort to reduce global reliance on China, which currently dominates the market for minerals essential for high-tech manufacturing. In a joint statement, the group expressed concerns about economic coercion and supply chain disruptions. The partnership aims to strengthen strategic stability and diversify supply chains for key technologies like semiconductors.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. The administration had planned to revoke their legal status and work permits in September, years ahead of the previously established 2026 deadline. The judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, stating the executive branch must be able to enforce immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly considering a significant strategic shift for the company's contract manufacturing business. The plan involves deprioritizing the marketing of its 18A chipmaking process to external clients, a technology that was central to his predecessor's strategy. Instead, the company may focus its resources on the next-generation 14A process to better compete with rival TSMC and attract major customers like Apple and Nvidia. This potential pivot reflects the new leadership's efforts to revive the struggling U.S. chipmaker. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposal, which will reportedly be delivered by mediators from Qatar and Egypt, aims to create a window to work towards a permanent end to the conflict.

However, challenges are expected to intensify in the second half of the year, with some analysts forecasting that export growth will slow or even contract.
