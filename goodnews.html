        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"We Are Guardians" is a documentary that focuses on the efforts of Indigenous people in the Amazon to combat deforestation caused by illegal logging and mining. The film contrasts the beauty of the rainforest with its devastation, highlighting the struggles of forest guardians who risk their lives to confront loggers. It also features activist Puyr Temb√©, who advocates for greater Indigenous women's involvement in politics, and presents the perspectives of loggers and landowners caught in the complex web of environmental, political, and economic factors. While comprehensive, the film's verit√© style sometimes clashes with its broader message.</p>

          <p>A real estate investor is considering selling two rental properties to pay off the mortgages on the other two, seeking advice on whether this is a responsible financial decision. The investor is conflicted due to the relatively low interest rates (4.50% and 5.75%) on the mortgages. Commenters on a Dave Ramsey subreddit suggest that selling two properties to eliminate debt could increase cash flow and de-risk the portfolio. This strategy reflects a shift from leveraging for growth to prioritizing financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>
