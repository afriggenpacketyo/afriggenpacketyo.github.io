          <p>Figma, the popular collaborative design software company, has officially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) and will trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory hurdles, resulting in a $1 billion fee paid to Figma. The company's prospectus reveals strong growth, with a 46% increase in first-quarter revenue and profitability, and CEO Dylan Field has signaled intentions to pursue acquisitions as a public entity.

          <p>Real Madrid advanced to the Club World Cup quarter-finals after a hard-fought victory over Juventus, decided by a late goal from 21-year-old Gonzalo Garc√≠a. While much of the attention was on Kylian Mbapp√©'s debut in the tournament, it was Garc√≠a who broke the deadlock with a powerful header, scoring his third goal in the U.S. competition. Real Madrid dominated much of the match but struggled to find a breakthrough against the Italian side's defense. The win sets up a quarter-final clash against either Borussia Dortmund or Monterrey.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a comprehensive ban on smoking in most public areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools, in a significant public health initiative. The new law aims to "denormalize" smoking, as over 200 people in the country die from tobacco-related illnesses daily. Violators of the ban face fines starting at 135 euros, though an initial grace period is expected. Despite previous bans in restaurants and bars and high taxes on cigarettes, over 30% of French adults still smoke, prompting the government to take these stricter measures to protect public health, particularly among young people.</p>

          <p>India's women's cricket team defeated England by 24 runs in Bristol, taking a commanding 2-0 lead in the five-match T20 series. After a shaky start, India recovered to post a strong total of 181-4, thanks to impressive half-centuries from Jemimah Rodrigues and Amanjot Kaur. In response, England's batting lineup faltered early, slumping to 17-3 and never fully recovering despite a notable 54 from Tammy Beaumont. The victory highlights India's growing confidence and exposes recurring weaknesses in England's performance ahead of the upcoming 50-over World Cup.</p>

          <p>The FBI has announced its intention to move its headquarters from the aging J. Edgar Hoover Building to the Ronald Reagan Building complex, just a few blocks away in Washington D.C. This decision marks a significant change from previous plans under the Biden administration to build a new suburban campus in Maryland. Officials stated that relocating to an existing federal property will be more cost-effective and faster than constructing a new facility. The current headquarters, in use since 1975, has fallen into disrepair, prompting years of discussion about a potential move for the law enforcement agency.</p>

          <p>Two-time Oscar-winning composer Alexandre Desplat has taken on the challenge of scoring the new film "Jurassic World: Rebirth," stepping into the musical world famously created by his idol, John Williams. In a recent interview, Desplat discussed the pressure and inspiration of following such a legendary composer, a task he also faced with the "Harry Potter" series. For "Rebirth," he created new themes while subtly referencing Williams' iconic score, aiming to write memorable motifs in an era of more ambient film music.

This move is part of a broader effort by Tinder's parent company, Match Group, to build trust on the platform amid a rising tide of romance scams.

          <p>Oklahoma City Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has signed a four-year, $285-million contract extension, giving him the richest average annual salary in sports history at $71.25 million. This article analyzes how his mega-deal compares to the largest contracts in other major sports like MLB and the NFL. While MLB players like Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto have larger total contract values due to longer terms, NBA players consistently earn higher annual salaries because of smaller roster sizes and lucrative media deals. The deal solidifies the NBA's position as the most lucrative league for individual player earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

The tax, which targeted projects using components from China, would have added a substantial financial burden to the industry. While its removal provided immediate relief to the market, industry associations caution that the overall bill is still detrimental to renewable energy, as it accelerates the phase-out of crucial investment and production tax credits.

Using a fermentation process similar to brewing beer, the company converts corn-based sugar into a bio-based, biodegradable super absorbent polymer (SAP). This material can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing diaper manufacturing, and the company claims it is approaching cost parity with traditional petroleum-derived SAPs. With backing from investors like Toyota Ventures and Lululemon, ZymoChem's technology could also be applied to other hygiene products and textiles.</p>
