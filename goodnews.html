          <p>In a potential sign of easing tensions, South Korea's military has detected North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border. This action follows South Korea's own dismantling of its speakers earlier in the week, a move initiated by new liberal President Lee Jae Myung to improve relations. For months, the two nations had engaged in a tit-for-tat psychological warfare campaign, with the South broadcasting K-pop and anti-Pyongyang messages and the North responding with irritating noises. While a positive step, tensions could rise again with upcoming U.S.-South Korea military exercises, which the North views as a provocation.</p>

          <p>Officials have lifted the last evacuation orders for the Canyon fire in Southern California, which has burned over 5,000 acres in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. With the fire now 28% contained, crews are focusing on securing the perimeter and managing hot spots. The firefighting efforts were complicated by a regional heat wave, with inland areas experiencing triple-digit temperatures that are expected to continue through the weekend. The fire also resulted in the serious injury of a Kern County Fire Department Battalion Chief, who was involved in a vehicle rollover while working on the incident.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed by a planetary geologist and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old. This makes the space rock about 20 million years older than our own planet. The meteorite is believed to have originated from the breakup of a much larger asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter around 470 million years ago. Scientists plan to officially name the rock the "McDonough Meteorite," marking it as the 27th meteorite ever recovered in Georgia and a rare witnessed fall.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts from NASA's Crew-10 mission have safely returned to Earth, splashing down in a SpaceX Dragon capsule in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego. The crew, consisting of two NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut, concluded a five-month mission aboard the International Space Station. During their 148 days in orbit, they conducted over 200 scientific experiments. This landing marked the first time a NASA-sponsored crew has splashed down in the Pacific, a change made by SpaceX to ensure any discarded debris falls harmlessly away from populated areas.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea made an emotional return to Old Trafford for a pre-season friendly with his new club, Fiorentina. De Gea, who played 545 games for United before his departure in 2023, received a standing ovation from the crowd of over 60,000, giving him the farewell he was not afforded at the time. The match itself ended in a 1-1 draw, with United winning the subsequent penalty shootout. The event highlighted the lingering debate over the club's decision to replace him and the deep appreciation fans still hold for the long-serving Spanish goalkeeper.</p>

          <p>A development partnership has invested over $104 million to convert the abandoned 19th-century St. John's College campus in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, into a luxury apartment building named The Hartby. The project, which began in 2020, preserved the historic building's architectural character while creating 205 modern units, including 62 designated for affordable housing. The developers secured a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church, which had long sought a way to repurpose the deteriorating but beautiful structure. The successful conversion has been embraced by the community for revitalizing a local landmark and providing new housing options.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have led both the FBI and the CIA, has died at the age of 101. Known for his integrity, he was appointed to head the FBI in 1978 to restore public trust after a period of scandal, and later took over the CIA in 1987 in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair. A Republican appointed by presidents from both parties, he was widely respected as a non-political public servant who helped stabilize the nation's top law enforcement and intelligence agencies during turbulent times. His career was defined by a commitment to the rule of law and a willingness to resign rather than compromise his principles.</p>

          <p>An article and a new museum exhibition are shedding light on the career of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch painter who was one of the most celebrated still-life artists of her era, even more famous than Rembrandt in her lifetime. Growing up as the daughter of a famous anatomist and embalmer, Ruysch devoted her nearly 70-year career to perfecting the art of flower painting. Her work is characterized by its scientific precision, dramatic lighting, and complex compositions that often brought together blooms from different seasons and continents. The renewed focus on her art explores its aesthetic, scientific, and moral dimensions, repositioning her as a pivotal figure in art history.</p>
