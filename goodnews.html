          <p>Neysun Mahboubi, a scholar on Chinese law, suggests that historical context provides a hopeful outlook for the future of U.S.-China relations despite current political ruptures. He draws parallels between the present-day post-pandemic disruptions and the period following the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, when academic and cultural exchanges also faced significant hurdles. Mahboubi notes that, similar to 30 years ago, American students are once again acting as pioneers in re-establishing connections, receiving a warm welcome in China that signals a desire for continued engagement.</p>

          <p>Vin Diesel has announced that the final installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise, slated for April 2027, will feature the return of Paul Walker's character, Brian O'Conner.

          <p>A controversial provision that would have mandated the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from a major Republican spending bill. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee, faced strong bipartisan backlash from at least four Republican senators and five House Republicans, who voiced concerns over the privatization of federal lands. Conservation and recreation groups celebrated the withdrawal of the proposal, which they argued was a giveaway to corporate interests and would threaten cherished natural spaces.
