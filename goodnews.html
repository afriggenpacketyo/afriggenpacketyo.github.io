          <p>British lawmakers voted to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, approving an amendment to a crime bill that would prevent women from being criminally punished for ending a pregnancy. The amendment was introduced because police have investigated over 100 women for suspected illegal abortions in the past five years. Under current law, doctors can legally carry out abortions up to 24 weeks, but changes during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed women to receive abortion pills through the mail, leading to prosecutions for illegal abortions after 24 weeks.</p>

          <p>The number of foreign visitors to Japan in May rose 21.5 percent from a year earlier to 3.7 million, setting a new record for the month. South Korea topped the list with 825,800 visitors, followed by China with 789,900. Travel demand has remained strong due to school holidays in some markets and a surge in visitors from China, the Philippines, and the United States. However, Hong Kong saw a decline in visitors, potentially due to concerns related to a Japanese manga predicting a major disaster in Japan.</p>

          <p>The article explores the stereotype that straight men are "bad" at gossip, suggesting it stems from a lack of cultural opportunities and a fear of being perceived as "messy." Social scientists are reassessing gossip as a helpful social tool that builds intimacy and strengthens bonds. The author connects this to the male loneliness epidemic, arguing that men's inability to share and engage in gossip contributes to their dwindling friendships. The article proposes that men could benefit from openly enjoying and seeking out gossip to build connections and combat loneliness.</p>
