          <p>Following two days of trade negotiations in Geneva, the White House announced a 'trade deal' with China, but Chinese officials characterized the outcome as 'consensus' and 'substantial progress.' Details remain scarce, with both sides promising a joint statement soon. While U.S. representatives hailed the discussions as constructive, the Chinese emphasized their consistent stance against trade wars. The talks aimed to de-escalate tensions sparked by tariff escalations earlier in the year, with both sides agreeing to establish a consultation mechanism for future economic issues.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced plans to overhaul the UK's immigration system, including stricter English tests for visa applicants and their adult dependents. Migrants will now need to wait 10 years before applying for settlement, instead of five. The Labour Party aims to create a controlled, selective, and fair system, while critics warn the new rules may split families and make it harder for migrants to settle. The changes also include a fast-track settlement for essential workers like nurses and engineers, and ending care worker recruitment from overseas.</p>
