          <p>Authorities in Pakistan's Punjab province have confiscated eighteen lions that were being kept illegally as pets. The crackdown was initiated after a lion escaped from a home in Lahore last week and attacked a woman and two children, who sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Keeping exotic animals like lions is seen as a status symbol among some wealthy Pakistanis, despite being an offense punishable by jail time. Officials plan to inspect over 500 lions and tigers held in private homes and breeding farms.</p>

          <p>Wimbledon officials have adjusted their electronic line-calling system to prevent a recurrence of a "human error" that occurred during a recent match. The ball-tracking technology was accidentally deactivated for one game, leading to a controversial decision by the umpire. In response, the All England Club has removed the ability for operators to manually turn off the system. The incident has also sparked discussion about implementing a video review system, similar to those used in other major tournaments.</p>

          <p>South Africa's acting cricket captain, Wiaan Mulder, chose not to pursue the Test record for the highest individual score, declaring his team's innings while he was at 367 not out. This left him 33 runs short of the 400 not out scored by West Indies legend Brian Lara in 2004. Mulder stated the decision was made for the team's benefit but also to honor Lara, saying "let the legends keep the really big scores." His act of sportsmanship has been widely noted in the cricket world.</p>

          <p>French Olympic fencer Ysaora Thibus has been cleared of a doping charge after a tribunal accepted her explanation that she was contaminated with a banned substance by kissing her partner. Thibus tested positive for ostarine in January, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed an appeal from the World Anti-Doping Agency. The court found it scientifically plausible that the substance was transferred from her then-partner, American fencer Race Imboden, over a nine-day period, clearing her to compete.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising credit card interest rates, many Americans are considering debt management programs (DMPs) offered by credit counseling agencies. These programs can significantly lower monthly payments by negotiating lower interest rates and waiving fees with creditors. On average, participants can see their interest rates drop substantially and their monthly payments reduced by 30% to 50%. While DMPs require a consistent monthly commitment and often the closure of credit accounts, they can provide a structured path out of debt. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals with overwhelming credit card debt, forgiveness is a potential but complex option. This is typically achieved through debt settlement, where a consumer negotiates with creditors to pay a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed. While this can provide significant relief, it can also severely damage a person's credit score and may have tax implications. The article clarifies that government-sponsored credit card forgiveness programs do not exist, and other options like debt consolidation or bankruptcy might be more appropriate.

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody was a suicide, and found no evidence of a secret "client list" for blackmail purposes. The review, which analyzed over 300 gigabytes of data, confirmed Epstein harmed over a thousand victims but did not uncover evidence to predicate new investigations against uncharged third parties. The DOJ also released security footage showing no one entered Epstein's cell area, aiming to debunk widespread conspiracy theories surrounding his death.</p>
