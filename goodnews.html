          <p>Shoji Nishida, a hawkish lawmaker from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, apologized for and retracted his controversial comments regarding exhibits at the Himeyuri Peace Museum in Okinawa. Nishida initially criticized the museum's portrayal of wartime history, suggesting it implied Japanese soldiers caused the deaths of female students during the Battle of Okinawa. Following backlash from Okinawans and fellow lawmakers, Nishida deemed his comments inappropriate. The museum commemorates over 200 female students and teachers who died during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945, a tragic event where over 200,000 people perished.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Mark Blumberg challenges the traditional concept of animal instinct, arguing that the term is too broad and confusing to be scientifically useful. He prefers the term 'species-typical' behavior, which avoids assumptions about the origins or control mechanisms of these actions. Blumberg emphasizes that behaviors are shaped by a complex interplay of genetics, environment, and learning, rather than being solely determined by innate programming. He uses the example of the tailorbird's nest-building to illustrate how intricate behaviors arise from interactions within a system, involving the animal, its body, and available materials.</p>

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is prosecuting the case, and has tried to narrowly define social networking as a service that links friends and family.
