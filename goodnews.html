          <p>President Donald Trump touted a "planned partnership" between Nippon Steel Corp. and United States Steel Corp., stating it would create at least 70,000 jobs and deliver a $14 billion boost to the U.S. economy. A White House official indicated Trump's social media post suggested he had approved Nippon Steel's plan to acquire U.S. Steel, despite previous concerns about national security risks. The deal is expected to maintain U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh and spur significant investment in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Inspired by calls for alternatives to policing from Black and brown organizers, Seattle leaders launched a third public safety department that responds to mental health crises. Austin has increasingly invested more money in its homeless services since the city diverted millions of dollars from the 2021 police budget to go toward permanent supportive housing instead. Organizers hope the Trump administration‚Äôs commitment to capital punishment and increasing law enforcement will inspire people to again envision alternatives to policing. The defund movement helped catapult the model from the advocacy space into the national dialogue, and continues to inspire change today.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that UK workers continue to work remotely more than most global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week. Hybrid working patterns have become the norm in advanced economies, particularly in English-speaking countries. While some companies have implemented strict return-to-office mandates, home working levels in the UK have stabilized since 2023. The popularity of remote work in the UK is attributed to commuting costs and length. A separate poll suggests many workers would resist full-time return-to-office mandates.</p>

Both at-home and manufactured foods can contribute to a healthy lifestyle, provided consumers monitor key nutritional parameters.</p>

Scientists discovered that the anatomy of ancient invertebrate armor resembled the teeth of vertebrates, suggesting a shared need for sensitivity. Analysis of fossilized bumps in ancient fish revealed similarities to the structure in the invertebrate armor. Modern-day fish embryos also showed nerves in their tooth-like scales, indicating that the armor allowed them to sense their environment.</p>
