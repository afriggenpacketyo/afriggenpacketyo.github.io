          <p>At a summit in Pittsburgh, the Trump administration announced over $90 billion in private investments from major technology and energy firms aimed at developing Pennsylvania's artificial intelligence sector. The plan includes building energy-intensive data centers and an innovation hub to train workers, leveraging the state's natural gas and nuclear resources. Hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, the event featured numerous industry leaders and administration officials, who framed the initiative as a way to create tens of thousands of jobs and establish a new economic era for the region. The announcement follows a recent $20 billion investment by Amazon in the state, though the summit also drew protests from environmental advocates.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from their federal deployment in Los Angeles, which began over a month ago amid protests. The Pentagon stated the move was possible because "lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding." President Trump had federalized about 4,000 troops to protect federal property and ICE agents during immigration enforcement operations, a decision Governor Gavin Newsom legally challenged as an overreach of power. Newsom responded to the partial withdrawal by calling for the remaining forces to be sent home, stating they were being used as "political pawns."</p>

          <h2>Congress Considers Bipartisan 'Genius Act' to Regulate Stablecoins</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 21:10:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation, which already passed the Senate, would create clear rules for the $250 billion market, defining what can be legally termed a stablecoin and allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own. Proponents argue this will foster innovation and enable faster, cheaper financial transactions, while critics point to risks such as the potential for de-pegging from the underlying asset. The bill is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to support the cryptocurrency industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reiterated his country's commitment to economic globalization and free trade in an article published by the Communist Party's leading journal. The piece compiles his statements on the topic, arguing against the rising trends of unilateralism, protectionism, and the building of trade barriers. Xi emphasized that China opposes the use of unilateral sanctions and what he termed "maximum pressure" tactics. This publication coincides with a major supply chain exposition in China and is widely seen as positioning Beijing as a champion of free trade in contrast to the tariff-focused policies of the United States.</p>

          <h2>Chinese State Media Encourages Local Governments to Use Legislation to Boost Economic Growth</h2>

          <p>An article in the Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, has urged China's local governments to use their legislative powers as a "propeller" for economic and social development. Since 2015, hundreds of Chinese cities have been granted the authority to draft local laws on issues concerning urban development, environmental protection, and heritage preservation. The state media outlet highlighted that tailored local legislation creates a stable and predictable environment for businesses to operate within the rule of law. This shift encourages cities to move away from top-down directives and instead use legal frameworks to manage economic issues and adapt to local needs.</p>

          <p>In a pioneering effort to save Florida's coral reef, marine scientists are crossbreeding native Elkhorn coral with a hardier variant from Honduras. Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral, a critical species for reef structure, has been lost due to warming oceans, disease, and coastal development. Researchers hope that the resulting "Flonduran" hybrid will be more resilient to marine heatwaves. The first batch of these crossbred corals was recently planted on a wild reef near Miami, a project that required international cooperation and special permits to transport the coral fragments. If successful, this initiative could be scaled up to help protect Florida's coastline from storm surges.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have revealed two new alternate uniforms for the upcoming 2025 NFL season, sparking a wide range of reactions from fans and players. The first, a bold all-gold "Charger Power" look, features gold jerseys and pants, which some have compared to mustard bottles or the Minions characters. The second is a "Super Chargers" uniform with navy blue jerseys, pants, and helmets, designed as a modern throwback to the team's look from the 1990s and 2000s. The team's business operations president noted the gold design appeals to a younger demographic, while former players praised the nostalgic feel of the navy blue.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. has finalized a trade agreement with Indonesia, setting a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods, which is significantly lower than the 32% he had previously threatened. As part of the pact, Indonesia has reportedly committed to substantial purchases from the U.S., including $15 billion in energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. The deal is one of several the administration has pursued to avoid escalating its planned tariff hikes on numerous global trading partners. The agreement also aims to impose steeper levies on goods that are transshipped through other countries to evade duties. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Central banks in countries with domestic gold production are increasingly buying the metal directly from local mines rather than on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows them to bolster reserves using local currency, avoiding the need to spend foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. This approach is also often cheaper, supports local industry, and helps formalize the small-scale mining sector. Countries like Ghana, the Philippines, and Colombia are among those using this method to build up their gold holdings as the metal's price soars and its appeal as a hedge against geopolitical risk grows.

          <p>Los Angeles County has agreed to a $14 million settlement for Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. Torres was convicted based on shaky witness testimony, despite having an alibi and wearing a cast that would have made firing a gun difficult. His conviction was overturned in 2021 after a review by the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit, and he was declared factually innocent in 2022. The settlement resolves his federal lawsuit, which claimed sheriff's detectives failed to disclose exculpatory evidence and used suggestive questioning techniques during the initial investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) should be renamed "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, commissioned amid debate over the roles, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to distinguish them from doctors and concluded they should not be diagnosing patients. The author found that a lack of a clear national plan for these roles led to them sometimes filling doctor vacancies without appropriate supervision. The recommendations aim to provide clarity for patients and healthcare teams, though the doctors' union believes the review should have gone further.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for a five-year, £50 million renovation project. The ambitious plan involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the historic ironwork, and making the building net-zero in emissions by replacing gas boilers with heat pumps. Opened in 1848, the Victorian glass house and its humid indoor rainforest require significant restoration. The project also necessitates the complex task of moving 1,300 plants, including a 250-year-old cycad that weighs over a tonne and is older than the Palm House itself.</p>
