          <p>The latest Consumer Price Index report revealed that inflation rose at a 3.0% annual rate in September, a figure slightly cooler than economists' predictions of 3.1%. This data, released by the Department of Labor despite the government shutdown, is crucial for determining the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. While President Trump's tariffs are contributing to upward price pressure, the muted inflation figures are increasing expectations that the Federal Reserve will implement another interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting to support a slowing job market.

          <p>Senior Chinese officials have detailed the country's next five-year plan, emphasizing "strategic proactiveness" to manage global turbulence and economic risks. The plan frames the next half-decade as critical for achieving China's long-term goal of "socialist modernization" by 2035. Officials stated that China will leverage its political advantages to shape its external environment and inject certainty into the world economy. A key phrase, "take economic development as the central task," has been reintroduced, signaling a renewed and firm pro-growth stance for the nation's economic policy.</p>

U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to attend and oversee the signing of a peace accord aimed at resolving the century-old Thai-Cambodian dispute, which recently flared into deadly combat. The summit will also address the crisis in Myanmar, where ASEAN's Five-Point Consensus has seen poor implementation, and leaders will discuss whether to send observers for the country's controversial upcoming elections.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 09:23:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will increase the average monthly retirement benefit by approximately $56 starting in January. This annual adjustment, which affects around 75 million beneficiaries, is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index to help payments keep pace with inflation. The increase is slightly above the 2.5% COLA for 2025 and the 20-year average of 2.6%. However, the net benefit increase for recipients will also be affected by rising Medicare Part B premiums, which are typically deducted from their checks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other European leaders in London to bolster support for Ukraine's war effort. The discussions focused on crippling Russia's war economy by targeting its energy sales and utilizing frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine's defense. As part of the summit, the UK announced it would accelerate the delivery of over 100 additional air defense missiles to help Ukraine through the winter. Zelenskyy continues to advocate for long-range missiles to counter Russia's relentless airstrikes, a request that comes amid increased Russian probing of NATO airspace in the Baltics.</p>

          <p>In a historic political shift, the Plaid Cymru party has won the Welsh Parliament by-election in Caerphilly, ending a 100-year period of Labour dominance in the constituency. Plaid's Lindsay Whittle secured 47% of the vote, marking a 27% swing from Labour, whose candidate finished third behind Nigel Farage's Reform party. Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth hailed the result as a momentous win, suggesting the party can now compete in any part of Wales. The loss is a significant blow to Labour's First Minister Eluned Morgan and complicates her government's ability to pass its budget.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United forward Anthony Gordon has been a standout performer in the Champions League, becoming the first player in the club's history to score in three consecutive games in the competition. However, the 24-year-old has yet to score or provide an assist in the Premier League this season, reflecting a broader struggle for the team in domestic play. Manager Eddie Howe praised Gordon's recent performance against Benfica and highlighted the challenge for him to deliver that same level of play consistently. Gordon's journey has been marked by ups and downs, including suspensions that caused him to miss key matches.</p>

          <p>New research from a fossil site in New Mexico suggests that dinosaur populations in North America were diverse and thriving just before the asteroid strike that caused their mass extinction 66 million years ago. By analyzing volcanic glass and magnetic minerals, scientists dated the fossils to within 400,000 years of the impact event. The findings, which include one of the largest dinosaurs ever, Alamosaurus, challenge the theory that dinosaurs were already in decline. However, some experts caution that this study represents only one location and that more global data is needed to form a complete picture of dinosaur populations at the time.</p>

          <p>England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton has been ruled out of the upcoming friendly match against Brazil due to an elbow injury. Her absence ensures that either Khiara Keating or Anna Moorhouse will make their international debut for the Lionesses. Hampton was a key player in England's Euro 2025 victory, and manager Sarina Wiegman acknowledged the injury provides an opportunity for other goalkeepers to gain experience. The match is part of a homecoming series celebrating the team's European success and marks the beginning of a new cycle as they prepare for the 2027 Women's World Cup.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble exceeded Wall Street's earnings and revenue expectations for its fiscal first quarter, driven by strong sales in its beauty and grooming divisions. However, the company reported flat overall sales volume, indicating that higher prices, not increased demand, were responsible for the revenue growth. P&G's CFO noted that U.S. consumers are stretching their budgets by using products to the last drop, with volume declining in the health care and home care segments. Despite this challenging consumer environment, P&G maintained its full-year sales and earnings forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has called off a planned deployment of federal troops to San Francisco, which was intended as a large-scale immigration enforcement operation. The decision followed a conversation with the city's mayor, Daniel Lurie, who reportedly asked for a chance to address local issues himself. The initial reports of the deployment had sparked widespread condemnation and protests in the Bay Area, with hundreds gathering outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda. Despite the cancellation, local organizers and community groups remain on high alert, prepared to respond to any potential future immigration raids in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The portrayal of aliens in popular culture, from the little green men of the 1950s to modern cinematic creations, has consistently mirrored societal fears and preoccupations. Early films used extraterrestrials as metaphors for Cold War paranoia, while later depictions explored themes of corporate greed, ecological disaster, and post-9/11 trauma. The article explores how these narratives often reveal more about human anxieties than about potential otherworldly life. It also draws parallels between the concept of the 'alien' and contemporary issues like migration, colonialism, and the rise of artificial intelligence, which is described as a form of non-biological, alien intelligence.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has stated he is not worried about Mohamed Salah's recent lack of goals, expressing confidence that the winger will return to his prolific scoring ways. Salah, who was the team's top scorer last season, has only three league goals this term as the team adjusts to significant summer signings and a new system. Slot acknowledged that changes in the squad, including the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold, could be a factor in Salah's slower start. Despite the drop in goals, Salah's chance creation numbers remain strong, and he was rested during the team's recent Champions League victory.</p>
