          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks extended their winning streak, defeating the Indiana Fever 100-91 in a hard-fought game. The Sparks capitalized on the absence of Fever's star rookie Caitlin Clark, who was sidelined with an injury, with standout performances from Kelsey Plum and Rickea Jackson. The game was also notable for a brief interruption when a fan threw a sex toy onto the court, an incident that players and officials handled by quickly removing the object and resuming play.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals with orchestrating a scheme to illegally export millions of dollars' worth of powerful AI chips to China. The individuals allegedly ran a company that shipped restricted Nvidia H100 GPUs and other technology without the required licenses, using transit hubs in Singapore and Malaysia to conceal the products' final destination. The arrests underscore the U.S. government's commitment to enforcing export controls designed to protect sensitive American technology.</p>

          <p>A new national poll indicates that one-quarter of Latino voters who supported Donald Trump in 2024 are not certain to vote for Republican candidates in the 2026 midterm elections. The research, conducted by Equis, suggests a potentially fragile alignment, with a significant portion of these voters expressing disapproval of Trump's presidency and feeling that neither political party genuinely cares about them. This uncertainty could pose a challenge for the GOP, which has been banking on solidifying its gains with this demographic.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a medium-security state prison in Norco by fall 2026. This decision is driven by a significant decline in the state's inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The closure is part of a broader trend of deactivating correctional facilities, reflecting the impact of criminal justice reforms and falling crime rates. The future use of the Norco property, which was once a luxury hotel, remains undecided.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Economists Debate Setting Official Consumption Targets to Boost Economy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant debate is underway among China's economists over whether to establish official, measurable targets for consumption in the country's next five-year plan. Proponents argue that setting a benchmark for the household consumption rate—the share of consumer spending in GDP—could help rebalance the economy away from investment and toward domestic demand. However, critics question the feasibility of such a target as a direct policy goal, suggesting it may not be operationally practical for national planners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are optimistic about the return of rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, whose highly anticipated debut season was derailed by a shoulder injury after just eight starts. The Japanese phenom is now progressing well in a throwing program and could rejoin the team by the end of August. The Dodgers have been encouraged by his improved mechanics and addition of a new pitch, hoping he can become a key contributor for their World Series defense, either as a starter or a reliever.</p>

          <p>Meta has announced that its messaging platform, WhatsApp, disabled 6.8 million accounts associated with scams during the first six months of this year. Many of the accounts were linked to criminal syndicates in Southeast Asia, which are known to use forced labor to carry out large-scale fraud operations like fake investment schemes. In conjunction with the crackdown, WhatsApp is introducing new security features to better alert users to potential fraudulent activity, such as being added to a group by an unknown contact.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion from a FEMA disaster mitigation program. The injunction was granted in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its funds without congressional authority. The judge ruled the transfer could cause "irreparable harm" to communities relying on the funds for critical flood-prevention and resilience projects.</p>

          <p>A massive, China-backed copper mining project in Afghanistan's Logar province is finally making significant progress after being stalled for 17 years. The state-owned China Metallurgical Group, which was awarded the contract for the Mes Aynak mine in 2008, says it is ready to begin extraction this year. The project had been delayed by security challenges and the presence of ancient Buddhist archaeological remains, which will now reportedly be protected by a switch to a more costly underground mining process.</p>

          <p>The FBI's annual crime report reveals that crime rates in the United States fell across every major category in 2024, continuing a downward trend from a spike during the pandemic. The data, collected from thousands of law enforcement agencies, shows significant decreases in both violent and property crimes, including a 14.9% drop in murder and a notable 18.6% drop in motor vehicle thefts. While the numbers are promising, experts caution that some crime types, like aggravated assault, remain higher than pre-2020 levels.</p>
