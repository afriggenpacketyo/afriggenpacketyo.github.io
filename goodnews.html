          <p>China is rapidly advancing its deep space exploration program, presenting a significant challenge to the United States' long-held dominance in space. The country aims to land two astronauts on the moon before 2030, with key hardware like the Mengzhou crew capsule and the Long March-10 rocket already in advanced development and testing phases. This progress puts China on a competitive timeline with NASA's Artemis program, which targets a crewed landing by 2027 but faces significant technical challenges, such as the need for in-orbit refueling. The intensified space race is underscored by recent US Senate approval of an additional $10 billion for NASA's lunar exploration efforts.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly from Gen Z, are using artificial intelligence to improve their online dating experiences, with a recent study showing a 333% increase in usage over the past year. AI dating assistants like Rizz and Keepler help users by suggesting replies, refining their tone, and providing conversation starters to break through the noise of crowded dating apps. These services analyze conversation screenshots to offer tailored advice, with some even helping users craft gentle rejection messages to avoid "ghosting." While some users find the technology a helpful confidence booster, experts caution against over-reliance, stressing that AI should supplement, not substitute, genuine human connection.</p>

          <h2>Sex Therapist Identifies Four Common Intimacy Blockers in Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sex therapist with over two decades of experience highlights four common behaviors that can quietly undermine intimacy in relationships, often hiding in plain sight. The first is excessive phone use, which signals a lack of presence and emotional connection with a partner. Another significant blocker is unresolved emotional attachment to an ex, which prevents new connections from forming. The article also points to negativity bias, where self-doubt and assumptions of rejection prevent vulnerability, and the physiological effects of stress, which can act as a major brake on desire for many individuals. The therapist suggests open communication and setting boundaries to overcome these challenges.</p>

          <h2>Negotiating a Raise is a Process, Not a Single Meeting, Says Expert</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to negotiation expert Kathryn Valentine, securing a pay raise is a process that unfolds over several weeks, not a single conversation. She advises against waiting for an annual review, as budgets are often set by then, and instead suggests initiating the discussion during a mid-year check-in. The goal of the first meeting should be to open the dialogue and present your case, not to get an immediate agreement. It is crucial to schedule a follow-up meeting to ensure accountability and to send a summary email with notes to document the conversation. Valentine emphasizes that patience and a collaborative mindset are key to a successful negotiation.</p>

          <p>One year after a near-fatal assassination attempt at a campaign rally, friends and allies of President Trump observe that while he remains largely unchanged, the event has had a noticeable impact. They describe him as more attentive, more grateful, and more openly expressive of his belief that he was saved by divine intervention to serve a second term. The president often recounts the story and has decorated the White House with memorabilia commemorating the moment. Trump himself has stated he feels an obligation to do a good job because he was "really saved," and he believes this was for the purpose of saving the country.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a 9.01% stake in Tripadvisor and plans to engage with the company's management on strategies to enhance shareholder value. Tripadvisor, which operates its core travel guidance platform, the booking site Viator, and the restaurant reservation platform TheFork, is seen as undervalued compared to its peers. Starboard may pursue several avenues, including improving operational efficiency, pushing for the sale of a segment like TheFork to realize sum-of-the-parts value, or exploring the company's hidden potential in AI given its vast user data. A full sale of the company is also a possibility, as Tripadvisor has previously received multiple acquisition offers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering the authorization of new funding for Ukraine's defense, a potential shift from his previous criticisms of aid spending. According to diplomatic sources, this move could be intended to send a strong message to Russia following its recent wave of intense missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities. The administration has access to approximately $3.85 billion in leftover presidential drawdown authority and the power to seize $5 billion in frozen Russian assets for Ukraine's benefit. This consideration follows recent tensions between Trump and Vladimir Putin, with Trump stating that Russia's actions might prompt him to send more defensive weapons to Kyiv.</p>

Following his own successful heart transplant, Micah and his mother, Brittany, created Transplant Teenz, a virtual community to connect teenagers nationwide who are awaiting organ transplants.

Chinese research based on these samples suggests the crater is 4.25 billion years old, a figure derived from direct evidence rather than previous methods like model-based crater counting. However, these findings, submitted to the journal Nature, were reportedly rejected twice by a review panel, highlighting ongoing contention within the international planetary science community. A Beijing-based scientist described the age as the most credible number available, despite not being 100 percent certain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that modern society increasingly restricts children's natural inclination for free, unstructured movement, which is crucial for their physical and cognitive development. With rising sedentary behavior and limited access to safe play spaces, many children are missing out on activities that build healthier bodies, improve cognitive skills, and foster resilience. Injury-prevention experts suggest that such "wild" play helps develop superior movement quality, making children less prone to injury in organized sports later in life. Parents are encouraged to allow for more adventurous play, like climbing trees and wrestling, to help children build a robust movement vocabulary that they may never get back if missed during childhood.</p>

          <p>In her new book "Rich Girl Nation," author Katie Gatti Tassin argues that the significant and recurring costs of maintaining an "acceptable feminine appearance" represent an insidious and often-overlooked financial burden for women. She describes this cycle of spending on hair, nails, and skincare as a "hot girl hamster wheel," where each expense necessitates future spending, effectively creating a depreciating asset. Tassin suggests women conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to understand their financial impact and then experimenting with eliminating services to reclaim money, time, and mental energy. This saved capital can then be redirected toward building wealth through debt repayment, savings, or investing.</p>
