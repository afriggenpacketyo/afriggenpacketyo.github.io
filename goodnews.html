          <p>The mayor of Tulsa has announced a $105 million reparations package aimed at addressing the lasting impact of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. This initiative marks the first large-scale effort to provide redress for the atrocity that decimated the Greenwood District, also known as Black Wall Street. The reparations plan involves raising private funds to support housing assistance, scholarships, and economic development within the affected community, with the goal of revitalizing the area and fostering economic opportunity for its residents. The plan seeks to acknowledge the historical injustices and promote healing and reconciliation through targeted investments in education, housing, and entrepreneurship.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump, is refusing the pardon she received for her involvement in the January 6th Capitol riot, seeking to formally block it with the help of her Republican senator. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the events, believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and undermine the legitimacy of the Justice Department's actions. She argues that accepting the pardon would be an admission of guilt, something she cannot reconcile with her conscience, while other January 6 defendants have actively sought and utilized their pardon certificates. Hemphill's stance contrasts sharply with other Capitol riot defendants who celebrated their pardons, and she anticipates potential backlash from Trump for her decision.</p>

          <p>A significant number of Hollywood stars are Australian, and the article explores the reasons behind this over-representation, and Sarah Snook, currently starring in a stage adaptation of "The Picture of Dorian Gray," discusses the challenges and focus required to play 26 roles simultaneously. The National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) is highlighted as a key institution in Australia's cinematic success, instilling a "can do, will tell, don't wait for permission" attitude in its graduates, while the remoteness of Australia allows actors to develop their talents away from Hollywood's gaze. John Clark, NIDA's director for 35 years, emphasized the development of a distinct Aussie mode of acting, combining the theater of London with Hollywood gloss.</p>

Tuscan artist Michael Monfroni believes that only a human touch can coax the divine out of stone, and contemporary artist Barry X Ball uses robots to create impossible art, and he also acknowledges the criticism that using robots is cheating. Vermont-based artist Richard Erdman says that robots are becoming essential in the changing art world, and that using them reduces mistakes and allows artists to focus on the creative aspects of sculpture.</p>

          <p>A powerful geomagnetic storm is forecast to potentially make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., including as far south as northern California and Alabama, according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. The storm is spurred by a coronal mass ejection, which can disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications, and space weather officials detected a solar flare associated with the geomagnetic storm. The northern lights are caused by solar wind hitting Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, and are typically best viewed in dark settings late at night or early in the morning.</p>
