          <p>Thousands of Orange Order members and spectators participated in annual Twelfth of July parades across Northern Ireland, a major event commemorating the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. The marches are a significant celebration of Protestant traditions and Ulster-Scots heritage, with organizers reporting that this year's events drew some of the largest and most peaceful crowds in a generation. Government officials attended, highlighting the importance of celebrating cultural identity in a peaceful manner, while noting the vast majority of related events passed without issue. The parades, held in various locations including Belfast and Keady, featured numerous marching bands and attracted tourists who remarked on the passion and generational tradition on display.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers secure a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants and snap a seven-game losing streak. Pitching three scoreless innings, the longest outing of his return from Tommy John surgery, Ohtani struck out four batters and allowed only one hit. While bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan was credited with the win, Ohtani's dominant start, which included fastballs reaching nearly 100 mph, provided the momentum the team desperately needed. His continued development as a pitcher is a significant positive for the Dodgers, even as he manages a limited workload.</p>

          <p>England claimed a dramatic 22-17 victory over Argentina in San Juan, securing a 2-0 series win with a last-minute try. With the score tied for most of the second half, replacement Jack van Poortvliet scored in the final moments to ensure a clean sweep for the visitors. The first half was an end-to-end affair, with tries from Seb Atkinson and Freddie Steward for England, while Argentina responded to take a narrow lead at halftime. The win marks England's sixth consecutive Test victory and their tenth in Argentina, capping a successful tour for Steve Borthwick's team.</p>

          <h2>Expert Suggests AI's Impact on China's Population Decline May Not Be Entirely Negative</h2>

          <p>While artificial intelligence is often blamed for exacerbating China's population decline by reducing incentives for marriage and childbirth, some experts are offering a different perspective. Many young people, like 32-year-old Tracy Li from Beijing, feel that AI advancements will eventually fulfill needs traditionally met by family, such as emotional companionship and elderly care. A leading demography expert argues that this technological revolution could redefine family structures and make traditional concerns about population numbers obsolete. This view suggests that as AI takes on more caregiving roles, the societal pressure to marry and have children for support in old age may diminish significantly.</p>

          <p>Global superstar Bad Bunny's latest album and concert residency are amplifying conversations about Puerto Rico's identity, its colonial status, and pressing issues like gentrification. His music directly addresses the island's struggles, with lyrics decrying corruption and the displacement of locals as affluent outsiders move in, drawn by tax incentives. Fans and cultural observers believe his massive platform is bringing unprecedented global attention to the territory's challenges, including its fragile economy and the erosion of its cultural identity. The concerts themselves are a celebration of Puerto Rican folklore, further reviving interest in the island's traditional music and heritage.</p>

          <p>Tensions flared at the end of the third day of the Test match at Lord's, as India's players reacted angrily to what they perceived as England's time-wasting tactics. England opener Zak Crawley repeatedly delayed the final over, ensuring he and his partner would only face one over before the close of play instead of two. England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, dismissed India's complaints, pointing out that Indian captain Shubman Gill had engaged in his own time-wasting by receiving a lengthy massage on the field earlier in the match. The incident added a dramatic conclusion to a day of competitive cricket.</p>

          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have made history, becoming the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 89 years. They secured the championship with a 6-2 7-6 (7-3) victory over Rinky Hijikata and David Pel on Centre Court. The duo, who only teamed up less than a year ago, fulfilled their season goal of winning a Grand Slam, a particularly sweet victory after watching their former partners win the title together last year. Their triumph marks the first time two Britons have won a men's doubles Grand Slam since Pat Hughes and Raymond Tuckey in 1936.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's Marc Cucurella reflected on his journey from a difficult start at the club to becoming a key player ahead of the Club World Cup final against Paris Saint-Germain. The Spanish left-back admitted he struggled initially with the pressure and high expectations after his £62m transfer, but has since found his confidence and adapted his game, notably by playing a more inverted role. A pivotal moment was his performance in the Euro 2024 final for Spain, and he has carried that form into a career-best season for goal contributions. Cucurella expressed confidence in his team's ability to challenge the formidable PSG side.</p>

          <p>An Avro Lancaster bomber from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) made an emergency landing after experiencing an engine problem during a families day event in Lincolnshire. The crew of the iconic World War Two aircraft diagnosed 'unusual engine behaviour' and, as a precaution, returned to its base at RAF Coningsby. Black smoke was seen coming from one of the plane's four engines before it issued a general emergency alert. The RAF confirmed that none of the crew were injured and an investigation has been launched into the incident involving one of only two airworthy Lancasters remaining in the world.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has confirmed that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime kick-offs to mitigate the effects of expected high temperatures. This decision comes after concerns about player welfare were raised during the recent Club World Cup in the US, where one player described the 35C (95F) heat as 'very dangerous.' The host cities of Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver all have covered venues that will be prioritized for daytime matches. Infantino acknowledged that heat is a significant issue but expressed confidence that this logistical adjustment will help ensure player safety.</p>
