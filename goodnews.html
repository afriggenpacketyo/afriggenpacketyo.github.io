          <p>An opinion article posits that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is well-positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to global diplomacy amid rising international tensions. As a leader of a major economic power not aligned with a single ideological bloc, Prabowo could champion a model of "constructive pragmatism." The piece argues this approach, prioritizing cooperation over confrontation, could serve as a corrective for a dysfunctional international system often paralyzed by competing national interests. It suggests the world needs practical action rather than revolutionary rhetoric to address pressing global challenges.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, starring Oscar Isaac and Jacob Elordi. The ambitious Netflix film, which del Toro considers a passion project decades in the making, is noted for its grand scale and physically crafted sets. Early reviews are divided; some critics have praised it as one of del Toro's finest works for its artistry and emotional depth, while others found it lengthy and lacking substance. The film explores themes of humanity and imperfection from the perspectives of both the creator and the creature.</p>

          <p>As the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II approaches, an article examines how revisiting the shared history of Sino-American cooperation could help improve current bilateral relations. It highlights a forgotten aspect of the war where American airmen and Chinese villagers worked together against a common enemy, fostering a sense of camaraderie and mutual support. The piece suggests that focusing on these historical instances of partnership from the ground up could provide a potential formula for rebuilding trust and fostering better ties between the two nations amidst contemporary geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter has released her new album, "Man's Best Friend," which lyrically explores the theme that superstardom has failed to improve her romantic prospects. Following the massive success of her previous album, this new collection details encounters with a variety of unimpressive men, from smooth talkers to crybabies. The album continues her collaboration with producer Jack Antonoff, blending '70s-inspired pop with disco and country influences. While some reviews suggest it isn't as consistently sharp as its predecessor, the album is praised for its witty commentary on modern dating dynamics.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team demonstrated its formidable squad depth by securing a record 92-3 World Cup victory over Samoa, even after making 13 changes to the starting lineup. The win not only secured their place in the knockout stages but also allowed several players to make a strong case for a permanent starting role. Winger Jess Breach was a standout performer, responding to recent criticism with a hat-trick of tries. The performance underscores the intense internal competition within the world's top-ranked team, which coach John Mitchell sees as a key strength.</p>

          <p>Manchester United clinched a dramatic 3-2 victory against Burnley thanks to a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes, providing a moment of relief for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the narrow win failed to mask persistent problems, particularly with the team's goalkeepers, who have made critical errors in recent games. Amorim acknowledged the pressure on his keepers and the team's general struggles, stating that every possession near their box feels like a scoring threat. The victory also came at a cost, with injuries to key players Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount adding to the club's challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid ongoing debate, child development experts generally agree on a precautionary approach to screen time for children, recommending minimal to no exposure for toddlers. For children under three, real-world exploration is crucial for cognitive and motor skill development, while screens can hinder language acquisition and attention control. As children age, guidelines suggest gradually increasing supervised screen time, from 30 minutes for preschoolers to about two hours for older teenagers. Experts emphasize that the quality of content and parental involvement are more important than strict time limits, urging open communication about online activities.</p>

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes has lauded the performance of Jack Grealish, who has made an immediate impact since joining the club on a season-long loan from Manchester City.

Moyes suggested Grealish is thriving with more consistent playing time and is demonstrating the creative edge that was often underutilized at his previous club. The player's resurgent form has reignited discussions about his potential return to the England national team ahead of the World Cup.</p>

This follows other recent health-related discussions, including bruising on his hand and a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency, though his physician maintains he is in "excellent health."</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been identified in three weeks. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams announced new proposals to prevent future clusters, including more frequent testing of cooling towers and expanded inspection capacity for the health department.</p>
