          <p>A British couple, detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months, has safely returned to the United Kingdom. Peter and Barbie Reynolds, who had lived in the country for decades running a charitable training program, were released following negotiations brokered by Qatar. The Taliban never publicly disclosed the reason for their detention, stating only that the couple had broken Afghan laws. Their family had lobbied for their release for months, citing harrowing conditions and deteriorating health during their captivity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to halt the planned shutdown of a U.S. Steel plant in Granite City, Illinois, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. The administration exercised its newly acquired "golden share" rights, a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel. These rights grant the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned against the move, U.S. Steel reversed its decision to idle the facility, marking a significant use of executive power in corporate operations.</p>

          <p>In an interview with The Atlantic, Monica Lewinsky reflected on her journey from being a subject of international scorn in the 1990s to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She discussed how she could not escape her public identity and instead chose to become a "poster child for having survived shame." Lewinsky also spoke about the cultural shifts since the 1990s, the rise of the #MeToo movement, and the importance of women telling their own stories. She emphasized that through this process, she has learned the importance of resilience, authentic relationships, and self-deprecating humor.</p>

Both leaders described the conversation as productive and constructive, covering topics from trade to TikTok. Following the call, Trump announced plans for a face-to-face meeting at the APEC summit and a potential visit to China next year. Despite the positive tone, analysts note that significant points of friction remain, including tariff threats and tensions over Taiwan and the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>A growing number of American students are applying to universities in Europe, the UK, and Asia, driven by the escalating costs of domestic education and the turbulent political landscape in the U.S. Data shows a significant increase in students studying abroad over the past five years. Consultants and admissions services report a spike in interest since the 2024 election, with families seeking more affordable tuition and a different social environment. While studying abroad offers cultural benefits, some students express concerns about navigating international bureaucracy and re-entering the U.S. job market.</p>

After bootstrapping the initial operations and overcoming fundraising challenges, the company has expanded to 90 studios across the U.S. and employs roughly 800 people, demonstrating a successful disruption of a traditional market.</p>

          <p>A leading dermatologist is cautioning that people can be exposed to harmful UV rays even while indoors, as standard window glass does not filter out all radiation. Dr. Adam Friedman explains that while windows may block UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays, which penetrate deeper and are associated with accelerated skin aging and skin cancer. Because UVA rays can also pass through clouds, exposure can occur without any visible signs like burning. He recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily to protect against both types of rays.</p>
