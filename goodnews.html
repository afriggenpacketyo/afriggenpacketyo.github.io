          <p>The US National Guard, comprising the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, is a component of the US Armed Forces Reserve. The National Guard has a wide range of duties, including disaster relief, ensuring internal security, and supporting military operations abroad. While the governor typically commands reservists deployed within their state, the US president assumes command when deployed nationwide. President Trump notably overrode the authority of California's Governor Newsom when deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles during protests against ICE immigration raids, citing national security concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) is calling for 200,000 new blood donors to address a "challenging" blood shortage, aiming to increase the number of regular donors from 800,000 to over one million. The organization is particularly emphasizing the need for more donors with O negative blood, which can be given to the majority of patients, and more black donors, who are more likely to have specific blood types beneficial for treating sickle cell disease. Concerns over blood stocks have previously prompted the health service to issue an "amber alert", indicating that supplies were running low enough to impact patient treatment. The NHS is working to make donating blood easier, opening new donor centers and providing appointments closer to home.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has partnered with Nvidia to launch a "Supercharged Sandbox" that will allow financial services institutions to safely experiment with artificial intelligence. Starting in October, firms can use Nvidia's accelerated computing and AI Enterprise Software products, gaining access to better data, technical expertise, and regulatory support. This initiative aims to address challenges banks face in deploying AI tools due to privacy and fraud concerns. The FCA's sandbox is designed for firms in the "discovery and experiment phase" with AI, helping them harness AI to benefit markets and consumers while supporting economic growth.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing an expansion of the ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method that drags large nets along the seafloor, across English waters. The proposal would extend the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. The announcement comes amid warnings about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on the seabed and marine life. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, seeking the views of the marine and fishing industry.</p>
