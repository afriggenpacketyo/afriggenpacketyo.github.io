          <p>LAFC secured a spot in the FIFA Club World Cup with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Club Am√©rica, highlighted by a late goal from D√©nis Bouanga.

          <p>Japan, a skateboarding powerhouse, has welcomed the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games, despite its potential impact on medal prospects. The decision by World Skate aims to mitigate the risk of severe injuries among younger children attempting increasingly difficult tricks. While some recent domestic competitions in Japan have remained open to younger skaters, organizers express a willingness to support children of all ages. The International Olympic Committee has been tightening age restrictions to protect child athletes following doping controversies.</p>

          <p>Japan has implemented an amendment to its Penal Code, prioritizing rehabilitation efforts in prisons, marking the first significant change to its crime laws in over a century.

The revised law stipulates that inmates can be assigned "necessary work" or undergo "necessary guidance" tailored to their age, characteristics, and other factors. The new system includes 24 programs, such as Daily Care-Senior for elderly inmates and Addiction Recovery for drug abusers, with inmates being sent to prisons that can offer appropriate programs.</p>
