        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and India are reportedly close to finalizing a trade agreement that could see Washington significantly reduce tariffs on Indian exports, from 50% to 15-16%. In return, New Delhi is considering increasing imports of non-GMO corn from the U.S. and scaling back its substantial purchases of Russian oil. President Trump confirmed a phone call with Indian Prime Minister Modi regarding the oil reduction, though India's foreign ministry has previously denied knowledge of such discussions, citing consumer interests in a volatile energy market. The deal aims to boost bilateral trade, which reached a record $132.2 billion in the last fiscal year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has publicly attacked NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, questioning his intelligence and accusing him of "trying to kill NASA." This criticism stems from NASA's decision to open proposals for moon landers to companies other than SpaceX, despite SpaceX holding a $2.9 billion contract for the Artemis III mission. NASA aims to return astronauts to the moon before China and is exploring multiple options due to delays in SpaceX's Starship development. Duffy responded by emphasizing competition among innovators for America's benefit, while Musk maintained SpaceX's rapid progress and ultimate success in lunar missions.</p>

          <p>The NBA season kicked off with thrilling action, as the Oklahoma City Thunder secured a 125-124 double-overtime victory against the Houston Rockets, following a championship banner unveiling and ring ceremony. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 35 points, including decisive free throws in the final seconds, while former Thunder star Kevin Durant faced boos in his Rockets debut. In another Western Conference matchup, the Golden State Warriors defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 119-109. Despite Luka Doncic's 43 points for the Lakers, the Warriors' balanced scoring, led by Jimmy Butler with 31 points and Stephen Curry with 23, proved too much for a Lakers team missing an injured LeBron James.</p>

          <h2>Netflix Embraces AI for Streaming Platform Amid Industry Concerns Over Job Displacement</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has declared itself "all in" on integrating generative artificial intelligence across its streaming platform, aiming to enhance recommendations, advertising, and content creation. The company cited examples like using AI to de-age characters in "Happy Gilmore 2" and assisting with set designs for "Billionaires' Bunker." CEO Ted Sarandos stated AI would help creators tell stories "better, faster and in new ways," expressing confidence it won't replace creativity. However, this stance comes amidst broader entertainment industry anxieties about AI's potential to displace human workers and its use of human-made content, highlighted by previous SAG-AFTRA strikes that secured contractual AI protections for performers.</p>

          <h2>New Theory Suggests Extraterrestrial Technology May Not Be Wildly Advanced, Addressing Fermi Paradox</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 23:25:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new research paper by NASA astrophysicist Robin Corbet proposes a "radical mundanity" theory regarding extraterrestrial civilizations, suggesting they likely lack technology significantly more advanced than humanity's. This theory attempts to resolve the Fermi Paradox, which questions why, if life is abundant, we haven't encountered aliens. Corbet argues that aliens probably don't possess warp drives or wormholes, implying that technological limitations and vast distances prevent interstellar travel and encounters. The article posits that the universe might be "less terrifying" and more mundane than often imagined, challenging the popular notion of wildly advanced alien technology.</p>

He described his 84 days in federal prison as "mentally torturous," with 41 days spent in isolation due to death threats.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gambling advertisements from firms Kwiff and Betway, featuring Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and the Chelsea football club logo, have been banned in the UK. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that these ads were likely to appeal strongly to individuals under 18, violating advertising codes. Kwiff's post on X promoting the British Grand Prix with Hamilton's image and Betway's YouTube ad showing fans with the Chelsea badge were both deemed problematic. The ASA highlighted Hamilton's significant youth following on social media and his appearances in child-rated media as factors in the decision, emphasizing the need to protect minors from gambling influence.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed author Sir Philip Pullman has called on the UK government to amend copyright laws to address "AI scraping," where writers' books are used without compensation to train artificial intelligence software. Pullman, known for "His Dark Materials," argues this practice is immoral and akin to theft, harming creative fields by denying recognition and payment to original creators. He emphasized that while he doesn't oppose the use of his work, it must be compensated. The government is currently reviewing copyright laws concerning AI, with expert working groups established to address the complex issues raised by the creative industries.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops are anticipated to arrive in New Orleans by late November, according to the city's police superintendent, Anne Kirkpatrick. The deployment, requested by Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, aims to support the New Orleans Police Department, which is currently understaffed and needs approximately 300 more officers. Troops are expected to remain through major events like New Year's Eve and Mardi Gras, patrolling between them. Superintendent Kirkpatrick emphasized that this is a partnership to enhance safety, clarifying that the Guard is not there to "take us over" and should not be a permanent fixture outside of major events.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles communities are grappling with rampant copper wire theft, leaving many streetlights in darkness and raising safety concerns. The iconic Sixth Street Bridge, for example, remains unlit after seven miles of wire were stolen, costing millions in repairs. A new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, is set to take effect next year, aiming to curb the problem by increasing responsibility for junk dealers purchasing scrap metal. The bill will require buyers to verify sellers' identities and lawful ownership, make certain scrap metal from public infrastructure illegal to possess, and stiffen penalties for recyclers dealing in stolen public property.</p>

While acknowledging the niche market for such devices, Samsung and Google position the Galaxy XR as a stepping stone to future AI glasses.
