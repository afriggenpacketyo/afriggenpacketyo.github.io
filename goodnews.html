This announcement was made at the annual meeting commemorating Buffett's 60th year at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, where he affirmed his commitment to retaining all his shares.

          <p>The Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, is facing economic uncertainty due to decreased consumer sentiment, with customers sharing meals and reducing orders. Consumer confidence has dropped to levels not seen since the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting restaurant traffic. The diner has paused expansion plans, and retaining staff is challenging due to the gig economy's flexibility. While food prices have remained relatively steady, companies are grappling with rising costs and tariffs, leading to potential price increases and reduced investments.

          <p>Reform UK made significant gains in the local elections across England, taking control of 10 councils and winning the Runcorn and Helsby by-election by a narrow margin. Labour and the Conservatives both experienced major defeats, failing to retain any councils they previously controlled. The Liberal Democrats gained seats and control of three councils, while the Greens more than doubled their number of councillors. The elections indicate a potential loosening of the traditional main parties' grip on voters, with Reform UK gaining substantial ground in former Conservative-controlled areas.</p>
