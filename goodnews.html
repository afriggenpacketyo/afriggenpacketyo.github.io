          <p>Google faces a landmark federal ruling that could dismantle its lucrative default search contracts, potentially jeopardizing over $26 billion annually, including a $20 billion deal with Apple. While this poses an immediate financial risk, some analysts believe it could ultimately benefit Google by freeing up capital to accelerate its generative AI and cloud investments, positioning it for significant future growth. The Justice Department is also advocating for restrictions on exclusive AI distribution deals and mandates for search data sharing, shaping the future competitive landscape of the tech giant.

Bain Capital is currently holding off on a decision, anticipating additional offers, with due diligence expected to conclude swiftly once a buyer is selected.

Following Trump's social media post urging the change, the company's shares rose.
