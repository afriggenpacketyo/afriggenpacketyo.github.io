          <p>President Trump met with Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee to rally support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which includes extending the 2017 tax cuts and increasing spending on military and border security. The bill faces opposition from some Republican senators concerned about its potential to increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Trump is attempting to sway senators who have expressed doubts, while Elon Musk has publicly criticized the bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination." Lawmakers aim to send the bill to Trump by the Fourth of July. </p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is attempting a political comeback in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, despite past sexual harassment allegations. Cuomo faces competition from Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani, who is gaining momentum with a progressive platform focused on rent control and public transportation. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent, adding further complexity to the race. Cuomo's name recognition and previous record as governor give him an advantage, but Mamdani's rising popularity could make the primary competitive. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to require American medical schools to include nutrition courses in their curriculum or risk losing federal funding. Kennedy argues that aspiring physicians are primarily taught to treat illnesses with drugs rather than focusing on preventative care through nutrition. Some nutrition experts have expressed optimism about the proposal, citing the need for doctors to address diet-driven conditions like obesity and diabetes. However, some medical schools claim they already offer sufficient nutrition education, but a 2015 study indicated that medical students spend an average of only 19 hours on required nutrition education during their four years of school. </p>

          <p>Experts analyze the potential for home equity line of credit (HELOC) rates to fall after the Federal Reserve's June meeting. The likelihood of average HELOC interest rates declining after the June Fed meeting will likely depend on what happens directly after the two-day meeting wraps up, not what actually happens in the meeting. Average home equity loan rates are currently higher than average HELOC rates, but the fixed interest rates may be more appealing to homeowners who are uncomfortable with a changing interest rate climate in today's economy. Consumers should shop around for rates and terms to find the best offer. (not investment advice)</p>
