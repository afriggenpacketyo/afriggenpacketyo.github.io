          <p>International pop star Dua Lipa has officially been granted citizenship in Kosovo, the home country of her parents. The ceremony was led by President Vjosa Osmani, who praised Lipa as a significant cultural figure who has gracefully represented Kosovo on the world stage. Born in London to Kosovan-Albanian parents, Lipa has consistently expressed her strong connection to the nation, notably through her charity work and the establishment of the Sunny Hill Festival. This marks her third citizenship, as she also holds passports from the United Kingdom and Albania.</p>

          <p>A new study from Hiroshima University in Japan suggests that a common sweetener could have anti-cancer applications. Researchers found that stevia leaf extract, when fermented with a specific bacterium, demonstrated enhanced antioxidant activity and was effective at killing pancreatic cancer cells in a laboratory setting. Medical experts caution that these are very early findings and the process has not yet been tested in humans to determine its safety or efficacy. While the discovery is seen as a promising step in finding new treatments, it is not expected to lead to immediate changes in patient care.</p>

          <p>A new memoir by Stephen Starring Grant, who became a rural mail carrier after losing his corporate job, is highlighted for its insights into the essential nature of postal work. The book, reviewed in The Atlantic, details how mail delivery provides a sense of order and predictability, especially during national crises. It explores the daily challenges and quiet heroism of carriers who ensure communities, even the most remote, remain connected. The article frames the postal service as a crucial federal bureaucracy that helps maintain a sense of normalcy in an often chaotic world.</p>

          <p>John F. Kennedy International Airport's new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 is visibly taking shape, with its first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. The project, part of a $19 billion overhaul of JFK, will create the airport's largest terminal, dedicated exclusively to international travelers and roughly the size of LaGuardia's two new terminals combined. Designed to be flooded with natural light, the facility will feature a streamlined layout, its own resilient microgrid, and extensive retail and dining space. The development is part of a nationwide push to modernize aging airport infrastructure to accommodate growing air traffic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major restaurant chains are increasingly adding spicy dishes and sauces to their menus in an effort to attract Gen Z and Gen Alpha consumers. This trend is driven by younger generations' preference for bold and adventurous flavors, with companies like Chipotle, Cava, and Taco Bell launching new, heat-focused limited-time offers. For restaurants, adding spice is a low-cost, high-impact strategy to generate buzz and drive sales, especially as consumers pull back on spending. The movement is heavily amplified by social media platforms like TikTok, where spicy food challenges and taste tests frequently go viral.</p>

          <p>Unlike global trends of declining religious affiliation, young people in India are increasingly connecting with spirituality, but on their own terms. India's Gen Z is using spiritual practices, from temple visits to astrology, as a way to cope with modern anxieties and improve mental health. This new engagement is less about rigid rituals and more about personalization, with many finding solace and community through online content and influencers. While some are driven by the current political climate promoting Hinduism, many are simply seeking peace and self-connection in a fast-paced world.</p>

          <p>A Florida mother who endured debilitating pain for months after foot surgery was eventually diagnosed with chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a rare and incurable disorder. The condition, which can occur after an injury or surgery, caused her extreme pain from the lightest touch. After multiple specialists failed to provide relief, she found a physical therapist specializing in CRPS who developed a multi-pronged treatment plan. Through a combination of specialized physical therapy, relaxation exercises, medication, and ketamine infusions, she has been able to regain much of her functionality and improve her quality of life.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that federal agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The Ninth Circuit panel agreed that such sweeps, conducted by the Trump administration, appeared to be unconstitutionally predicated on broad profiles rather than reasonable suspicion of an individual being in the country illegally. The ruling is a victory for immigrant advocates who argued that the "roving patrols" by ICE and CBP agents were instilling fear and violating constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has reportedly taken a significant position in Equinix, a major data center REIT. The move follows a drop in Equinix's stock price after it announced higher-than-expected capital expenditures and a downgraded forecast for adjusted funds from operations (AFFO). With its extensive experience in the data center sector, including a successful campaign at Switch, Elliott may push for changes to amplify returns. Potential strategies could involve improved market communication, cost structure optimization, and financial engineering to enhance shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>
