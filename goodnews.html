          <h2>China Mandates Safety Certification for Power Banks Following Fire Incidents</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has officially introduced new mandatory quality and security regulations for lithium-ion battery packs, including power banks, requiring them to carry a China Compulsory Certification (CCC) before production or sale. This significant policy shift comes in response to numerous fire incidents caused by defective products, which even led to the demise of a prominent power bank brand. While not an outright ban on uncertified devices, the regulation implies potential prohibitions on their use in public vehicles or venues, with civil aviation already enforcing a ban. The measure seeks to bolster consumer safety and rectify a historical lack of stringent quality checks, indicating a proactive step by the State Administration for Market Regulation to address public safety concerns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. airport security program, Clear+, which expedites identity verification at checkpoints, has now opened its membership to international travelers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. This expansion allows eligible foreign visitors to use dedicated lanes at 59 U.S. airports, where their identities are swiftly confirmed via biometric data such as eye, finger, or facial scans, bypassing manual checks. Priced at $209 per year, the service aims to significantly reduce wait times, particularly when combined with other existing trusted traveler programs like TSA PreCheck, which remains exclusive to U.S. citizens. This move represents a notable step towards streamlining travel processes and enhancing efficiency for a wider pool of international visitors entering the United States.</p>

          <h2>The Historical Influence of Martian "Canals" on Humanity's Fascination with Mars</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Humanity's deep-seated fascination with Mars, which continues to inspire ambitious goals like Elon Musk's vision for a Martian city, has historical roots in a 19th-century misinterpretation. Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli's observations of “canali” (channels) were mistranslated as “canals,” leading American astronomer Percival Lowell to popularize the theory of intelligent Martians constructing irrigation systems to survive a drying planet. This widely believed “alien craze” not only spurred scientific inquiry but also deeply permeated popular culture, fostering a societal desire for a utopian, cooperative civilization. Despite NASA’s Mariner spacecraft later disproving the existence of these “canals” in the 1960s, this early, erroneous belief played a significant role in cementing Mars in our collective psyche and motivating the long-term pursuit of space exploration.</p>

          <h2>Tsinghua University Scientists Achieve Breakthrough in Computer Speed Optimization</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 05:17:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of young Chinese scientists from Tsinghua University’s Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences has achieved a significant breakthrough in theoretical computer science, potentially overcoming a 40-year-old mathematical limitation on computer speed. Their new approach addresses the “single-source shortest-paths” problem (SSSP), a core challenge in finding the most efficient path in a network. Unlike the long-standing Dijkstra’s algorithm, which is constrained by an unavoidable sorting step, the Tsinghua team’s method circumvents this by concentrating solely on the shortest distances between critical points. This innovative technique dramatically reduces calculation time, marking a major advancement in computational efficiency. The research has already garnered recognition, winning the Best Paper Award at the prestigious ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has publicly reinforced Beijing’s commitment to supporting the private sector, calling for “no delay” in implementing policies to ensure a level playing field and protect entrepreneurs’ lawful rights. Details from his February speech, recently released, reveal Xi acknowledged that many private businesses have received limited tangible benefits from prior relief measures. He emphasized the necessity of enhancing policy precision to ensure that government commitments translate into concrete, substantive assistance, and that all eligible enterprises receive equitable treatment. This renewed directive signals Beijing’s determination to bolster confidence and address persistent challenges, such as overdue payments, faced by private firms, aiming to foster a more supportive economic environment for non-state enterprises.</p>

          <p>Undefeated British heavyweight boxing prospect Moses Itauma, at just 20 years old, is poised for a significant career moment as he faces Dillian Whyte in Saudi Arabia this Saturday.

Itauma, a southpaw known for his quick hands and power, has amassed an impressive record of 10 knockouts in 12 wins, fueling considerable hype around his potential. While he acknowledges his earlier “naive” ambition to surpass Mike Tyson’s record as the youngest heavyweight champion, Itauma remains focused and self-assured.

          <p>Toni, the beloved young pygmy hippopotamus from Berlin Zoo, is being prepared for a transfer to Mulhouse Zoo in France as part of the European Endangered Species Program (EEP), a critical conservation breeding initiative. Since her birth, Toni has become a public sensation, significantly increasing the zoo’s social media engagement and even attracting a high-profile sponsor in soccer star Antonio Rüdiger. The Berlin Zoo has arranged special “Toni Time” events for visitors to bid farewell, offering a last chance to see her and witness her daily routine, which now includes “crate training” for her journey. This move is vital for the EEP’s efforts to maintain healthy captive populations of pygmy hippos, an endangered species facing threats like poaching and habitat loss, thereby raising crucial awareness for their survival.</p>
