        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Austria's federal government is deprioritizing climate action, Vienna is stepping up its efforts to combat climate change, implementing measures such as mandating solar panels on new buildings, utilizing geothermal energy for heating, and investing in infrastructure to adapt to heat waves and floods. The city has passed a historic climate law, aiming to achieve zero climate pollution by 2040, and is requiring projects to detail both financial and emissions costs. Vienna's actions serve as a model for cities worldwide, demonstrating the impact of local policies on reducing emissions, though some of its initiatives may not be directly replicable in all contexts.</p>

          <p>This week's inflation report will provide initial insights into the effects of President Trump's tariff policies on US pricing. Economists initially feared a surge in inflation due to the tariffs, but early data suggests a slight cooldown in price increases. The report notes that the Trump administration has eased some tariffs since the initial announcement, which may mitigate the overall impact on inflation. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has warned that sustained tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth.</p>
