          <p>An innovative "ice battery" system is being used to cool buildings and lower energy costs, with the Eleven Madison skyscraper in Manhattan utilizing this technology. The system freezes water at night when electricity costs are low, and then uses the ice to cool the building during the day, potentially reducing cooling costs by up to 40%. This approach addresses the issue of peak energy demand during hot days, when air conditioning significantly strains the power grid. Scientists are also exploring new materials that require less energy to store coolness, aiming to make the system more efficient and accessible for residential use.</p>

          <p>A 4-year-old Mexican girl has been granted humanitarian parole to remain in the U.S. and continue receiving life-saving medical care. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security granted the girl and her mother humanitarian parole for one year, reversing an earlier decision to revoke their status. The girl has been receiving treatment for short bowel syndrome since arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2023. The treatment, which is unavailable in Mexico, requires 14 hours a day of intravenous nutrition.</p>
