          <p>President Donald Trump has stated it is "highly unlikely" he would dismiss Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite his ongoing public criticism of Powell's performance. This comment came shortly after reports that Trump had discussed the possibility of firing Powell with Republican lawmakers, which caused instability in stock markets. While continuing to assert that Powell is "doing a lousy job" by not lowering interest rates, Trump clarified that a dismissal would only be considered in an extreme case, such as fraud.

          <p>The family of U.S. Army Air Corps Staff Sgt. Michael Musashe, who went missing in action during World War II, has been reunited with his personalized Zippo lighter after 80 years. The reunion was made possible after a relative saw the lighter, inscribed with Musashe's name, in a Facebook post by a Swiss collector. With assistance from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, the family contacted the collector, who willingly returned the artifact. The airman's 95-year-old sister, who last saw him as a child, was able to hold the lighter, bringing a tangible piece of her brother's memory home.</p>

          <p>A CNBC study has identified the top ten states for workers in 2025, with Texas, Florida, and Georgia leading the list. The ranking considers factors such as workforce education levels, concentration of STEM workers, state training programs, and net migration of skilled labor. The analysis notes that while the nationwide labor shortage has largely subsided, thanks to a cooling job market and AI integration, significant regional disparities remain. States that are succeeding have strong pipelines for career education and are effective at attracting and retaining talent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a federal court ruling that struck down a CFPB rule to automatically remove medical debt from credit reports, consumers must take personal action to address these financial burdens. This article outlines several strategies for individuals to manage medical debt and potentially have it removed from their credit history. Key methods include disputing billing errors, negotiating a settlement with collection agencies, and exploring financial assistance or charity care programs offered by healthcare providers. Consumers are also reminded that credit bureaus have a policy to remove paid medical debts and those under $500.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified IMAX as a standout company within the struggling movie theater industry, citing its unique and successful business model. Instead of operating theaters, IMAX sells or leases its high-end projection and sound systems to theater chains, creating a premium experience that commands higher ticket prices. The company recently reported its best-ever first quarter, driven by strong global box office performance and a growing number of system installations, particularly in international markets. Cramer highlighted IMAX's strategic partnerships with major studios and streaming services as a key reason for its continued momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>"Superman" director James Gunn has shared insights into the new film, which debuted with a strong $122 million domestic opening weekend. Gunn explained that he aimed to create a more humanized and vulnerable version of the character, emphasizing kindness in a cynical world. He also explored Superman's identity as an immigrant, a concept central to the character's creation by the children of immigrants, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The film's central message, according to Gunn, is about extending compassion even to adversaries, a theme he hopes resonates with audiences in their own lives.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market saw a recovery as investor optimism grew regarding the potential passage of key U.S. stablecoin legislation, known as the GENIUS Act. Prices for Bitcoin and Ether rose, along with shares of related companies like Circle and Coinbase, after an initial dip when the legislation stalled in the House. The rebound was bolstered by a statement from President Donald Trump suggesting that some Republican holdouts would now support advancing the bill. Analysts believe the passage of crypto-focused regulation is a matter of when, not if, which could reduce market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Model and author Emily Ratajkowski is returning to acting with a role in the new Netflix romantic comedy "Too Much," created by her friend Lena Dunham. Ratajkowski had taken a break from acting around 2020 to reassess her career and personal priorities, during which time she wrote a book and managed her own career. She explains that the role, which Dunham wrote specifically for her, felt like a natural way to return to the screen. The series explores millennial experiences with aging and fulfillment, themes Ratajkowski says she can personally relate to from her own career reset.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to a powerful performance from its trading division. The bank's trading operations generated $840 million more in revenue than anticipated, with equities trading revenue jumping 36% to $4.3 billion. This success reflects a broader trend on Wall Street, where market volatility from U.S. tariff policies has created profitable conditions for trading desks. Investment banking fees also saw a significant 26% increase, contributing to the firm's overall strong quarterly results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from Deutsche Welle explores the possibility that First Lady Melania Trump is playing a role in shaping President Donald Trump's policy toward Ukraine. The President recently revealed that his wife often points out the contradiction between his "nice" phone calls with Vladimir Putin and Russia's subsequent missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. This has led to a flurry of positive social media activity from Ukrainians, who have dubbed her "Agent Melania Trumpenko." The article notes that her upbringing in the former Yugoslavia may give her a unique perspective on the region's geopolitics.</p>

          <p>Republican senators have indicated they will amend a spending cut package to protect funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The move would spare the globally recognized HIV/AIDS program from a proposed $400 million cut, leaving the total rescissions package at $9 billion. The original bill, which targets foreign aid and public broadcasting, faced bipartisan opposition over the proposed cuts to PEPFAR, a program credited with saving millions of lives. The amendment means the revised bill must return to the House of Representatives for another vote.</p>
