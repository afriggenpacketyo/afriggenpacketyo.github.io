          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to June, defying analyst expectations of a slight decline. Housing inventory reached its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease upward pressure on prices, although the median price still saw a minor annual increase. The market continues to see its strongest activity at the higher end, with a notable rise in transactions from investors and all-cash buyers, suggesting a potential inflection point for the housing sector.

Speaking from the Jackson Hole symposium, Schmid stated that the "last mile" of reducing inflation is proving difficult and that the rate is likely closer to three percent than the Fed's two percent target. His comments contrast with market expectations of a rate reduction and come amidst political pressure for lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Study Questions Effectiveness of Wolf Hunting for Livestock Protection</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 11:07:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study suggests that public wolf hunting in the Western U.S. has had a negligible impact on reducing livestock losses for ranchers. Researchers analyzing data from four states found that killing a single wolf saved only about 7% of a single cow, meaning 14 wolves would need to be killed to save one cow. The findings challenge a key justification for regulated wolf hunts and suggest that non-lethal methods may be more effective tools for managing human-wildlife conflict.</p>

The statue was placed on the seabed in 1954 as a memorial for those who have died at sea and has become one of the most popular diving spots in the Mediterranean.</p>
