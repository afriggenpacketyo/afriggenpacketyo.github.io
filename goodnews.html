          <h2>New Archaeological Evidence Suggests Survivors Returned to Live in Pompeii After Eruption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 18:39:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have found new evidence indicating that people returned to live among the ruins of Pompeii after the city was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. It is believed that some survivors who could not afford to relocate, possibly joined by others seeking shelter, established a precarious settlement within the devastated city. According to the site's director, this informal "favela" existed among the ruins until the 5th century. This discovery revises the long-held understanding of Pompeii's history, suggesting a period of reoccupation that was previously overlooked in the focus on the well-preserved artifacts from the moment of the disaster.</p>

          <p>Brian Robbins, the co-CEO of Paramount Global and head of its film studio, has stepped down from his position. His departure comes just one day before the finalization of Skydance Media's $8.4 billion acquisition of the historic entertainment company. The move was anticipated, as Skydance had previously announced its own leadership team for the studio, which will now be co-chaired by Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein. Robbins, who has led Paramount Pictures since 2021, oversaw major franchises like "Top Gun: Maverick" and "Mission: Impossible" during a tumultuous period for the company that included significant business pressures and ownership uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Following pressure from the White House, Apple has announced plans to increase its investment in the United States by an additional $100 billion. This new commitment will support the creation of new data centers and a smart glass production line in Kentucky, aiming to bring more of the company's supply chain stateside. The announcement was made by President Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook at the White House, with Trump lauding it as a significant step toward manufacturing more Apple products domestically. This move comes as Apple seeks to avoid a new 100% tariff on semiconductors that the president is planning for foreign-made components. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore has retired from the space agency, just under five months after returning from an unexpectedly long mission in space. Wilmore, along with fellow astronaut Suni Williams, was part of the first crewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule. What was planned as a one-week trip to the International Space Station extended to over nine months due to technical issues with the spacecraft. The 62-year-old astronaut ultimately returned to Earth via a SpaceX capsule. Over his career, Wilmore logged a total of 464 days in orbit across three separate missions for NASA.</p>

          <p>England cricketer Chris Woakes has been widely praised for his courage after batting in the final Test against India despite suffering a suspected dislocated shoulder on the first day. With England needing just 17 runs to win, Woakes emerged to bat at number 11 with his arm in a sling, stating he "wouldn't have been able to live with himself" if he didn't try. Although he did not face a ball, he ran four crucial runs before his partner was dismissed, resulting in a narrow six-run victory for India. His selfless act of putting the team first, even with a painful injury, has been hailed as an extraordinary display of sportsmanship.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparison for savers deciding between a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) and a money market account for a $10,000 deposit. While current interest rates are similar for both products, the key difference lies in their structure. A CD offers a fixed rate, guaranteeing a predictable return, whereas a money market account has a variable rate that can fluctuate with market conditions. Given the potential for future interest rate cuts, the article suggests a CD may offer more security and a slightly higher guaranteed return over the six-month period, though it requires sacrificing liquidity.
