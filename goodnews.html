          <p>The UK Transport Secretary has approved plans for a £2.2 billion expansion at London Gatwick Airport, involving moving the Northern Runway to bring it into regular use. This project aims to create thousands of jobs and billions in investment, increasing annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves hails it as a boost for economic growth and tourism, environmental groups and the Green Party criticize it as a "disaster" that ignores climate science. The decision follows previous concerns over traffic and noise, addressed by stricter controls and public transport targets.</p>

          <p>A recent call between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been characterized as "pragmatic, positive, and constructive," indicating a shift towards accommodation rather than escalation in US-China relations. This emerging reality reflects a pragmatic acceptance of mutual dependence despite strategic competition, establishing a framework for global stability. The article suggests that while Trump's previous administration pursued economic pressure, the current interdependence between the two powers in hi-tech and supply chain sectors necessitates cautious competition. This dynamic aims to prevent mutually devastating all-out conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A senior source familiar with the matter indicates that Saudi Arabia's new mutual defense pact with Pakistan is unlikely to disrupt its established energy relationship with India, a major crude consumer. Saudi Arabia aims to bolster its security alliances without compromising its commercial ties, including with India, which remains one of its top oil customers alongside Russia and Iraq. The article also dismisses ongoing speculation about a shift away from the U.S. dollar for Saudi oil trade, affirming the dollar's foundational role in crude exports. Analysts are skeptical of any long-lasting impact on oil prices from regional geopolitical events. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Golfer Shane Lowry candidly discusses his ambition and competitive spirit, admitting a "nice" jealousy towards close friend Rory McIlroy's recent successes, including a Masters win and a second Irish Open title. Lowry, who has played alongside McIlroy since their youth, emphasizes his strong desire to achieve more in his own career, driven by a "fear of not being good enough." As they prepare for the Ryder Cup, Lowry reflects on their past comprehensive defeat and the criticism faced by former captain Padraig Harrington. He is determined to "right that wrong" and contribute to a different European team outcome.</p>

This incident follows a similar one in the previous week's loss to the Philadelphia Eagles and during Super Bowl LVIII. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes also affirmed the strong relationship between Kelce and Reid, despite these public displays of frustration.</p>

          <p>A delegation of US lawmakers, led by Democrat Adam Smith, has visited China to meet with Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Defense Minister Dong Jun. This marks the first reported visit by House of Representatives members since 2019, aiming to "open lines of communication" on peace and security. The discussions come as both countries seek to re-establish military communication channels, which Beijing shut down in 2022 following a visit to Taiwan by former House speaker Nancy Pelosi. The delegation emphasized the need to "recalibrate the bilateral relationship on diplomatic, economic and security issues."</p>

          <p>Build-A-Bear Workshop has emerged as a bright spot in the retail sector, reporting record-breaking revenue in the first half of fiscal 2025 despite tariffs and declining mall traffic. The company's success is attributed to its strategic diversification beyond traditional mall storefronts into cruise ships and amusement parks, alongside its effective tariff mitigation strategies. By leaning into the brand's nostalgia, Build-A-Bear has successfully targeted adults and "kidulting" trends, fostering strong emotional connections with consumers across generations. Analysts highlight the company's ability to discreetly raise prices and its high return on international store capital as key drivers of its continued growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quarterback Caleb Williams delivered a breakthrough performance, leading the Chicago Bears to a dominant 31-14 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, providing a much-needed spark for the struggling franchise. After an uneven start to the season, Williams showcased his potential with an explosive offense, highlighted by a 65-yard touchdown pass. He finished with career highs in yards per attempt and passer rating, crucially without taking a single sack. This article details how Williams found a balance between structured play-calling and his improvisational style, offering a glimpse of the team's potential under new head coach Ben Johnson, despite lingering questions about consistency.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Key Differences Between ETFs and Mutual Funds for Investors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds, while both offering diversified investment baskets, have key differences that impact investors. ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange, providing real-time pricing, whereas mutual fund transactions are processed at day-end prices. A significant advantage of ETFs is their tax efficiency, particularly in taxable brokerage accounts, due to "in-kind" transactions that often avoid capital gains distributions common in mutual funds. Additionally, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios, making them cheaper to own. However, mutual funds offer a larger universe of options and are more commonly available in 401(k) plans.

          <p>A Citi Private Bank survey reveals that family offices, investment firms of the ultra-wealthy, are optimistic about their returns, with most expecting 5-10% or more for 2025. Seven out of ten family offices made direct investments in private companies, showing increased exposure to risk assets driven by bullish long-term trends like AI and infrastructure. However, optimism for direct private-equity investments has slightly dimmed from the previous year, and there's a notable retreat from startup and early-stage investing. Family offices are becoming more selective, focusing on growth-stage investments and opportunistic plays in secondary sales, leveraging their reliable cash flow from operating businesses.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neurologists are recommending walnuts as a key food to help reduce the risk of dementia, a condition marked by cognitive decline. Walnuts are highlighted for their rich content of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid, and potent antioxidants, which are crucial for brain and heart health. The article explains that omega-3s may reduce inflammation and protect neurons, while antioxidants counteract oxidative stress linked to aging. Additionally, walnuts support cardiovascular health, which is closely tied to brain function. Other expert-backed tips for cognitive health include following the MIND diet, staying physically active, ensuring good sleep, and engaging in mental challenges.</p>
