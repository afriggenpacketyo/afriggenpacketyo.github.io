          <p>Negotiations between the UK and EU are ongoing before a summit, aiming to address issues like youth mobility, airport e-gate access for UK passport holders, trade, security, and fishing rights. The minister for UK-EU relations emphasizes a focus on jobs, lower household bills, and stronger borders, but declines to provide specific details. A potential youth mobility scheme, allowing young people to move abroad for up to two years, is under discussion, drawing mixed reactions from opposition parties. Concerns are raised about potential compromises on fishing rights and access to EU defense funds, with some describing the deal as a 'surrender'.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent armed clashes between India and Pakistan have revealed a proving ground for competing military technologies, particularly Chinese military hardware facing off against Western and Russian systems. Pakistan's arsenal, shaped by defense cooperation with China, increasingly incorporates advanced Chinese air and missile systems, drones, and multirole fighters. The price differential between Chinese and Western military systems is substantial, potentially reshaping global defense procurement and strategic alignments. The battlefield testing of Chinese weapons systems may signal a paradigm shift in global military dynamics, challenging the long-held dominance of Western military technology.</p>

          <p>Consumers are being warned about a 'brushing' scam where they receive unsolicited packages, often containing low-value items, which are used by third-party sellers to manipulate online product reviews. The scammers send these items to random people using names and addresses found online, then leave fake five-star reviews using the recipient's name. Postal inspectors caution against scanning any QR codes included in these packages, as they can lead to malicious websites that steal personal data or install malware. If you receive an unexpected package, do not scan QR codes, check your financial accounts, and report the package to authorities.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick disclosed that he spent $5,000 on special milk for Tom Brady to keep his relationship with Antonio Brown positive during Brown's brief time with the New England Patriots. Brown ordered the milk, which was part of Brady's nutrition-oriented lifestyle, but it spoiled in the mailroom. Belichick approved the expense to avoid ruining the relationship between the two players. Though Brown's tenure with the Patriots was short, he and Brady later won a Super Bowl together with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>
