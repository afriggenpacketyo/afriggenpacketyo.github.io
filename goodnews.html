          <p>A New York judge has ruled that advanced whole genome sequencing can be used as evidence in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann, setting a new legal precedent for the state. This cutting-edge DNA testing method, which can analyze degraded and rootless hair samples, linked Heuermann and his family to hair strands found on several victims. While prosecutors hailed the decision as a major victory, the defense challenged the ruling, arguing the lab used is not licensed in New York and that the science is inconclusive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it froze $2.2 billion in federal research grants for Harvard University. Judge Allison Burroughs determined the funding halt was unconstitutional retaliation for the university's refusal to comply with administration demands regarding its diversity programs and other policies. The ruling vacates the freeze orders, which had impacted numerous critical research projects unrelated to the administration's stated concerns about antisemitism on campus. The judge suggested the focus on antisemitism was a pretext for an "ideologically-motivated assault" on universities.</p>

          <p>Veteran all-rounder Ravi Bopara scored a spectacular 45-ball century to lead Northamptonshire to a seven-run victory over Surrey in a rain-shortened T20 Blast quarter-final. The 40-year-old's unbeaten 105 guided his team to a total of 154-4 from their 14 overs after an early setback. Despite a strong effort from Surrey's captain Sam Curran, who scored an unbeaten 69, his team fell short in the chase. The victory secures Northamptonshire's first appearance at the prestigious Finals Day since they won the competition in 2016.</p>

          <p>Félix Auger-Aliassime has advanced to the US Open semi-finals for the second time in his career after a hard-fought victory over eighth-seed Alex de Minaur. The Canadian player won the tense, four-hour match with a score of 4-6, 7-6 (7), 7-5, 7-6 (4). The win marks a significant return to form for Auger-Aliassime, who has struggled with injuries and confidence in recent years. For de Minaur, it was another disappointing quarter-final exit, marking his sixth time failing to advance to a Grand Slam semi-final.</p>

          <p>Montell Jordan, the singer best known for the 1995 hit "This Is How We Do It," has revealed that his prostate cancer has returned, despite undergoing a radical prostatectomy last year. Now a pastor based in Georgia, Jordan explained that a follow-up exam detected a small number of cancer cells, and he will begin proton radiation therapy. The 56-year-old is speaking publicly about his experience to encourage other men, particularly Black men, to be proactive about their health and to show that it is okay to be vulnerable while navigating a diagnosis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has introduced a new bill aimed at banning members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The Restore Trust in Congress Act consolidates several previous proposals and has support from across the political spectrum, including both conservative and progressive lawmakers. The bill would require lawmakers to sell their individual stocks shortly after taking office and would impose financial penalties for violations. Supporters argue the ban is necessary to eliminate potential conflicts of interest and restore public trust. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI is expanding its secondary share sale, allowing current and former employees to sell up to $10.3 billion in stock, a significant increase from the initial $6 billion target. The transaction values the artificial intelligence leader at $500 billion, a substantial jump from its previous $300 billion valuation earlier in the year. This type of sale provides liquidity for employees and early investors without the company needing to go public. A consortium of prominent investors, including SoftBank and Thrive Capital, is participating in the purchase of the shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups have negotiated an agreement with the Department of Justice to prevent approximately 98,000 North Carolina voters from being purged from the rolls. The DOJ, under President Trump, had sued the state to block voters who registered without providing a driver's license or partial social security number. The new agreement allows these voters to provide the required information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively curing the issue without disenfranchising them. A federal judge must still approve the settlement.</p>
