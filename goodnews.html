          <p>Lifestyle personality Martha Stewart, 84, has revealed that her viral "thirst trap" photos on social media have led to a significant number of people sending her flirtatious direct messages. During an appearance on the "Today" show, she confirmed that while she receives many propositions, she is currently single and finds happiness in her friendships. Stewart first gained attention for these posts in 2020 with a sultry poolside selfie, and she has since embraced the provocative and fun nature of sharing such images, which she says has led to new opportunities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has found evidence of recent landslide activity on the moon, challenging the long-held belief that the moon is geologically dormant. By comparing high-resolution images taken since 2009, researchers identified 41 new landslides that appear to have been triggered by moonquakes. This discovery, published in the National Science Review, has significant implications for future lunar missions and the safety of establishing permanent human bases on the moon's surface. The findings underscore the need to assess geological hazards when planning for deep-space outposts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed five new bills aimed at protecting residents from federal immigration enforcement operations directed by the Trump administration. The most prominent new law, the No Secret Police Act, will prohibit on-duty federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings and require them to be identifiable by name and badge. Other laws will restrict immigration agents' access to schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant and require schools to notify families of ICE presence on campus. These measures are being framed as a form of resistance against perceived federal overreach.</p>

The article reflects on his journey from a top prospect to a three-time MVP, celebrating him as one of the greatest players of his generation. Despite the Angels' lack of team success and his time missed due to injuries, Trout's loyalty to the franchise and his consistent on-field excellence are highlighted as defining aspects of his legacy.

          <h2>Used Electric Vehicle Sales Surge as Consumers Discover Lower Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 20:35:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite general economic caution among consumers, sales of used electric vehicles have skyrocketed, with a reported 40% spike in July. This surge is largely attributed to the discovery that pre-owned EVs are often priced lower than comparable cars with internal combustion engines, even before factoring in savings on fuel and maintenance. The trend indicates a growing consumer appetite for electric cars, challenging the perception that they are prohibitively expensive. This shift is occurring even as the overall automotive industry faces headwinds from economic uncertainty and increased competition in the EV market.</p>

          <p>German media outlets are reporting that Evelyn Palla will be appointed as the first female CEO of Deutsche Bahn, the country's national railway operator. The 52-year-old, who currently heads the company's regional subsidiary DB Regio, is expected to be officially named by Germany's Transport Minister. Her appointment comes as Deutsche Bahn faces significant challenges, including widespread delays and cancellations that have been blamed on aging infrastructure.

          <p>An article details the story of Giulia Baccosi, a woman who accepted a last-minute job as a cook on a cargo ship just before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world in 2020. What was meant to be a three-month voyage turned into a 188-day ordeal at sea, as ports closed and global travel ground to a halt. During her time on the schooner Avontuur, she and the crew rescued migrants off the African coast, faced dwindling supplies, and navigated the emotional toll of being isolated from their families during a global crisis, unable to set foot on land.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has reiterated his prediction that artificial intelligence and robotics will replace all human jobs by approximately 2030, leading to a future of "sustainable abundance." In his view, this technological shift will make a "universal high income" necessary, going beyond the concept of a basic safety net to provide everyone with the best food, housing, and healthcare. While Musk presents an optimistic, utopian vision of a post-work society, his forecast has prompted skepticism regarding the political and economic feasibility of funding such a massive overhaul of the social structure.</p>

          <p>Creatine, a supplement widely known for enhancing athletic performance and muscle mass, is now being investigated for its potential cognitive benefits. A growing but still limited body of research suggests that it could help improve short-term memory, mood, and focus. The article explores whether creatine could be effective in clearing "brain fog," a common symptom for women in perimenopause or those suffering from post-viral conditions. While experts find the research promising, they caution that more studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and note it may only be effective for individuals under certain kinds of stress.</p>
