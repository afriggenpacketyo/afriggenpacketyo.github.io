          <p>Hong Kong's capital markets are experiencing a resurgence, with Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals, China's largest pharmaceutical company, initiating a billion-dollar IPO. The company aims to raise HK$9.89 billion (US$1.27 billion) through a share sale, signaling renewed confidence in the city's financial landscape. This development follows a period of market stagnation, with the total market capitalization of Hong Kong-traded stocks increasing significantly compared to the previous year. The IPO reflects positive earnings reports from some firms amidst ongoing US-China trade dynamics. Hengrui's earnings surged in 2024, and the IPO price offers a discount to attract investor interest in the offshore listing.</p>

The deal includes 130 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 30 of the delayed 777-9s, with options for 50 more. Qatar Airways also signed an agreement with GE Aerospace for over 400 engines to power these planes. The agreement was formalized during President Trump's state visit with the Emir of Qatar.

          <p>Singapore's Changi Airport has commenced construction of its fifth terminal, projected to be operational by the mid-2030s, in anticipation of a surge in air travel demand within Asia. The new terminal will nearly double the airport's existing area, increasing its capacity to handle 140 million passengers annually. This expansion positions Changi to connect with 200 cities, up from its current 170, further solidifying its role as a major aviation hub.

          <p>A manuscript acquired by Harvard Law School in 1946 for a mere $27.50, initially believed to be an unofficial copy of the Magna Carta, has now been authenticated as a genuine original from 1300, during the reign of King Edward I. Two UK academics identified the document as one of the world's most valuable documents, highlighting its significance in constitutional history. The professors believe the document originated from Appleby, Cumbria, tracing its ownership through the Lowther family and abolitionist Thomas Clarkson before its auction at Sotheby's. The discovery underscores the importance of preserving and making historical collections accessible to scholars, potentially leading to public display of the document.</p>

This discovery makes it one of only seven such documents from that period still in existence. The authentication involved comparing the manuscript with other originals and utilizing spectral imaging.

          <p>A Communist Party journal in China has asserted that the country possesses the financial strength to establish a market stabilization fund, citing its robust economy and substantial foreign exchange reserves. This proposal aims to safeguard the capital market and protect investors amidst economic instability stemming from the US-China trade war. The journal emphasizes that China's enhanced regulatory capabilities would ensure the effective operation of such a fund. The fund would mitigate irrational market volatility, drawing parallels to interventions used by major economies during stock market crises, such as Hong Kong's actions during the 1997 Asian financial crisis.</p>

Analysts suggest that Sara Duterte, now likely to survive an impeachment trial, could become a formidable candidate in the 2028 presidential election. Her "pragmatic" stance on China could lead to improved relations if she wins the race.

The new law will allow State Owned Investors (SOIs) - including sovereign wealth funds, public pension or social security schemes - to take a stake in UK newspapers.

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, signaling progress against the opioid crisis. Data from the CDC revealed a nearly 27% drop in drug fatalities nationwide, with decreases in all major drug categories and most states. Public health experts attribute this to changes in the illicit drug supply, increased access to treatment, and the use of naloxone. However, these gains are threatened by proposed budget cuts to federal health programs. The data was released as Mr. Trump‚Äôs health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was testifying on Capitol Hill about the administration‚Äôs proposed cuts to many federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis.</p>
