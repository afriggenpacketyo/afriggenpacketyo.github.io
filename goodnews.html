While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the system as a "PhD-level expert in anything," some Chinese analysts characterized it as an incremental improvement rather than a revolutionary breakthrough. The reaction highlights the heightened competition and high expectations within the global AI landscape, where Chinese companies are also rapidly developing their own advanced models.</p>

          <p>China is moving forward with the development of the Xinjiang-Tibet Railway, a significant infrastructure project designed to create a strategic 2,000km (1,240-mile) artery linking its northwestern and southwestern regions. The route will connect Hotan with the existing line at Shigatse, traversing a challenging high-altitude environment. This railway is a key component of China's broader ambition to establish a comprehensive 5,000km plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by the year 2035.</p>

          <p>Travelers can face significant extra charges for using their phones abroad, but several strategies can mitigate these costs. Options include switching to a carrier with inclusive international roaming, such as certain T-Mobile plans, or purchasing a local or international eSIM for cheaper data access. Another effective method is to rely heavily on Wi-Fi, which can be optimized by downloading offline maps and other necessary content before leaving home, ensuring connectivity without incurring high roaming fees.</p>

          <p>The popular Perseid meteor shower, which peaks in mid-August, is expected to be less spectacular this year due to the presence of a bright full moon. This annual celestial event, caused by Earth passing through the debris trail of the Swift-Tuttle comet, is known for producing bright fireballs. While NASA states that viewing conditions are not ideal, astronomers suggest that patient observers may still be able to spot some meteors in the Northern Hemisphere during the predawn hours.</p>

          <h2>Nutritionists Favor Oatmeal Over Smoothies for Sustained Morning Energy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the debate between oatmeal and smoothies for a healthy breakfast, nutrition experts suggest oatmeal holds a slight advantage for providing sustained energy. Due to its solid form and complex carbohydrates, oatmeal digests more slowly, which helps maintain fullness for a longer period. While both can be nutritious choices, experts recommend enhancing either meal with protein and fiber, such as adding nuts to oatmeal or Greek yogurt to a smoothie, to maximize their energy-boosting benefits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant de-escalation, North Korea has started dismantling some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the border it shares with South Korea. This move is a direct response to South Korea halting its own broadcasts, which included playing K-pop music and news reports, in a gesture aimed at easing tensions. The reciprocal action is one of the first since South Korea's new president took office and reflects a renewed effort to reopen dialogue after a period of heightened animosity.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has officially approved the revival of a long-stalled project to build a bridge across the Strait of Messina, connecting Sicily to the mainland. The project, estimated to cost €13.5 billion, aims to be the world's longest single-span suspension bridge and is touted as a major economic stimulus for southern Italy. Despite government backing, it faces significant hurdles, including its location in a seismically active zone, environmental concerns, and strong opposition from local groups.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the American astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and famously guided it safely back to Earth, has died at the age of 97. A veteran of four spaceflights, he was the first person to travel to the Moon twice but never had the chance to land on it. NASA and his family remembered him as a national hero whose unshakeable optimism and steady leadership turned a near-certain tragedy into one of the most celebrated triumphs in the history of space exploration.</p>

          <p>Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has ended his high-profile attempt to switch to the NFL, leaving the Jacksonville Jaguars to return to his original sport. His decision was influenced by a combination of factors, including a back injury, a coaching change at the Jaguars, and growing opportunities back in the world of rugby. While he showed promise, experts suggest the immense athletic and technical leap required to excel in the NFL proved formidable, leading him to return to the sport where he is already an established star.</p>
