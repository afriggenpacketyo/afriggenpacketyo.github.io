          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO, effective January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain as chairman. This decision, revealed during the annual shareholder meeting, assures shareholders that the 94-year-old 'Oracle of Omaha' will still be available to assist with major investment opportunities, especially in volatile markets. Buffett emphasized that Abel, 62, will have the final say on company operations and capital deployment during the transition.

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures declined following OPEC+'s decision to increase production for the second consecutive month, adding 411,000 barrels per day in June. This move, nearly triple Goldman Sachs' forecast, raised concerns about an oversupplied market, contributing to a more than 20% drop in oil prices this year. Oilfield service firms anticipate reduced investment in exploration and production due to the weak price environment. Goldman Sachs forecasts U.S. crude and Brent prices to average $59 and $63 per barrel, respectively, for the year.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for new overpayment notices from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, which include retirement, survivors, and disability insurance, while the rate for Supplemental Security Income benefits remains at 10%. Experts, however, still warn that even a 50% clawback can cause financial hardship for beneficiaries who rely on these payments for essential needs. Overpayments occur due to various reasons, such as unreported changes in circumstances or agency errors. Beneficiaries have 90 days to request a lower rate, reconsideration, or waiver of recovery.</p>
