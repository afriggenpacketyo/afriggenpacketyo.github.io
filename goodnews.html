          <p>China's industrial profits saw a 3% rise in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The growth occurred even with the U.S. imposing tariffs, though both countries later agreed to reduce some levies following a trade truce. Despite the profit increase, manufacturing activity in China fell more than expected, and retail sales growth slowed. Exports to the U.S. also plunged, but overall exports surged due to increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations. (not investment advice)</p>
