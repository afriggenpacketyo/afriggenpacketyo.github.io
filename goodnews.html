          <p>The Federal Reserve held its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing a cautious approach while monitoring the impact of President Trump's tariffs.  The Fed's forecast indicates some inflation concerns, predicting a rise in the personal consumption expenditures index.  Despite Trump's calls for rate cuts, the Fed anticipates two quarter-point cuts in 2025 and further reductions in subsequent years.  This decision reflects the Fed's balancing act between inflation and economic growth.</p>
