        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Schools across the United States are adopting Yondr pouches, a lockable magnetic case, to enforce classroom cellphone bans and reduce student distraction. Districts in at least 35 states have begun using the system, where students keep their phones in the locked pouches throughout the school day, unlocking them only at magnetic stations upon dismissal. While some students and educators praise the initiative for increasing social interaction and focus, others raise concerns about the cost, which can be up to $30 per student. Proponents argue the pouches help create a healthier learning environment by encouraging students to engage with their surroundings rather than their screens.</p>

          <p>Zach Yadegari, an 18-year-old entrepreneur, is the co-founder and CEO of Cal AI, a mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to estimate the calorie count of food from a photograph. Launched in May 2024, the app has quickly achieved significant financial success, reportedly bringing in $1.4 million in gross profit per month. Yadegari, who began coding at age seven, developed the app to simplify the tedious process of manual calorie tracking. Now a freshman at the University of Miami's business school, he plans to leave college within a year to focus on his company full-time and pursue a career as a serial entrepreneur.</p>

          <p>Despite former President Trump's repeated claims that Chicago is the nation's most dangerous city, an analysis of 2024 crime data reveals that the four cities with the highest murder rates are all located in Republican-led states. Jackson, Mississippi; Birmingham, Alabama; St. Louis, Missouri; and Memphis, Tennessee, all have significantly higher homicide rates per capita than Chicago. The article highlights that violent crime has been falling nationwide, with Chicago's homicide rate on pace for a significant decline. This data suggests that political rhetoric often focuses on Democratic-led cities while ignoring more severe violence in other regions, creating a distorted public perception of crime trends.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying its anti-corruption campaign within the financial sector, a move that analysts believe is designed to establish a cleaner governance model and ultimately attract more overseas investment. While the crackdown may create short-term uncertainty, it addresses the demands from international institutions for more transparent and predictable markets. The investigation of high-profile figures in banking and the stock market signals Beijing's commitment to rooting out illicit practices. This long-term strategy is expected to bolster confidence by aligning the country's financial systems with global standards of conduct and accountability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, one of the American Revolution's most devastating defeats for the Continental Army. Now, in what is being called "the ultimate cold case," forensic genealogists are using advanced DNA analysis to identify these forgotten soldiers and connect them with living descendants. The team has already built genetic profiles for two individuals, yielding over 25,000 potential relatives and narrowing the search to specific family names from the era. This effort aims to restore the identities of these first American soldiers, who were buried hastily on the battlefield over 240 years ago.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden is beginning the process of establishing his presidential library, confirming it will be located in his home state of Delaware. A newly formed 13-person board, including former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and chaired by fundraiser Rufus Gifford, will oversee the project. The team faces the significant challenge of raising hundreds of millions of dollars in a politically polarized climate that may deter some traditional corporate donors. The library is envisioned as a museum detailing his presidency and a center for civic engagement, policy, and leadership, continuing the tradition of post-presidency legacy projects.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom will conduct its second national test of the emergency alert system this Sunday, sending a message to millions of 4G and 5G mobile phones around 3:00 PM BST. The system is designed to warn the public of life-threatening events such as extreme weather or terror attacks. The alert will cause compatible phones to vibrate and emit a siren sound for about ten seconds. This test follows a previous one in April 2023 that experienced technical glitches, which the government says have since been addressed. While officials recommend keeping the alerts enabled, users have the option to opt out through their phone's settings.</p>

          <p>Scotland's momentum in the Women's Rugby World Cup was halted by a formidable Canadian team, resulting in a defeat that places them on a likely collision course with host nation England in the quarter-finals. Despite a strong effort, including tries from Rhona Lloyd and Evie Gallagher, the Scots were unable to overcome the world's number two ranked side. Canada secured the top spot in Pool B with their victory. The result means Scotland will advance to the knockout stage but will face the winner of the Pool A decider between England and Australia, a challenging prospect for the aspiring team.</p>

A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) named "Emmy" descended over 1,500 feet, providing a unique glimpse into the ancient lake's ecosystem, which is estimated to be 2 to 3 million years old. The event, sponsored by environmental non-profits, aimed to raise awareness about the lake's unique geography and the importance of conservation efforts. Experts discussed the lake's history and unique deep-water ecosystems, while also dispelling popular myths about mafia bodies preserved in the cold depths.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, an activist investor with a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo, has presented a detailed plan to the company's board aimed at improving performance and reaccelerating growth. The proposal calls for greater focus on core brands, strategic reinvestment, and shedding underperforming assets. Key recommendations include refranchising Pepsi's bottling network to improve margins in its North American beverage business and divesting the Quaker brand to concentrate on the more profitable Frito-Lay snack division. Elliott argues these changes could unlock significant shareholder value, potentially increasing the stock price by over 50%. (not investment advice)</p>

She points out that homeownership can limit career mobility and that the current market makes it difficult for existing owners to move without facing higher costs. For her, renting provides the freedom to adapt to life's changes without being tied down by a mortgage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book showcases the previously unpublished jazz photography of Lisette Model, a Viennese Jewish émigré renowned for her street photography. In the early 1950s, Model embarked on a project to document America's jazz scene, capturing both the rapturous joy of audiences and the profound wariness of musicians like Duke Ellington and Miles Davis. The project, which was to include an essay by Langston Hughes, was ultimately abandoned after Model came under investigation by the FBI during the McCarthy era. These rediscovered images offer a poignant look into the era, reflecting the shared experiences of persecution between the photographer and her subjects.</p>

At Arsenal, Venkatesham was known for his role in appointing manager Mikel Arteta, championing the women's team, and providing empathetic leadership during the pandemic. He is described as an inclusive and understated leader who relies on football experts for on-pitch decisions. His appointment signals a significant cultural shift for Spurs, potentially moving away from Levy's famously tough negotiation style toward a more collaborative approach.</p>

          <p>A mother's intuition that her toddler's constant illnesses were abnormal led to a devastating diagnosis of malignant rhabdoid tumor, a rare and highly aggressive cancer. After Jonny Terrell's pediatrician initially dismissed his symptoms, his mother, Emily Robichau, pushed for more tests, which revealed a grapefruit-sized tumor in his liver. Despite a grim prognosis, a team at Massachusetts General Hospital developed an individualized treatment plan involving intensive chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. Now just over two years old, Jonny is in remission and undergoing careful surveillance, a hopeful outcome for a disease that has a very low survival rate.</p>

Recent breakthroughs include the FDA approval of a blood test for early Alzheimer's diagnosis and growing evidence from studies like the U.S. POINTER Study, which showed cognitive improvement in at-risk individuals through lifestyle changes. This research reinforces that a regimen of physical activity, healthy diet, cognitive exercises, and social engagement can delay or even improve cognitive function. While a cure remains elusive, these developments offer new hope for managing and mitigating the effects of dementia.</p>

          <p>China is designing a planetary defense mission to test its ability to deflect a potentially hazardous asteroid, a top space program official has revealed. The mission, which could launch as soon as this year, would target a small asteroid tens of millions of kilometers from Earth. It would involve two spacecraft: an impactor to collide with the asteroid and an observer to measure the resulting orbital change, which is expected to be between 3 to 5 centimeters. If successful, this kinetic impact demonstration would make China only the second country, after the United States, to demonstrate this crucial planetary defense capability.</p>
