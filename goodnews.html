          <h2>Analysis Explores the Rise of 'Tipflation' and Shifting Tipping Etiquette</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 11:13:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The phenomenon of "tipflation," driven by digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options, is causing confusion and pressure for consumers. While tipping was traditionally for specific service roles, requests for gratuities have expanded to fast-food counters and even self-service kiosks. Experts note that system designs often default to tipping, influencing customer behavior and increasing tip amounts, which benefits both employees and the tech companies processing the transactions. The article suggests that understanding local wage norms and paying with cash can help consumers navigate this evolving social and economic landscape.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 11:07:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hamas has formally submitted what it describes as a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, stating its readiness to enter negotiations on implementation details. The proposed deal, previously announced by President Trump, is understood to involve a two-month truce. While Israeli sources indicated cabinet support for the terms, they have not yet formally committed. The development is seen as a potentially significant step toward de-escalating the 21-month conflict, which has resulted in over 57,000 Palestinian deaths according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>The draw for the Women's Euro 2025 has placed England, Wales, France, and the Netherlands together in what is being called the tournament's "toughest group." This grouping features three teams ranked in the world's top 11, including defending champions England and 2017 winners the Netherlands. Analysts and coaches acknowledge the high level of competition from the outset, with every match being critical for advancement. For Wales, making their major tournament debut, the challenge is particularly steep as they face some of the world's strongest teams in their initial matches.</p>

          <p>A "cortisol cocktail," a non-alcoholic drink combining ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, and magnesium powder, has gone viral on TikTok with claims it can lower stress hormones. However, medical experts interviewed for the article are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, endocrinologists clarify that cortisol levels fluctuate naturally and are not something doctors typically aim to lower outside of specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. They advise that proven stress-reduction methods like sleep, exercise, and social connection are more effective.</p>

          <p>A prototype of the MingKwai typewriter, an innovative machine designed in the 1940s by linguist Lin Yutang, has been discovered after being lost for decades. The typewriter was a revolutionary attempt to adapt the complex, character-based Chinese language for modern technology, a crucial step toward Chinese computing. Its unique system broke down characters by shape rather than sound, allowing access to thousands of characters and influencing modern input methods for East Asian languages. Now acquired by Stanford University, the machine is seen as a significant artifact representing a vision to preserve Chinese culture in the technological age.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over a century, Parisians are legally allowed to swim in the Seine River. The ban, in place since 1923 due to pollution, was lifted after a massive $1.5 billion cleanup project originally tied to the Olympic Games. On Saturday, swimmers gathered at designated swimming areas, including newly built decks near the Eiffel Tower, to take a plunge in the waterway. Officials, including Mayor Anne Hidalgo, have confirmed that the water quality now meets European standards on most days, marking the culmination of a long-held dream to restore the iconic river for public recreation.</p>

          <p>At Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab, scientists are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand their role in the ecosystem and change their negative public image. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the research involves temporarily capturing sharks to examine their stomach contents, which provides insights into both the animal's health and the overall water quality. Researchers believe that a healthy shark population is indicative of a healthy ocean. Despite public fascination, the lab struggles to secure funding, as people are often more interested in watching sharks than supporting the science that protects them.</p>

          <p>The article refutes the political claim that race is a "biological reality," explaining how the scientific community reached a consensus that race is a social construct. It traces the history of racial science from chaotic 20th-century typological studies, which failed to agree on consistent physical markers, to the modern understanding shaped by genetics and anthropology. Scientists like Theodosius Dobzhansky and Sherwood Washburn established that human differences are better explained by culture and that genetic populations are tools for studying evolution, not for defining fixed, "real" racial groups. This view is now standard in fields like human genetics.</p>

          <p>A couple in Scottsdale, Arizona, was fined $4,000 by their property management company, Denali Real Estate, for posting negative online reviews about their rental experience. The fine was based on a "non-disparagement" clause in their lease, which is illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA). This federal law protects consumers' right to share honest feedback without retaliation from businesses. After being contacted by local news, the company stated it would remove the clause from future leases, but the incident highlights a potentially widespread issue of companies unlawfully trying to silence customer complaints.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage emotional responses to upsetting events. The concept, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological effects of anger or stress hormones like cortisol last for only about 90 seconds. After this period, any lingering feeling is due to mentally re-running the negative thought. Gawdat advises allowing yourself that brief window to feel the emotion, and then consciously choosing to shift your focus, a practice he believes can lead to a more fulfilled and resilient life.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the Danish secret to happiness, an Emory University professor undertook an experiment to try 17 different hobbies over one year. She discovered that engaging in activities like pottery, tennis, and woodworking helped her kick her doomscrolling habit, build community, and feel less lonely. The experience fundamentally changed her perspective on self-care and work-life balance, leading to increased confidence and stronger social connections. She concludes that actively pursuing hobbies, rather than waiting for balance to appear, is the key to creating a more fulfilled and joyful life.</p>

This continues a long-standing trend, although the number is significantly lower than the net gain seen in 2022. The state's appeal is largely attributed to its tax-friendly policies, including no state income tax on Social Security or retirement account withdrawals, as well as its sunny weather and recreational opportunities.

          <p>The article highlights the remarkable progress made in combating heart disease, noting that the proportion of deaths from heart attacks has fallen by nearly 90 percent since 1970. This success is attributed to a combination of public health campaigns against smoking, the development of statin drugs to manage cholesterol, and improved emergency treatments like CPR and angioplasty. While this has saved millions of lives, heart disease remains a leading killer, with rising rates of obesity and diabetes posing new challenges. Future progress may depend on wider adoption of preventative screening and new drugs.</p>
