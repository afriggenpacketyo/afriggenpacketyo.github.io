          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin commented that the Middle East situation is calming down, viewing the conflict between Israel and Iran as being "in the past" and suggesting this could foster economic development. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova echoed this, urging all parties, including the U.S., to return to negotiations to preserve the "fragile truce." Zakharova emphasized that diplomacy is the only viable path for resolving crises like the Iranian nuclear program, noting that Russia has already proposed specific initiatives to all involved nations.</p>

          <p>Shares of stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group, which recently went public, saw a significant 12% rally, recovering from a brief two-day drop. This post-IPO volatility has also benefited Coinbase, the main distribution platform for Circle's USDC stablecoin, whose shares gained 15% during Circle's dip and continued to rise. As investors learn more about Circle's business model, they are recognizing the potential benefits for Coinbase, which receives half the revenue from interest on USDC reserves.

          <p>The S&P 500 has recovered from a significant sell-off earlier in the year, now approaching a new record high, driven by investor optimism and strong liquidity. Despite concerns over trade wars, Middle East conflicts, and AI competition, the market has shown resilience, partly due to President Trump easing some tariffs and strong corporate earnings. The U.S. economy remains solid with low unemployment, and the Federal Reserve is signaling potential rate cuts, further bolstering investor confidence in avoiding a recession.

          <p>In a decision that brought some relief to the public health community, the new Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended the use of Merck's RSV shot, Enflonsia, for infants. The panel, recently overhauled by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to include some vaccine critics, voted in favor of the preventative antibody, which will compete with a similar shot from Sanofi. The endorsement allows the shot to be deployed for the upcoming RSV season, which is a leading cause of hospitalization for newborns.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker officially announced he is running for a third term, positioning himself as a problem-solver who stands in stark contrast to President Trump's administration. In his announcement, Pritzker highlighted his record of balanced budgets, credit upgrades, and progressive legislation on issues like the minimum wage and abortion access. While his announcement fuels speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run, he focused on his commitment to Illinois, criticizing the "megalomaniac narcissist in the White House" and vowing to continue fighting for working families.</p>

          <p>Three-time Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon of Kenya is attempting to become the first woman in history to run a mile in under four minutes, a milestone once considered an insurmountable barrier. To achieve this "moonshot" goal at a special event in Paris, the 31-year-old will need to beat her own world record of 4:07.64 by a significant margin. The attempt will utilize advanced technology, including rotating pacers to reduce air resistance, similar to the strategy used by Roger Bannister in his historic 1954 run.</p>

          <p>Denis Villeneuve, the acclaimed director behind "Dune" and "Blade Runner 2049," has been chosen to direct the next installment of the James Bond franchise. This marks the most significant creative decision since Amazon MGM took control of the iconic spy series. Villeneuve, a self-professed "die-hard Bond fan," called the opportunity a "massive responsibility" and an "incredible honor," promising to respect the series' tradition. The selection of the Quebecois filmmaker has been widely praised by fans, though there is still no word on who will succeed Daniel Craig in the leading role.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 12:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article traces the American cultural tendency to value a lack of sleep as a symbol of hard work and moral superiority back for centuries. From early exhortations to emulate historical figures who slept little, the piece connects this mindset to the Protestant work ethic and the modern phenomenon of "workism," where professionals derive their identity from their jobs. While tools from coffee to energy drinks have been marketed to help people fight their body's need for rest, the essay notes a recent, albeit slow, shift in acknowledging the importance of sleep for well-being.</p>

          <h2>New Research Suggests Watching Unflinching Documentaries May Effectively Reduce Meat Consumption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 12:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new, yet-to-be-published study from the University of Toronto suggests that it may be possible to persuade people to eat less meat, challenging a long-held consensus among animal advocates. In the experiment, students who watched a 16-minute clip from the documentary "Dominion," which graphically depicts standard practices in industrial pig farming, showed a significant decline in choosing meat for a meal a week later. Researchers believe the high-quality, non-preachy nature of the video may be more effective than traditional advocacy.</p>
