          <p>Germany is actively working to overcome significant shortcomings in its drone defense systems, a vulnerability highlighted by recent airspace incursions in NATO countries. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has acknowledged the country is behind, citing challenges such as the high cost of using fighter jets for interception and a shortage of specialized anti-aircraft tanks. To address this, Germany is ordering new equipment, amending laws to grant the military more authority in domestic airspace, and learning from Ukraine's innovative use of drone technology. The new strategy involves creating a multi-layered defense system combining electronic countermeasures with kinetic solutions.</p>

          <p>Police and immigration officials have evicted three individuals who identified as members of the "Kingdom of Kubala" from an encampment on council-owned land near Jedburgh, Scotland. The group, which includes individuals from Ghana, Zimbabwe, and the United States, had been staying in a wooded area, claiming they were reclaiming land stolen from their ancestors 400 years ago. The eviction followed a court order banning them from any council land in the area. The members of the group, who refused to recognize the court's authority, streamed the eviction live on social media as they were detained.</p>

          <p>A government supplier has revealed that dozens of hand-sewn American flags for Donald Trump's recent state visit to the UK were replaced at an estimated public cost of £52,800. The U.S. embassy reportedly objected to the shade of red on the existing flags, requesting a brighter "cherry red" instead. This resulted in the new Stars and Stripes flags featuring a more vibrant red than the Union flags flown alongside them. The incident highlights the meticulous and costly preparations undertaken by the UK government to host the former U.S. President for his unprecedented second state visit.</p>

          <p>Online fast-fashion retailer Shein has announced it will open its first-ever permanent physical retail locations in France, marking a significant shift from its primarily digital business model. The company will establish "shop-in-shop" outlets within major department stores, starting in Paris before expanding to five other French cities. Shein cited France's influential fashion market as the reason for choosing it as a testbed for physical retail. This expansion comes as the company continues to face criticism regarding its environmental impact and the working conditions within its vast supply chain.</p>

          <p>Paris is experiencing a boom in authentic Chinese cuisine, driven by a new generation of restaurateurs catering to a younger and more diverse clientele. These establishments are moving beyond traditional Cantonese fare to offer regional specialties, such as the seasoned meat skewers known as kaochuan from northeastern China. One such restaurant, Tonton Mao, has successfully transported the culinary traditions of Shenyang to the French capital, complete with specialized chefs and decor reminiscent of 1920s China. This trend reflects a significant expansion and diversification of the Chinese culinary scene in the city.</p>

          <p>A consortium of lenders has submitted a new rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances and fund infrastructure improvements. The investors state that this plan would rebuild the company without requiring any taxpayer money or government support. The move comes after years of financial instability at the utility, which has faced the threat of temporary nationalization to ensure continued service.</p>

          <p>Switzerland's Defense Minister, Martin Pfister, is urging lawmakers to relax the country's stringent arms export laws, arguing that the current restrictive stance undermines trust with international security partners. The neutral country's policies have famously blocked the re-export of Swiss-made ammunition and weapons to Ukraine, drawing criticism from allies. Pfister warned that to be considered a reliable partner and enhance its own security against threats like drone incursions, Switzerland must be able to cooperate more effectively with other armed forces. The proposed revision to the war materials act aims to facilitate this cooperation.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda struck Bermuda with heavy rain and powerful winds as a Category 2 storm before weakening and moving farther out into the Atlantic Ocean. As of early Thursday, the storm had been downgraded to a Category 1, with its center located northeast of the island. While a hurricane warning remained in effect, there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries from the storm's passage. Forecasters expect Imelda to continue weakening and transition into an extratropical cyclone, though swells from the system are still likely to cause life-threatening surf conditions along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has endorsed the concept as a cornerstone of credible defense.
