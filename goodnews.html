        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The movie review for "Freakier Friday" suggests the sequel serves more as a fan-service reunion for stars Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis than a compelling new story. The plot involves a four-way body swap that includes their new step-family members, but the film rushes through character development, relying on hijinks and montages instead of emotional depth. While the chemistry between Lohan and Curtis remains a highlight, and the film is packed with comedic cameos, the central mother-daughter story feels underdeveloped. The article concludes that while the movie is a disposable delight, it fails to recapture the magic of the original.</p>

          <p>Shares of the language-learning platform Duolingo jumped nearly 14% after the company reported strong quarterly results and raised its full-year revenue and bookings forecast. The company attributed its success to a 40% increase in daily active users, driven by the implementation of new AI tools and an expansion into new subjects like chess. Duolingo also announced the acquisition of music gaming startup NextBeat, signaling its intent to broaden its educational product offerings. The strong performance suggests the company's growth strategy is resonating with users and investors. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Adam Foroughi suggested that the legal fallout from the Apple vs. Epic Games case will create a future tailwind, as developers will have more money to spend on advertising once they are no longer forced to pay Apple's high App Store fees. This positive outlook comes despite criticism from several short-selling firms earlier in the year, which the company has refuted as misleading and self-serving. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order to stop further construction at a controversial immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling follows a lawsuit by environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argue the facility was built without required environmental impact studies, threatening a sensitive ecosystem and sacred tribal lands. While the center can continue to house detainees, the 14-day halt on construction prevents potential irreversible harm to the area. The case highlights a jurisdictional dispute over whether state-managed projects must adhere to federal environmental laws.</p>

          <h2>Explainer Details When and How a Debt Collector Can Freeze a Bank Account</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 15:25:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains that while a debt collector can legally freeze a person's bank account, they cannot do so arbitrarily and must first obtain a court judgment. This requires filing a lawsuit and winning the case, a process that gives the debtor an opportunity to respond or negotiate. Even with a judgment, federal and state laws protect certain funds, such as Social Security and disability benefits, from being garnished. If an account is frozen, individuals still have options, including filing an exemption claim with the court or negotiating a payment plan to have the freeze lifted.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched GPT-5, the latest version of its influential AI model, which CEO Sam Altman claims offers "PhD-level" expertise on any topic. The new model is described as smarter and faster, with an enhanced ability to demonstrate logic and inference in its responses, and is trained to be more accurate and "human-like." While OpenAI highlights its advanced capabilities, some ethics experts express concern that the technology is advancing faster than regulation. The rollout comes amid intense competition among tech giants to develop the most capable AI, raising questions about its potential and governance.</p>

Hashimoto's is a common but slow-progressing condition that can cause a range of symptoms. Luddington shared that she is now on medication and has returned to exercising, expressing relief at finally having a medical reason for how she was feeling.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut looking likely, savers may question the value of opening a high-yield savings account (HYSA). This article argues that HYSAs remain a worthwhile option for several reasons. Their rates, while slightly lower than their peak, are still substantially higher than those of traditional savings accounts, offering significant earning potential. Furthermore, any rate reductions are expected to be small and gradual, meaning HYSA rates will likely remain attractive, all while offering the flexibility that fixed-term products like CDs lack in an unpredictable economy.

          <p>This market commentary article argues that a recent sell-off in cybersecurity stocks, triggered by a disappointing forecast from Fortinet, presents a buying opportunity for other companies in the sector. The author notes that stocks like CrowdStrike, which operates on a different business model than Fortinet's hardware-focused one, were unfairly dragged down by association. The piece suggests that the market is overreacting and that the fundamental growth drivers for cloud-native cybersecurity firms like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks remain strong. It reflects a strategic view of capitalizing on a perceived market overreaction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that an extension of the current tariff truce with China is likely, providing a strong signal from the administration ahead of the deadline. The 90-day pause in escalating tariffs was set to expire, and an extension would allow for continued negotiations between the two economic powers. The statement came as the Trump administration's broader worldwide tariffs on imports from approximately 90 countries took effect. This potential de-escalation with China contrasts with the administration's generally aggressive global trade posture. (not investment advice)</p>
