          <p>Shares of South Korean chipmakers SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics surged significantly, with SK Hynix hitting a 25-year high, after announcing a partnership with OpenAI. This collaboration, part of OpenAI's Stargate initiative, aims to boost the supply of advanced memory chips crucial for next-generation AI and expand data center capacity in Korea. SK Hynix is already a major supplier of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips to Nvidia, while Samsung seeks certification for its HBM4 chips. The alliance underscores the increasing demand for specialized memory in the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence sector.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved an all-time high, climbing over 3%, primarily propelled by the strong performance of Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. These chip giants saw their shares rise after announcing a strategic partnership with OpenAI to enhance advanced memory chip production for AI. The broader Asian markets also experienced gains, with Japan's Nikkei 225 advancing and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbing. This market surge occurred despite an increase in South Korea's consumer price index and ongoing uncertainty surrounding the U.S. government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Maxwell House coffee, a 133-year-old brand, has launched a viral marketing campaign rebranding itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee" to humorously highlight the severe U.S. housing crisis. The advertisement, featuring the slogan "Maxwell House? In this economy?", offers an "affordable name" and a year's supply of coffee for "under $40." This initiative acknowledges that the median age of first-time homebuyers has reached an all-time high of 38, with fewer than 16% of homes being affordable for typical households. The campaign aims to connect with the growing population of coffee-loving renters across the country.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of War has strongly refuted claims of an internal strategy split, asserting that the National Defense Strategy was "seamlessly coordinated" with all senior civilian and military leaders. Deputy Secretary of War Steve Feinberg dismissed reports from The Washington Post suggesting political leadership and senior officers were at odds over the strategy's priorities and tone. Officials emphasized the extensive collaboration involved in drafting the document, which aligns closely with the National Security Strategy. This pushback comes amidst broader overhauls by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, focusing on tougher standards and a tighter warfighting focus.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made history by becoming the first individual to reach a net worth exceeding $500 billion, briefly touching $500.1 billion. This financial milestone is attributed to the soaring valuations of his ventures, including electric car manufacturer Tesla, AI startup xAI, and rocket company SpaceX. The increase in his wealth solidifies Musk's position as the world's richest person, significantly ahead of competitors like Oracle founder Larry Ellison. Tesla's shares have risen over 20% this year, partly due to investors welcoming Musk's increased focus on his companies rather than political engagements.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order declaring that any armed attack on Qatar's territory or critical infrastructure would be considered a threat to U.S. peace and security. The order commits the U.S. to take "all lawful and appropriate measures," including military action if necessary, to defend Qatar. This pledge follows an Israeli attack on Doha targeting Hamas leaders, for which Prime Minister Netanyahu later expressed regret during a visit to Washington. Qatar, a crucial U.S. military partner hosting the Al Udeid airbase, views this as a significant step in strengthening their defense partnership.</p>

          <p>Six individuals were arrested Sunday after they trespassed and attempted to hang a banner on one of the "O's" of the iconic Hollywood sign in Los Angeles. Authorities reported that the group was detained without incident around noon, though the specific message or purpose behind their actions remains publicly unclear. A photo shared by the LAPD showed the banner included what appeared to be a green-and-white pill capsule, but its full content was not visible.

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders adopted a unique form of protest by literally muting himself during a press conference, providing voiceless answers to questions about the team's depth chart changes. This occurred after fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel was promoted to starting quarterback, with Sanders remaining at No. 3 behind Joe Flacco. Sanders, a former college star, was considered a potential first-round pick but fell to the fifth round. His silent response may be a reaction to recent critical remarks from analyst Rex Ryan regarding his comments on being a backup.</p>
