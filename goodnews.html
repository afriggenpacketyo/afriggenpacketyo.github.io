          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' expectations despite trade pressures from U.S. tariffs. The growth was primarily fueled by strong export performance, which helped narrow the country's trade deficit. However, on a year-over-year basis, GDP growth slowed, and analysts remain cautious about the future, warning of a potential slowdown. Concerns persist that the impact of tariffs on corporate profits and investment could still pose significant risks to Japan's economic stability in the coming quarters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fast-fashion giant Shein reported a significant 32.3% increase in its UK sales for 2024, reaching £2.05 billion and boosting its pre-tax profits. The growth comes as the Singapore-headquartered company pursues a public listing, having shifted its focus to an IPO in Hong Kong after facing regulatory hurdles in London. Despite its commercial success, the company's filings acknowledge potential risks from supply chain issues, currency fluctuations, and shifting UK regulations. The strong financial performance underscores the brand's continued expansion and market dominance ahead of its anticipated stock market debut. (not investment advice)</p>

The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling the Seven Teacups Trail when he came off his lines and was pinned by the intense water flow. Search teams located him using aircraft with infrared technology and a drone before a California Highway Patrol helicopter performed the hoist rescue.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw single once again, an ending that the article argues is more true to the character than a traditional fairytale romance. After the original "Sex and the City" ended with all four main characters in committed relationships, the sequel series explored widowhood and new life challenges for Carrie. The finale sees her embracing a future that may not include another great love, instead finding fulfillment in her friendships and independence. This conclusion is seen as a correction to the original series' ending, reinforcing the idea that enduring female friendships are the true soulmates.</p>

          <p>Shares of Guangzhou Innogen Pharmaceutical Group surged dramatically in their Hong Kong trading debut, closing at nearly four times their initial public offering price. The successful IPO reflects strong investor confidence in China's pharmaceutical sector, particularly for companies developing popular anti-obesity drugs. Innogen's stock opened at HK$72, a substantial increase from its HK$18.68 IPO price, despite a broader market decline. The performance is part of a larger trend of rising valuations for biotech companies in Hong Kong, where the sector has seen significant cumulative returns this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a new high-speed jet drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, a development that could effectively turn any warship into a small aircraft carrier. The uncrewed aircraft is designed to launch from the decks of vessels like destroyers and frigates, even in rough seas, and then transition to fast, long-range flight. According to the project team, the drone's speed is far superior to that of other mainstream VTOL drones currently in use. This technological advancement could significantly expand the operational range and surveillance power of the Chinese navy's surface fleet.</p>

          <p>The city of Youngstown, Ohio, once a symbol of industrial decay after the collapse of the steel industry, is experiencing a quiet economic and cultural revival. Local entrepreneurs are repurposing abandoned factories into new businesses, such as a brewery and a bustling flea market, bringing new life to the city's historic industrial core. While the comeback is not flashy, the city's population has stabilized, and its unemployment rate is now only slightly above the national average. This gradual revitalization is driven by a local spirit of resilience, demonstrating a potential future for the city beyond its steel-producing past. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to educate the public about the risks associated with traveling overseas for cosmetic surgery. The campaign addresses growing concerns over "medical tourism," where people seek cheaper procedures like hair implants or dental work abroad, sometimes with dangerous consequences. The influencers will advise their followers to consult with a UK doctor, obtain proper travel insurance, and be wary of package deals that include surgical procedures. This initiative is part of a broader effort to protect patients and reduce the burden on the NHS, which often has to correct botched operations.</p>

          <p>An AI-driven tool called DeepEditor is changing how foreign language films are dubbed, making it appear as if actors are genuinely speaking the new language by manipulating their lip movements. Developed by London-based company Flawless, the technology was used on the Swedish sci-fi film "Watch the Skies," enabling its release in over 100 U.S. theaters. Proponents argue that this innovation can break down language barriers and open up the traditionally challenging U.S. market to a wider range of international cinema. The company emphasizes that the tool is designed to empower creative professionals, using real voice actors rather than replacing them with synthetic voices.</p>
