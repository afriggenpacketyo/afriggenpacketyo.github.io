          <p>A New York Times article reports that Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the primary transit system in the San Francisco Bay Area, shut down all trains due to a computer networking problem. The outage disrupted the morning commute for over 170,000 passengers, forcing them to seek alternative transportation. This disruption comes as BART struggles to attract passengers post-pandemic, with ridership remaining less than half of pre-pandemic levels. A BART spokesman stated that a similar shutdown in the past took several hours to resolve.</p>

          <p>CNBC reports on a trend of low turnover among apartment renters in large urban markets. Real estate analyst Alex Goldfarb notes that some of the largest landlords are seeing turnover at just 30%, compared with the industry norm of 50%. Reasons include an unaffordable for-sale market, lack of rental supply, economic nervousness, and the cost of moving. As a result, landlords are getting better pricing from renewals, improving their cash flow. Rents are now increasing, up 0.9% year over year in the first quarter, due to strong demand and a decrease in vacant units.</p>

          <p>A CNBC article details the trend of apartment renters renewing their leases at a higher rate than normal, driven by an unaffordable housing market and economic uncertainty. Alex Goldfarb at Piper Sandler notes that some of the largest landlords are seeing turnover at just 30% compared to the industry norm of 50%. This trend is benefiting landlords, who are seeing better pricing from renewals and improved cash flow. CBRE also reported that rents are now rebounding after declines last year, up 0.9% year over year in the first quarter.</p>
