          <p>Marks and Spencer (M&S) has resumed taking online orders after suspending them in April due to a cyber attack. Shoppers can now purchase a selection of fashion products for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, with more products and services expected to return in the coming weeks. The cyber attack, which occurred over the Easter weekend, initially affected click and collect and contactless payments, leading to an estimated ¬£300 million hit to the retailer's profits. The company has assured customers that while some personal data was stolen, payment details and account passwords were not compromised.</p>

          <p>Toyota Industries is facing criticism from investors regarding a $33 billion buyout offer from parent company Toyota Motor, with shareholders expressing concerns that the price undervalues the supplier's intrinsic value. At the company's annual general meeting, domestic shareholders echoed concerns raised by international investors like Zennor Asset Management and Oasis Management. Critics argue that the acquisition strengthens the Toyoda family's control over the group and does not adequately compensate minority shareholders for the company's assets, including substantial real estate holdings. Toyota maintains that the acquisition will foster deeper collaboration without short-term profit pressures.</p>

The FCA has also made arrests and authorized criminal proceedings against individuals involved in illegal financial promotions.

          <p>Japan plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles to lower the elevated prices of the staple food. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced that the released rice, consisting of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, will be sold directly to retailers. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, prompting concerns about emergency preparedness and leading Koizumi to consider increasing rice imports. The government suspects that some wholesalers and farmers are hoarding rice in anticipation of further price increases.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have risen significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have increased by double-digit percentages compared to the same period in 2024. Analysts suggest that Chinese manufacturers are increasingly shipping goods to Southeast Asia for final assembly or re-export, partially to offset the impact of high U.S. tariffs. Factories often inject enough local content into goods from China to declare any re-exports as made in Vietnam, Thailand, or Indonesia.</p>

          <p>A recall on Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded due to a serious health risk, as some cans labeled "zero sugar" contain the full amount of sugar found in regular Dr Pepper. The affected cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company, have the product code XXXXRS05165 and a "best by" date of February 16, 2026, and were distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. This mislabeling poses a risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, especially those with diabetes, as it can lead to hyperglycemia and potentially fatal complications.
