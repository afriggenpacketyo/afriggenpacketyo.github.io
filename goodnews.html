        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's recent tariffs have not led to a significant spike in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term strategies employed by businesses, including pre-ordering large amounts of inventory to avoid duties and temporarily absorbing costs to protect consumers. Companies are also leveraging loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay tariff payments while waiting for more clarity on U.S. trade policy. However, experts caution that these buffers are temporary and price increases are still likely in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Both account types feature variable rates that are expected to decline with future interest rate cuts.

          <p>Amid rising consumer debt, debt forgiveness through negotiation is becoming a more common consideration for financially strained Americans. This article outlines five types of debt that are often eligible for settlement, where a borrower pays a reduced lump sum to clear the balance. Unsecured debts like credit card balances and personal loans are prime candidates, as creditors prefer partial recovery over a total loss. Medical bills, buy now, pay later plans, and even high-interest payday loans may also be negotiable, particularly if the accounts are significantly delinquent and the borrower can demonstrate financial hardship.</p>

          <p>After qualifying for the Wimbledon main draw, 21-year-old British tennis player Oliver Tarvet has called for a reform of the NCAA's rules on prize money. As a student at the University of San Diego, Tarvet is restricted to claiming only $10,000 in profit annually from professional tournaments, plus expenses, despite earning ¬£66,000 for reaching the first round. Tarvet stated that he believes he has earned the prize money and that a rule change would be appropriate. His comments echo a recent class-action lawsuit filed by other college players challenging the NCAA's restrictions on athlete earnings.</p>

          <p>Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," is reviewed as a deliberate return to the electronic, rhythm-driven sound of her earlier work, set against the backdrop of downtown Manhattan. The article notes that while the album aims to capture visceral, real-world experiences, it often becomes a study in self-consciousness, reflecting a culture where introspection can supplant broader connection. The production, influenced by artists like Charli XCX, is described as having the trappings of radicalism but ultimately feeling like smooth, streamable pop. The review concludes that the album's intense self-focus highlights a potential dead end for the first-person pop style Lorde herself pioneered.</p>

          <p>To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the influential TV show "Girlfriends," a free art exhibition has been organized at The Line Hotel in Los Angeles. The exhibit, curated by the show's cast and other cultural figures, pays homage to the groundbreaking series that centered on the lives of four Black women. It features photography, sculpture, and paintings by all-Black female artists that explore the show's core themes of sisterhood, ambition, and self-discovery. The series, which ran for eight seasons, is celebrated for its nuanced and authentic portrayal of Black women, a legacy the exhibition aims to honor.</p>
