          <p>George Gountas, a New York City father and "Daily Show" lighting designer, won a Pedro Pascal look-alike contest, securing a year's worth of burritos and $50. Gountas' wife encouraged him to enter after noting his resemblance to the actor, which began when she couldn't watch Pascal's character die on "Game of Thrones." He received styling help from a neighbor and surprised the contest organizers by showing up without pre-registering. Gountas plans to maintain his Pascal-inspired look, despite some family resistance, and hopes Pascal will visit "The Daily Show" so his wife can meet him.</p>

          <p>The U.S. men's national soccer team is under pressure as it prepares to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup, facing criticism after a series of disappointing losses and a public disagreement between star player Christian Pulisic and coach Mauricio Pochettino. Pulisic's decision to sit out recent games to rest sparked controversy, with some former players questioning his commitment. The team is currently participating in the Gold Cup, with young players using the opportunity to prove themselves for a spot on the World Cup roster. A strong performance in the tournament could shift the negative narrative surrounding the team.</p>

          <p>Greta Thunberg, once criticized on Chinese social media, is receiving support in China, particularly after her attempt to sail to Gaza was stopped by Israeli forces. The 22-year-old activist's journey to break Israel's siege of Gaza was closely followed, marking a shift in public sentiment. Commenters on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, praised Thunberg's consistent support for Palestine and opposition to Israel, acknowledging her commitment to her beliefs. This newfound respect contrasts with previous criticism of her environmental activism.</p>

          <p>The Senate tax bill proposes a $1,000 baby bonus for children born between January 1, 2024, and December 31, 2028, deposited into "Trump accounts." To be eligible, a child must be a U.S. citizen at birth, and both parents must have Social Security numbers. These accounts, similar to 529 college savings plans, offer tax-deferred earnings and are designed to encourage wealth-building. However, some experts argue that the accounts are overly complicated and may not effectively reach lower-income families (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Researchers have confirmed that Captain James Cook's lost ship, HMS Endeavour, rests in Newport Harbor, Rhode Island, resolving a decades-long mystery. Australian historians pinpointed the location in 1998, and a 26-year research program confirmed the identification. The Endeavour, known for Cook's voyages across the Pacific, was later used by the British during the American Revolutionary War and deliberately sunk in 1778. Efforts are underway to protect the wreck site, recognizing its historical and cultural significance to multiple nations and First Nations peoples.</p>
