          <p>President Trump is attending the NATO summit in The Hague, pushing for European leaders to increase defense spending, and NATO has reached an agreement for nations to boost spending to five percent of their GDP. Spain has requested an exemption, complicating the consensus, and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is expected to attend to advocate for Ukraine's admission into NATO. Rutte claims allies are increasing responsibility for shared security, and Trump suggests the U.S. does not need to hit the 5% target. The summit follows Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, adding complexity to the discussions.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, is running for New York City mayor. Cuomo is leading in the polls, supported by wealthy backers and name recognition, but faces a strong challenge from Zohran Mamdani, a left-wing state representative. Cuomo's campaign focuses on his past achievements, while Mamdani criticizes Cuomo's funding from Trump-supporting billionaires and highlights the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation. Despite the controversy, Cuomo maintains support from labor unions and key voting groups.</p>

          <p>The UK has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. This commitment includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas like resilience and security. While the government argues that measures on energy and tackling smuggling could be classified as security spending, critics like Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel argue that the target should be reached sooner. The decision comes amid increased pressure on NATO members to boost defense spending due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Trump's call for allies to increase their contributions.</p>

          <p>Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are introducing a framework for a bill to establish rules for digital assets. The proposed legislation aims to define when crypto is a commodity or a security, allow crypto exchanges to register with the CFTC, and reduce the SEC's regulation of digital currencies. It also includes measures to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion. Scott hopes the framework will serve as a baseline for negotiations and provide clarity for digital asset regulation, building on recent bipartisan momentum in the crypto space.</p>

The budget was made possible by a law easing Germany's debt brake.
