          <p>The United Kingdom continues to experience a significant heatwave, with temperatures reaching highs of 33.1°C in England and setting new records for the year in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Amber heat health alerts remain in effect for southern and eastern England, warning of potential health risks, especially for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The hot weather has led to hosepipe bans in several regions and an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland. The Met Office forecasts a break in the heat starting Monday, with cooler temperatures and rain expected.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Tibet Dam May Increase Dry-Season Water Flow to India</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that China's massive dam project on the Yarlung Zangbo river in Tibet may not cause the droughts in India that many have feared. Instead, data from two existing upstream dams suggests the opposite effect. The research, measuring water levels downstream since 2014, found that water flow during the dry season has significantly increased, with low flows in February rising by over 50%. This evidence counters concerns that the mega-dam would be used to restrict water, suggesting it could instead help regulate and augment supply during drier periods.</p>

          <p>Several companies, including the UK-based start-up Better Dairy, are developing lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to produce casein, the key protein in milk. The goal is to create a product that tastes and melts like traditional dairy cheese, overcoming the quality gap often found in plant-based alternatives. However, these new products face significant hurdles, including high initial costs, regulatory approval processes, and a recent decline in the vegan food market. Success will depend on improving taste, achieving price parity, and convincing consumers to embrace this new food technology.</p>
