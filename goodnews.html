          <h2>Nvidia Resumes H20 Chip Sales to China and Introduces New Compliant GPU</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 22:01:49 EDT</div>

          <p>Nvidia has announced its intention to resume selling H20 graphics processing chips in China, alongside the introduction of a new, fully compliant RTX PRO GPU for the country. This strategic move aligns with US export restrictions, with the US government reportedly assuring Nvidia that necessary licenses will be granted for these deliveries. CEO Jensen Huang's visit to Beijing underscores the company's commitment to navigating the complex Chinese market. This development signals Nvidia's adaptive approach to ongoing tech trade tensions, aiming to maintain its presence while adhering to regulatory frameworks.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the US will supply Ukraine with advanced weaponry, including Patriot air defense systems, through NATO countries, with European allies funding the replacements. He also threatened to impose 100% secondary tariffs on countries that continue to trade with Russia if a peace deal is not reached within 50 days. This marks a notable shift in his administration's approach, aiming to pressure Russia and bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities. The announcement signals a more assertive stance from the US president towards ending the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A US appeals court has issued a temporary administrative stay, preventing the Trump administration from removing the temporary protected status of thousands of Afghans in the United States. This significant decision comes after an immigration advocacy organization, Casa, filed a lawsuit challenging the termination of protected status for both Afghan and Cameroonian nationals. The stay will remain in effect until July 21, allowing further legal proceedings to unfold. The ruling offers a temporary reprieve for affected individuals who had faced imminent termination of their legal status, highlighting ongoing legal battles over immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies successfully recovered an assault rifle and five magazines that had inadvertently fallen out of a squad car onto city streets. The department took the unusual step of publicly appealing for help in locating the weapon, detailing the route where it might have been lost. A Lennox resident discovered the black, hard-shelled carrying case, initially mistaking it for a musical instrument, and promptly turned it in to the sheriff's station.

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a new technique to rapidly cool superalloy turbine discs during manufacturing, a crucial step for significantly improving aircraft engine performance. These discs are among the heaviest and most technically demanding parts of an aircraft engine, vital for converting thermal energy into rotational force and withstanding extreme conditions. The innovation addresses a long-standing challenge for China, which has historically lagged behind Western nations in advanced aircraft engine development. This breakthrough is particularly significant as China works on its next-generation fighter jets, aiming to enhance engine power, efficiency, and lifespan.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has urged the Supreme Court to deny Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal, seeking to uphold her 20-year prison sentence for conspiring with and aiding Jeffrey Epstein in the sexual abuse of underage girls. Maxwell argued that Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her subsequent prosecution in New York. However, the DOJ contends the agreement only applied to the Southern District of Florida and was not intended to benefit Maxwell, whom the government was not fully aware of at the time. Victims' attorneys support the DOJ's stance, asserting Maxwell deserves to remain incarcerated for her horrific crimes.</p>

PayPal, for instance, anticipates minimal short-term impact due to existing long-term pricing contracts.
