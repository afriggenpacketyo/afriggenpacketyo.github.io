          <p>The United Kingdom continues to experience its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures reaching 33.1°C in England and setting new 2025 records in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Amber heat-health alerts remain active for southern and central England, warning of risks to the wider population, especially the elderly. The heat has prompted hosepipe bans and wildfire warnings in several regions. The Met Office forecasts a shift to cooler, rainier conditions on Monday, which will end the heatwave for most of the country.</p>

          <p>A new study offers insights into the effects of China's dams on the Brahmaputra river, which flows into India and Bangladesh. Contrary to fears that the dams would cause droughts, data collected since 2014 from two existing dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, suggests the opposite effect. The research indicates that the dams regulate water flow, significantly increasing river levels by over 50% during the dry season. This finding could reframe the debate around China's controversial new mega-dam project planned for Tibet.</p>

          <p>China's space economy is expanding rapidly, driven by a surge in private investment and technological advancements supported by the state. The global space market is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, and Chinese companies like i-Space and LandSpace are becoming major players with successful orbital launches. This boom in the commercial space industry, focused on areas like satellite constellations and space manufacturing, presents a significant opportunity for Hong Kong to leverage its financial and international expertise.

          <p>Several companies, including UK-based Better Dairy, are using precision fermentation to create cheese without cows, aiming for a taste and texture comparable to the real thing. The process involves genetically modifying yeast to produce casein, the key protein in milk, which is then combined with plant-based fats. While the technology shows promise, these startups face significant challenges, including high initial costs, regulatory approval for "novel foods," and a recent decline in consumer demand for plant-based alternatives. The industry hopes to overcome these obstacles and launch products within the next few years.</p>

          <p>After years of declining viewership, the reality show "Love Island" is experiencing a resurgence in popularity, largely driven by its presence on TikTok.

This shift allows viewers to keep up with the show's discourse without committing to nightly hour-long episodes.
