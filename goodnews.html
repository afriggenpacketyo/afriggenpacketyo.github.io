          <p>India has approved Apple-supplier Foxconn's $433 million joint venture with HCL Group to construct a semiconductor plant in Uttar Pradesh, with operations expected to commence by 2027. This initiative aims to boost India's semiconductor industry and reduce reliance on China amidst ongoing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. The plant will manufacture display driver chips used in various electronic devices, with a capacity to produce up to 20,000 wafers and 36 million chips monthly. This strategic move aligns with Apple suppliers' increasing shift towards India. Optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger-than-anticipated growth of 0.7% in the first three months of the year, driven primarily by the services sector, according to official figures. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the figures as evidence of the UK's economic strength, analysts caution that this rate of growth is unlikely to persist due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Despite positive signs in business investment, skepticism remains regarding the sustainability of this growth, with some economists suggesting that this may be the peak for the year.

          <p>Germany's foreign minister announced that Berlin is willing to "follow" the US's call for NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, signaling a commitment to bolstering the alliance's strength. While some countries view this target as unrealistic, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte proposed a compromise involving increased military spending and investment in defense-related infrastructure. This move reflects Germany's intention to take on greater responsibility within NATO and transform its army into the strongest in Europe. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Ola Aina, a teammate of Nottingham Forest striker Taiwo Awoniyi, suggests that Awoniyi's injury could have been avoided if the assistant referee had flagged Anthony Elanga for being offside earlier in the play.

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of stockpiled rice to roughly 600,000 tons in an effort to control rising rice prices, which remain near record highs due to a supply shortfall. This action involves releasing 300,000 tons over three months through July, in addition to the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. The move could reduce the government's stockpile to about one-third of the recommended reserve level, raising concerns about future responses to poor harvests or natural disasters.
