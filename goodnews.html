          <p>Broadcom's stock price increased after the company reported strong third-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations and provided a robust forecast for the future. A significant driver of this optimism was the announcement of a new $10 billion order for its custom AI chips from an undisclosed fourth major customer. This development reinforces the company's growing position in the artificial intelligence sector and fuels investor confidence in its ability to compete with market leaders. The company's AI-related revenue saw a substantial 63% jump during the period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ESPN host Laura Rutledge revealed on a podcast that she created a fake social media profile to defend her husband, former MLB player Josh Rutledge, from online critics during his playing career. Under the pseudonym "BillyHalo76," she would post positive comments and use statistics to counter negative commentary, occasionally tweeting about star player Mike Trout to avoid suspicion. Rutledge acknowledged that the action was wrong and admitted that her husband was likely unaware of her secret online activities, which she undertook because she struggled with the public criticism he faced.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity at record highs, the article advises homeowners to carefully consider several key questions before borrowing against their property's value. It suggests verifying the actual amount of equity available to borrow and assessing whether the financial need is urgent enough to justify taking on new debt. Homeowners are also encouraged to weigh the timing of their decision in light of an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut, which could soon make borrowing cheaper and affect the choice between a fixed-rate loan and a variable-rate home equity line of credit (HELOC).

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid global adoption of stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to traditional money, presents a strategic challenge for China because over 99% are backed by the U.S. dollar. This trend reinforces the dollar's supremacy in the evolving landscape of digital finance, running counter to Beijing's long-term goal of promoting the yuan internationally. The article explores how the rise of these dollar-denominated tokens could impact China's economy and geopolitical ambitions, forcing Beijing to consider its response as Wall Street and global markets increasingly embrace this new financial technology.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are advising savers to lock in high rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) before an expected Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September causes returns to fall. The article recommends that individuals, particularly those with larger sums like $10,000, should act quickly and strategically to maximize their earnings in the current high-rate environment. It suggests prioritizing online banks, which generally offer better rates, and warns that financial institutions may lower their CD rates in anticipation of the Fed's decision, making prompt action essential.

          <p>Daniel Levy, the longest-serving chairman in the Premier League, is stepping down from his executive role at Tottenham Hotspur after nearly 25 years. The decision was reportedly driven by the club's ownership, who believe a change in leadership is necessary to achieve greater sporting success. Levy's tenure was characterized by major off-field accomplishments, including the construction of a state-of-the-art stadium, but was also marked by consistent fan frustration over a lack of major trophies and frequent managerial changes.</p>

          <p>This opinion article analyzes President Xi Jinping's call for a new global order based on "true multilateralism" as a strategic effort to challenge U.S. hegemony and build alliances with developing nations. The author contends that this vision appeals to countries in the Global South and the Muslim world that feel marginalized by Western-dominated institutions like the IMF and World Bank. By offering an alternative framework, Beijing is tapping into existing frustrations and encouraging a recalibration of global partnerships as nations seek to reduce their economic and political dependence on Washington.</p>

          <p>After reaching their highest levels in over two decades, mortgage rates have been on a consistent downward trajectory throughout 2025, providing some relief for the housing market. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped by more than half a percentage point since the beginning of the year. Economists suggest that rates could fall further, depending on future Federal Reserve policy and the performance of the 10-year Treasury yield, offering a glimmer of optimism for potential homebuyers and homeowners considering refinancing.
