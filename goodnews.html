          <p>David Huerta, president of the California division of the Service Employees International Union, was charged with conspiracy to impede an officer after being arrested during anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. According to court documents, Huerta allegedly blocked a gate to an ICE staging ground and resisted law enforcement efforts to move him. Newsom and other Democratic leaders have denounced the arrest, while Huerta himself stated the protests are about resisting injustice against hard-working people and families. He was released on a $50,000 bond and is due back in court in July.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have increased significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by consumer demand, factory investments, and the need to offset losses from US tariffs. Manufacturers are increasingly shipping goods to Southeast Asia for final assembly and re-export, including to the United States, to avoid tariffs. Analysts note that this shift reflects a diversification of export destinations and closer economic ties between China and Southeast Asian countries. This allows some exports to be transshipped from China via Southeast Asia to avoid US tariffs.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdose risk for those aged 20 to 29. This trend is attributed to factors including wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl potency, and less risky drug use among teens. Despite this positive shift, addiction remains a severe issue for many, and potential cuts in funding for addiction services pose a threat to sustaining progress. Researchers are studying the reasons behind this decline to better understand how to continue saving lives.</p>
