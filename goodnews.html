        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration is considering limiting COVID-19 vaccine access to adults over 65 and those with specific medical conditions, potentially requiring further studies for healthy individuals under 65. This shift contrasts with the previous recommendation of annual COVID shots for everyone aged 6 months and older. Agency leaders believe additional doses offer uncertain benefits to younger, already vaccinated individuals. Some experts worry these restrictions will deny vaccines to those who want them, while others support the risk-based approach. Clinical trials may be required before wider vaccine approval.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor has announced that the RAV4 SUV, the top-selling SUV in the United States, will be exclusively offered as a hybrid model as part of its redesign. The 2026 Toyota RAV4 will only be available as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid, eliminating the traditional gas engine option. The company's decision is driven by the increasing popularity of hybrid models and growing customer demand. The redesigned RAV4 will include interior and exterior design changes, as well as upgrades to performance and technologies. The RAV4 faces new challenges this year with President Donald Trump's ongoing tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts.</p>

          <p>Taku Eto has resigned as Japan's farm minister following a backlash over his admission that he does not buy rice due to receiving it from supporters, a remark deemed insensitive amid soaring rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as Eto's replacement. The controversy dealt a blow to Ishiba ahead of an upcoming election, with public support for his Cabinet at its lowest since he took office. Eto's resignation came shortly after the Agriculture Ministry decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles in an attempt to lower prices.</p>

The total reached 89,179, although it remains below the peak in fiscal 2018. The number of international students accepted into Japan reached a record high, driven by the popularity of Japanese subcultures and the yen's depreciation. The most common destinations for Japanese students were the United States, Australia, and South Korea.

          <p>The 'Tush Push', a signature play of the Philadelphia Eagles, is under scrutiny in the NFL, with proposals to ban it citing player safety and pace of play concerns. Despite concerns, NFL data suggests the play doesn't pose a significant safety risk due to its infrequent use. While some, like Washington Commanders linebacker Frankie Luvu, view it as a 'cheapo play' akin to a rugby scrum, others, including Eagles center Jason Kelce, argue it's not particularly dangerous. The play involves the quarterback being pushed forward by teammates for short-yardage gains, sparking debate about its place in football.</p>

          <p>Palo Alto Networks shares fell despite reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its April quarter. The company's revenue increased 15% year over year to $2.29 billion, and adjusted earnings per share increased 21% to 80 cents. CEO Nikesh Arora highlighted the company's success in platformization and the growth of its next-generation security products, particularly Cortex XSIAM. However, the stock's decline may be attributed to the company not raising its full-year outlook for key metrics, such as remaining performance obligation and next-gen security ARR. Despite the drop, analysts maintain a positive outlook on the company's long-term prospects. (not investment advice)</p>
