          <p>Psychiatrist Awais Aftab discusses the often-overlooked downsides of antidepressant medications, noting that while they can be transformative for some, many patients experience sexual side effects, manic episodes, or severe withdrawal symptoms when attempting to taper off the drugs. Aftab emphasizes the lack of high-quality research guiding clinicians on safely tapering patients off antidepressants, despite millions of people taking them long-term. He argues that psychiatry needs to engage seriously with patients' concerns and acknowledge the trade-offs of these medications to maintain credibility and avoid ceding the conversation to those who might exploit the suffering of vulnerable individuals for personal or political gain. The article calls for more research into the long-term effects and safe tapering strategies for antidepressants.</p>

          <p>The Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, a family-run business for 50 years, is experiencing the impact of decreased consumer sentiment, according to its manager, Stanley Kallivrousis. Kallivrousis notes a reduction in foot traffic and changes in customer eating habits, with people sharing meals and taking leftovers home due to economic pressures. He has paused expansion plans and faces challenges in retaining staff, as some workers leave for the gig economy's flexibility. The article highlights the broader economic uncertainty affecting businesses, with companies raising prices and pulling back on investments amid tariff concerns, though food prices have remained relatively steady.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris secured victory in a chaotic, wet-to-dry Miami Grand Prix sprint race, overtaking his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri with the aid of a safety car. Piastri had led from the start, passing Kimi Antonelli, but the safety car period, triggered by a crash between Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson, allowed Norris to pit and rejoin in the lead. Max Verstappen, who initially finished fourth, received a 10-second penalty for an unsafe pit release, dropping him to 17th place, while Antonelli's race was compromised by a collision with Verstappen during the pit stop.</p>

The Department of Justice informed Reporters Without Borders that VOA staff could begin returning to work, with programming set to resume shortly. This development follows a federal appeals court upholding a temporary stay on the executive order, which had eliminated the workforce and activities of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), VOA's parent agency.

He expressed that he doesn't get fearful about financial concerns that worry others, and would see a 50% drop in Berkshire's stock as a "fantastic opportunity."

          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially raising prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs, enacted under President Trump's plan to boost domestic manufacturing, follow earlier tariffs on imported cars. The new levies affect even domestically produced cars, as they often contain foreign-made components. The administration claims the tariffs will protect national security by incentivizing domestic production, but automakers warn of rising costs and supply chain disruptions. While some exemptions exist for parts from Canada and Mexico, uncertainty remains, and General Motors estimates the tariffs could cost it up to $5 billion this year.</p>

          <h2>Capital One's Discover Purchase Could Yield Greater International Payoff</h2>

          <p>Capital One's acquisition of Discover Financial has the potential to be even more lucrative than investors expect, particularly through international expansion. The acquisition is expected to deliver billions in benefits by using Visa and Mastercard less. Discover's payment network generally trails Visa and Mastercard internationally, but if Capital One can close this gap, that would motivate the company to shift more of its Capital One-branded credit cards away from the networks of Mastercard and Visa than currently assumed in the synergy estimate. The global expansion of Discover's network will create a "flywheel effect" for the combined business.</p>

          <h2>Farage's Prime Ministerial Ambition Gains Traction After Reform Success</h2>

          <p>Nigel Farage's ambition to become prime minister is no longer a wild notion, as his Reform party has seen stunning success, challenging the traditional main parties. This week's results show that Farage has changed the race, prompting Labour to prove that government can be a force for good and the Tories to look like a serious outfit. Reform has already been ahead of the Conservatives in the polls for months, with many Tories acknowledging privately it's not impossible that Farage's party could replace them in the medium term.</p>
