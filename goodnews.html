          <p>Manchester City's recent match against Arsenal showcased a significant tactical shift for a Pep Guardiola-managed team, which recorded its lowest-ever possession statistic in a game. This move towards a more defensive, counter-attacking style represents a radical departure from the possession-based football typically associated with Guardiola. The article questions whether this change is a reaction to specific opponents or an admission that the current squad is less suited to his traditional approach.</p>

          <p>China's soybean imports reached near-record levels in August, with a significant majority sourced from Brazil, indicating preparations for a long-term trade standoff with the United States. This surge in purchases from South American growers is a strategic move to hedge against supply uncertainties as Chinese tariffs on U.S. agricultural products are expected to have a greater impact. While imports from the U.S. saw a slight increase, they represent only a small fraction of China's total procurement.</p>
