          <p>Two young bears named Mish and Lucy escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in the U.K. and feasted on a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The park stated that the bears posed no threat to the public, though visitors were escorted to a secure building as a precaution. Keepers monitored the bears and used recall training to guide them back to their enclosure without intervention. An investigation is underway to determine how the bears escaped, with the park citing an "operational error." The park assured the public that the structural integrity of the enclosure remained uncompromised, and they are taking the incident seriously.</p>

The film follows a 12-year-old boy named Spike as he journeys to find a cure for his mother's illness in a post-apocalyptic world. Director Danny Boyle applies a captivating digital aesthetic, using iPhones to create a fever dream crossed with an immersive video game. The film explores how isolation reshapes the human mind and ends on a cliffhanger, with a sequel set to be released in January.</p>
