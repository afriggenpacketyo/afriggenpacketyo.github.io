Hern√°ndez expressed sadness and anger at the treatment of immigrants, highlighting Los Angeles as a welcoming city. These statements come as community leaders and fans increase pressure on the Dodgers to take a public stand against the raids, especially after federal agents attempted to use Dodger Stadium's parking lots for processing after raids.

The vote followed an emotional debate, with MPs sharing personal experiences of witnessing the deaths of loved ones. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer supported the measure, while Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch opposed it. The bill includes safeguards to prevent coercion, but critics remain concerned about the protection of vulnerable individuals.

          <p>With college costs continuing to rise, securing low student loan rates is essential for many students. Federal undergraduate loan rates are decreasing to 6.39% for the 2025-26 academic year, offering some relief. To get the best rates, experts recommend starting with federal loans, shopping around among private lenders, optimizing your credit profile, and using a cosigner if possible.

          <p>AAA projects a record 72 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more during the nine-day Independence Day holiday period, from June 28 to July 6. New highs are expected for both drivers and air travelers as summer travel reaches peak season. Airport officials are implementing new technology to reduce wait times, such as enhanced passenger processing technology using facial recognition. Top summer destinations include Las Vegas, Orlando, Tokyo, and London. Travel demand reflects both practical and emotional factors, with people wanting to get away and not be home.</p>
