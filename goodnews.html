          <p>David French discusses Justice Jackson's opinion in Ames v. Ohio, a Supreme Court case about sexual orientation discrimination. The case examines how the law should treat individuals versus members of a group, particularly concerning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The court unanimously decided that a heterosexual woman, Marlean Ames, who was discriminated against based on her sexual orientation, had grounds to sue under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. This ruling underscores the importance of individual rights over group affiliations in legal contexts and signals a potential shift in how DEI initiatives are viewed by the court, emphasizing individual justice over group-based considerations. The court's decision highlights the complexities of balancing historical injustices with contemporary legal standards.</p>

          <p>Damage to the Santa Cruz Wharf from winter storms has prompted debate about whether to fully rebuild the structure, given the increasing impact of climate change and sea-level rise. A 180-foot section of the wooden pier collapsed into the ocean, leading to a $1 million partial repair project, but a full restoration would cost $14 million. City officials are seeking state funding for the rebuild, considering the long-term viability of the wharf in the face of more frequent and intense storms. The situation highlights the challenges coastal communities face in preserving aging infrastructure amidst growing environmental threats and economic constraints.</p>
