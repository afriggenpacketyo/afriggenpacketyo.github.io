          <p>Voters in South Texas, largely SpaceX employees, approved the incorporation of Starbase as an official city, fulfilling Elon Musk's vision for the area. The new city, located near the Mexico border, will manage its own roads, utilities, and potentially schooling and medical care. Critics worry about Musk's increased control, including the potential to close a popular beach and state park for launch operations, as SpaceX seeks to increase launch frequency. The South Texas Environmental Justice Network continues to protest the city vote and beach access issues.</p>
