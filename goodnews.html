          <p>Chip manufacturers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to an unprecedented deal with the U.S. government, paying 15% of their revenue from specific high-tech chip sales to China. This arrangement was a condition for securing export licenses, allowing the companies to sell their advanced AI chips, like Nvidia's H20, to the Chinese market after previous bans. While the move signals easing trade tensions, some analysts question the logic of addressing national security concerns with a financial payment. The deal highlights the strategic complexities of the global tech trade. (not investment advice)</p>

The Reserve Bank of India has been actively intervening in currency markets to stabilize the rupee against external pressures. A softer U.S. dollar, driven by expectations of a Fed rate cut, is also anticipated to support the Indian currency's position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As part of a new road safety strategy, the UK government is considering implementing compulsory eye tests for drivers over the age of 70. The proposed change would require older motorists to pass an eye test every three years upon renewing their license, or risk being banned from driving. This move follows a coroner's report that criticized the UK's "lax" licensing system after several fatal accidents involving drivers with poor eyesight. The strategy also includes proposals to tighten drink-driving limits and introduce penalties for passengers not wearing seatbelts.</p>

          <h2>Physicists Explain the Theoretical "Music" Radiated by Newly Formed Black Holes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, newly formed ones theoretically produce a unique form of "music" through gravitational waves. This phenomenon occurs as a baby black hole, created from a star's collapse or a merger, settles into a stable, perfect shape defined by its mass and spin. During this brief, violent process, the distortion of spacetime rings out, analogous to a bell. These vibrations, predicted by general relativity, are a pure expression of the black hole's fundamental properties, offering a unique way to study these cosmic objects.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests China's New Childcare Subsidies May Disproportionately Benefit Poorer Regions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan annually for each child under three years old. An analysis of the policy suggests it will have a more significant economic impact in less affluent regions where the handout represents a larger percentage of average income. For example, the subsidy amounts to over 13% of an average resident's annual income in Gansu province, compared to just 4% in Shanghai. This disparity could lead to a greater boost in consumption and potentially birth rates in smaller cities and rural areas.</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose captured his first PGA Tour title in over two years, winning the St. Jude Championship after a dramatic three-hole playoff against American JJ Spaun. Rose, who had lost a playoff at this year's Masters, held his nerve to secure the victory with a birdie on the third extra hole. The win was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with the lead but finished one stroke short of the playoff. For the 45-year-old Rose, the victory was a gratifying return to form.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled new measures to help newly qualified nurses and midwives in England secure jobs within the NHS, addressing a surplus of graduates compared to available vacancies. The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing hospital trusts to hire more proactively based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise. While nursing unions have welcomed the move as a positive step, they caution that its success will depend on whether graduates can actually find jobs. Trust representatives have also raised questions about funding.</p>

          <p>In the Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory over the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance delivered another strong performance, seemingly closing the gap in the race for the backup position. Lance showcased his dual-threat ability, completing several passes and rushing for 48 yards, including a five-yard touchdown run. In contrast, veteran Taylor Heinicke appeared rusty in his first preseason action. The game also highlighted the Chargers' defensive depth, with undrafted rookie Eric Rogers making two interceptions, one of which he returned for a touchdown, strengthening his roster case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 2022 study conducted on mice has suggested a plausible, though not yet proven in humans, link between nose-picking and an increased risk of dementia. Researchers found that bacteria could travel up the olfactory nerve to the brain, particularly when the nasal tissue was damaged. This bacterial presence triggered a response in the mouse brains—the deposit of amyloid-beta proteins—that resembles a key sign of Alzheimer's disease. While the findings are preliminary and require human studies, they offer a new avenue for understanding environmental factors in the disease's onset.</p>
