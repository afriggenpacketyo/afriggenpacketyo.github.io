          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia are scheduled to meet in Malaysia for negotiations aimed at ending a deadly border dispute that has claimed at least 34 lives. The talks were organized following diplomatic intervention from the United States, with President Trump reportedly pressing both nations to agree to a ceasefire. The conflict, which flared up after a landmine explosion, has displaced over 168,000 people and led to both countries recalling their ambassadors. Despite the agreement to meet, fighting reportedly continued over the weekend along the contested border.</p>

          <p>Ohio State University President Ted Carter stated he is not feeling significant pressure from federal investigations into alleged antisemitic practices and diversity policies on campus. He expressed confidence that the university's actions will withstand scrutiny and noted that research funding has not been severely impacted compared to some Ivy League institutions. Carter acknowledged a decline in public confidence in higher education, citing concerns over cost, relevance, and political bias.

          <p>German football club Bayern Munich has agreed to a deal with Liverpool to sign Colombian forward Luis Diaz for a fee of €75 million (£65.5 million), including add-ons.

Since joining Liverpool from Porto in 2022, he has scored 41 goals in 148 appearances, enjoying his most prolific season in 2024-25.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is celebrating a significant box office weekend, with two of its major films, "Superman" and "F1," each crossing the $500 million mark in global ticket sales. The success of "Superman" is a major boost for the studio's revamped DC Studios, as it is the first film released under the new leadership of James Gunn and Peter Safran. For Apple, which produced "F1," the achievement solidifies the film as its most successful theatrical release to date. The dual milestones underscore the continued drawing power of major blockbusters in the current cinema landscape.</p>

          <p>Disney and Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps" has made a powerful debut at the box office, earning an estimated $118 million in domestic ticket sales during its opening weekend. The film's strong performance, which brought its global total to $218 million, is seen as a significant success for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has faced criticisms of "superhero fatigue" and inconsistent quality in recent years. This successful launch, following other recent hits, suggests that well-received films with strong stories can still draw large audiences. The movie's positive critical reception and audience scores indicate it may have strong staying power.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri claimed victory at the Belgian Grand Prix after a decisive overtake on his McLaren teammate Lando Norris on the first lap of the rain-affected race. The Australian driver managed his medium tires expertly to last the entire race without a second pit stop, a strategy that his team initially questioned. This impressive win extends Piastri's lead in the championship standings to 16 points. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc secured the final podium position, holding off Red Bull's Max Verstappen in a race that was delayed by over an hour due to heavy rain.</p>

          <p>Preparations are now underway to refit a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet donated by the Qatari royal family for President Trump's use as Air Force One. Senior U.S. officials have reportedly seen the floor plans for the aircraft, which will require extensive and costly renovations to meet security and operational standards before it can enter service. The donation, which the president has called a "gift," has raised constitutional questions about a president accepting valuable items from foreign states. The U.S. government and Qatar are expected to finalize the transfer agreement this week.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that President Trump is willing to negotiate a trade deal with the European Union but needs a "good enough" offer to avert threatened tariffs. Speaking ahead of the August 1 deadline, Lutnick reiterated the administration's belief that there is a 50-50 chance of reaching an agreement. His comments suggest that a primary U.S. demand is for the EU to open its markets further to American exports. The ambiguity of what constitutes a "good enough" deal, however, leaves the outcome of the high-stakes negotiations uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

The current suspension of heavy tariffs, which was agreed to in May, is set to expire on August 12. While the extension would prevent an immediate escalation of the trade war, insiders do not expect the talks to yield major breakthroughs on significant sticking points, such as U.S. concerns over China's industrial overcapacity. The Chinese delegation is also expected to press the U.S. on tariffs related to fentanyl. (not investment advice)</p>

Starmer will likely welcome American efforts to secure a ceasefire and discuss further actions to get aid into the territory, where aid agencies warn of mass starvation. The meeting comes as the UK government faces growing pressure, both domestically and internationally, to take a stronger stance, including calls to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Starmer has recently confirmed the UK is working with Jordan on aid drops and accelerating medical evacuations for children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the new "Trump IRA" for children, established in a recent bill, suggests that while the initial $1,000 government contribution is a welcome bonus, other savings vehicles offer superior long-term benefits. The article argues that after-tax accounts like 529 plans for education and Roth IRAs provide more flexibility and tax-free growth. Furthermore, it highlights whole life insurance policies as a powerful but often overlooked strategy, as they can lock in low premiums, build cash value, and guarantee future insurability for a child. The piece concludes that parents should explore these more robust options for their children's financial future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day workweek have shown significant improvements in employee well-being, and it's not just due to having an extra day off. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a major factor in increased happiness is that employees feel more effective and productive at their jobs. Faced with less time, teams are forced to streamline processes, eliminate busywork, and focus on high-impact tasks, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment. This feeling of being on top of their work contributes significantly to lower stress and better overall mental health.</p>
