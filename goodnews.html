          <p>Asia-Pacific markets opened higher on Monday following China's decision to keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged, a move anticipated by analysts. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices saw gains, as did South Korea's Kospi, which hit a record high. This market optimism comes ahead of new economic data from China, with Reuters-polled analysts expecting a slowdown in third-quarter GDP growth to 4.8%. The stability in lending rates signals a cautious approach to monetary policy amidst global economic uncertainties and domestic growth adjustments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential run-off election with over 54% of the vote, marking a significant shift after two decades of leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party rule. The election occurred as Bolivia grapples with its worst economic crisis in decades, characterized by a severe shortage of US dollars, a devalued currency, and 23% inflation. Both Paz and his conservative rival, Jorge Quiroga, campaigned on promises to stabilize the economy, attract foreign investment, and restructure state-owned businesses, though Paz aims to avoid an IMF loan. His victory signals a likely pivot towards stronger relations with the United States, potentially reshaping Bolivia's geopolitical alliances.</p>

          <p>French luxury goods conglomerate Kering announced the sale of its beauty division to L'Oreal for 4 billion euros ($4.66 billion), with the deal expected to finalize in the first half of 2026. L'Oreal will acquire the high-end fragrance company House of Creed and gain licenses to develop beauty and fragrance products for Kering's major brands like Gucci and Balenciaga. The companies also plan to establish a strategic committee to coordinate brand efforts and explore joint ventures in the growing wellness and longevity markets. This move aims to leverage L'Oreal's expertise to scale Kering's beauty presence and unlock long-term potential, building on a previous successful partnership for Yves Saint Laurent Beauté.</p>

          <h2>LiDAR Maker Founder Challenges Elon Musk's Vision-Only Approach to Self-Driving Technology</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 20:08:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Steven Qiu, founder of leading LiDAR maker RoboSense, argues that a multi-sensor system, incorporating LiDAR, is safer and more effective for self-driving vehicles than Elon Musk's vision-only approach. Qiu asserts that vision-only systems struggle with "corner cases," like detecting white cars against a bright sky or black cars in tunnels, which prevent achieving higher levels of driving automation. While Musk has long dismissed LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary" for cars, Qiu notes that LiDAR costs have significantly decreased, and its performance has improved. Other auto executives, like Ford CEO Jim Farley, also consider LiDAR "mission critical" for robust autonomous driving capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts polled by Reuters anticipate China's economy likely slowed in the third quarter, with official data expected to confirm a weaker growth trajectory. Gross domestic product growth is forecasted to rise 4.8% in the July-to-September period, a decrease from the 5.2% recorded in the previous quarter. Fixed-asset investment, a key economic indicator that includes real estate, is estimated to have expanded by only 0.1% in the first nine months of the year. Retail sales and industrial production are also projected to show slower growth in September, despite continued resilience in China's exports amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Millions across India are celebrating Diwali, the festival of lights, a significant Hindu observance marked by lamps, sweets, and firecrackers. However, the festivities exacerbate air pollution, a critical issue in northern India during winter months. This year, the Supreme Court permitted "green crackers" in Delhi, which claim to emit 20-30% less pollution, ending a ban in place since 2020. Critics remain skeptical of their environmental effectiveness, as previous restrictions on firecrackers have often been flouted. Beyond fireworks, Diwali involves extensive home decorations, gift exchanges, and the worship of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, boosting the economy and fostering community spirit.</p>

          <p>The global market for secondhand luxury items is experiencing rapid growth, expanding at three times the rate of the firsthand market and projected to reach $360 billion by 2030. This surge has made authentication a crucial differentiator for credible resale platforms, as counterfeit manufacturing becomes increasingly sophisticated. Companies like Carousell and Bunjang are investing heavily in verification systems, combining visual inspections, scientific equipment, and AI to ensure authenticity, offering money-back guarantees. Affordability remains the primary driver for consumers, but access to rare or discontinued collections also attracts younger shoppers, who frequently buy, enjoy, and resell items, reflecting a fundamental shift in luxury consumption.</p>

Later, Witkoff, having lost his own son, shared condolences with top Hamas negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, whose son was killed in an Israeli strike, transforming a tense negotiation into a moment of shared humanity.

          <p>China's upcoming Five Year Plan, to be decided by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, will outline the nation's key goals for 2026-2030, with historical plans having profoundly reshaped the global economy. The "reform and opening up" policy of 1981-84 transformed China into a manufacturing powerhouse, leading to the "China shock" in Western economies. Later, the 2011-15 plan focused on "strategic emerging industries" like green technology, establishing China's dominance in renewables and critical rare earth supply chains. The current 2021-2025 plan emphasizes "high quality development," aiming for technological leadership and self-reliance, which Western countries increasingly view as a national security threat, fueling diplomatic tensions.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new vocational courses, called V-levels, for 16-year-olds to simplify the post-GCSE qualification landscape in England. These V-levels are intended to replace Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, with the Department for Education citing craft and design, and media production as examples. Additionally, an alternative qualification will be introduced to reduce the number of teenagers resitting maths and English GCSEs, a policy that has faced criticism for its low pass rates. The initiative aligns with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's goal for two-thirds of young people to pursue university or technical qualifications, aiming to provide clearer pathways for students.</p>
