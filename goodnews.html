          <p>Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka was notably absent from the England squad facing Andorra in a World Cup qualifier, alongside Conor Gallagher and Ollie Watkins, the latter due to a minor injury. Head coach Thomas Tuchel mentioned that Saka had only participated in one full training session during the week, suggesting a link between his omission and his fitness. Saka, 23, has yet to play under Tuchel, having missed the German's first camp due to injury, and it remains uncertain whether he will participate in the friendly against Senegal on June 10. England remains unbeaten in World Cup qualifying, having won their first two matches against Latvia and Albania.</p>
