          <p>The Trump administration is set to sign an executive order terminating the general U.S. sanctions program on Syria, a move intended to support the country's new transitional government. The order will lift broad economic restrictions while maintaining targeted sanctions on former president Bashar al-Assad, his associates, and entities linked to human rights abuses, terrorism, and Iranian proxies.

          <p>A key provision in President Trump's major budget bill aims to eliminate federal income taxes on tips, a move the White House frames as a benefit for working-class Americans. The proposal would create a new deduction for tipped workers, though legislative versions differ on income caps and deduction limits, and the tax cut would expire in 2028. Critics, including the Independent Restaurant Coalition and some economists, argue the policy is poorly targeted, as it would not help the lowest-earning workers who already have no federal income tax liability.

          <p>The Trump administration has postponed by one month a plan to cut access to a Department of Defense satellite data program crucial for hurricane forecasting. The delay comes after scientists raised alarms that losing access to the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data could set forecasting back decades. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) stated the initial decision was to mitigate a "significant cybersecurity risk." The postponement follows a request from a NASA director, with the data cut now scheduled for the end of July.</p>

          <p>Ben Askren, a former MMA champion and Olympic wrestler, is recovering after undergoing a double lung transplant, his wife announced. The 40-year-old had been hospitalized for several weeks with severe pneumonia, requiring ventilator support before being placed on the transplant list. His wife expressed immense gratitude to the donor's family and asked for prayers for his recovery. The sudden and serious illness came as a shock, as Askren was reportedly healthy just five weeks prior. He is a decorated athlete with multiple championships.</p>
