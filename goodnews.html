          <p>Varda Space Industries has successfully raised $187 million in a Series C funding round to advance its mission of manufacturing pharmaceuticals in orbit. The company aims to leverage the unique microgravity environment of space, which allows for the creation of drug crystals that are difficult to produce on Earth. This new capital will support the expansion of Varda's operations, including increasing its flight cadence and building out a new lab in California. Having already completed three space launches and with a fourth in orbit, Varda is the first company to process materials beyond the International Space Station.</p>

          <p>Wedbush analyst Dan Ives forecasts that Microsoft is poised to become the next company to achieve a $4 trillion market capitalization, potentially as early as this summer. The prediction is driven by accelerating large-scale artificial intelligence deals and strong growth in the company's cloud services. Ives raised the 12-month price target for Microsoft to $600 per share, suggesting the stock has yet to fully price in its future growth potential in the AI and cloud sectors. This optimistic outlook positions Microsoft to follow Nvidia in reaching this significant financial milestone. (not investment advice)</p>

The Khao Kheow Open Zoo organized a four-day event for the beloved animal, whose name means "bouncy pork" in Thai. The celebration highlights Moo Deng's role in raising awareness for endangered species like the pygmy hippopotamus, which is native to West Africa.

          <p>At the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz pledged that Germany is prepared to purchase additional U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to bolster Ukraine's defenses against Russian aerial attacks. This commitment comes as Kyiv faces relentless daily bombardments and allies discuss urgent military support. Merz stated he had already requested that U.S. President Donald Trump approve the delivery of more systems. The pledge was part of a broader conference where allies committed over €10 billion to aid Ukraine's economic recovery, underscoring the international community's continued support for the nation.</p>

          <p>A Delta flight from Madrid to New York carrying nearly 300 passengers was diverted to an island in the Azores after experiencing a mechanical issue with one of its engines. The plane landed safely at a U.S. Air Force base on the Portuguese island, and all 282 customers and 13 crew members were provided with overnight hotel accommodations and meals. Delta apologized for the delay and arranged for a new aircraft to transport the passengers to New York the following day.

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high on Thursday, exceeding $113,000 as investors showed renewed appetite for risk assets. The rally was fueled by significant short liquidations, with over $318 million in short positions being closed in a 24-hour period, forcing traders to buy back bitcoin and further driving up its price. The upward trend, which began Wednesday, also lifted other cryptocurrencies, with major altcoins like Ether and Solana seeing gains. This movement comes after weeks of range-bound trading, supported by strong inflows into bitcoin ETFs and purchases by public companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In celebration of its third anniversary, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured stunning new images of the Cat's Paw Nebula, located about 4,000 light-years from Earth. The images focus on one of the nebula's three dust and gas clouds, revealing an active region of star formation where young, bright stars are carving out the surrounding material. The telescope's infrared camera pierced through the cosmic dust to show these nascent stars, which appear in yellow and blue, as well as dense red and brown filaments where future stars may form. The discovery continues Webb's mission of unveiling previously hidden aspects of the universe.</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly flooding in Texas, disaster preparedness experts are emphasizing key safety measures for flash floods, which are becoming more frequent due to climate change. Before a storm, individuals should create a household emergency plan, pack a "go bag," and set up multiple methods for receiving weather alerts. During a flood, the primary advice is to immediately seek higher ground and never attempt to walk, swim, or drive through floodwaters, as just six inches of moving water can sweep a person away. Experts stress that preparedness is crucial, especially for overnight emergencies that can catch people off guard.</p>

          <p>A White House request to rescind $1.1 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is facing resistance from some Senate Republicans. Lawmakers from rural states like South Dakota, Montana, and Alaska are concerned that the cuts would devastate local radio and television stations that serve as the sole source of news and emergency alerts for many communities, including Native American tribes. The recent deadly flash floods in Texas have heightened these concerns about maintaining robust emergency communication systems. While the House approved the cuts, the Senate is considering amendments to protect these vital rural services before a July 18 deadline.</p>

          <p>The film “Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight,” adapted from Alexandra Fuller's memoir, provides a compelling look at a white family's life in 1980s Zimbabwe-Rhodesia during a period of intense civil strife. Told through the eyes of 7-year-old Bobo (Lexi Venter), the movie captures the raw, often unsettling, reality of growing up amidst political violence and racial tension. Directed by Embeth Davidtz, who also delivers a powerful performance as Bobo's mother, the film skillfully balances the naive perspective of a child with the dark undertones of the surrounding conflict.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 14:03:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities can serve as a powerful tool to supplement Social Security and create a more secure retirement. By providing a guaranteed income stream, an annuity can allow a retiree to delay claiming Social Security benefits, which increases the eventual monthly payout by about 8% for each year of delay past full retirement age. This strategy creates a higher lifetime income. Furthermore, annuity payments can fill the financial gaps left by Social Security, covering essential expenses and helping to manage taxes on retirement income by offering more control over annual taxable distributions.
