          <p>India is experiencing a resurgence in chess, becoming a global hub for the game with numerous grandmasters and young, top-ranked players. The country's men's and women's teams excelled at the Chess Olympiad, and Gukesh Dommaraju became the youngest-ever world champion at age 18. Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, is considered the epicenter of Indian chess, fostering talent through grassroots training and supportive parents. The rise of chess in India is also attributed to the increasing opportunities for players to make a living from the game and the efforts to make chess education accessible in local languages.</p>

          <p>Tinder is testing a new feature that allows premium users to filter potential matches by height, sparking mixed reactions among daters. Some worry it may stifle connections, while others believe it could help shorter men find matches. Ashley, who is 5ft 1in, found love with her 5ft 6in partner Joe on Tinder and believes the filter could have prevented them from meeting. Experts note that such filters are common on dating apps, but Tinder's size gives the experiment significant weight in the dating world.</p>

          <p>A network of women in Latin America transformed safe, self-managed abortions by sharing information about misoprostol, a drug used to induce abortions. Activists connected the dots, realizing that women could end pregnancies despite severe legal restrictions. Hotlines were established in Ecuador and Argentina to provide information and support. In Mexico, "acompa√±amiento" (accompaniment) was developed, offering support throughout the abortion process, and in Argentina, Socorristas en Red systematized accompaniment, training volunteers and tracking data to strengthen relationships with doctors.</p>
