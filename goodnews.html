Despite challenges such as the fragile state of the cords and the disappearance of knowledge on how to read them, scholars are making progress using linguistic analysis, radiocarbon dating, and AI. New khipus discovered in the remote village of Jucul could provide valuable clues to understanding Inca history and culture.

Sources close to the president downplayed the event, attributing it to a moment of decompression before the start of a week-long Southeast Asian tour.

Trump's decision to delay the tariffs until July 9 followed a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed readiness to advance trade talks.

          <p>Analysts caution that the potential for a trade war has not completely dissipated despite President Trump's delay of rolling out 50% tariffs on the European Union, and investors should "buckle up" for more volatility. Trump announced on Sunday that he had agreed to push the rollout of the punitive import duties back to July 9, following a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The president had initially called for a 50% tariff on EU goods to begin on June 1.  The EU does have capacity to retaliate should massive tariffs be levied on its exports by the Trump administration, Wolff added, pointing to the importance of its pharmaceutical products to the U.S., and the potential for retaliatory measures to be implemented in the services sector.

The article argues that the current environmental crisis stems from a failure to recognize nonhuman actors and that new narratives are needed to foreground their role in shaping our world.

          <p>Despite alarming signs of democratic erosion during Donald Trump's second term, the United States possesses exceptional traits that protect it from a complete unraveling, including a robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, and a constitutional system that makes executive preferences hard to entrench. A diverse and free private press, a federal system of government, and a uniquely speech-protective legal tradition also contribute to this resilience. These features empower dissenters and make it difficult for aspiring autocrats to consolidate power, distinguishing the U.S. from countries where democracy has recently declined.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to spend 900 billion yen on emergency economic measures to counter the negative impacts of higher U.S. tariffs, marking the nation's first fiscal response to President Donald Trump's trade duties, sources close to the matter said Monday. The overall scale of the relief package is estimated to reach up to 2.8 trillion yen, including spending by local governments, in a bid to tackle a potential downturn in the broader economy, the sources added. The University of Tokyo said Monday it is considering temporarily accepting international students from Harvard University if they are affected by the U.S. government's move to bar them from studying at the institute.
