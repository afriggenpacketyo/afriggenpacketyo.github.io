          <p>Ecuadorian drug lord Adolfo "Fito" Macias, leader of the powerful Los Choneros gang, has been extradited to the United States to face charges of cocaine trafficking and firearms smuggling. This marks the first time Ecuador has extradited one of its own citizens. Macias was recaptured in June after a high-profile escape from a maximum-security prison in January, which prompted Ecuador's president to declare a state of "internal armed conflict." Once a peaceful nation, Ecuador has become a key transit point in the global cocaine trade, with gangs like Los Choneros, linked to Mexican cartels, fueling widespread violence.</p>

          <p>An FBI supervisor, Eduardo Valdivia, has been found guilty of sexually assaulting three women whom he lured to secret tattoo parlors he operated. Prosecutors stated that Valdivia used fake names and an Instagram account to offer free tattoos and modeling contracts, then filmed himself assaulting the women and used the footage for blackmail. During the trial, Valdivia admitted to destroying evidence after learning a warrant was issued for his arrest. A jury found him guilty on all counts, including four counts of second-degree sexual assault, and he now faces a lengthy prison sentence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to concerns about market volatility from looming trade tariff deadlines, market analyst Jim Cramer argues that stocks are well-positioned for gains. He points to several positive factors, including terrific corporate earnings, a new tax bill with provisions that will boost the economy, and massive investment needed for data centers and the electric grid. He also highlights a coming renaissance in the U.S. energy sector and a more favorable environment for mergers and acquisitions. Cramer suggests these tailwinds are more powerful than the potential headwinds from trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1984-85 miners' strike. The incident involved thousands of police officers and striking miners clashing outside a coking plant in Rotherham, leading to numerous injuries and the arrest of 95 miners. The subsequent criminal case against the miners collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for decades, expressed cautious elation, hoping it will finally bring truth and accountability for an event considered a dark chapter in British industrial history.</p>

          <p>Following his commanding victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler is solidifying his status as the most dominant force in men's golf since Tiger Woods in his prime. This analysis highlights how Scheffler's run of four major titles in four seasons, along with numerous other wins, has drawn frequent comparisons to Woods's early career. While Scheffler himself dismisses the parallels as premature, his peers and pundits point to his machine-like consistency and ruthless ability to close out tournaments as "Tiger-like." His success is attributed to a combination of mental calm, unorthodox but effective technique, and a recently improved putting game.</p>

          <p>Coldplay frontman Chris Martin has begun giving audiences a friendly warning before the band's "Jumbotron Song," advising them to be prepared to appear on the large screens. This new practice follows a recent concert where the camera focused on a man and woman who appeared to be in an affair, an incident that quickly went viral online. The two individuals were later identified as the CEO and chief people officer of a tech company, leading to the CEO's resignation and a formal investigation by the company. The band has not directly addressed the viral moment, but the new on-stage warning serves as a tacit acknowledgment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert argues that the single most important skill to teach a child for a successful life is "self-connection"—the ability to tune into and trust their own emotions and inner voice. The expert suggests that common parenting phrases like "you're fine" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, undermining their self-esteem. Fostering self-connection through validating emotions and allowing autonomy helps build emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. This strong sense of self is presented as a powerful buffer against anxiety and a foundation for lifelong mental health.</p>

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, stated that while an extension of the current 90-day pause on new tariffs between the two nations is almost inevitable, the business community remains concerned. He noted that discussions have been almost exclusively about tariffs, overlooking other critical issues impacting the trade relationship. Stein suggested that China's recent move to restrict fentanyl precursors could create a path toward normalizing trade if the U.S. reciprocates by lowering related tariffs. However, he emphasized that the narrow focus on tariffs is a source of worry for the over 270 American companies his organization represents.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has founded a nonprofit, Better Angels, with the ambitious goal of proving that affordable housing can be built profitably without taxpayer money. His model involves a $300-million investment fund that provides private equity to finance projects, which he believes will allow for faster and cheaper construction than the traditional government-subsidized system. By aiming for market-rate returns, Miller hopes to attract for-profit developers to the affordable housing space. While the resulting rents may not serve the most acutely low-income individuals, the goal is to create a new supply of housing for those with vouchers or modest incomes.</p>
