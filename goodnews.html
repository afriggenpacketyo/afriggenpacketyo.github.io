          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced on social media that he has persuaded Coca-Cola to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar in its U.S. products. Trump, a known fan of Diet Coke, praised the move as being "just better" for consumers. In response, Coca-Cola did not explicitly confirm the change but acknowledged Trump's enthusiasm and stated that details on new product innovations would be shared soon. The company already uses cane sugar in its products sold in other countries, such as Mexico.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama have jointly addressed and humorously dismissed persistent rumors about their potential divorce. Appearing together on a podcast, they joked about the speculation, which had been fueled by Barack Obama attending several high-profile events alone. Michelle Obama explained her absence from some events as a newfound freedom to make her own choices now that their daughters are grown. She reaffirmed the strength of their marriage, stating she has never considered leaving him despite facing hard times together.</p>

          <p>Germany has committed to passing new legislation by the end of the year to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants across the English Channel to the UK. The new law will make it illegal to facilitate migration to a non-EU country like the UK, closing a legal loophole. This change, announced during the German chancellor's visit to the UK, is expected to help authorities disrupt the supply lines for small boats used in the crossings. The move comes as the UK government faces pressure to address a significant increase in Channel crossings.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have observed the birth of a planetary system around a sun-like baby star, or protostar, named HOPS-315. Located 1,300 light-years away, the system shows the earliest stages of planet formation as mineral specks begin to coalesce. Using NASA's Webb Telescope and data from our own solar system, scientists identified the presence of silicon monoxide, a mineral found in ancient meteorites that forms only at very high temperatures near a young star. This discovery provides a glimpse into what our solar system may have looked like in its infancy.</p>

          <p>United Airlines has issued a positive full-year forecast for 2025, with CEO Scott Kirby stating that the world is "less uncertain" and that travel demand is strengthening after a weak start to the year. The airline reported second-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates, although revenue was slightly below expectations. While domestic revenue per seat mile fell, premium cabin sales showed robust growth, indicating continued demand for comfort. The optimistic outlook follows a period of economic uncertainty that had previously led the airline to issue cautious guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking UK study has successfully used a 'three-person DNA' technique to prevent devastating inherited disorders, resulting in the birth of eight healthy children. The method, known as mitochondrial donation, combines genetic material from the parents with healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. This prevents the transmission of mitochondrial diseases, which can be fatal and cause severe disabilities. The children, who now range in age from infants to over two years old, are developing normally, offering hope to families affected by these incurable genetic conditions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that China is making "big steps" in controlling the flow of illicit fentanyl into the United States. This marks a significant shift in tone from his previous statements, where he directly linked the fentanyl crisis to his decision to impose tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump's positive assessment comes amid ongoing high-level trade negotiations between the two countries. The comments were made as he signed the HALT Fentanyl Act, which permanently classifies fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I drugs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. If passed, the legislation would establish consumer protections and clear rules, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. Proponents argue this could lead to faster, lower-cost financial transactions, while critics point to risks such as the digital currency becoming "depegged" from its underlying asset, as seen during the 2023 banking turmoil.
