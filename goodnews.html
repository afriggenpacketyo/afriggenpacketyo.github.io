          <p>A new pilot program in UK primary schools is teaching children as young as five about sun safety to reduce future rates of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer. The initiative, which is being trialed in Kent, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, aiming to instill lifelong protective habits. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases adult cancer risk, and this preventative education is seen as crucial as melanoma diagnoses are projected to rise.</p>

          <p>Japan successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of a 24-year era for the country's space program. The rocket, which has been a reliable workhorse since 2001, lifted off from Tanegashima Island and placed a climate-monitoring satellite into orbit. The H2A series is now being retired in favor of the newer, more cost-effective H3 rocket, as Japan aims to stay competitive in the global satellite launch market.</p>
