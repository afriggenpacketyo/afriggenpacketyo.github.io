          <p>British television personality Davina McCall is engaged to her partner of seven years, celebrity hairdresser Michael Douglas. The news was confirmed by her representative following initial reports. This announcement comes several months after the 57-year-old host of shows like 'Big Brother' and 'Stranded on Honeymoon Island' revealed she had successfully undergone surgery for a benign brain tumor. Douglas had cared for McCall during her recovery, which she described as "the hardest thing" she had been through. This will be McCall's third marriage; she has three children from a previous relationship.</p>

          <p>Elissa Kalver, diagnosed with incurable HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer at age 34, shares her journey of navigating life with a terminal illness while raising a young child. After an initial prognosis gave her an 80% chance of dying within five years, she has focused on prioritizing quality of life through aggressive treatments and clinical trials. Kalver has since founded a nonprofit gift registry for cancer patients, written a book, and become a public speaker. Her story highlights both the grueling reality of lifelong cancer treatment and the resilient mindset required to focus on living fully rather than merely surviving a devastating diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Fast-food restaurants are losing breakfast customers to a growing competitor: food-forward convenience stores. According to market research, morning traffic to fast-food chains saw minimal growth, while visits to convenience stores with robust food offerings climbed 9% in a recent three-month period. Chains like Wawa and Casey's are successfully leveraging their locations to offer quick, varied, and value-driven breakfast options, from coffee to made-to-order sandwiches and pizza. This trend is challenging fast-food giants like McDonald's, which has acknowledged that the breakfast period is currently its weakest and most economically sensitive daypart.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 07:00:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of scientists is urging U.S. health authorities to recognize Chagas disease, spread by "kissing bugs," as an endemic illness rather than one primarily associated with Latin America. The report, published in a CDC journal, argues that low awareness among the public and medical professionals leads to underreporting and missed diagnoses. While most infections are asymptomatic initially, about 20-30% of people can later develop serious cardiac or gastrointestinal problems. By treating the disease as endemic, the authors hope to improve screening, build better public health infrastructure, and ensure that at-risk individuals receive timely treatment.</p>

          <h2>OpenAI's Massive Spending on Cloud Computing Drives Profits for Tech Giants like Oracle</h2>

          <p>Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI is fueling a spending spree across the tech industry, with Oracle being the latest major beneficiary. Oracle's stock surged after revealing massive contracts, including a deal with OpenAI reportedly worth $300 billion for computing power over five years. This follows similar boosts for Microsoft, Nvidia, and Broadcom, all of which have seen their market values soar due to their partnerships with the AI startup. While OpenAI's spending is powering significant growth, some analysts express concern over the market's reliance on a single, cash-burning private company for such a large portion of its momentum.

          <h2>Travel Experts Recommend Flexibility as the Top Strategy for Securing Cheaper Airfare</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 07:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to travel experts at Google Flights, the single most effective advice for finding affordable airfare is to be flexible with travel dates. Data shows that flying midweek—on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Wednesdays—is typically 13% less expensive than traveling on weekends. Even shifting departure or return dates by a day or two can result in significant savings, often around $42 per ticket for domestic flights. The article also debunks the myth that the day of the week you book your flight matters, stating that the day you actually fly is far more important for securing a good deal.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright has officially disbanded the Department of Energy's Climate Working Group, a panel of scientists known for questioning the consensus on climate change. The group authored a controversial report that was heavily criticized by independent scientists for containing errors and misrepresenting climate science. The administration cited this report in its efforts to roll back federal regulations on climate pollution. The decision to dissolve the group was announced as a lawsuit filed by environmental organizations, which alleged the panel was created unlawfully and in secret, was proceeding in court.</p>

          <p>Obtaining a COVID-19 vaccine has become more complicated this year, as the FDA has narrowed its approval to specific groups, including those 65 and older and individuals with high-risk health conditions. This marks a significant shift from previous years when the vaccine was available to nearly everyone. This article provides guidance on how to navigate the new system, explaining the list of qualifying risk factors and the process of "self-attesting" at a pharmacy. It also addresses eligibility for pregnant individuals and children, noting that some may now require a doctor's prescription to receive the shot.</p>

          <p>An exhibition titled "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau" at the Das Minsk museum in Potsdam is exploring the complex legacy of the prefabricated concrete slab apartment blocks that defined East German urban landscapes. Once promoted as a socialist utopia for modern living, these buildings became symbols of dystopia and social decay following German reunification, associated with unemployment and rising extremism. The exhibition uses art to revisit the Plattenbau not just as architectural heritage but as a cultural space reflecting collective memories, social change, and questions of community and belonging in post-GDR Germany.</p>
