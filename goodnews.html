          <h2>China's Exports Surge Despite US Tariffs, Driven by Southeast Asia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 02:38:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, primarily fueled by increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations, which effectively compensated for a significant decline in exports to the United States due to tariffs. While exports to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, shipments to ASEAN countries rose by 20.8%, with notable growth in Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. This surge is attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced, with experts anticipating a gradual weakening of trade data in the coming months, especially with the number of container vessels from China to the U.S. dropping dramatically. Optimism is tempered by the expectation of future trade challenges.</p>

          <p>The Shuangjiangkou hydropower project in southwest China, set to be the world's tallest dam at 315 meters, has commenced water storage on May 1. This $4.9 billion project, situated on the Dadu River in Sichuan province, is being constructed by state-owned Power Construction Corporation of China for power generation and flood control. The water level has already reached 2,344 meters, 80 meters above the original river level. Upon completion, the dam will be slightly taller than the current record holder, the Jinping-I dam, also located in Sichuan, signifying a major infrastructure achievement for China.</p>

          <p>The 19th Venice Architecture Biennale, curated by Carlo Ratti, addresses the urgent need for cities to adapt to extreme heat and other climate change impacts. With the theme "Intelligens. Natural. Artificial. Collective," the biennale emphasizes collaboration across disciplines and generations to rethink the built environment. The focus is on mitigating urban overheating through solutions like increasing green spaces and permeable surfaces, drawing inspiration from cities like Paris, Copenhagen, and Rotterdam, which are implementing climate adaptation strategies. The German Pavilion's "Stress Test" exhibition offers an immersive experience of future urban climates, highlighting the necessity for rapid action to ensure the habitability of European cities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan is maintaining its demand for the complete removal of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, despite a recent U.S.-Britain trade agreement that left some levies in place. Tokyo seeks the full elimination of reciprocal tariffs, including a 25% levy on cars and steel/aluminum, as a condition for reaching an agreement with Washington. The government is dismissing the idea of reducing the consumption tax rate to alleviate the impact of inflation and U.S. tariffs. Japan's household spending in fiscal year 2024 also saw a slight decrease due to rising prices.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Randy Travis, who suffered a near-fatal stroke in 2013, has made a remarkable comeback with the help of artificial intelligence. Collaborating with musician James Dupr√© and producer Kyle Lehning, Travis has released two new songs, "Where That Came From" and "Horses in Heaven," using AI to recreate his voice. The process involved inputting raw vocals from 45 of Travis's songs into an AI model and refining the output to match his tone and inflections. Travis has also returned to touring, with Dupr√© assisting as a special guest vocalist, marking a significant milestone in his career and demonstrating the potential of AI in music.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. tariffs on goods from China may decrease as top trade officials from both countries prepare for negotiations. Referring to the current tariff level of 145%, Trump stated, 'You can't get any higher, so we know it's coming down.' The upcoming meeting in Switzerland signifies a potential de-escalation in the trade war between the two economic giants. Despite this, analysts caution that any tariff cuts are likely to be minor and that significant systemic frictions between the U.S. and China will persist.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests a revival of U.S. strategic interest and involvement in Greenland due to its geographic location and climate considerations. Greenland's location is critical for routes between Russia and the U.S., and the opening of the Arctic Sea gives Russia unimpeded access to open waters. The author proposes the United States, Denmark, and Greenland apply a Pacific model in the Arctic to assure NATO security interests and reinforce international stability. Russia occupies two-thirds of the Arctic coastline, and its portion shows prospects of being ice-free much earlier than the Canadian or the American portion of the Arctic Sea.</p>

          <p>The European wind industry is reassessing its strategy due to policy shifts in the U.S. under the Trump administration, which has halted offshore wind projects. Industry executives are now relying on Europe to compensate for the pullback in the U.S., with expectations that offshore wind will significantly increase its share of Europe's electric power generation by 2050. Despite positive financial results from companies like Vestas and Orsted, challenges remain, including rising prices and regulatory uncertainty. The industry is adapting to these changes, with Vestas geographically arranging its turbine manufacturing to reduce damage from tariffs.</p>

The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports remains in place, but the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates, according to the White House.</p>
