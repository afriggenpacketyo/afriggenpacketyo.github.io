          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's attempt to withhold grant funding from 34 cities and counties with "sanctuary" policies. These policies limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The ruling, from Judge William Orrick, specifically protects Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants, which amount to hundreds of millions of dollars for the affected municipalities, from being stripped. This decision represents a significant setback for the administration's broader effort to compel local jurisdictions to assist in federal immigration enforcement, a campaign that has included multiple legal challenges against states and cities across the country.</p>

Nicoresti's winning show, "Baby Doomer," which explores life as a trans woman, earned high praise and a £10,000 prize. In another milestone, Ayoade Bamgboye won the best newcomer award for her show "Swings and Roundabouts," making her the first Black woman to receive the honor. The awards this year also marked a change, as the long-standing prize for the festival's funniest joke was scrapped.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, sending fountains of lava up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. This marks the 31st eruptive event since December, with the activity currently contained and posing no threat to nearby homes. The U.S. Geological Survey is closely monitoring the situation, providing livestreams that attract hundreds of thousands of viewers. Scientists explain that magma accumulation in lower chambers creates pressure, forcing spectacular but periodic lava displays. While the eruption's duration is uncertain, it provides a dramatic natural spectacle for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.</p>

          <p>For the third consecutive year, the Georgia Institute of Technology has been ranked as the public college with the best return on investment (ROI) in the United States, according to The Princeton Review. The ranking considers a combination of academic quality, financial aid, overall cost, and the post-graduation success of its students. With its strong focus on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), Georgia Tech graduates often command high salaries, contributing to its top valuation. The report underscores that while sticker price is a factor, the ultimate value of a degree often depends on a school's ability to prepare students for lucrative careers.</p>

          <p>College athletics are undergoing a fundamental transformation, moving away from their amateur roots toward a more professionalized model. Recent court rulings allowing student-athletes to be paid have accelerated this shift, particularly in high-revenue sports like football and men's basketball. This evolution is reshaping the landscape of collegiate sports, raising questions about the future of less-profitable, niche sports such as squash and water polo. The article compiles several viewpoints on this change, exploring the implications of treating players as employees and the long-standing debate over fairness and equity in a system that has historically generated immense wealth for institutions.</p>

          <p>A first-of-its-kind technology is offering new hope for stroke survivors who have plateaued in their recovery. The Vivistim System, an FDA-approved implant, uses vagus nerve stimulation during physical therapy to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, a process known as neuroplasticity. The article highlights the story of restaurateur Tommy Fello, who regained significant function in his left arm after receiving the implant, which delivers gentle pulses to the vagus nerve while he performs rehabilitative exercises. Neurosurgeons believe this technology could redefine recovery possibilities for patients with long-term motor deficits following a stroke, representing a major advance in rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>The CEO of the Lobito Atlantic Railway (LAR) has stated that the major Angola rail project is a commercial venture and not a geopolitical move aimed at countering China's influence in Africa. The project, which involves creating a cross-continental railway connecting the Atlantic and Indian Oceans through Zambia and Tanzania, has received backing from the U.S. However, the CEO emphasized that LAR maintains strong business ties with China, serving as a key logistics provider for Chinese-owned mining companies and relying on Chinese manufacturing for equipment. He clarified that the railway is just one component of a larger logistics corridor and that "no geopolitics involved whatsoever."</p>

          <h2>Strategies for Transferring Real Estate Wealth to Heirs While Minimizing Conflict and Taxes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 08:00:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wealth advisors highlight the growing complexity of transferring real estate, valued at up to $25 trillion, from older generations to their children. To avoid family disputes and significant tax burdens, experts suggest specific strategies, such as transferring property through a will or trust at death to benefit from a "step-up in basis" on capital gains. Using legal structures like Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) can protect the assets from lawsuits and provide a framework for usage rules and expenses. Setting aside liquid assets for upkeep and establishing clear buyout provisions are also recommended to ensure a smooth inheritance process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's Evolving Wardrobe Signals a Shift in Diplomatic Strategy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's choice of attire for his recent meeting with President Trump at the White House is being interpreted as a deliberate act of "wardrobe diplomacy." After being criticized for wearing his signature bunker-chic Henley shirt during a previous combative visit, Zelenskyy opted for a more formal black canvas blazer and collared shirt. This sartorial shift is seen as a strategic move to project seriousness and de-escalate tensions, reflecting a change from a wartime footing to high-stakes diplomatic negotiations. The article notes that a politician's clothing often sends a powerful, non-verbal message, much like Winston Churchill's air-raid suit during his 1941 White House visit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest season of the animated series "South Park" is garnering record ratings for its direct and scathing satire of the Trump administration. The show's creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, have centered the new episodes on parodies of President Trump and figures like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. This aggressive critique comes as the show's parent company, Paramount, has been under pressure from the administration, recently settling a lawsuit and agreeing to hire an ombudsman to address alleged "bias." Despite this, the creators are leveraging a new billion-dollar streaming deal, suggesting that the show's commercial value is protecting its creative and political freedom.</p>

          <p>Medical technology giant Medtronic has appointed two new directors, John Groetelaars and Bill Jellison, to its board following engagement with activist investor Elliott Investment Management. The company also formed new Growth and Operating committees to address long-term investor frustration over its stagnating stock price and underwhelming revenue growth. These changes signal a new focus on portfolio management, including tuck-in acquisitions and improving operational efficiency to boost profit margins, which have eroded more than its peers. The move is seen as a constructive step to professionalize the company's process for delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the face of more frequent and powerful hurricanes, Florida is exploring new models of resilient community development and retrofitting existing homes. The article highlights Babcock Ranch, a town designed to be "storm-proof" with features like underground power lines, native landscaping for water absorption, and hurricane-resistant construction, which sustained almost no damage from Hurricane Ian. For lower-income residents unable to relocate, nonprofits and city programs are helping to rebuild and strengthen older homes by elevating them and installing impact-resistant features. These efforts underscore a critical shift toward mitigation, as experts argue that every dollar invested in pre-disaster resilience saves six dollars in post-disaster recovery costs.</p>

          <p>Eddie Horne, a 75-year-old man, has finally received his high school diploma decades after his education was cut short by severe abuse at the notorious Dozier School for Boys. Horne attended the brutal Florida reform school in the mid-1960s, where he endured vicious beatings that led him to drop out of school to support his family. He fulfilled his lifelong goal through a new state compensation program created for victims of abuse at Dozier and a similar institution. After completing the program's requirements, Horne participated in a graduation ceremony, expressing his hope that his story can inspire others who have faced significant setbacks in life.</p>
