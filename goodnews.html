          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 02:37:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled a miniature 10th-century ivory figurine, believed to be the first 'portrait' of a Viking, depicting a meticulously groomed man with an imperial mustache and braided beard. The 1.2-inch walrus tusk carving, found in Norway in 1796 and long forgotten, contrasts with simpler Viking depictions by showcasing detailed facial expressions and a smiling demeanor. Curators suggest the figure, possibly a board game piece representing a king, challenges the perception of Vikings as savage and highlights the importance of grooming and status in their era.</p>

          <p>Mitch Brown, a former player for the West Coast Eagles, has become the first openly gay or bisexual man in the Australian Football League's (AFL) 129-year history. Brown revealed that hiding his sexuality significantly contributed to his decision to retire and expressed hope that his public announcement will foster a safer, more inclusive environment for others. He described a 'hyper-masculinity' within the AFL, where homophobic comments were common, and urged the league to celebrate positive male role models to drive cultural change. Brown believes other closeted players currently exist in the league.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a new passive residual heat removal system, a crucial technology designed to make its next-generation, radioactive waste-recycling fast nuclear reactors more meltdown-proof. Conducted by the China Institute of Atomic Energy, this proof-of-principle test marks a significant breakthrough in developing fourth-generation nuclear plants with a closed-loop fuel cycle. These advanced reactors use high-energy neutrons for greater fuel efficiency and can act as breeders, reprocessing spent fuel within the same facility.

          <h2>China's Industrial Profits Decline Narrows in July Amid Anti-Price War Campaign</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits saw a narrowed decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, a significant recovery from steeper drops in previous months, indicating the positive impact of Beijing's campaign against price wars. The government's tougher regulations aim to ease financial strain on companies, particularly in raw-material manufacturing, which rebounded to 36.9% growth. While mining profits still plunged, the manufacturing and utilities sectors improved. Economists suggest the 'anti-involution' campaign is yielding early effects, but sustained deflationary pressures may require further industry consolidation before a full recovery.

          <p>Britain's Jacob Fearnley achieved his first US Open main-draw victory, overcoming nerves, 16 double faults, and a heckler to defeat Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut in a late-night four-set battle. The 24-year-old Scot, whose ranking has rapidly risen in the past 15 months, admitted his service game was affected by high-tension moments. Fearnley's win sets him up for a second-round rematch against German third seed Alexander Zverev, providing another high-stakes opportunity to refine his game and gain experience at the Grand Slam level.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship rocket successfully completed its tenth test flight, a critical step toward its goals of full reusability and human missions to Mars. The 123-meter vehicle demonstrated satellite deployment for the first time by ejecting eight dummy Starlink units and successfully tested upgraded heat shield tiles during reentry. While challenges like developing a reusable heat shield and orbital refueling remain, this achievement brings Starship closer to its role in NASA's Artemis program for crewed lunar landings and Elon Musk's long-term vision of making humanity multiplanetary.</p>

          <p>A time capsule buried by Diana, Princess of Wales, at Great Ormond Street Hospital (Gosh) in 1991 has been opened, offering a nostalgic glimpse into the 1990s. The lead-encased wooden box contained items selected by competition-winning children, including a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator, a pocket TV, and a passport. Originally intended for unearthing in 'hundreds of years,' it was retrieved to make way for a new children's cancer center. Despite some damage, the artifacts are largely intact, providing a unique historical snapshot and connecting to Diana's legacy at the hospital.</p>
