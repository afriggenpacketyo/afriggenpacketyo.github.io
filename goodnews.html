          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit against The Hershey Company that claimed its Halloween-themed candies were deceptively packaged. Consumers argued that the spooky designs shown on the wrappers, such as faces on Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins, were absent on the actual unwrapped chocolates. The judge ruled that while the appearance might be disappointing, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate economic harm as the candies were not rendered worthless. The plaintiffs' attorney has stated their intention to amend and refile the complaint, continuing the legal challenge.</p>

          <p>Recent research has revealed that advanced artificial intelligence models can now pass all three levels of the rigorous Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam, a feat that typically requires humans over 1,000 hours of study. A study by NYU Stern School of Business and GoodFin found that frontier large language models successfully answered both multiple-choice and complex essay questions from the difficult Level III mock exams. While this technological leap highlights AI's growing analytical reasoning capabilities in finance, experts believe it will transform the industry rather than completely replace human analysts, who excel in understanding nuanced context and client intent.</p>

          <p>Financial regulators are moving to eliminate the $25,000 minimum equity requirement for "pattern day traders," a rule that has been in place since the dot-com era of 2001. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved replacing the fixed threshold with a more flexible intraday margin rule based on the specific positions taken during the day. This change, which is pending SEC approval, aims to make active trading more accessible to retail investors with smaller accounts. The overhaul reflects the significant technological and market access changes that have occurred in the trading landscape over the past two decades.</p>

          <p>India and China conducted separate diplomatic meetings with Global South countries during the UN General Assembly, signaling an ongoing rivalry for leadership of the developing world. Despite recent moves toward rapprochement, the two nations pursued parallel agendas rather than a united front. Chinese Premier Li Qiang chaired a Global Development Initiative event, calling for developed nations to support developing ones. In contrast, India's meeting emphasized south-south cooperation and diversified supply chains, positioning itself as a democratic alternative to China for addressing the challenges faced by the developing world.</p>

          <h2>Ryder Cup Strategist Believes Meticulous Preparation Can Secure European Victory in US</h2>

          <p>Paul McGinley, a strategic adviser to Europe's Ryder Cup team, believes a new level of detailed preparation could help them achieve a rare away victory at Bethpage. Following a heavy defeat in 2021, Europe has invested millions in a data-driven strategy focusing on sports science, analytics, and preparing players for a hostile crowd environment. McGinley notes that this is the most thoroughly prepared European team ever, leveraging data from figures like vice-captain Edoardo Molinari to select experienced players who perform well under pressure on the road. The approach emphasizes marginal gains and constant communication to overcome the challenge of winning in America.</p>

          <p>Sales of newly constructed homes in the U.S. surged by 20.5% in August, a much larger increase than anticipated and the highest level seen since early 2022. This spike occurred even before the recent decline in mortgage rates, suggesting that builder incentives and price cuts were a primary catalyst for the strong performance. Analysts caution that the monthly data is often volatile and subject to revision, but acknowledge it points to underlying strength in the new-build market. The robust sales reduced the inventory of new homes to a 7.4-month supply, down from a nine-month supply in July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Multiple sightings of the rare and massive "pink meanie" jellyfish have been reported along the Texas Gulf coast. This species, scientifically known as Drymonema larsoni, was only officially identified in 2011 and is notable for its size, with tentacles that can reach up to 70 feet and a body weight exceeding 50 pounds. Experts note that their appearance is linked to the abundance of their primary food source, the smaller and more common moon jellyfish. Despite their intimidating name and size, the sting from a pink meanie is considered to be relatively mild for humans.</p>

Cramer and his team view the stock's recent 10% pullback as a buying opportunity. The discussion also touched on rising bond yields impacting the broader market and concerns about vendor financing in the AI sector following Nvidia's large commitment to OpenAI.

          <p>Shares of Canadian mining company Lithium Americas surged over 100% following reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal comes as the company renegotiates a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for its Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, a joint venture with General Motors. An administration official indicated that if loan repayments are deferred, the government wants a small equity stake to mitigate risk for taxpayers. This move reflects a broader White House strategy to secure direct ownership in supply chains for critical minerals essential for technologies like electric vehicle batteries.

Appointed by Mayor Eric Adams in 2023 with a mission to reduce the city's estimated 3 million rats, Corradi was tasked with a $3.5 million initiative that included public awareness campaigns and rat birth control. During her tenure, calls to the city's 311 service line regarding rats saw a significant decrease. Mayor Adams praised her creative and confident approach to the complex task and affirmed that the city's efforts to combat its rodent problem will continue unabated.</p>

          <p>Peter Mutharika has won Malawi's presidential election, ousting incumbent Lazarus Chakwera in a victory driven by public frustration over severe economic hardship. Over the past five years, Malawi has experienced soaring inflation, which surged from under 10% to over 30%, and a rise in poverty affecting a majority of the population. Analysts attribute the economic collapse to overspending, corruption, and inadequate agricultural policies. The incoming president faces immense pressure to restore fiscal discipline, implement austerity measures, and deliver decisive policies that can stabilize the economy and provide relief to citizens.</p>
