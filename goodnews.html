        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ether, the cryptocurrency underpinning Ethereum, achieved a new record high for the first time since 2021, spurred by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole. Powell's comments, suggesting a potential adjustment to policy stance and hinting at September rate cuts, caught traders off guard, leading to significant short liquidations in ETH. This surge reflects a broader market repositioning towards risk-on assets, with momentum returning to the crypto market. Regulatory tailwinds and institutional interest in stablecoins, largely powered by Ethereum, are also contributing to Ether's leadership in the crypto space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korean cafes, particularly in student-heavy areas like Seoul's Daechi, are grappling with "Cagongjok" – customers who occupy seats for extended periods to study or work. This cultural trend, often involving multiple devices and long unattended breaks, is disrupting other patrons and impacting cafe profitability, especially with high rents. Starbucks Korea recently issued guidelines to address "extreme cases" without asking customers to leave, while some independent cafes have implemented "No Study Zones" or time limits. The phenomenon reflects South Korea's hyper-competitive society and a lack of public study spaces, prompting calls for more inclusive environments.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists and divers have recovered ancient artifacts, including a sphinx statue and Roman coins, from the Mediterranean Sea off Egypt's Abu Qir Bay. These relics, dating back over 2,000 years, are believed to be from an extension of the ancient city of Canopus. Many statues are missing heads and feet, damage attributed to a natural disaster like a tsunami or earthquake. The discovery confirms the area was once a thriving residential city and port, highlighting Alexandria's historical significance and its vulnerability to rising sea levels.</p>

Raducanu believes this "huge success" generated significant fan engagement and talk, benefiting the sport.
