          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order that will allow alternative assets, such as private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies, to be included in 401(k) retirement plans. The order directs the Department of Labor to review its guidance on these investments under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). This move is seen as a significant win for the alternative asset industry, which has been advocating for inclusion in defined-contribution plans. While proponents argue this could offer diversification, these assets are often considered riskier due to higher fees and less transparency. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists in Pompeii have uncovered new evidence indicating that survivors of the 79 AD Mount Vesuvius eruption returned to the devastated city. Contrary to the belief that the area was completely abandoned, it appears some residents established an informal settlement amid the ruins. These individuals lived in "precarious conditions," converting the ground floors of old houses into workshops with ovens and mills. This discovery challenges the long-held narrative that focused solely on the city's destruction, revealing a more complex story of survival and adaptation after the cataclysmic event.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has reduced its key interest rate to 4%, a move that will have varied effects on household finances. Homeowners with variable-rate mortgages may see their monthly payments decrease, offering some financial relief. Conversely, savers will likely face lower returns on their deposits, as banks are expected to reduce the interest paid on savings accounts. The central bank's decision aims to stimulate spending and manage the economy, even as it forecasts a temporary rise in inflation later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The form is currently open to a limited group for beta testing, with broader access planned for September and a full launch in October. Financial aid experts believe the earlier, extended testing window will help the department identify and fix potential bugs that caused significant problems in the previous application cycle. An early and smooth FAFSA process is crucial for students, as much federal aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's air force conducted a high-risk medical evacuation to rescue three people from McMurdo Station, an American research base in Antarctica. The nearly 20-hour mission was performed in 24-hour darkness and sub-zero temperatures, conditions that make such flights exceptionally dangerous. A C-130J Hercules crew used night vision goggles to land on a manually prepared ice runway, keeping the engines running during "hot refueling" to prevent freezing. U.S. officials praised the crew's courage and skill, describing the successful operation as "nothing short of heroic."</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by soaring demand for its diabetes drug Mounjaro and weight-loss treatment Zepbound. The pharmaceutical company subsequently raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance for 2025, signaling confidence in its product portfolio. Despite the strong overall performance, the company's stock dipped after it released trial data for a new oral obesity pill that fell slightly below analyst expectations for weight loss efficacy.
