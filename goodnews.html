          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth, with a central component being lower energy costs for businesses. The plan includes exempting over 7,000 UK businesses from some green energy levies, potentially slashing energy bills by up to 25%. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms. The strategy also aims to upskill Britons, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending, focusing on eight specific sectors where the UK is already strong.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott vetoed a bill that would have banned all THC consumables, allowing the state's billion-dollar industry of THC-infused products to continue. The bill would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture, or sell consumable THC products. Critics argued that the ban would prevent people who cannot access marijuana through the state's medical program from obtaining similar relief. Retailers also highlighted the thousands of jobs and millions in revenue generated by the industry.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media is urging Beijing to proactively adapt to the trend of stablecoins by developing yuan-backed versions to promote the currency's global use. The Securities Times argues that while unregulated stablecoins could harm the financial system, forgoing this efficient settlement tool could mean missing an opportunity for the yuan. Experts believe stablecoins offer unique advantages as an emerging payment method, reducing capital and time costs for cross-border transactions. The article suggests that regulating stablecoins would facilitate the internationalization of the yuan.</p>
