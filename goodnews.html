          <p>Several senators are advocating for the advancement of a stringent Russia sanctions bill, with Senator Lindsey Graham indicating potential Senate action this week following discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The proposed legislation aims to impose significant tariffs on countries purchasing energy products from Moscow, with Graham emphasizing the need to hold China and India accountable for supporting Russia's war efforts through oil purchases. Trump has not endorsed the bill but Zelenskyy has expressed a desire for the sanctions and a ceasefire. The bill, known as the "Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025," has bipartisan support and seeks to isolate Russia economically. Optimism surrounding the bill's potential to deter Russian aggression is tempered by the need for White House coordination and international cooperation. </p>

          <p>Magnus Carlsen, the world's top-ranked chess player, was defeated by current world champion Gukesh Dommaraju at the Norway Chess tournament, resulting in Carlsen slamming his fist on the table in frustration.

          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from gun rights advocates, allowing Maryland's ban on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines to remain in place. This decision upholds a ruling by the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which stated that the state can constitutionally prohibit the sale and possession of these weapons. Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas dissented, while Justice Kavanaugh expects the high court to formally weigh in on the legality of the AR-15 in the near future. Maryland has seen a decline in gun violence since enacting a series of laws aimed at curbing access to dangerous weapons. </p>
