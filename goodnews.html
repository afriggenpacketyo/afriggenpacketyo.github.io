          <p>Australia's economy experienced stagnant growth in the first quarter of the year, with a 1.3% year-on-year increase, failing to meet economists' expectations of 1.5%. This figure mirrors the previous quarter's growth rate and comes as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has been easing monetary policy. The RBA anticipates a gradual pickup in domestic GDP growth throughout 2025, driven by a recovery in consumption and strong public demand. However, the central bank acknowledges that weaker global demand and uncertainty could dampen this recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Duke Tanner, a former professional boxer who received clemency from President Trump in 2020 and a pardon in May 2025, shared his experiences and views on criminal justice reform. Tanner, who served 16 years in prison on drug trafficking charges, emphasized the importance of rehabilitation and faith during incarceration. He also commented on the possibility of Trump pardoning Sean "Diddy" Combs, stating that if Trump makes that decision, there's likely a valid reason behind it, suggesting potential mishandling of the law. Tanner advocates for clemency for others he believes deserve it, contrasting his case with Hunter Biden's pardon.</p>
