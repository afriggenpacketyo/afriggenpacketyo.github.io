          <h2>Singapore's Economy Grows in Q2, Averting Recession Amid Global Trade Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 23:56:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession thanks to strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. This growth was partly fueled by businesses front-loading exports ahead of a temporary tariff pause and a de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. Despite the positive figures, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year. The government has downgraded its full-year GDP forecast from 1-3% to 0-2%, reflecting ongoing volatility in international trade and the potential impact of U.S. tariff policies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers used their first two picks in the Major League Baseball draft to select a pair of teammates from the University of Arkansas. With the 40th and 41st overall picks, the team chose left-handed pitcher Zach Root and outfielder Charles Davalan. Root, a junior transfer, posted a 3.62 ERA with 126 strikeouts, while Davalan, a sophomore, hit .346 with 14 home runs and demonstrated excellent plate discipline. Both players were instrumental in leading the Razorbacks to the College World Series. The selections represent a strategic move by the Dodgers to bolster their future prospects with talent from a top-tier collegiate program.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 23:40:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is intensifying efforts to resolve a national shortage of air traffic controllers, aiming to hire 2,000 new personnel by the end of the year. The initiative, supported by a $12.5 billion infrastructure boost, utilizes advanced simulation technology at its Oklahoma City training facility to shorten certification times by several weeks. This push comes in response to staffing shortages that caused significant flight delays at major airports like Newark earlier this year. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the streamlined hiring process is helping the "best and the brightest" candidates begin their careers faster to enhance overall air travel safety and efficiency.</p>

          <h2>China's Exports Surpass Expectations in June as Imports Rebound</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's trade data for June revealed stronger-than-expected performance, with exports growing 5.8% year-over-year, beating analyst predictions. This surge is attributed to businesses rushing shipments to capitalize on a temporary tariff truce with the United States before a potential August deadline. In a significant development, imports rose by 1.1%, marking the first increase of the year and signaling a potential revival in sluggish domestic demand. The data reflects exporters' successful diversification into markets like Southeast Asia and the EU to offset declines in U.S.-bound trade, though the overall economic outlook remains tied to ongoing negotiations with Washington.

          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a symbol of resilience and women's rights in France, has been awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for her courageous public testimony against her ex-husband, who drugged her and invited dozens of other men to sexually assault her over a decade. Her insistence on a public trial, which resulted in the conviction of her ex-husband and 50 co-defendants, has been credited with sparking national debate and prompting legal reforms. Following the trial, the French Senate passed a bill to include a lack of consent in the country's criminal definition of rape, a landmark change she helped inspire.</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated that the central bank is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK's job market shows signs of slowing. In an interview, Bailey stated he believes the path for interest rates is downward, citing a sluggish economy and signs that businesses are reducing hours and offering smaller pay increases. This outlook follows the UK Chancellor's decision to raise employers' national insurance contributions. With interest rates currently at 4.25%, these comments suggest a potential shift in monetary policy to stimulate the economy, which contracted in both April and May of this year.

This shift from checklist tourism to experiential travel is a significant trend, with Gen Z travelers being more willing to splurge on unique experiences than previous generations. Ho also highlights the rise of "rainbow tourism," where travelers from a diverse range of developing nations are exploring destinations all over the world, changing the traditional west-to-east flow of tourism.</p>

This unbroken sequence of handwritten data, which began on July 14, 1795, is the longest of its kind in the UK and Ireland, providing an invaluable record of climate change. The tradition continues today with a human observer manually recording data, a practice now rare in an era of automated stations. The observatory's long history has contributed significantly to meteorology, including the development of the cup anemometer for measuring wind speed. The data clearly shows a warming climate, with current observer Shane Kelly noting that the distinct seasons of the past have blurred.</p>
