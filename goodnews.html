          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has become the leading candidate to be the next Fed Chair, according to prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket. His odds surged after reports that President Trump's advisers favor his policy approach, which is open to adjusting monetary policy based on forecasts. Waller, a Trump appointee, has recently expressed a more dovish stance, dissenting from the Fed's decision to hold rates and calling the approach "overly cautious." His rise surpasses previous front-runners Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, who have also advocated for lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. is becoming more crypto-friendly, with President Trump planning an executive order to broaden the availability of digital assets in retirement plans. This has fueled interest in cryptocurrency ETFs, like those for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which offer investors exposure without directly holding the assets. While some advisors advocate for significant crypto allocation in portfolios, others remain cautious about the inherent volatility and risks. The article distinguishes between standard crypto ETFs, suitable for long-term holds, and high-risk leveraged funds designed for short-term trading, advising investors to understand the difference.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global oil market is largely dismissing President Trump's threats to impose 100% tariffs on countries buying Russian energy, with many traders viewing it as a negotiation tactic. Trump gave Russia a deadline to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, threatening "secondary tariffs" on importers like India, China, and Turkey if Moscow fails to comply. However, after imposing a lower 25% tariff on India with a 21-day delay, oil prices fell, suggesting the market believes Trump will ultimately back down to avoid a significant spike in global energy prices that would undermine his domestic policy goals.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced a new $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, a move seen as strengthening its relationship with the Trump administration and mitigating tariff risks. The announcement, made alongside President Trump, has temporarily shifted Wall Street's focus away from the company's perceived lag in artificial intelligence strategy. As part of the investment, Apple will spend $2.5 billion to expand its partnership with Corning, which will now produce all glass for iPhones and Apple Watches domestically. This strategic move could also give Apple a competitive advantage over rivals like Samsung.</p>

          <p>President Trump's expansive tariff policies have created a "tricky" and volatile investment environment, according to market strategists. While many financial advisors recommend a long-term perspective, some suggest tactical moves can be made using tools like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to navigate the disruptions. Sectors less exposed to tariffs on physical goods, such as financials, utilities, and some technology, are seen as potential safe havens. Conversely, sectors like consumer discretionary, materials, and industrials are more vulnerable, but the article suggests opportunities exist for investors willing to look for them.

          <p>The U.S. Army has awarded the meritorious service medal to six soldiers for their heroic actions during a shooting at Fort Stewart, Georgia. The soldiers intervened when a fellow service member, Sgt. Quornelius Radford, allegedly opened fire with a personal handgun, wounding five people. According to army officials, one unarmed soldier tackled the gunman while another helped subdue him, and the other four immediately began rendering aid to the wounded. Three of the five injured soldiers have since been released from the hospital, with officials crediting the awardees' quick actions for saving lives.</p>

          <p>This essay posits that the decline of politeness, particularly in online interactions, is a significant cultural problem that harms individual well-being. The author argues that being rude or even witnessing rudeness can increase anger and depression, while practicing courtesy—even towards AI bots—can boost personal happiness. The piece suggests that individuals can counteract this negative trend by making politeness a conscious habit, renouncing sarcasm and snark, and responding to incivility with dignity. In an era of widespread rudeness, the author concludes that choosing politeness is a powerful and liberating act.</p>

          <p>A startup named Neurable has developed consumer headphones that use a brain-computer interface to monitor the user's focus and cognitive state. The technology employs EEG sensors to detect electrical signals from the brain, which are then interpreted by algorithms to measure attention levels and provide real-time feedback through an app. While the device does not read thoughts, it can identify when a user is distracted and suggest taking a break. The company is also exploring future applications for the technology, such as detecting early signs of depression or Alzheimer's disease by tracking brain health over time.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has launched the 2026-27 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) earlier than usual in a beta test, a move aimed at resolving bugs that have plagued past rollouts. The FAFSA is the primary application for federal student aid, including grants, loans, and work-study programs. Experts believe an earlier and longer testing window will allow for a smoother process when the application opens to all students in October. This early access could help more families secure financial aid, as some funding is distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

The ruling allows a lawsuit, filed by Oregon Humanities and the Federation of State Humanities Councils, to proceed. The grants, previously approved by Congress and distributed by the National Endowment for the Humanities, were abruptly terminated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The judge stated that the power of the purse belongs exclusively to Congress, not the President, in a significant victory for the plaintiffs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented new "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, with President Trump announcing that "billions of dollars" are now flowing into the country. The policy establishes a blanket 10% tariff rate for most countries, but significant exceptions and higher rates apply to others. For instance, Brazil and India face total tariffs of 50% due to specific U.S. objections, while Mexico and Canada are subject to pre-existing levies of 25% and 35%, respectively. Meanwhile, China is under a temporary truce with a 30% tariff rate, as some nations continue to negotiate for exemptions.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of three key financial tools for retirees: Social Security, annuities, and reverse mortgages. It explains that while Social Security provides a foundational income, it is rarely sufficient on its own. Annuities can offer a guaranteed lifetime income stream, acting like a personal pension, which is ideal for those worried about outliving their savings. Reverse mortgages allow house-rich, cash-poor seniors to tap into their home equity without selling. The article concludes that the best strategy often involves blending these options to create a resilient and flexible retirement plan. (not investment advice)</p>
