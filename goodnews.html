          <h2>White South Africans Granted U.S. Refugee Status Depart for America</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first group of white South Africans, known as Afrikaners, who were granted refugee status by the U.S. departed from Johannesburg on a U.S.-funded charter plane. This move follows President Trump's executive order to resettle Afrikaners, citing "government-sponsored race-based discrimination," a claim strongly denied by South Africa. The initiative contrasts sharply with the Trump administration's ban on most other refugees, and the processing of Afrikaners has been unusually fast. Relations between South Africa and the U.S. have deteriorated over various policy issues, leading to Washington's expulsion of Pretoria's ambassador earlier in the year, yet this resettlement is still occurring.</p>

          <p>Five individuals broke into a Cheviot Hills home, tied up the occupants, and kidnapped a man, later releasing him near a gas station in Glendale. The Los Angeles Police Department reported that the incident occurred around 1:30 a.m., with the assailants stealing an iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. The other victims in the house were tied up, and a pregnant woman suffered an anxiety attack and required medical attention. The abductors were last seen in a black pickup truck, and detectives are canvassing the neighborhood for leads.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to reform the UK's immigration system by implementing stricter English tests for all visa applicants and their adult dependents. Migrants will also be required to wait ten years before applying for settlement in the UK, instead of the current five. The new rules aim to ensure that immigrants commit to integration and language acquisition, but critics warn that the changes could split families. The article notes that the government's immigration white paper will lay out plans to reduce net migration and raise the threshold for Skilled Worker Visas to graduate level.</p>

BP's underperformance and strategy shifts have made it attractive to companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, and TotalEnergies. The article notes that BP has struggled to define its identity compared to U.S. oil giants like Exxon and Chevron, which have well-defined strategies for growing shareholder value. A takeover of BP might be difficult, the article states, but the speculation highlights the ongoing consolidation wave in the oil patch.</p>
