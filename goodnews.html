          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a significant 20% surge after the e-commerce giant reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst predictions for both earnings and revenue. The company issued an optimistic forecast for the third quarter, projecting revenue growth at a rate higher than Wall Street had anticipated. This strong performance and positive guidance indicate that Shopify is successfully navigating broader economic uncertainties, with its CFO stating that the anticipated negative impact from US tariffs "did not materialize." The growth was further evidenced by a 29% year-over-year increase in gross merchandise sales, reflecting continued strong consumer activity on the platform.</p>

          <p>In their opening match of The Hundred cricket tournament, the Southern Brave secured a decisive six-wicket victory over the Manchester Originals. The win was spearheaded by an impressive bowling performance from England's Lauren Bell, who took three wickets for 28 runs. The Originals' batting lineup struggled, managing to post only 95 runs, with Seren Smale being the lone standout performer with an undefeated 40. In response, Southern Brave, anchored by South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt's 42 not out, comfortably chased the target with 11 balls remaining, signaling a strong start to their season.</p>

          <h2>Comparing the Suitability of Annuities and CDs for Retirement Planning</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 12:51:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the roles of certificates of deposit (CDs) and annuities in retirement planning, concluding that neither is universally superior but each serves different needs. CDs offer simplicity, predictability, and FDIC-insured safety, making them ideal for short-term goals and preserving capital without risk. However, their returns often fail to outpace inflation, and they do not provide guaranteed lifetime income. Annuities are specifically designed to address longevity risk by converting a lump sum into a guaranteed income stream for life, though they are more complex, less liquid, and can have higher fees. The best choice depends on an individual's specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and need for lifetime income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple announced it will increase its investment in the United States by an additional $100 billion, a move made amid ongoing pressure from the Trump administration to onshore more of its manufacturing. The commitment, which includes a new "American Manufacturing Program," brings Apple's total planned US investment to $600 billion over four years. This development comes as President Trump continues to push for American production of Apple products like the iPhone, which are largely assembled in China. The announcement may help Apple navigate the administration's aggressive tariff policies, which have recently been expanded to include higher rates on goods from India, where Apple has been shifting some production.</p>

          <p>RVR, the Venice, California restaurant from acclaimed chef Travis Lett, is receiving high praise for its innovative, vegetable-focused take on Japanese izakaya cuisine. The restaurant is a reimagining of Lett's previous venture, MTN, in the same location, but with a warmer atmosphere and a refined culinary approach. Partnering with executive chef Ian Robinson, the kitchen excels at highlighting seasonal produce with creative preparations, such as layering Fuyu persimmons with daikon or grilling Costata Romanesco zucchini with a curry leaf aioli. While the menu also features well-executed dishes like duck meatball tsukune and various hand rolls, it is the plant-centered cooking that is drawing significant attention.</p>

          <p>Shares of Match Group, the parent company of Tinder and Hinge, jumped over 10% after it issued an upbeat financial forecast and indicated its new product initiatives are showing promise. The online dating company projected third-quarter revenues that beat analyst estimates, suggesting a potential turnaround after a period of slowing user engagement. Under new CEO Spencer Rascoff, Match has been implementing AI-powered features and new tools aimed at attracting younger users, particularly Gen Z. The company plans to reinvest $50 million in product development and expects its Hinge platform to return to year-over-year growth in 2025.</p>

          <p>A human foot found inside a hiking boot on the shore of Fishlake, Utah, has been identified as belonging to David White, a man who went missing 28 years ago. White disappeared in September 1997 after going fishing alone; his boat was later found empty. The breakthrough in the cold case came after investigators traced the manufacturing date of the boot and used DNA analysis to confirm the identity. DNA from the remains was matched to White's daughter with 99.9994% certainty, finally providing closure for the family and the original search and rescue members involved in the case.</p>

          <p>The candy manufacturer Mars has announced a partnership with biotechnology company Pairwise to use CRISPR gene-editing technology to develop more resilient and sustainable cocoa plants. The goal is to create cacao varieties that can better withstand the effects of climate change, such as disease and heat, which threaten the global chocolate supply. This collaboration gives Mars access to Pairwise's advanced genetic tools, allowing for faster and more precise development of desired crop traits compared to traditional breeding methods. The move reflects a growing trend of major food companies turning to biotechnology to protect their agricultural supply chains from environmental pressures.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is selling a portion of its holdings in the semiconductor and software company Broadcom, locking in a significant gain. The move is not based on a negative change in outlook for the company's AI-related business but rather a precautionary measure against potential profit-taking in the hot AI chip sector. The decision was influenced by the recent drop in AMD's stock despite a solid earnings report, suggesting market expectations are currently very high. This trim reduces the Trust's weighting in Broadcom and is described as a prudent step to avoid being "too greedy" after the stock's strong performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arizona Diamondbacks designated hitter Lourdes Gurriel Jr. has set a new MLB record by hitting a home run off a 103.9-mph fastball, the fastest pitch ever hit for a homer since tracking began in 2008. The two-run blast came against San Diego Padres reliever Mason Miller and traveled 439 feet, tying the game in the eighth inning. Although the Diamondbacks ultimately lost the game in extra innings, Gurriel's historic hit was a remarkable feat of batting. This was his second home run of the game and marked a significant moment in baseball analytics and player performance.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Nature reveals that trees harbor a rich and complex microbiome within their trunks, similar to the microbial communities found in the human body. Researchers found that an average tree contains approximately one trillion microbe cells, including distinct communities of fungi, bacteria, and viruses specialized for different parts of the wood. This discovery redefines trees as complex ecosystems rather than standalone organisms and suggests these internal microbes could play a crucial role in tree health, growth, and defense. The findings open new frontiers for forest science and understanding how forests might respond to challenges like climate change.</p>
