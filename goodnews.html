          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 06:24:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the previous quarter's 0.7% growth but still better than the 0.1% that had been forecast. According to the Office for National Statistics, the services and construction sectors were the primary drivers of this modest expansion. This resilience could make the Bank of England more hesitant to cut interest rates until inflation moves closer to its 2% target. However, economists express doubt that this pace can be maintained, citing the weak global economy and the potential for future tax increases to dampen consumer and business spending.

          <p>Aviva's chief executive, Amanda Blanc, has strongly reiterated the insurer's commitment to its net zero climate goals, despite increasing political resistance in both the U.S. and the UK. Blanc emphasized that addressing climate change is crucial for the company's insurance business, which is directly impacted by the rising frequency of extreme weather events like wildfires and floods. Her comments come as several major U.S. and UK banks have withdrawn from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. Aviva recently published a new transition plan, aiming to cut operational emissions by 90% by 2030, with its strong financial performance bolstering investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cottontail rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been spotted with grotesque, horn-like growths on their faces, causing alarm among residents. However, scientists have clarified that the animals are infected with the Shope papillomavirus, a relatively common and mostly harmless virus that causes wart-like tumors. The virus, which is not transmissible to humans or pets, is believed to be the inspiration for the mythical jackalope. While the growths can interfere with eating if they obstruct the mouth or eyes, a rabbit's immune system can typically fight off the virus, causing the growths to disappear over time.</p>

          <p>California's signature cap-and-trade program, which requires major polluters to buy allowances for their emissions, is facing a difficult battle for renewal before its 2030 expiration. While Governor Newsom wants to extend the program to 2045, critics argue it needs significant reforms to be effective. Environmental advocates and some lawmakers are concerned that the emissions cap is too weak and that too many free credits are given to polluters, allowing them to avoid making real reductions. Meanwhile, the oil and gas industry is pushing for changes to lower costs, warning that stricter rules could drive business out of the state.</p>

          <p>After a wildfire destroyed the Altadena home and studio of the late, acclaimed artist-activist John Outterbridge, his daughter Tami has launched a unique salvage project called 'Diggin' Bridge.' She has invited artists who were close to her father to help excavate the ruins, gathering materials like metal scraps and ceramic shards from the ashes. The goal is not only to recover remnants of her father's archive but also for the participating artists to create new works inspired by the found objects and Outterbridge's legacy. The collaborative effort has been a source of community and healing, turning a devastating loss into an act of creation.</p>

          <p>A new documentary series, 'Rebel Architects,' revisits the influential group of Los Angeles architects, including Frank Gehry and Thom Mayne, who defined a rebellious, norm-busting creative movement in 1980s Venice Beach. The series is centered around a reunion and re-staging of an iconic 1980 photograph that captured the group's brash spirit. Through candid conversations, the architects, now in their 70s and 80s, reflect on their early careers, the scrappy Venice art scene that fueled their work, and the evolution of their city. The film explores their legacy, rivalries, and the bittersweet loss of the creative freedom that defined that era.</p>

          <p>More than 160 workers at Blizzard Entertainment's Irvine campus, responsible for cinematics, animation, and other narrative content, have successfully voted to unionize. They will join the Communications Workers of America, becoming the latest group to organize within the growing labor movement in the video game industry. This wave of unionization has been driven by widespread concerns over job insecurity, frequent layoffs, and difficult working conditions. The union was recognized by parent company Microsoft, which has taken a neutral stance on organizing efforts, paving the way for thousands of its workers to unionize more easily.</p>

          <p>The FBI has returned a 500-year-old document signed by Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés to the government of Mexico. Penned in 1527, the manuscript page details payments for supplies for expeditions and is one of 15 pages believed to have been stolen from Mexico's national archives between 1985 and 1993. The FBI's art crime team located the document in the U.S. following a request from the Mexican government in 2024. While no one will be prosecuted due to the time elapsed and multiple changes of ownership, the FBI stated it is determined to locate the remaining missing pages.</p>

          <p>The market for memecoins has seen a significant resurgence, with its total value surging over 14% to nearly $82 billion in the past week. This rally is part of a broader bullish trend in digital assets, which has seen Bitcoin reach new record highs. Analysts attribute the renewed investor appetite for high-risk assets to easing geopolitical tensions and growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. While experts note that memecoins are purely speculative and extremely volatile, trading volumes for major tokens like Doge have been increasing significantly. (not investment advice)</p>
