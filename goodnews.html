          <p>A suspected gas explosion caused a partial collapse of a 20-story residential building in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx. The incident, which occurred at the NYCHA Mitchel Houses, resulted in the building's ventilation shaft falling away and sending debris onto the street below. Miraculously, officials reported no initial injuries or loss of life, though some apartments were evacuated as a precaution. Firefighters and emergency crews are investigating the cause and assessing the building's structural integrity while working to restore services to the complex.</p>

          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximate 8% increase in U.S. auto sales for the third quarter, largely propelled by record-breaking sales of electric vehicles. This surge in EV purchases was partly driven by consumers acting before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax incentive. GM's EV sales more than doubled, while Ford's increased by 30%, with the overall U.S. EV market share expected to hit a record 10% for the quarter. GM stated it remains the top automaker in U.S. sales, achieving its highest market share since 2015. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former U.S. Navy submariner is part of a team of 180 volunteers in Woodbridge, England, working to build a precise, seaworthy replica of the Sutton Hoo longship. This historic 7th-century Anglo-Saxon vessel was discovered nearly a century ago and is believed to be the burial ship of King Raedwald of East Anglia. The ambitious project aims for historical accuracy, using traditional tools and methods from the period, such as hand-carved oak planks and locally made iron nails. The team hopes to complete the 90-foot ship by 2027, reviving ancient shipbuilding techniques.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has restored internet and telecommunication services following a 48-hour nationwide blackout that drew widespread international condemnation. The shutdown disrupted businesses, flights, and access to emergency services, further isolating a population already facing severe restrictions, particularly women and girls. Residents in Kabul expressed relief as they reconnected with relatives, though the government has not provided an official reason for the outage. The UN had warned the blackout risked inflicting significant harm on the Afghan people amid a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <h2>All GP Practices in England Now Required to Offer Online Appointment Booking</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of today, every General Practitioner practice in England is mandated to offer patients the ability to book appointments online throughout the entire workday. This government initiative aims to end the daily "8am scramble" where patients compete for limited slots via phone calls. While the government has invested over £1 billion to support the transition, the British Medical Association has opposed the move, warning it could overwhelm practices with an "online triage tsunami" and potentially compromise patient safety. The change is part of a broader push to digitize the NHS.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Pfizer has agreed to offer some of its prescription drugs at significantly discounted prices for American consumers, including lower costs for Medicaid. President Trump announced the deal, which aligns with his 'most favored nation' executive order aimed at matching U.S. drug prices with those in other high-income countries. The discounted medications will be available on a new government-operated website called "TrumpRx." Pfizer's CEO stated the decision was motivated by the administration's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the United States.</p>

Berkshire already holds a significant 28.2% stake in Occidental Petroleum, an investment Buffett began increasing in 2022. The potential deal aligns with the energy sector expertise of Greg Abel, Buffett's designated successor as CEO. (not investment advice)</p>

The group's mission is to defend constitutional rights against what they describe as a new, coordinated government campaign to silence critics. In a public letter, the members draw parallels between the McCarthy era and the current political climate, asserting that forces of repression have returned.

The trend reflects a broader market shift, with research group Circana finding that adults are now the primary drivers of growth in the U.S. toy market.

This move would reduce its reliance on dominant semiconductor suppliers like Nvidia and AMD. While Microsoft currently uses chips from both companies, it has also been developing its own silicon, such as the Azure Maia AI Accelerator, to optimize performance for specific workloads. Scott emphasized that the goal is to control the entire system design, from chips to networking and cooling, to best meet the massive demand for AI computing capacity.</p>

          <p>A major Nigerian oil workers' union, PENGASSAN, has ended its two-day strike at the Dangote refinery, Africa's largest, following a meeting with government officials. The strike was initiated after the union accused the company of firing 800 unionized workers and replacing them with non-union foreign labor. Under the agreement, Dangote will begin the process of transferring the dismissed staff to other companies within the Dangote Group without any loss of pay. The company had previously denied the allegations, stating the dismissals were part of a staff reorganization.</p>
