          <p>In response to the deadly flash floods that have killed over 100 people in the Texas Hill Country, numerous charitable organizations are actively collecting donations to aid in recovery efforts. Groups like the Kerr County Flood Relief Fund, TEXSAR, and the Salvation Army are providing direct support for rescue operations, relief supplies, and assistance to affected families. Local churches and national organizations such as the American Red Cross are also involved, offering ways for the public to contribute financially and support first responders and displaced residents. These efforts are crucial as communities begin the long process of recovering from the widespread destruction.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A legislative amendment has been proposed in the UK to make at least ten Premier League football games, along with several key finals, available on free-to-air television each season. Tabled by the Liberal Democrats as part of the Football Governance Bill, the proposal aims to tear down the "paywall" that keeps top-flight matches behind expensive subscription services. Proponents argue this would give the Premier League back to the country, similar to a law in Spain that requires one free La Liga game per week. However, the government has expressed concerns that it could interfere with commercial broadcast deals that generate billions for the sport.</p>

          <p>As China navigates ongoing trade tensions, it is strategically focusing on developing Guizhou, historically one of its poorest provinces, as a key part of its national economic plan for 2026-2030. Provincial leaders are aligning with the national "strategic hinterland strategy" to leverage Guizhou's comparative advantages and bolster the nation's industrial and economic landscape. This initiative represents a significant shift, aiming to build resilience and new growth drivers from within the country's interior. The plan is designed to serve China's broader national strategy by transforming the region into an economic powerhouse. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Prohibit Use of NDAs in Workplace Misconduct and Discrimination Cases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 17:44:24 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to ban the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) for silencing victims of workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. This change, introduced as an amendment to the Employment Rights Bill, will render such confidentiality clauses void, aiming to end the practice of covering up inappropriate or criminal behavior. The move follows years of campaigning by activists like Zelda Perkins, a former assistant to Harvey Weinstein, and aligns the UK with other countries that have enacted similar protections. The legislation is expected to become law later this year, providing greater confidence to workers that misconduct will be addressed rather than concealed.</p>

          <p>The UK government will conduct another nationwide test of its emergency alert system, sending a message to all compatible smartphones at 3:00 PM BST on September 7. The system, designed to warn of imminent dangers like extreme weather or terror attacks, will cause phones to vibrate and emit a siren sound. This second test follows a 2023 trial that revealed technical issues, with some users not receiving the alert. The government aims to ensure the system's reliability and familiarize the public with it, while domestic abuse charities have reiterated concerns about the potential risk to victims with hidden phones.</p>

          <p>Spain's women's football team has established itself as the team to beat at Euro 2025, securing a spot in the knockout stage with two decisive victories and scoring 11 goals. As reigning world champions, their performance has underlined their status as tournament favorites, showcasing a dynamic and exceptionally talented squad. While their intricate, possession-based style is well-known, they have also demonstrated a more direct approach, adding versatility to their attack. Despite their dominance, both the coach and players believe there is still room for improvement, a frightening prospect for their future opponents in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Kelly Osbourne is engaged to Sid Wilson, the DJ for the band Slipknot, after he proposed backstage at her father Ozzy Osbourne's final concert. The proposal was a family affair, with Ozzy jokingly telling Wilson to "F— off" before he could ask, drawing laughter from the gathered family and friends. Wilson then proposed, and a visibly shocked Kelly accepted. The couple, who have known each other for over two decades, welcomed a son together in late 2022. Their relationship developed from a long-standing friendship that began when Slipknot toured with the Osbourne family's Ozzfest tour many years ago.</p>

          <p>Following his acquittal on sex trafficking and racketeering charges, Sean "Diddy" Combs received a standing ovation from fellow inmates, according to his lawyer, Marc Agnifilo. In an interview, Agnifilo detailed the defense strategy, which involved frankly admitting to Combs's domestic abuse and drug problems to differentiate them from the federal charges. This approach, combined with meticulous cross-examinations, successfully created doubt for the jury. Agnifilo stated that Combs, who remains incarcerated on lesser prostitution-related convictions, is committed to personal improvement and addressing his flaws, recognizing that fame and fortune cannot erase them.</p>

          <p>A collection of Bavarian palaces built by King Ludwig II, including the famous Neuschwanstein Castle, are among 32 global sites nominated for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The World Heritage Committee is currently meeting to decide on new additions, which also include ancient fortresses in India and prehistoric rock art in Russia. The article notes that while a UNESCO designation brings global recognition and can boost tourism, it also faces criticism for the potential negative impacts of mass tourism on local communities. The committee is also addressing growing threats to existing sites from conflict, climate change, and natural disasters.</p>

          <p>An experimental "cool block" project in Chelsea, Massachusetts, is testing solutions to combat the urban heat island effect, where dense development can make neighborhoods significantly hotter. The environmental group GreenRoots, in partnership with the city, has planted over 100 trees, resurfaced streets with lighter colors, and painted rooftops white to reflect heat rather than absorb it. This urban laboratory aims to provide a template for other cities as climate change intensifies heat waves. Researchers are working with residents to track heat exposure, demonstrating how targeted green infrastructure can effectively lower temperatures and improve living conditions in vulnerable urban areas.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to lift the foreign terrorist organization designation for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian rebel group whose leader now governs Syria. This decision follows HTS's successful offensive that overthrew the Assad regime and President Ahmed al-Sharaa's subsequent efforts to portray his government as moderate and inclusive. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited the new government's commitment to combat terrorism and its plan to disband HTS as reasons for the change. The move is a significant step in normalizing relations with Syria's new leadership, despite HTS's historical ties to al Qaeda.</p>
