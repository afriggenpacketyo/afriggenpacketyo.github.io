          <p>The Trump administration is launching a $10 million health study for residents of East Palestine, Ohio, following a toxic chemical spill from a train derailment. The five-year initiative will assess the long-term health effects of exposure to hazardous chemicals, including vinyl chloride and benzene residue, through epidemiological research and public health surveillance. Vice President Vance criticized the former Biden administration for allegedly neglecting the long-term health impacts on East Palestine residents. Residents had reported various health issues, such as headaches and respiratory illnesses, after the February 2023 spill, leading to a $600 million settlement from Norfolk Southern. </p>

Waymo expanded its service area in Los Angeles County and San Francisco, and Zoox plans to launch public ride-hailing services in Las Vegas and San Francisco this year.

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring 20 Democratic-led states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation grant funding. The judge granted an injunction, stating that the states were likely to succeed in their claims that the administration was unlawfully holding federal funds hostage. The lawsuit was filed by state attorneys general who argued that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress. The ruling comes amid Trump's efforts to cut funding to sanctuary jurisdictions that limit cooperation with ICE. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effective in reducing shoreline pollution, with local and state policies enacted from 2016 to 2023 reducing plastic bag waste by up to 47%. The study analyzed data from over 45,000 beach cleanups and found that full bans and fees were more effective than partial bans. California's efforts to curb plastic waste, including a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags, have shown mixed results due to loopholes allowing thicker plastic bags. The study also found a potential benefit in reducing harm to marine life in areas with bag policies. </p>
