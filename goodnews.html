          <h2>Study Reveals Ancient Roses Were Likely Yellow</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Chinese and Dutch researchers has found that the original roses were likely yellow, not red as commonly believed. The research involved an evolutionary genetic analysis of domesticated and wild rose samples. Roses, known as the 'queen of flowers,' are a symbol of love and beauty worldwide. The study indicated that the common ancestor of roses had single-petal flowers with a yellow color and seven leaflets, challenging the modern perception of roses.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming the third position. The United States remained the top ODA donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast with the sharp increases seen in previous years due to resumed development projects after the pandemic. Despite the drop, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool for promoting a 'free and open' Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey revealed that the lack of trash bins in public areas, including train stations, is a major frustration for visitors to Japan. Many tourists reported having to carry their trash back to their accommodations. The removal of public trash bins in Japan is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks. Despite the inconvenience, littering in tourist spots remains a concern. CEO of Forcetec Inc., Yohei Takemura, said popular tourist destinations like New York and Paris each have about 30,000 public trash bins.</p>
