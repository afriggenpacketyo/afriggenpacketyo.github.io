          <p>The United States has established a new trade agreement with Vietnam, replacing a potential 46% levy with a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports. As part of the deal, Vietnam will eliminate tariffs on U.S. products, granting American goods full market access. The agreement also includes a higher 40% tariff on goods that are "trans-shipped" through Vietnam from other countries, particularly China, a practice the administration has sought to curtail. This development comes as the Trump administration continues to renegotiate trade relationships with various global partners, aiming for what it terms "reciprocal" arrangements.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy that effectively banned migrants from seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president overstepped his authority by bypassing existing immigration law, stating that the proclamation did not grant the power for an "extra-statutory" system of removing individuals without an asylum opportunity. The ruling is a setback for the administration's hardline immigration agenda, though the judge has stayed the decision for two weeks to allow for an appeal. The ACLU, which brought the case, celebrated the decision as a protection for those fleeing danger.</p>

In a statement ahead of his 90th birthday, he said his successor should be identified through traditional Tibetan Buddhist practices, signaling that China should not interfere in the process. This decision is politically significant for Tibetans who resist Chinese control and is expected to anger Beijing, which claims sole authority to approve the next leader.

          <p>The UK Prime Minister has launched a new 10-year plan for the National Health Service in England, aiming to "fundamentally rewire" how care is delivered. The strategy involves shifting millions of patients from hospitals to a new network of around 200 neighborhood health hubs. These hubs will be staffed by a mix of healthcare professionals and offer services closer to home, with the goal of having the majority of outpatient care occur outside of hospitals by 2035. While the government says the plan will reduce waiting lists, healthcare unions have raised concerns about staffing and funding for the ambitious shift.</p>

The book, "Apple in China," contends the company made a "calamitous mistake" by consolidating its operations within an authoritarian state. However, some experts, like Harvard's Meg Rithmire, argue that Apple may not have had a realistic alternative. They suggest that to become the company it is today, Apple had to participate in the massive wave of innovation and production happening in China, making its deep integration a necessary, if risky, move.</p>

          <p>The historic Griffith Park Pool in Los Angeles, closed since 2020, will be demolished and replaced with a new $28-million aquatic facility. City officials abandoned plans to repair the 1927 pool after discovering a severe foundation crack that made it unable to hold water. The new project will feature two smaller, modern pools and a splash pad, along with a rehabilitated pool house, designed for year-round use. While residents have been frustrated by the long closure, the new plan is fully funded, with construction hoped to begin in 2026 and finish by early 2028.</p>
