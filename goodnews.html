          <p>Promising results from a North American trial indicate that the Galleri blood test can detect over 50 types of cancer, with more than half identified at an early, treatable stage. The test, developed by Grail, works by finding fragments of cancerous DNA in the blood, and correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of negative cases. While scientists call for more evidence, particularly from ongoing trials like the one involving 140,000 NHS patients in England, the data suggests a potential "fundamental change" in early cancer screening and diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Credo, a previously little-known semiconductor company, has seen its shares more than double this year, positioning itself as a crucial supplier in the trillion-dollar AI infrastructure expansion. Its signature purple active electrical cables (AECs), costing $300-$500 each, are vital for connecting the vast numbers of GPUs in AI data centers for major hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, and xAI. Analysts predict the AEC market will reach $4 billion by 2028, with Credo holding an 88% market share. The company is benefiting from the "insatiable demand" for high-bandwidth connections in AI clusters, offering more reliable alternatives to fiber optics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Northern Metropolis in Hong Kong should transcend its initial purpose as a tech and housing hub to become a significant zone of cultural emancipation. This article argues that in an era of advanced technological infrastructure within the Greater Bay Area, the focus should shift from mere connectivity to cultural influence and innovation. By prioritizing cultural development over property-led growth, Hong Kong can leverage the Metropolis to become a global cradle for cultural content, akin to the global reach of Hollywood, Japanese anime, or Korean K-pop.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 17:25:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk fell after President Trump announced his administration's goal to cut the cost of brand-name GLP-1 weight loss drugs, like Ozempic, to $150 per month. This proposed price is a fraction of their current list price, aligning U.S. costs with those in other developed nations. While Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz clarified that negotiations are ongoing, the president's initiative seeks to make these high-demand drugs more affordable for consumers and employers, potentially disrupting the existing market for both brand-name and compounded versions.

          <p>The Northampton Saints claimed the top position in the Prem rugby table after a comfortable 36-19 victory against the Newcastle Red Bulls, who remain winless this season. Despite playing a significant portion of the match a man down due to two sin-bins for JJ van der Mescht, Saints secured a five-try bonus point. Newcastle showed resilience, closing the gap twice when they had a man advantage, but ultimately couldn't capitalize. The defeat extends Newcastle's league victory drought, while Northampton continues an unbeaten run of three wins and a draw.</p>

          <p>Boeing has received FAA approval to increase its 737 Max jet production to 42 aircraft per month, a significant milestone almost two years after a near-catastrophic incident led to a production cap. The FAA conducted extensive reviews to ensure the increase is safe, following a January 2024 incident where a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines flight due to uninstalled bolts. This approval marks a softening in the FAA's stance and increased confidence in Boeing, which has been working to recover from prior crashes, supply chain issues, and aims for its highest delivery rate since 2018.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed plans for a call with Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng, signaling an easing of tensions between the two global powers.

          <p>President Trump expressed interest in a Kremlin proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait, connecting Russia and Alaska. Russian investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev suggested the $8 billion project, which would symbolize unity, could be completed in eight years. This idea emerged after a call between Putin and Trump to discuss Ukraine war resolutions, with a future Trump-Putin meeting anticipated. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, however, voiced unhappiness with the tunnel idea. Concerns exist about The Boring Company's lack of experience in such extreme conditions and its past regulatory issues.</p>

          <p>A collection of 17 iPad drawings by renowned artist David Hockney, titled "The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate," sold for £6.2 million at Sotheby's in London. Created in 2011 after Hockney relocated to Bridlington, the series captures the changing seasons in the Yorkshire Wolds. The sale significantly exceeded the collection's estimated value, marking an "exceptionally rare opportunity" for buyers during the Frieze art fair. Hockney, now 88, turned to his iPad for the project after finding traditional plein air painting difficult in winter, and the full series was later exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts.</p>

Del Taco, acquired in 2022 for $575 million, has recently struggled, leading to temporary closures. The sale is expected to close in January 2026, with proceeds used to pay down debt.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Instagram is introducing a new PG-13 content filtering system for all users under 18, automatically placing them in a more restrictive environment. This update expands limitations on graphic, sexual, and harmful content, as well as posts about risky stunts or strong language, aiming to provide a safer, age-appropriate experience. While Meta cites parent concerns as the driving force, experts question the simplistic "Gen X-nostalgia move" and its potential to stifle creative expression and context-sensitive discussions appropriate for older teens. The system also applies to AI chatbot features, further shaping the platform's future.</p>
