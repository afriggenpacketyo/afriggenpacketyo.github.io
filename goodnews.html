          <p>A Seattle man, Earl Henderson Riley IV, has been charged with multiple counts of residential burglary and one count of robbery for targeting the homes of professional athletes, including Blake Snell, Julio Rodriguez, Luis Castillo, and Richard Sherman. The King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office coordinated with six police jurisdictions during the investigation, which began in early 2025. The suspect is currently held on $1 million bail, and the investigation is ongoing, with the possibility of additional charges against other defendants. The defendant was previously released on Feb. 7 after pleading guilty to three robbery counts.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty triumphed over Journalism in the 157th Belmont Stakes at Saratoga Springs, New York, marking a repeat of the Derby's top two finishers. Sovereignty, ridden by jockey Junior Alvarado, won in muddy conditions, completing the 1 1/4-mile race in 2 minutes, 0.69 seconds. This victory makes Sovereignty the first horse to win the Derby, skip the Preakness Stakes, and then win the Belmont, with Journalism finishing second after winning the Preakness. The Belmont took place at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park, shortening the race to the same length as the Derby.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Belmont Stakes featured a rematch of the top three horses from the Kentucky Derby, with Sovereignty winning over Journalism and Baeza.

Journalism, the Preakness winner, was the morning-line favorite but finished second at the Belmont. The race was held at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park, resulting in a shorter 1 1/4-mile distance.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert, Susan Dominus, identifies five common traits among parents who raise highly successful children, based on interviews with numerous families and experts. These traits include fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to individual children, recognizing learning opportunities in everyday tasks, nurturing a genuine love for knowledge, and motivating children with love rather than being a coach. Dominus emphasizes that academic strengths alone are insufficient without a sense of possibility and that parents should support their children's growth with love and joy. She also notes the importance of fostering a love of learning and curiosity.</p>

          <p>Doctors in the UK are testing "poo pills" containing freeze-dried feces from healthy donors to combat dangerous superbug infections. These pills aim to replace harmful gut bacteria with a healthy mix, offering a new approach to tackling antibiotic resistance. Early data suggests that superbugs can be flushed out of the bowel using this method, potentially reducing the risk of infections. The trial has shown promising signals, indicating that donor bacteria may compete with superbugs for resources, ultimately reducing their presence in the body.</p>
