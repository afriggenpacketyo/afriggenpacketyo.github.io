          <p>Toyota is shifting its focus toward plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as a strategic move amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles. The company aims to increase PHEV sales to roughly 20% of its U.S. volume by 2030, aligning with California's emission standards. Toyota plans to enhance the EV-only range of its PHEVs and is evaluating where to integrate plug-in technology across its lineup, considering factors like production capacity and competitive advantages. This expansion demonstrates Toyota's commitment to offering diverse powertrain options and adapting to evolving market demands.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has granted the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to the Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which manages federal payments. This ruling allows four DOGE employees to access the system after the Trump administration established a training program to prevent improper disclosures. Democratic attorneys general initially sued to block DOGE's access, but the judge permitted access after appropriate training and restrictions were implemented. The ruling marks a win for the Trump administration, streamlining DOGE's access to critical financial data.
