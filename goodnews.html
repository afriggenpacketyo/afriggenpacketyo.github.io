          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 14:28:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve initiating an interest rate cut, the monthly payments on a $100,000 home equity loan have become marginally more affordable compared to earlier in the year. For example, a 15-year loan now costs around $973 per month, a slight decrease from previous rates. The article notes that while the savings are not drastic, further rate cuts are anticipated, which could make borrowing even cheaper in the future. Homeowners are also advised to consider Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which have variable rates that could drop further with future Fed actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration stop-work order, permitting the Danish company Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind farm project off the coast of New England. The project, which is 80% complete and set to power over 350,000 homes, was halted by the Interior Department in August. Orsted stated it will restart work as soon as possible, marking a significant development in the conflict between the administration's anti-offshore wind stance and the renewable energy industry. The judge's decision allows the nearly finished project to proceed toward completion.</p>

          <p>Bruce Pearl, the head coach of Auburn University's men's basketball team, is reportedly planning to retire before the 2025-26 season, with his son Steven Pearl expected to succeed him. This news fuels speculation that Pearl may be considering a political career, potentially running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Tommy Tuberville. Pearl has been an outspoken supporter of Israel and has previously commented on whether he could make a greater impact in politics versus coaching. He led the Tigers to two Final Four appearances during his successful tenure.</p>

          <p>Better Home & Finance Holding Co. saw its stock price more than double after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, known for his influence on Opendoor's stock, recommended it. Jackson's firm, EMJ Capital, has taken a position in the mortgage lender, which he dubbed "the Shopify of mortgages." He argued that the company, which leverages artificial intelligence, is undervalued compared to competitors like Figure Technology Solutions. Jackson suggested the stock could be a "potential 350-bagger in 2 years," sparking a massive, albeit volatile, surge in its share price. (not investment advice)</p>

The highest probability for isolated storms is on Tuesday and Wednesday, mainly north and east of L.A. County. Meteorologists are also monitoring Tropical Storm Narda, which is developing off the coast of Mexico and could bring more moisture to the area by early next week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To maintain a $100,000-a-year lifestyle in retirement, financial experts suggest a savings goal of approximately $1.1 million to $1.75 million, depending on Social Security benefits. This calculation is based on the general rule of needing 70-80% of pre-retirement income. Key factors influencing the required amount include retirement age, life expectancy, and inflation, which can double the cost of living over 25 years. Experts recommend using the "4% rule" as a starting guideline for withdrawals but stress the importance of a diversified portfolio and a flexible plan tailored with a financial advisor.

          <p>The monthly premiums for Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, in 2025 can vary significantly, ranging from as low as $32 for high-deductible plans to over $550 for comprehensive coverage. On average, most beneficiaries can expect to pay between $90 and $300 per month for popular mid-level plans like Part G or Part N. Costs are influenced by factors such as location, age, gender, tobacco use, and the specific plan chosen. To lower costs, experts advise enrolling when first eligible, comparing plans from multiple insurers, and considering options with higher cost-sharing if one is in good health.

Miran contended that current monetary policy is overly restrictive and risks harming employment, citing disinflationary pressures from tax, immigration, and deregulation policies. His view places him in dissent with the Federal Open Market Committee's more cautious approach, as he was the sole member to vote for a half-point cut at the last meeting. He believes the federal funds rate should be in the low-2% range, not its current 4%-4.25% target.</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging to a record high above $3,700 per ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. Gold tends to perform well during periods of low interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty, and central bank purchases have further supported demand. For most investors, financial experts recommend gaining exposure through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rather than buying physical bullion, due to lower costs and higher liquidity. Financial advisors generally suggest limiting gold to a small portion, typically under 3%, of a well-diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>
