          <h2>Barry Diller Reflects on Instinct Versus Data in Media Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 12:04:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, Barry Diller, a prominent figure in TV, film, and media, discusses the importance of instinct over relying solely on data when making creative and business decisions. He argues that instinct is a better predictor of success than research, which can be harmful and narrow-minded. Diller recounts his experience with the made-for-TV "Movie of the Week" at ABC, emphasizing the value of a good title and trusting one's gut feeling. He also highlights the success of projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," which were greenlit based on instinct rather than extensive data analysis.</p>

          <p>This Fox News article reports on the praise from free speech advocates for the Trump administration's condemnation of global censorship. Chris Elston, a Canadian free speech advocate, was fined in Australia for displaying a billboard with a slogan and had a tweet censored by the country's eSafety commission. The U.S. State Department criticized these actions, asserting the importance of protecting freedom of expression online and offline. Lois McLatchie Miller of Alliance Defending Freedom International emphasized the right to speak one's truth, highlighting Elston's case as an example of defending free speech.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly set to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet as a gift from the royal family of Qatar during his upcoming trip to the Middle East. The plan is for U.S. officials to convert the plane into a potential presidential aircraft. Trump intends to use the Qatari aircraft as a new version of Air Force One until shortly before he leaves office in January 2029, when ownership will be transferred to the foundation overseeing his presidential library. However, the aircraft would have more limited capabilities than the existing Air Force One planes, lacking features like air-to-air refueling.</p>

Gaffigan proposes "Father's Day Month" as an off-and-on holiday, where dads receive a present on even days and are left alone on odd days, creating a "Ramadad." While acknowledging the concept is new and might seem excessive, Gaffigan playfully argues that fathers deserve the extended recognition, while still honoring mothers with their dedicated day. The comedian‚Äôs piece is a lighthearted commentary on the societal focus on mothers and the desire for fathers to receive equal appreciation.</p>

          <p>Junior Alvarado, the jockey who rode Sovereignty to victory in the Kentucky Derby, has been fined $62,000 and suspended for two racing days due to overuse of his riding crop. Alvarado struck Sovereignty eight times during the race, exceeding the permitted limit of six strikes under Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority (HISA) regulations. This was Alvarado's second such offense in the last 180 days, resulting in a doubled fine and a two-day ban. Sovereignty will not compete in the upcoming Preakness Stakes.</p>
