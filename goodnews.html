        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 7-2 ruling, the Supreme Court extended an injunction barring the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act. The court found that the government did not provide adequate time or information for detainees to contest their removals, remanding the case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to determine the necessary due process. President Trump criticized the decision, while the ACLU praised the court for pausing the use of the Act, and the order only prevents removals under the Alien Enemies Act proclamation, allowing the government to pursue deportations under other lawful authorities.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service is questioning former F.B.I. Director James Comey about a social media post that Trump administration officials claimed was a call for Mr. Trump‚Äôs assassination. The post featured seashells forming the numbers ‚Äú86 47,‚Äù a phrase used by Mr. Trump‚Äôs critics. Administration officials like Kristi Noem and Tulsi Gabbard publicly commented on the post, with Gabbard suggesting Comey should be jailed. Critics argue that Trump officials are using the post to harass one of Trump‚Äôs perceived enemies, as Comey has long been a target of Mr. Trump‚Äôs ire since the F.B.I. investigated potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016.</p>

The justices criticized the fast-tracked and secretive nature of the deportation process initiated by the Trump administration in mid-April.

The research highlights the potential for saving lives and reducing economic costs by implementing these known prevention strategies, while also noting the elimination of the CDC's drowning prevention research team due to layoffs.</p>
