          <p>Hong Kong and Shanghai are set to sign an agreement at the Lujiazui Forum to deepen their financial ties, aiming to better manage geopolitical risks. The action plan will outline cooperation in multiple areas, with speculation that it will expand cross-border trading schemes and initiate trials for financial derivative products involving foreign currencies and commodities. This collaboration, marked as the most significant since the 2014 Stock Connect scheme, intends to bolster China's ability to withstand potential financial decoupling from the U.S., where some Chinese companies face possible delisting.</p>

          <p>The Leipzig Bach Festival features contemporary arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach's masterpieces, addressing themes of oppression and conflict. Reworkings of Bach's St. John Passion included the "Queer Passion," focusing on the suffering of LGBTQ+ individuals, and the "Arabian Passion," promoting peace in the Middle East. The festival's theme, "transformation," applies to music and reflects changes in the economy, digital world, and climate. The event also marked the 75th anniversary of the Leipzig Bach Archive, receiving the Kulukundis Collection of Bach's sons' writings, letters and autographs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The system would protect the entire United States. However, Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, argues that building a Golden Dome in the U.S. is significantly more complex than Israel's Iron Dome due to the size of the country and the types of missiles it would need to defend against.</p>

          <p>Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada is aiming for the club to win both the men's and women's league titles by 2028, marking the club's 150th anniversary. Berrada first outlined this goal, known as 'Project 150,' to staff in September 2024. Despite the men's team recently experiencing their worst domestic campaign since 1973-74 and the women's team needing to surpass Chelsea's unbeaten Treble winners, Berrada believes it's better to aim high. He emphasized the importance of setting targets to focus efforts and energy on achieving specific goals.</p>

          <p>China displayed a scale model of its J-35A fifth-generation fighter jet at the Paris Air Show, marking the first time the aircraft has been showcased overseas. The J-35A is the land-based variant of China's latest fifth-generation fighter jet, developed by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC). While the J-20 is prohibited from overseas export, it was also on display at the event. This move signals China's intent to boost export sales of its fighter aircraft, particularly in developing countries in the Middle East and South Asia.</p>

          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and northeastern Japan were suspended due to an inspection of an out-of-service train that halted between stations, according to JR East. Services were suspended between Tokyo and Sendai stations on the Tohoku shinkansen line. The out-of-service train, which debuted last spring, stopped between Utsunomiya and Nasushiobara stations, forcing two other trains to stop as well. Operations were expected to resume around 7 p.m.</p>

          <p>Chris Woakes' return to the England team is more important than ever before the first Test against India at Headingley. Woakes has played a pivotal role in past series, including the 2023 Ashes and Stuart Broad's send-off. At 36, he is the oldest player in the squad and his accuracy and movement are expected to challenge the Indian batting line-up. Woakes emphasizes being a senior bowler and supporting younger players, rather than focusing on being an 'attack leader'.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to reduce tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US, bringing into force parts of a tariff deal agreed between the two countries last month. The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports. Prime Minister Starmer called the move a "very important day" for both countries. The pact, initially agreed last month, is the first that the White House has announced since it imposed wide-ranging tariffs on various goods entering America earlier this year.</p>
