          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 18:31:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AppLovin's stock experienced a significant increase after the company announced better-than-expected earnings and revenue, along with the sale of its mobile gaming division to Tripledot Studios for $400 million in cash and a 20% ownership stake. The company's first-quarter net income rose substantially compared to the previous year, although it anticipates lower-than-expected sales for the second quarter. This strategic move allows AppLovin to focus on its core advertising technology business, while also gaining a stake in Tripledot Studios, which specializes in mobile games. The deal is expected to finalize in the second quarter of 2025.</p>

The decision to replace Dr. Nesheiwat, a former Fox News contributor, came amid concerns over her ideological alignment with Trump and questions about her resume, while her brother is an advisor to Kennedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia's stock value increased following reports that the Trump administration intends to rescind the "AI diffusion rule," which would effectively halt restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence chips. The Department of Commerce confirmed plans to replace the rule with a simpler one, aiming to foster American innovation and dominance in AI technology. Chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD have opposed the restrictions, with AMD's CEO emphasizing the need to balance national security concerns with industry growth. Nvidia's CEO has also expressed concerns that being locked out of the Chinese AI market would result in significant losses.</p>

          <p>Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for the North Carolina Supreme Court, conceded the race to Democratic Justice Allison Riggs after a judge rejected his legal challenges to the election results. Griffin stated he respects the court's holding and will not appeal the decision, which comes after a six-month effort to overturn the election. The ruling is a significant victory for Democrats in the key swing state, allowing Riggs to serve an eight-year term on the Republican-majority court and improving Democrats' chances of regaining the majority in 2028.</p>

          <p>The use of AI to deliver a victim's statement in an Arizona sentencing hearing has sparked ethical debates regarding the fidelity of AI representations to the victim's wishes. While some experts see it as a natural progression of technology in legal settings, others worry about the potential for misuse and the precedent it sets for future cases. The case involved an AI-generated version of a murder victim addressing his killer, raising questions about authenticity, consent, and the emotional impact on the legal process.</p>
