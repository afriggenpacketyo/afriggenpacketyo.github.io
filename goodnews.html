          <p>China has expressed concerns to the European Union regarding the proposed handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized the need for a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies. The European Commission's proposal includes a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less and a 50-cent fee for parcels sent to European warehouses, with the revenue intended to cover customs and safety checks.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. This price surge occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, which Bitcoin typically correlates with. Analysts suggest investors are seeking alternative stores of value amidst broader macro concerns, such as Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, bolstering Bitcoin's narrative as a hedge against fiat instability.

          <p>The Marks & Spencer website is back online after a cyber-attack left users unable to browse for several hours, following weeks of disrupted online orders. The retailer estimates the attack will impact this year's profits by around £300 million, with online services expected to be disrupted until July. Personal customer data, including telephone numbers, addresses, and dates of birth, may have been stolen, although payment details and passwords remain secure.

          <p>Shares of Xpeng, a Chinese electric-vehicle maker, are surging following upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. Analysts anticipate Xpeng will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter of this year, driven by robust sales and a pipeline of new models. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled from the previous year, and its gross margin improved. Analysts at UOB Kay Hian maintain a buy rating on the stock, projecting a significant upside from its current price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill to provide $1,000 to every American baby born over the next four years, deposited into what would be named a "Trump account." The funds would be invested in financial markets and could be withdrawn later for expenses like college or buying a house. Tax experts are puzzled by the accounts, as they function similarly to typical investment accounts without tax advantages. The bill's naming convention is a clear attempt to credit President Trump for the initiative.</p>
