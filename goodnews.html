          <p>The UK government is set to launch a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth by lowering energy costs for businesses. The plan includes exempting over 7,000 UK businesses from certain green energy levies, potentially slashing energy bills by up to 25%. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027, while energy-intensive firms will receive increased discounts on network charges. Other measures involve upskilling Britons, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and boosting research and development spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A university teaching assistant grapples with the ethical implications of widespread AI use in student writing, questioning the value of strict enforcement in a system students don't take seriously. The author suggests that the true value of humanities education lies in character development, not merely the production of academic work. She proposes integrating AI into the curriculum by allowing students to use it but requiring them to reflect on how it affects their thinking and learning. By adding friction back into the learning process, educators can help students cultivate practical wisdom, essential for navigating the complex choices presented by emerging technologies.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that a majority of California voters support expanding access to translated ballots for limited-English-proficient voters, which could potentially increase voter turnout. The survey, conducted in multiple languages, found strong support across various demographics, with Democrats and independent voters particularly in favor. While current laws mandate bilingual voting assistance for Spanish speakers, and some counties offer materials in other languages, many believe that official ballots should be available in voters' preferred languages. Legislation aimed at expanding translated ballot access has faced challenges, but advocates emphasize the importance of accessible voting materials in a state with a diverse electorate and complex ballot measures.</p>
