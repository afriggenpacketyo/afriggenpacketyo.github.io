        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cooper Flagg, the 18-year-old No. 1 NBA draft pick, made his debut for the Dallas Mavericks in the Las Vegas Summer League, showing flashes of his acclaimed two-way skillset despite a self-described poor shooting performance in his first game. He quickly rebounded with a 31-point performance in his second game, reinforcing the hype that has surrounded him since his high school career in Maine. Known for his relentless work ethic and focused demeanor, Flagg is often compared to NBA stars like Kevin Garnett and Jayson Tatum. Insiders praise his maturity and commitment, with one executive calling him the most complete 18-year-old prospect since LeBron James.</p>

          <p>A team of American archaeologists has discovered the 4th-century tomb of Te' K’ab Chaak, the earliest known ruler of the ancient Mayan city of Caracol in Belize. The tomb, the first confirmed royal burial found at the site, contained numerous "priceless" artifacts, including pottery, carved bone tubes, and a jadeite death mask. The discovery provides significant insight into the Mayan dynasty and its long-distance trade networks, with items found from as far as the Guatemalan Highlands and the Pacific Ocean. The excavation marks a major milestone for the archaeologists, who have been studying the Caracol site for over four decades.</p>

          <h2>Netflix Confirms First-Time Use of Generative AI for Visual Effects to Reduce Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:51:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has utilized generative artificial intelligence to create visual effects in one of its original series for the first time, according to co-CEO Ted Sarandos. The technology was employed in the Argentine sci-fi show "The Eternauts" to produce a scene of a building collapsing, a task completed ten times faster and at a significantly lower cost than with traditional methods. Sarandos highlighted that AI allows productions with smaller budgets to access advanced visual effects. The move comes as the entertainment industry continues to grapple with the controversial use of AI, a key issue in the 2023 Hollywood strikes over concerns about job displacement and copyright.</p>

          <p>Investment in private space startups surged to $3.1 billion in the second quarter of 2025, marking the second-largest quarter on record and a significant increase from the previous period. According to a report from Seraphim Space, this rally is fueled by sustained interest in defense applications and improved market sentiment. U.S. firms captured the majority of the funding, with year-to-date investment already surpassing the total for all of 2024. The sector is also seeing new public listings, with rocket maker Firefly Aerospace filing for an IPO, indicating continued strong momentum in the commercial space industry.

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop High-Speed Infrared Technology Inspired by Fire Beetles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new infrared sensing technology inspired by the heat-seeking abilities of the fire beetle. This technology is reportedly capable of detection speeds 20,000 times faster than conventional methods, which could have significant applications in military and industrial fields where clear imaging is needed in obscured conditions like smoke or fog. The fire beetle possesses a unique organ that allows it to detect faint infrared radiation from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away. This biological marvel, which the beetle uses to find suitable environments for its larvae to hatch, has provided a blueprint for creating more advanced optoelectronic devices.</p>

          <p>Despite being engaged in multi-front wars for 22 months, Israel's stock market has outperformed all Middle East counterparts, reaching a record high. After an initial 23% drop following the October 2023 Hamas attack, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) has rebounded, gaining over 200% from its low and attracting significant foreign investment. This economic buoyancy is attributed to investor confidence in Israel's security capabilities, the dynamism of its powerful tech sector, and a surge in new trading accounts. The country's GDP has also shown resilience, with modest growth expected to accelerate in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and letting go of the childhood notion that adults have everything figured out. Instead, he embraces the lesson that most people are continually "winging it" through a life that is always a process of becoming. Using the French TV show "Bref" as a cultural bookend to his own adulthood as an immigrant in France, he explores themes of regret, identity, and the value of chosen family. The author concludes that while he doesn't have all the answers, he has learned to be more at ease with life's uncertainties and to appreciate the unexpected moments that shape his story.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by building and successfully operating his own 7-metre submarine. The inventor, identified only as Zhang, said he had been fascinated by machines since childhood and was inspired to build a submersible after seeing one on a television program in 2014. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his own money, he purchased steel plates and an engine, and began constructing the vessel in secret. His creation, which he has been seen piloting on a local river, represents the fulfillment of a lifelong dream to build something beyond the means of his rural life.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a man recounts his harrowing journey with Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD), a rare cancer that began as a persistent itch in his groin. Initially dismissed as a simple fungal infection, his condition went undiagnosed for over a year and a half until he insisted on a biopsy, which revealed the invasive cancer. The author details his multiple painful surgeries, the challenges of navigating a fragmented healthcare system, and the profound isolation of battling a little-known disease. His experience prompted him to create an online resource and support group, transforming his personal struggle into a global advocacy effort to raise awareness for EMPD.</p>
