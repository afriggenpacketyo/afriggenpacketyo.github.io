          <p>Following the conclusion of the Trump-Putin summit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced he will travel to Washington D.C. on Monday for a meeting with President Trump. The announcement came after a lengthy phone conversation between the two leaders, which also included European allies. Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the invitation and stated his intention to discuss the details of ending the war. This development shifts the diplomatic focus to direct U.S.-Ukraine discussions after the talks with Russia failed to produce a concrete peace agreement.</p>

          <p>An executive order signed by President Trump is set to facilitate the inclusion of "alternative assets," such as cryptocurrency, real estate, and private equity, into 401(k) retirement plans. This move aims to democratize access to investment classes previously reserved for wealthy individuals and large institutions. However, financial experts caution against the potential risks, including the high fees and long lock-in periods associated with private equity and the significant volatility of cryptocurrency. The order directs the Department of Labor and other agencies to clear regulatory hurdles, though employers will ultimately decide which funds to offer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global music superstar Bad Bunny's 30-concert residency in San Juan has become a significant cultural event, drawing thousands of Puerto Ricans back to the island from the diaspora. Titled "I Don't Want To Leave Here," the shows address the painful economic and social issues that have compelled many to leave, fostering a sense of communal catharsis and pride. The concerts have served as a powerful reunion for families and friends, reinforcing a shared cultural identity for those both on and off the island. Many attendees have expressed a renewed determination to find ways to return to Puerto Rico permanently.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors have become the predominant participants in Greece's "golden visa" program, which offers residency in exchange for real estate investment. As of June 2025, Chinese citizens accounted for nearly half of all first-time permit holders and over 60% of those who have renewed their visas, having purchased thousands of apartments primarily in Athens. This influx of investment has quietly transformed parts of the Greek capital, reflecting a significant trend of Chinese capital seeking opportunities and residency within the European Union. The program's popularity among Chinese nationals highlights its role as a key pathway for accessing Europe.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed a crucial engine test for its Long March-10 rocket, a major milestone in its plan to land astronauts on the moon by 2030. The test confirmed that the rocket's 21 YF-100K engines can operate in sync, providing the necessary thrust for the superheavy launcher. The Long March-10 is designed to deliver a 27-tonne payload to a trans-lunar orbit. China's lunar landing strategy involves two separate launches of this rocket: one carrying the crewed Mengzhou spacecraft and another carrying the Lanyue lander, which will then meet in lunar orbit.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, English football legend Wayne Rooney discussed his journey from a young player to his current role as a pundit for the BBC's Match of the Day. He recalled a pivotal moment at age 14 when a youth coach warned him against derailing his talent, which set him on a path of focus. Rooney also spoke about his challenging forays into management, the importance of family, and his conscious effort to educate himself on diverse topics to better connect with teammates. He aims to be a fair and honest pundit, acknowledging that his on-field self probably wouldn't have liked his critical commentary.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 3-2 victory against the San Diego Padres, allowing them to move back into a tie for first place in the National League West. The win came at a critical time, as the team had been in a slump and had just placed key player Max Muncy on the injured list. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered a strong performance over six innings, and the bullpen successfully protected a narrow lead, a welcome change after several recent collapses. An opposite-field home run by Teoscar Hernández in the seventh inning provided the decisive run in the tightly contested game.</p>
