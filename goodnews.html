          <p>Donald Trump Jr. has significantly increased his presence in Washington, D.C., becoming a prominent figure in the MAGA movement. Since his father's election, he has joined several corporate boards and advisory committees, leveraging his family name for business ventures. He co-founded an exclusive private club called "Executive Branch" with a hefty membership fee, raising concerns about potential pay-to-play culture. Trump Jr. defends his activities, stating he is a private citizen and businessman providing for his family. Critics argue that he is cashing in on his father's presidency, while allies claim his high membership fees deter influence peddling.</p>

The variable nature of HELOC interest rates means they can adjust based on market conditions, potentially benefiting borrowers if rates decline later in the year.
