          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:02:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a change that would require SEC approval. He argued the shift would save money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits, a sentiment previously echoed by figures like Warren Buffett. Supporters of the current quarterly system maintain that it provides essential transparency and timely information for investors. The proposal aligns U.S. practices more closely with those in the U.K. and European Union, though critics argue it would reduce valuable market insight. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price saw a significant jump after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his first open-market purchase of the company's shares since 2020. Musk acquired approximately 2.57 million shares for about $1 billion, a move widely interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer. This is reportedly his largest-ever purchase by value and comes as Tesla seeks to pivot towards artificial intelligence and robotics. The purchase also follows a period where the stock has been affected by slumping sales and concerns over Musk's political activities impacting the brand. (not investment advice)</p>

Other top contenders mentioned include reigning champions Paris St-Germain and perennial favorites Real Madrid. Some analysts also see potential for a strong run from Barcelona, led by young star Lamine Yamal, or a surprise performance from Italian champions Napoli, now featuring Kevin de Bruyne.</p>

          <h2>Experts Suggest Investing in Gold Despite Near-Record High Prices</h2>

          <p>Despite gold prices reaching near-record highs of over $3,600 per ounce, financial experts suggest it remains a worthwhile investment. They argue that the precious metal still has significant growth potential, particularly with an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut that could make it more attractive relative to dollar-based assets. Gold also serves as a hedge against a depreciating U.S. dollar and acts as a low-risk portfolio diversifier during times of economic uncertainty. Various accessible options like fractional gold, ETFs, and mutual funds make it easier for investors to enter the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, joining Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged over 4% on Monday, driven in part by a recent antitrust ruling that imposed lighter penalties than investors had feared. Despite facing increased competition from AI challengers and regulatory pressure in the U.S. and Europe, Alphabet's shares have risen more than 30% this year. This milestone arrives approximately 20 years after Google's initial public offering and over a decade after the formation of the Alphabet holding company. (not investment advice)</p>

Instead, the article suggests asking more engaging questions that prompt excitement, such as "What's the highlight of your week so far?" or inquiring about fun weekend plans. To build trust, it's recommended to encourage others to share positive stories and to respond to standard greetings with humor or whimsy. The expert also emphasizes the importance of open body language, like uncrossed arms, to signal trustworthiness and create a welcoming atmosphere.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve rate cut expected this month, mortgage experts are advising prospective homebuyers on how to strategically approach the changing market. Key recommendations include getting a freshly updated pre-approval to reflect increased buying power and promptly comparing offers from various lenders to secure the best terms before locking in a rate. Experts caution against assuming one's current lender will offer the best deal or trying to time the market by waiting for further rate drops. They also stress the importance of not overextending one's budget, even if qualifying for a larger loan, to maintain long-term financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced their highest weekly inflows since mid-July, pulling in approximately $2.3 billion. The sustained demand across five trading sessions was led by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund. This surge in investment aligns with growing expectations of an interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve and has coincided with Bitcoin's price recovering above $115,000. Analysts suggest this indicates a clear demand impulse and growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as a long-term asset class within standard investment portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The watermelon has emerged as a prominent symbol of Palestinian solidarity, largely due to its colors—red, green, black, and white—which mirror the Palestinian flag. Its use as a protest symbol dates back to the 1980s, when Israel banned the public display of the Palestinian flag in occupied territories. Artists and activists adopted the fruit as a subtle way to represent national identity. In the modern era, the watermelon emoji is widely used on social media to bypass censorship and express support for the Palestinian cause, connecting a new generation to a long history of cultural resistance.</p>

          <p>While AI tools are increasingly popular for job applications, career experts caution against over-reliance on them, which could harm a candidate's chances. A major pitfall is AI's tendency to "hallucinate" or fabricate information when asked to tailor a resume to a job description for which the candidate isn't a perfect match. Recruiters also note that AI-generated applications often lack authenticity and share a uniform structure, making them less impactful than those written in a candidate's own voice. Experts recommend using AI to polish a self-written draft rather than for initial generation, and always proofreading for errors.</p>

Hall, backed by several prominent local leaders, argues that Mejia has focused more on "social media theatrics" than on the core duties of the office. This sets up a contest between an establishment Democrat and Mejia, a young leftist who won the office in 2022 as a political outsider. The race will test whether voters' appetite for anti-establishment candidates remains strong in the city's 2026 election.</p>
