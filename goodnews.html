          <h2>Chinese Scientists Identify Compound Produced During Exercise That May Slow Aging</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, as a key factor in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine functions as a messenger that prevents inflammation and organ aging by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This discovery helps explain the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The findings could also lead to new anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of exercise, offering new avenues for promoting longevity and health.</p>

          <p>China's booming coffee culture, once concentrated in cities, is now spreading to rural areas, with a surge in new cafes catering to locals and tourists. This expansion is part of a larger trend that has seen China's net coffee imports grow over 6.5 times between 2020 and 2024, creating a $42 billion industry. However, some observers question the sustainability of this rural cafe craze, noting that many shops rely on unique, picturesque settings to attract social media-savvy customers for one-time visits. This influencer-driven model may struggle for long-term viability once the initial novelty fades for consumers.</p>

          <p>A key survey from the Bank of Japan indicates a marginal improvement in business confidence among Japan's large manufacturers. The Tankan survey's headline index for big manufacturers rose to +13 in June, a slight increase from the +12 reading in the previous quarter. This data point offers a snapshot of the current sentiment within one of the most crucial sectors of the Japanese economy. The modest uptick suggests a degree of resilience and cautious optimism among major industrial firms, though it also reflects a slow and gradual recovery environment amid global economic uncertainties.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made moves in NBA free agency, agreeing to a two-year, $12 million deal with forward Jake LaRavia. This signing came shortly after the team lost a key role player, Dorian Finney-Smith, who agreed to a four-year, $53 million contract with the Houston Rockets. Finney-Smith had opted out of his contract with the Lakers to become a free agent. The 6-foot-7 LaRavia provides wing depth, having averaged 6.9 points and shooting 42.3% from three-point range last season while playing for Memphis and Sacramento, as the Lakers work to reshape their roster.</p>

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated that the system has not been seriously examined for decades and needs modernization to better suit the needs of families and businesses. Campaign groups have praised the review, calling it a generational opportunity to fix a system they describe as one of the worst in the developed world. Key issues include low take-up of shared parental leave and statutory paternity pay that is too low for many fathers to afford.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has requested that the Trump administration return 200 soldiers to California's state command. The troops were federalized to respond to immigration-related protests, but with unrest decreasing and fire season intensifying, there is a critical need for them to resume firefighting duties. Governor Gavin Newsom has been a vocal critic of the federalization, calling it illegal and highlighting that the state's specialized firefighting Guard unit is severely understaffed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that a new wave of younger investors is driving market trends by favoring companies with bold, innovative ideas over established firms that prioritize stock buybacks. He argues that this demographic sees buybacks as a sign a company has run out of ideas, instead rewarding firms like Robinhood and Reddit for their potentially transformative business models. According to Cramer, this has created an "idea market" where individual company stories and growth potential are more influential than macroeconomic factors like Federal Reserve policy. This shift in investor behavior could be reshaping market valuations and rewarding disruptive companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Energy bills for millions of households in England, Scotland, and Wales are set to decrease by about 7% starting in July, according to the latest price cap from regulator Ofgem. This provides some immediate relief, equating to a drop of around ¬£11 per month for a typical household. However, analysts warn that prices are unlikely to fall much further and remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, raising concerns about affordability during the upcoming winter. With future wholesale prices subject to global uncertainty, consumers are being encouraged to explore fixed-rate deals that could offer more stability.</p>

The Privy Council, the final court of appeal, rejected a challenge that argued the island's governor overstepped his authority by enacting the law after local lawmakers had voted it down. The law was originally introduced to comply with a court ruling that same-sex couples were entitled to legal protections equivalent to marriage.

          <p>The Writers Guild of America West has removed film producer Randall Emmett from its "strike list," allowing guild members to work with him again. The decision came after Emmett paid $630,000 to resolve a long-standing judgment over unpaid compensation and benefits owed to four writers from a collapsed 2019 television project. Emmett stated that while the debt was tied to a former company, he chose to pay it personally because it was the right thing to do.
