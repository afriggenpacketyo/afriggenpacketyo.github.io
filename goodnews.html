          <h2>Mortgage Demand Experiences Unexpected Surge Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 09:53:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing economic uncertainty and only a slight decrease in mortgage interest rates, weekly mortgage demand has surprisingly surged by 11%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The increase is primarily driven by conventional loans, suggesting that borrowers with larger loan sizes and those looking to upgrade their homes are more willing to take on mortgages. The April housing market had been slow due to potential buyers' concerns about tariffs and stock market volatility, but real estate agents still report strong demand. Applications to refinance a home loan also rose by 11%, driven by Veterans Affairs loans, and the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting could further influence mortgage rates (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card interest rates remaining high, experts are weighing the potential benefits and drawbacks of credit card debt forgiveness for seniors. Debt forgiveness may be a smart option for seniors with high medical expenses, limited income, or no significant assets, especially if repaying debt would mean sacrificing basic needs. However, it may not be suitable for seniors with substantial assets or those who plan to use credit in the future, as it can damage credit scores and trigger tax consequences. Seniors are advised to explore alternative debt reduction strategies and to be wary of predatory actors in the debt relief industry (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere soon, posing a minimal risk to the planet. Experts predict the failed Venus-bound spacecraft, weighing about half a ton, could reenter around May 10, potentially landing anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south. While the chance of the spacecraft hitting someone is small, experts note that the object was built to withstand Venus's atmosphere, meaning that it might not burn up completely during reentry. This event raises concerns about the increasing risks of space debris impacting Earth.</p>

          <p>Uber reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations, but revenue fell short of anticipated growth, causing the company's shares to drop.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, saving money can be a challenge, but a certificate of deposit (CD) can help by offering higher returns. CDs allow you to lock in high rates for the term and are generally FDIC or NCUA insured up to $250,000, making them safe investments. Short-term CDs often offer the best rates, and online banks typically provide more competitive rates than traditional brick-and-mortar banks. Strategies like CD laddering can help you take advantage of high rates while saving for the long-term (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the prehistoric Chav√≠n people in the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals, which may have contributed to the establishment of social and political hierarchies. Researchers found traces of hallucinogenic substances, including DMT, on artifacts at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. These substances were likely consumed via "snuff tubes" during private gatherings reserved for elite figures, suggesting that access to altered states of consciousness played a vital role in creating early class structures. This study provides material evidence that hallucinogens were a focal point of formalized and tightly-controlled rituals.</p>
