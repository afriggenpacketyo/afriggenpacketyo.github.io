        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a spokesperson, former President Joe Biden's last prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test, a common screening method for prostate cancer, was conducted in 2014, which is consistent with medical recommendations for men over 70. Current guidelines suggest that men aged 55 to 69 should discuss the pros and cons of PSA testing with their doctors, while those 70 and older are generally advised against it due to the risk of false positives. The article notes that medical experts emphasize that PSA screenings are not foolproof and can produce false positives or negatives, sparking debate about their appropriate use. Biden's representatives revealed that doctors discovered a small nodule in his prostate during a routine physical last week.</p>
