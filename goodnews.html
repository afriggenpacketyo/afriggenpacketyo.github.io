          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will lift billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on most U.S. goods, effective September 1st. This decision, made after a recent discussion with President Donald Trump, aims to restore free trade for a significant portion of cross-border commerce, particularly for goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement (USMCA). However, Canada will maintain its 25% tariffs on U.S. autos, steel, and aluminum, indicating that negotiations in these strategic sectors are still ongoing. The White House welcomed the move as "long overdue," signaling a cautious step toward de-escalation in trade tensions between the two North American partners.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack voiced significant skepticism about lowering interest rates, emphasizing the persistent threat of inflation. Despite market anticipation for cuts following Chair Jerome Powell's recent comments, Hammack stressed that inflation has remained above target for four years, necessitating a "modestly restrictive stance" to bring it under control. She noted her belief that the "neutral" interest rate, which neither boosts nor restricts activity, is higher than most other Fed officials, making her wary of any accommodative policy that could reignite inflationary pressures. Hammack, though not a voting member this year, underscores a cautious viewpoint within the Fed regarding monetary policy adjustments, highlighting internal divisions on the path forward.

          <p>The UK government has agreed to an out-of-court settlement to compensate over 7,700 Kenyans affected by a fire caused during a British military training exercise in the Lolldaiga conservancy four years ago. Claimants had sought redress for property loss and health complications attributed to smoke inhalation and stampeding animals. A British High Commission spokesperson called the fire "extremely regrettable," with the lawyer for the claimants stating the settlement was £2.9 million, despite clients' complaints about the sums being too small. This resolution follows a lengthy legal battle and addresses environmental damage, while British military exercises continue in the area, amidst historical land disputes and past controversies regarding soldier conduct.</p>

          <p>Millions of American retirees rely on Social Security benefits, with the average monthly payment just under $2,000, but many are unaware that their benefits are not fixed and can be reduced by several factors. This article highlights three main ways checks can shrink: the earnings test for those working before their full retirement age, automatic deductions for Medicare Part B premiums (which can increase significantly for high-income earners through Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts), and federal income taxes on benefits if combined income exceeds certain thresholds. Understanding these potential pitfalls is crucial for retirement planning, as reductions can amount to hundreds of dollars monthly, impacting essential expenses. The article also suggests options like reverse mortgages or part-time work to supplement income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are navigating the impact of President Trump's increased tariffs, implementing creative strategies to avoid widespread price hikes for consumers. While tariff costs are rising, companies have largely absorbed them, diversified sourcing, or pushed back on vendors, leading to a less severe financial pinch than initially feared in the spring. Walmart, for instance, has selectively raised prices but also expanded discounts, recognizing consumer sensitivity, particularly among lower-income households. Despite these challenges, overall consumer spending remains steady, with some brands even raising sales outlooks, highlighting the retail sector's ongoing efforts to mitigate tariff effects while maintaining demand.

While acknowledging potential job cuts, he aligns with experts who predict AI will create millions of new roles and boost productivity across various fields. However, some critics note that 95% of generative AI implementations have yet to boost revenue in the short term, suggesting significant challenges in effectively integrating the technology into existing workflows for measurable business impact.</p>

Navigating the city's "overtourism," Groff found profound connections not in historical relics, but through sensory experiences like eating a 7-Eleven sandwich or taking a hot bath. Her journey, detailed in this article, reveals how these experiential moments and observations of Japan's Shinto traditions provided a deeper understanding of Murasaki's writing style and the embrace of ambiguity. This quest mirrors the spiritual themes prevalent in Groff's own fiction, emphasizing a deeper, more empathetic connection with history and nature, diverging from typical tourist consumption.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish speech at Jackson Hole significantly boosted market confidence, particularly for cyclical stocks, by signaling likely interest rate cuts. Powell indicated that with policy in "restrictive territory" and rising downside risks to employment, adjusting the policy stance may be warranted. He also suggested that tariff-driven inflation might be a temporary, "one-time hit" rather than an embedded inflationary spiral, despite acknowledging visible effects. This led to a jump in odds for multiple rate cuts this year, causing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to hit new highs and sectors like consumer discretionary, real estate, and industrials to rally strongly, reflecting investor focus on companies poised for earnings estimate revisions.

This article details how much a $10,000 deposit can earn across various common terms, from 3 months to 5 years, assuming no early withdrawal penalties or fees. For example, a 1-year CD at 4.30% APY would yield about $430, while a 5-year CD at 4.20% APY could earn approximately $2,100, leveraging the effect of compounding. CDs provide predictability and FDIC insurance up to $250,000, making them an appealing choice for savers looking to lock in competitive rates before potential future declines in interest rates.

          <p>Over 2,000-year-old artifacts, including ancient statues, Roman coins, and a merchant ship, have been recovered from a sunken city in Abu Qir Bay off Egypt's coast.

Notable finds include limestone structures that may have served as places of worship, residential spaces, and statues of royal figures, including a partially preserved sphinx of Ramses II.

However, the momentum is expected to stall significantly through August, September, and October, with box office analysts predicting a "bereft" period until late November.
