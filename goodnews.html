          <p>New York Yankees star Aaron Judge has hit his 350th career home run, achieving the milestone in just 1,088 games. This makes him the fastest player in MLB history to reach this mark, surpassing the previous record holder, Mark McGwire. Despite the personal achievement, Judge expressed that a team victory would have made the moment better. The two-time AL MVP continues to have a dominant season, leading the major leagues in batting average, home runs, and RBIs.</p>

          <p>The Levitt Pavilion Los Angeles has confirmed its free summer concert series in MacArthur Park will proceed despite recent immigration enforcement raids in the area. Organizers canceled one performance but have since resumed the schedule, stating the importance of providing a space for community and culture during uncertain times. To address safety concerns among community members who may be afraid to attend, the organization will hire private security and livestream the performances. This decision highlights the tension between continuing cultural events and the fear generated by federal immigration operations in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is strategically focusing on developing "future industries" to create a new economic growth model based on technological innovation. First mentioned by President Xi Jinping in 2020, this initiative targets emerging sectors with high potential, such as humanoid robots, 6G networks, and brain-computer interfaces. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released guidelines to steer development in these areas. This long-term strategy aims to secure China's position as a global leader in cutting-edge technology and reduce its reliance on foreign innovations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several start-ups, including UK-based Better Dairy, are developing lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to produce casein, the key protein in milk, without using animals. These companies aim to launch their products within the next few years, targeting consumers looking for alternatives that more closely mimic the taste and texture of traditional dairy cheese. However, they face significant hurdles, including high production costs, regulatory approval, and a recent decline in plant-based cheese sales. The success of this novel food will depend on overcoming consumer concerns about price, taste, and the perception of it being an ultra-processed food.</p>

          <p>Jess Basey-Fisher, a 53-year-old from Norfolk, has been reunited with her older brother, Alistair Dalgliesh, after discovering his existence six years ago. Her mother had kept his adoption a secret her entire life, revealing it to her husband just before she died. After a determined search, Jess located Alistair in Australia, and the two connected deeply over FaceTime. Tragically, a month after they first spoke, Alistair was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, prompting Jess to travel to Australia to spend precious time with him and his family, creating memories in the short time they have together.</p>

          <p>The reality TV show "Love Island" is experiencing a resurgence in viewership, with its growth being significantly driven by social media, particularly TikTok. While television ratings are improving, the show's official social media accounts have gained millions of followers, with short-form clips, recaps, and fan commentary reaching a massive audience. This shift in consumption habits allows viewers to stay engaged with the show's drama without committing to watching the full hour-long episodes daily. However, some raise concerns that this bite-sized format can take conversations out of context and alter the reality of the reality show.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, barring immigration officials from "indiscriminately" arresting individuals suspected of being in the country illegally. The ruling by Judge Maame Frimpong states that there is a "mountain of evidence" that officials have been conducting unconstitutional "roving patrols." The order prohibits arrests based solely on factors like race, speaking Spanish, or being present at a specific location. This legal setback for the administration's immigration crackdown comes amid widespread protests and criticism of recent raids in California.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, setting the tone for the Los Angeles Dodgers to end their seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. In his longest outing since returning to the mound after surgery, Ohtani pitched three scoreless innings, striking out four and allowing only one hit. Although bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan earned the official win, Ohtani's dominant start provided the momentum the team desperately needed. The performance is a promising sign for the two-way superstar's continued recovery and his impact as a pitcher for the team's second half.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team clinched a dramatic 22-17 victory and a 2-0 series win against Argentina after a last-gasp try from replacement Jack van Poortvliet.

          <p>As artificial intelligence technology advances, it is increasingly seen as a factor contributing to China's declining birth rate by fulfilling needs traditionally met by family, such as companionship and elder care. Many young professionals now feel less pressure to marry and have children, believing AI-powered robots will provide support in their old age. While this trend exacerbates demographic concerns, some experts argue it may not be entirely negative. They suggest that the AI revolution could redefine societal structures around life and family, potentially making traditional population concerns obsolete in a technologically advanced future.</p>
