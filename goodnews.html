          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, with sales growing 13% year-over-year to $167.7 billion, driven by strong performance in its advertising and online stores units. However, the company's shares declined in extended trading after it provided a cautious operating income forecast for the upcoming quarter, raising investor concerns about the high costs of its significant investments in artificial intelligence. Despite the guidance, Amazon's cloud computing division, AWS, saw an 18% revenue increase, though this growth rate trails behind competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.

          <p>Apple announced third-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst predictions for both profit and revenue, marking the company's most significant quarterly revenue growth since December 2021. The strong performance was fueled by a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, particularly the popular iPhone 16 model, and a nearly 15% rise in Mac revenue. While the services division continued its steady growth, sales for the iPad and wearables declined, though overall positive results were bolstered by a 4% sales increase in the crucial China market.

          <p>The White House has announced the construction of a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump has long advocated for to host large formal events and state dinners. The estimated $200 million cost will be covered by President Trump and other anonymous private donors, with construction slated to begin in September. The new facility, to be located in a modernized East Wing, is designed to seat approximately 650 guests, eliminating the need for the large tents currently used for major functions on the White House grounds.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, significantly drawing down the force deployed by the Trump administration two months ago to address protests related to immigration policies. California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, praised the withdrawal, having previously argued that local law enforcement should manage the protests and that the deployment was unnecessary. Approximately 250 troops will remain to protect federal property, while the administration maintains the deployment was vital for maintaining order amid what it termed "rampant lawlessness."</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell reveals that the modern potato evolved from an ancient interbreeding event between a tomato ancestor and a wild potato species around 9 million years ago. Scientists have long been puzzled by the potato's origins, but this research shows that a crucial gene from the ancient tomato gave the potato its ability to form starch-rich tubers. This genetic combination was necessary to create the staple vegetable known today, solving a long-standing botanical mystery and demonstrating how hybridization can spark the evolution of entirely new traits.</p>
