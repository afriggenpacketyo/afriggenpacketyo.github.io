          <p>A recent drop in mortgage interest rates to their lowest level since April has triggered a significant increase in home refinancing applications, which rose 7% last week. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, this demand from current homeowners is 40% higher than the same period last year. However, the lower rates did not similarly motivate potential homebuyers, as purchase applications remained nearly flat, indicating ongoing uncertainty in the housing market. The data highlights a divergence where existing homeowners are capitalizing on savings while new buyers remain hesitant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Honor has launched its new Magic V5 foldable smartphone, directly challenging market leader Samsung with a device that emphasizes its slim design and large battery capacity. Initially available in China, the phone is notably thinner and lighter than its predecessor and boasts a battery capacity exceeding 6000mAh in its premium version. The launch is strategically timed just before Samsung's own foldable device unveiling, as competition intensifies in the niche but growing foldable market. Analysts note that while the device's features are impressive, Honor faces challenges in brand recognition and global distribution compared to Samsung.</p>

          <p>China may be on the verge of conducting a landmark test of autonomous satellite refueling and servicing in geostationary orbit, a complex capability the United States has not yet achieved. Recent tracking data shows two Chinese satellites, including the Shijian-25 probe, in extremely close proximity, suggesting a potential docking maneuver is imminent. The mission's goal is to verify technologies for on-orbit maintenance that could extend the lifespan of satellites, reduce operational costs, and help mitigate the growing problem of space debris.

The squad is in a generational transition, missing key veterans like Alexandra Popp and the injured Lena Oberdorf, placing more responsibility on players like Giulia Gwinn and Lea Sch√ºller. The team has embraced a more central team camp location in Z√ºrich to foster better morale and will sport a rainbow captain's armband, a symbol previously banned at the World Cup.

This ambitious target aims to guide the bloc towards its 2050 climate neutrality goal and provide predictability for investors and industry. However, the plan also introduces new flexibility, allowing member states to use carbon credits from non-EU countries to meet a small portion of their targets, a move seen as a concession to industries concerned about competitiveness.

While Tuesday was the hottest day of the year so far in London, temperatures have since dropped by more than 10¬∞C in some areas. Forecasters do not expect a return to heatwave conditions in the first half of July, with more unsettled weather and some rainfall predicted, particularly in the north-west. The shift provides relief but comes amid ongoing drought concerns in parts of England, as scientists continue to link the increasing frequency of intense heatwaves to climate change.</p>

          <p>A Beijing-based think tank, the China Finance 40 Forum, is challenging the consensus view that China's consumer spending is underdeveloped. In a new report, researchers argue that mainstream metrics systematically underestimate the country's actual consumption power. After adjusting for factors like purchasing power parity, the think tank contends that China's per capita consumption is significantly higher than official data suggests, potentially reaching 40-50% of levels in developed nations like Japan and Germany. This alternative perspective suggests a much stronger domestic consumer base and potential for the world's second-largest economy. (not investment advice)</p>

These include creating a detailed budget that accounts for a new lifestyle, and developing a strategy to eliminate or significantly reduce non-mortgage debt, as many seniors carry substantial credit card and medical bills. It is also crucial to secure a comprehensive healthcare plan, establish an estate plan, and prepare a social and mental plan to combat potential loneliness and boredom. Finally, a trial run of the retirement lifestyle can help test the budget and social plans in a real-world setting. (not investment advice)</p>
