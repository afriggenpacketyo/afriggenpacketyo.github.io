          <h2>Man's Snake Venom Injections Lead to Development of 'Unparalleled' Antivenom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 02:29:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antivenom has shown protection against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests, offering hope for a universal antivenom. Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for snakebite victims, and researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies in his blood that could target two classes of neurotoxin. The antivenom cocktail has shown unprecedented breadth of protection against deadly snakes.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens believe social media should be regulated during elections to combat the spread of misinformation. The survey also indicates divided opinions on revising Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war.

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to curb the strength of the Hong Kong dollar, which had exceeded its trading band due to capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion in local currency. The intervention comes ahead of a US Federal Reserve meeting where interest rate cuts are expected, which could further increase capital inflow to Hong Kong. The HKMA stated it will continue to monitor the market and ensure orderly operations.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is implementing sweeping administrative reforms to streamline bureaucracy, boost economic growth, and consolidate political power. The reforms involve merging ministries, shuttering media outlets, and eliminating public sector jobs. This "revolution" aims to address dysfunction caused by the anti-corruption campaign and external pressures, including potential US tariffs. The changes are also seen as a power play by party chief To Lam ahead of the Communist Party's National Congress in 2026.</p>
