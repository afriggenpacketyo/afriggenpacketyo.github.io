          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as interim US attorney for Washington DC, following the withdrawal of his initial nominee due to Republican opposition in the Senate. Pirro, a long-time Trump ally, previously served as a Republican district attorney in Westchester, New York, and has been a vocal defender of Trump on Fox News. The appointment has raised legal questions, as it appears Trump is attempting to bypass Senate confirmation by relying on an aggressive interpretation of his appointment powers. Pirro replaces Ed Martin, who will now serve as director of the "weaponization working group.</p>

          <p>A Southern California Edison transmission tower, being removed as part of the investigation into the Eaton fire, sustained damage during a helicopter lift when the top portion contacted power lines. The tower was one of two being removed for testing to determine the cause of the fire, with the first tower being successfully transported earlier. While the power lines were reportedly not energized, the incident is under assessment, and the extent of the damage remains unclear. The official cause of the Eaton fire is still under investigation, with induction being considered as a potential cause.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer announced a new trade agreement between the US and UK, but the actual substantive changes appear limited. While the deal rolls back some tariffs on cars and steel, the 10% import tax imposed by Trump remains in place for most UK goods. In exchange, the US gains increased access for agricultural products like beef and ethanol. Experts suggest the deal is more of a political victory for both leaders, offering limited economic benefits, and some American carmakers have voiced concerns that the deal disadvantages them.</p>

          <p>China's latest stimulus measures to boost economic growth have not significantly impacted the stock market due to ongoing worries about the trade war with the U.S. Investors are concerned that broader economic deterioration outweighs the optimism from the new policies, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections. Unlike previous stimulus efforts, this round is more targeted at industrial and social needs rather than direct market support. Analysts suggest that more fiscal measures are needed to boost consumer sentiment and stabilize the real estate sector for a meaningful market rally.</p>

          <p>Some Chinese academics are advocating for a revision of World War II history, suggesting that it should begin with Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. They argue that marking 1939 as the starting point diminishes China's role in the war. This proposal comes as countries worldwide commemorate the 80th anniversary of the war's end. Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow, marking the surrender of Nazi Germany.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain aimed at increasing market access for American farm exports. In return, the US will allow Britain to export 100,000 cars annually with a 10% tariff and remove additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. This agreement, hailed as a "tremendous" deal, is seen as a model for future trade negotiations with other countries. The deal with Britain, which has a trade surplus with the US, provides insights into Trump's tariff approach, suggesting that the 10% universal tariff will likely remain in place.</p>

          <p>President Trump has proposed a tax increase on high-income earners to House Speaker Mike Johnson, aiming to create a new top income bracket for those making over $2.5 million per year, taxed at 39.6%. This would partially reverse the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered the top rate to 37%. Trump's motivation is to offset the costs of continuing the 2017 tax cuts and to protect Medicaid from spending cuts. Republicans are also considering other tax hikes with a populist appeal, including taxes on stock buybacks and limiting executive compensation deductions.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a shift from its protectionist trade policies. This move comes after President Trump referred to India as the "tariff king" and imposed tariffs on Indian exports. Experts believe that a trade deal with the U.S. is crucial for India's economic growth, but concerns remain about the impact on domestic manufacturing. Some analysts argue that certain sectors, such as steel and pharmaceuticals, may not be significantly affected by the removal of tariffs.</p>
