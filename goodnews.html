          <p>Actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has garnered significant fan attention after debuting a noticeably leaner physique at the Venice Film Festival. He was in Italy to promote his new film, "The Smashing Machine," in which he portrays former MMA fighter Mark Kerr. The role required a significant physical transformation, including hours in makeup and prosthetics, and has already generated awards buzz for the actor, who expressed a hunger to take on more dramatic roles beyond his action-star typecasting.</p>

          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, a Labour peer and former senior civil servant, has questioned the UK government's plan to restrict a key civil service internship scheme exclusively to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. While acknowledging the good intentions, Gray argued from her own working-class background that she learned a great deal from exposure to people from different walks of life. She called for the evidence base behind the decision, suggesting that while opening up the civil service is important, this specific method may be counterproductive.</p>

          <p>In a departure from the standard "evacuate immediately" protocol, the Los Angeles County Fire Chief is now supporting the idea of training some residents to stay and defend their homes during wildfires. Chief Anthony Marrone acknowledged the hard reality that there will never be enough firefighters to protect every structure in massive, fast-moving blazes. The new approach emphasizes that with proper training, equipment, and home hardening, homeowners can become a crucial part of the firefighting effort and save their properties.</p>

          <p>Nearly 25 years after the 9/11 attacks prompted the fortification of cockpit doors, a new layer of security is being added to commercial aircraft. Airlines are beginning to install secondary barriers, which are retractable gates that block access to the flight deck when the main cockpit door is open. This measure, mandated by Congress in 2018, is designed to prevent unauthorized entry during critical moments, such as when pilots need to use the lavatory, providing more robust protection than the beverage carts currently used by flight attendants.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared rapper Cardi B of assault, battery, and other allegations in a civil lawsuit filed by a security guard. The guard, Emani Ellis, had sued the star for $24 million, claiming she was spat on and cut by Cardi B's fingernail during a 2018 confrontation at an obstetrician's office. The jury deliberated for only an hour before reaching its verdict, following a trial that drew significant public attention for the rapper's colorful testimony and daily fashion choices.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, can resume her duties, rejecting the Trump administration's attempt to fire her. The court's 2-1 decision affirmed that FTC commissioners are protected from being removed by a president without cause, upholding a key principle of regulatory agency independence. The ruling is a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to exert greater control over independent federal bodies that enforce consumer protection and antitrust laws.</p>

          <p>American filmmaker Hopwood DePree has initiated a High Court battle against Rochdale Borough Council to gain ownership of Hopwood Hall, a historic stately home he has spent seven years restoring. DePree, who documented his efforts in the book "Downton Shabby," claims he fulfilled an agreement giving him the option to purchase the building. The council, however, argues he failed to meet the conditions, including providing a viable business model, and locked him out of the property last year.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Power and the Palace," by journalist Valentine Low, details a series of interactions between the British royal family and the political world. Among its claims, the book alleges Queen Elizabeth II was privately in favor of remaining in the European Union and that Queen Camilla once fought off a sexual assault as a teenager. The book also contains lighter anecdotes, such as discussions about the Coronation budget and the late Queen's concern for the Army's bagpipe school, offering a behind-the-scenes glimpse into palace life.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed erupting on Hawaii's Big Island, shooting lava fountains up to 330 feet into the air. This marks the 32nd episode of the current eruption that began in December 2024, with all activity so far contained within the Halemaʻumaʻu crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain the spectacular fountains are caused by gas-rich magma being forced through narrow vents after building up pressure beneath a cap of heavier, previously erupted magma.</p>

          <p>In a significant antitrust case ruling, a U.S. federal judge decided against forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser, a decision that sent parent company Alphabet's stock soaring by 8%. While the company was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, the remedies were less severe than prosecutors sought. The court has ordered Google to share certain search data with rivals and has placed limits on its ability to create exclusive contracts that make its search engine the default on smartphones and browsers.

Another prevalent scam involves "skimming" devices attached to contactless readers on parking machines that steal card details. Experts advise the public to verify fine details, avoid clicking unsolicited links, and inspect payment machines for any signs of tampering.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at curbing the flow of fentanyl by imposing sanctions on Chinese officials and manufacturers. The legislation targets those who fail to take credible action to prevent the trafficking of the synthetic opioid and its precursor chemicals into the United States.

          <p>A federal judge delivered a scathing ruling, finding that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops for law enforcement in Los Angeles was a "serious violation" of the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1878 law generally bars the use of the military for domestic policing. The judge's opinion detailed how the administration attempted to circumvent the law with a memo creating a "constitutional exception," an argument the court dismissed as not grounded in history, jurisprudence, or common sense, and warned of its dangerous implications.</p>

          <p>Following a market decline driven by profit-taking in major tech stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain confidence in the strong companies they own for long-term growth. He attributed the pullback to typical September profit-taking by institutions and broader investor anxiety over a recent tariff ruling and the upcoming jobs report. Cramer cautioned against panic selling, suggesting that for well-researched portfolios, such downturns are "garden-variety pullbacks" and not a sign of fundamental weakness in market-leading companies.

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot climbs to an estimated $1.3 billion, an analysis reveals that a winner's take-home amount depends heavily on their state of residence. While the odds of winning are 1 in 292.2 million, the final payout is impacted by state income taxes on top of the mandatory 37% federal tax. Winners in states with no income tax like Florida or Texas would receive significantly more than those in high-tax states like New York, which has the lowest after-tax payout for lottery prizes in the country.
