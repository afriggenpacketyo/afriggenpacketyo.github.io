Collins, who retired in 2014 after a 13-year career with multiple teams, serves as an ambassador for the NBA. His family has requested privacy and support during this time as they focus on his health and well-being, welcoming prayers from the public. Collins' career included averages of 3.6 points and 3.7 rebounds, with a peak season in 2004-05 with the New Jersey Nets.

          <p>SK Hynix shares experienced a significant surge, reaching 25-year highs, after the company announced the completion of the development of HBM4, the latest generation of high-bandwidth memory vital for AI applications. The shares rose over 7%, marking the highest point since 2000, reflecting positive investor sentiment. This breakthrough contributes to the broader rally in equities across various global markets, driven by easing inflation pressures and expectations for U.S. rate cuts. Steve Sosnick from Interactive Brokers noted that momentum and the anticipation of easier monetary policy are key factors driving market performance (not investment advice).</p>

This service ranks destinations, including restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions, marking a significant step in Alibaba's super-app strategy. JPMorgan analysts suggest Amap is becoming Alibaba's primary entry point for offline local services, potentially challenging Meituan's user review service, Dianping.

          <p>The article argues that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), led by China, offers a critical solution to the challenges facing the global order, which is currently faltering. It suggests that the UN is increasingly sidelined by unilateral actions and trade wars, with the Global South being marginalized in decision-making. The author claims that the SCO embodies principles of cooperation among countries with diverse cultures and political systems, serving as a platform for countries to cooperate. The SCO's approach provides a means to address global issues amidst rising tariffs and undermined global institutions.</p>

          <p>Teaching unions report that an increasing number of children are starting school without essential skills like speaking in full sentences or independent toilet use. A survey indicates that a third of teachers have at least five reception students needing help with toilet training, and 9 in 10 have observed a decline in speech and language abilities. Social isolation and increased screen time are cited as potential factors contributing to the decline in communication skills. Schools are urged to allocate resources for speech and language therapists to support children's development.</p>

          <p>A child nutritionist offers five tips for managing fussy eating, emphasizing that it is a normal part of development. These tips include allowing children to choose what they want to eat, avoiding labeling food as good or bad, prioritizing enjoyment during mealtimes, being mindful of appetite, and involving children in food preparation.

          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, 'Play,' arrives after two commercially unsuccessful records, as he seeks to regain his position as a leading pop artist. Sheeran calls the album a response to a dark period in his life, aiming to create joy and explore cultures through his travels. The album incorporates Asian and Middle Eastern influences, including instruments like the sitar and tabla, but integrates these elements into his signature pop style. Despite some critics noting a lack of depth in cultural integration, 'Play' showcases Sheeran's talent for crafting catchy tunes.</p>
