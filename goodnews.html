        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts explained his decision to initially hold back ace reliever Roki Sasaki in Game 2 of the National League Division Series, opting for Blake Treinen despite a save situation. The choice was driven by a desire to manage Sasaki's workload, as he had recently returned from injury and pitched frequently. Although the strategy nearly backfired, Sasaki ultimately secured the final out. Roberts confirmed that Sasaki is now the primary option for future save opportunities, but the team will continue to carefully balance his usage given his limited relief experience and the demands of the postseason.</p>

          <p>Arizona Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon has been fined $100,000 for a sideline altercation with running back Emari Demercado. The incident occurred after Demercado fumbled before scoring a touchdown, a mistake that significantly contributed to the team's narrow loss to the Tennessee Titans. Gannon expressed regret for letting his emotions get the better of him, and no further discipline is expected. This article notes that this is the first such fine for an NFL head coach since 2019, highlighting the rare nature of such public disciplinary action.</p>

          <p>Shares of Trilogy Metals, a U.S.-listed minerals explorer, surged over 200% after the White House announced a 10% stake in the Canadian company. This $35.6 million investment is part of a broader U.S. push to secure domestic supplies of critical minerals like copper, cobalt, and zinc from Alaska's Ambler mining district. The Trump administration's decision to grant permits for the Ambler Road project, reversing a previous rejection, aims to bolster U.S. supply chains and counter China's dominance in critical mineral processing. Opponents, however, raise environmental concerns about the road through Alaskan wilderness. (not investment advice)</p>
