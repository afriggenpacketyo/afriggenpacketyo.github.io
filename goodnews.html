The combined company, trading under the ticker symbol "ABTC," will be majority-owned by existing stockholders of American Bitcoin, including the president's sons. Eric Trump framed the move as a strategy to solidify the United States' position in the global bitcoin mining sector, emphasizing the use of excess power for bitcoin mining.

          <p>Iowa Republican Rep. Randy Feenstra has announced his candidacy for governor, setting up a potentially contested primary in the GOP, as the seat will be open due to Gov. Kim Reynolds' decision not to seek re-election. Feenstra's entry could lead to a high-profile Republican primary, potentially including Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, considered a favorite of President Trump. On the Democratic side, Iowa state auditor Rob Sand has also entered the race, marking the first major moves from both parties. The Iowa race is expected to be closely watched both within the state and nationally, serving as a training ground for political operatives and potential presidential candidates.</p>

          <p>Despite recent trade deals with China and the United Kingdom, the tariff rate imposed by the U.S. on imports remains higher than at any point since the 1930s, according to a Yale Budget Lab report. The total U.S. average effective tariff rate stands at 17.8%, a substantial increase from pre-Trump's second term, costing the average household an estimated $2,800 in the short term. The report notes that the reduction in tariff rates is primarily due to lower rates on Chinese imports, with the U.S.-U.K. trade deal having minimal impact on average tariff rates. Economists anticipate that businesses and consumers will adjust their purchasing behavior to mitigate the higher costs associated with tariffs.</p>

          <p>Following a US-brokered ceasefire between India and Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged a strong response to any future "terrorist attack" against India. Modi emphasized that while it is not an era of war, it is also not an era of terror, and stated that water issues with India would be resolved through peaceful negotiations. His comments followed days of intense military exchanges between India and Pakistan, triggered by a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. Both countries declared military victory after the ceasefire, with discussions underway to reduce troop presence at the borders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. tariff receipts hit a record $16.3 billion in April, driven by revenue from President Trump's trade policies, according to the Treasury Department. This surge in customs duties significantly exceeded collections from both the previous month and the same period last year, contributing to a surplus for the month. While the U.S. continues to face a substantial budget deficit, the increase in tariff revenue helped to reduce the imbalance in April. High interest rates, however, continue to pose a budgetary challenge, with net interest on the national debt remaining a significant expense.</p>

The order said the administration would consider taking regulatory actions or importing drugs from other countries in the future if drugmakers do not comply. The executive order also called on federal agencies to investigate why European countries get lower prices and to push them to pay more.

          <p>A trade deal between the U.S. and China has led to a surge in freight shipments as importers rush to move goods during a 90-day pause on the steepest tariffs. While the suspension of reciprocal tariffs is expected to benefit small businesses, lingering frustrations remain over the trade policy's instability. Experts anticipate rising costs in the supply chain due to increased demand, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. The unpredictable nature of the trade policy continues to pose challenges for businesses, impacting forecasting and long-term capital decisions.</p>

          <p>Brazil's president, Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, is aiming to build "indestructible" relations with China, as leaders from Latin America's largest economies visit Beijing amid global trade tensions. Lula criticized Trump's tariffs and expressed his desire to strengthen ties with China, already Brazil's top trading partner. The visits highlight China's growing influence in the region and underscore the shift in global power dynamics. The presence of these leaders in Beijing reflects a broader trend of countries seeking opportunities outside of the U.S., particularly in light of Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <p>American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency firm co-founded by Eric Trump, is set to become publicly traded through a merger, marking the latest expansion of the Trump family's investments in the crypto industry. The company, focused on Bitcoin mining, is merging with Gryphon Digital Mining Inc., already traded on the Nasdaq. The move could allow traders to invest in a Trump family entity, though existing stockholders are expected to own a majority of the company. This venture adds to the Trump family's growing involvement in crypto, including a digital coin and memecoin.</p>

          <p>A power failure caused major disruptions to the London Underground network and the Elizabeth line, leading to suspensions and delays across multiple lines. Transport for London (TfL) reported that the issues stemmed from a short power cut. Power has been restored, but delays and line suspensions are ongoing. National Grid attributed the problems to a fault on its transmission network in central London, causing a voltage dip that affected power supplies on the low voltage distribution network.</p>
