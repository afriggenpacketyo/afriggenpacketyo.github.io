          <p>Actor and comedian Marlon Wayans is starring in the new psychological horror film "Him," a significant departure from his comedic roots. In an interview, Wayans reflects on his career, which started at LaGuardia High School, and the influence of his famous comedic family. He also discusses how he channels personal grief, particularly the loss of his mother, into his dramatic performances, finding new depth in his acting. The article highlights his journey and the hard work that has defined his nearly two-billion-dollar box office career.</p>

          <p>Historians Jill Lepore and Jeffrey Rosen emphasize that the U.S. Constitution was designed as a dynamic document, intended to be amended and adapted by the people. The article explores its origins, from the compromises over slavery to the addition of the Bill of Rights, which were essential for its ratification. Rosen notes that the founders expected change to come from the people, not primarily from the Supreme Court, and worries that modern political gridlock and judicial overreach are undermining the system of checks and balances. Despite current challenges, they argue its core principles remain timeless and essential for democracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon is expanding its use of artificial intelligence with "Hear the Highlights," a feature that provides AI-voiced audio summaries of product information and customer reviews. The tool aims to simplify the shopping experience by distilling thousands of comments into short clips, though it raises questions about losing the nuance and specific insights found in human-written reviews. While potentially beneficial for accessibility, especially for visually impaired shoppers, critics worry that blending marketing language with genuine user feedback could mislead consumers. The technology represents a shift toward more AI-driven, conversational e-commerce experiences.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy has revealed that the European Ryder Cup team is using a novel training method to prepare for the tournament at Bethpage: virtual reality headsets that simulate a hostile crowd by shouting abuse. Captain Luke Donald introduced the technology to help players desensitize themselves to the intense pressure and name-calling expected from American fans. McIlroy noted that players could customize the verbal abuse to be "as close to the bone as you like." This innovative approach highlights the meticulous preparation Europe is undertaking to overcome its poor record on U.S. soil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the 2025 WNBA playoffs begin, sports analysts are weighing in on the top contenders and key storylines. Several experts believe the Minnesota Lynx, driven by a desire for redemption after a controversial loss last season, are poised to win the championship, led by MVP candidate Napheesa Collier. Other strong contenders include the Las Vegas Aces, who finished the season on a 16-game winning streak, and the defending champion New York Liberty. The absence of rookies Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese due to injuries changes the postseason dynamic, shifting focus to established league veterans.</p>

          <p>Top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending three stocks—Broadcom, Zscaler, and Oracle—as strong long-term investments, largely driven by their growth potential in the artificial intelligence sector. Semiconductor firm Broadcom is benefiting from accelerating AI demand, with one analyst projecting its AI revenue to reach $20 billion in fiscal 2025. Cybersecurity company Zscaler is seeing strong demand for its AI security solutions, while Oracle's stock has surged due to massive growth in its cloud infrastructure contracts.

          <p>As the UK's Labour government faces plummeting popularity, this analysis explores the lessons it could learn from Zohran Mamdani, a progressive Democrat enjoying surging support in New York's mayoral race. Mamdani's success is attributed to his laser focus on affordability, offering compelling, costed policies like free bus transport and a rent freeze that resonate with voters' lived experiences. He has also crafted a clear narrative that identifies adversaries and champions ordinary people, a contrast to Labour's shifting priorities. The article suggests that adopting a clear, authentic message and embracing modern communication could help Labour reconnect with the public.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable act of courage, doctors in Kyiv performed a life-saving heart transplant on a 12-year-old girl, Kira Skliarova, during an intense Russian missile and drone attack. Dr. Borys Todurov and his team drove through explosions to retrieve a donor heart from a deceased 4-year-old and successfully completed the surgery as the hospital shook from nearby blasts. Kira, whose own heart was severely weakened by illness, is now recovering and has a chance at a new life. The story highlights the incredible resilience and dedication of Ukrainian medical professionals working under wartime conditions.</p>

          <p>A plan by Florida's Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo, to eliminate all vaccine mandates in the state has faltered following criticism from public health experts and the White House. President Trump publicly disagreed with the move, stating that proven vaccines "just pure and simple work." After initially vowing to end every mandate, Ladapo's office has clarified it will only propose removing requirements for immunizations not mandated by legislation for school entry, such as for chickenpox and hepatitis B. The rollback highlights a rare instance of pushback against the state's aggressive anti-vaccination stance.</p>

          <h2>Advice Column: Overcoming Moral Scrupulosity and the Paralysis of Seeking Perfection</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This advice column addresses a reader struggling with scrupulosity—an obsessive worry about being morally perfect—especially around the Jewish High Holiday of Yom Kippur. The author suggests reframing the goal from moral optimization to simply living in line with one's values, accepting human imperfection. Drawing on rabbinic stories, the column explains that the Hebrew word for "sin" means "to miss the mark," implying a normal part of the human experience rather than a damning failure. Practicing self-compassion, the author argues, can lead to greater accountability and less paralysis, fostering growth instead of guilt.</p>
