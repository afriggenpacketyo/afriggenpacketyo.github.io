          <p>The U.S. Northern Command reported that approximately 2,800 service members, including 700 Marines, are being deployed to the Los Angeles region to serve alongside National Guard troops. The Marines, having completed training in de-escalation and crowd control, will operate as part of Task Force 51 under Title 10 status, aimed at protecting federal personnel and property. While authorized to detain individuals in specific circumstances, such as preventing assaults or interference with federal duties, the troops are required to transfer custody to civilian law enforcement. This deployment comes amid ongoing protests in Los Angeles, where the military's role is to provide protection without engaging in law enforcement activities. The general sentiment is relatively stable given the controlled deployment, and the fact that the Marines have de-escalation training.</p>

          <p>The US has launched a review of its multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the UK and Australia, stating the security pact must fit its "America First" agenda. Under the trilateral pact, Australia is to get its first nuclear-powered subs from the US. Both Australia and the UK have played down news of the US probe, saying it is natural for a new administration to reassess. The move comes as both Australia and the UK face pressure from the White House to lift military spending. The tone is cautious.</p>

          <h2>US President Trump Claims Rare Earths Deal with China</h2>

          <p>US President Donald Trump claims a rare earths deal is "done" with China. China had agreed to supply US companies with magnets and rare earth metals, while the US would walk back its threats to revoke visas of Chinese students. Details about the new agreement with China were limited. The negotiations in London were triggered in part by US concerns that China was being too slow to release exports of its magnets and rare earth minerals. The tone is somewhat optimistic, but cautious. (not investment advice)</p>
