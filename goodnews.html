          <p>Da Wei, a security and strategy expert from Tsinghua University, expresses cautious optimism about a potential U.S.-China trade deal. However, he characterizes current American foreign policy regarding China as being marked by "ignorance and neglect," suggesting a flawed approach to the growing competition between the two global powers. The interview delves into the complexities of the bilateral relationship, examining China's evolving role on the world stage amidst Washington's strategic shifts. He believes a deal is possible but depends on the criteria for success.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 17:54:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Liverpool John Moores University reveals a strong connection between hydration and stress management. Researchers found that individuals who drink less than the recommended 1.5 liters of water daily exhibit a 50% higher cortisol response to stressful situations. Cortisol is the body's primary stress hormone, and elevated levels are associated with increased risks of heart disease, diabetes, and depression. The findings suggest that maintaining proper hydration could be a simple yet effective strategy for mitigating the physiological impact of stress.</p>

          <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood has won his first-ever PGA Tour title, claiming victory at the Tour Championship in his 164th attempt. The 34-year-old demonstrated remarkable composure, leading throughout the final day to finish three shots ahead of his competitors with a score of 18 under par. This significant win not only earns him a $10 million prize but also sheds the "nearly man" label he had acquired on the American circuit. The victory is seen as a major confidence boost ahead of the upcoming Ryder Cup.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $750 million after no ticket matched all the winning numbers in Saturday's drawing. This grand prize now ranks as the 10th largest in the game's history, with a cash value option of approximately $338.6 million. While there was no jackpot winner, several tickets won smaller prizes, including three that matched the five white balls for a significant payout. The next drawing for the massive prize will take place on Monday evening, continuing a winless streak that began in late May.</p>

          <p>Following a significant stock market rally spurred by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaling future rate cuts, this article outlines a potential investment strategy. The analysis suggests that the market had incorrectly anticipated a more hawkish stance from the Fed, leading to a powerful rebound. The author recommends focusing on sectors sensitive to interest rates, such as housing and M&A-related stocks, while being cautious about enterprise software and certain healthcare stocks. The piece also touches on the unique situations of major tech companies and the recent government intervention in Intel. (not investment advice)</p>

The launch aims to test numerous vehicle upgrades and deliberately stress the rocket to gather critical performance data. The flight plan includes a complex landing burn test for the Super Heavy booster and a suborbital flight for the Starship upper stage, which will attempt to deploy simulated satellites. This test is crucial for both SpaceX's Mars colonization goals and for NASA's Artemis program, which relies on Starship for future moon landings.</p>

          <p>A tiny homes enthusiast in southern Ohio has built what may be one of the world's smallest livable houses, measuring just 19.4 square feet. The builder, Levi Kelly, constructed the micro-home on a utility trailer for about $5,000, using mostly pre-owned materials. Despite its closet-sized footprint, the off-grid home is equipped with solar panels, a battery system, heating and air conditioning, a compact kitchen, and a portable toilet. The project demonstrates the potential for creative and efficient design in minimalist living, pushing the boundaries of functional small-space construction.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement officials have removed over 2,300 illegal marijuana plants and 2,000 pounds of trash from a large cultivation site within California's Sequoia National Park. The operation also uncovered a semi-automatic pistol and a gallon of a banned, highly toxic insecticide. The National Park Service reported that such illegal grows, often linked to drug-trafficking organizations, cause extensive environmental damage, including water diversion, habitat destruction, and chemical contamination. This raid is part of an ongoing effort to combat these operations in protected wilderness areas.</p>
