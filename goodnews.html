          <p>President Trump met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia, marking the first meeting between a U.S. president and a Syrian leader in decades. Trump announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria to encourage its "greatness" and urged al-Sharaa to normalize ties with Israel and combat terrorism. Al-Sharaa, a former Islamist militant, expressed hope for Syria to become a key trade link and invited American investment in Syrian oil and gas. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham cautioned against easing sanctions without congressional approval and coordination with allies, particularly Israel.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury indicted Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan for allegedly helping a man evade immigration authorities, escalating a conflict between the Trump administration and local authorities over immigration enforcement. Dugan is accused of misdirecting federal agents away from an undocumented individual in her courtroom, leading to charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction. Dugan argues she is entitled to judicial immunity and has filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. The state Supreme Court has suspended Dugan from the bench pending the outcome of the case.</p>

          <p>Customs and Border Protection officers in Southern California seized approximately 150,000 illegally imported cigarettes from two cruise ship passengers arriving from Ensenada, Mexico. The seizure, valued at nearly $60,000, included various brands stored in 749 cartons across ten pieces of luggage. The passengers could not provide permits for transporting such a large quantity of tobacco, leading to potential penalties for violating import laws.

          <p>In honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, this article examines how frustrations with unfair representation in early Hollywood led to the creation of the Great Wall Film Company in Brooklyn in the 1920s. Chinese leaders, disappointed by demeaning portrayals of their community in film, were encouraged to make their own movies. Harold Lee and his uncle Lee Kee Do founded the studio, reflecting a "do-it-yourself" mentality within Chinese-American communities. The studio later moved to Shanghai, producing films distributed in the U.S. and China, and the Lee family continued their impact with the New York Chinese Film Exchange.</p>

Chang became involved in natural dyes after growing tired of the toxic fabrics in the fashion industry. The art of indigo connects cultures, carries a rich history, and has medicinal benefits.

          <p>Georgetown University researcher Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national, has been released from immigration detention in Texas following a federal judge's order. The judge stated that the government failed to provide evidence supporting Suri's detention or demonstrate that he posed a threat to U.S. interests. Suri, who was never charged with a crime, had been detained for two months after his visa was revoked. A DHS official claimed Suri spread Hamas propaganda and had connections to a suspected terrorist, allegations his lawyers deny.</p>

          <h2>California Stands Firm on Healthcare for Undocumented Immigrants Amid Federal Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 18:08:45 EDT</div>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom committed to maintaining state-funded health insurance for undocumented residents despite potential federal penalties. Congress is considering a bill that would penalize states providing healthcare to undocumented immigrants, which could cost California $27 billion over six years. While Newsom's budget includes cuts to various programs, he emphasized the economic benefits of providing healthcare to all low-income residents, regardless of immigration status, and argued that denying care leads to higher emergency room costs. However, the budget also proposes limiting enrollment and adding premiums for undocumented adults.</p>
