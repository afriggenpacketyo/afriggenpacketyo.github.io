        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in grant funding for Harvard University was illegal. The court found that the administration's action was retaliatory, stemming from the university's refusal to comply with demands that violated First Amendment rights, such as altering its diversity programs. Judge Allison Burroughs stated the administration's sudden focus on antisemitism as a pretext for the freeze was arbitrary and pretextual, as most of the conditions imposed were related to ideological and pedagogical concerns. The ruling immediately vacates the funding freeze.</p>

          <p>Key Republican senators on the Banking Committee have stated they will not consider a potential replacement for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook until her lawsuit challenging her dismissal by President Trump is resolved. Senators Mike Rounds and Thom Tillis emphasized the need for due process, expressing concerns that the move to fire Cook could be a partisan effort to undermine the Fed's independence. Cook is suing the administration over her termination, which was based on allegations of mortgage fraud that her lawyer denies. The senators' stance creates a significant hurdle for the administration's plans to reshape the central bank's board.</p>

          <p>American Eagle's stock surged over 20% after the retailer reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations and re-issued a positive full-year outlook. The company credited its successful marketing campaigns, particularly a controversial but effective partnership with actress Sydney Sweeney and another with NFL star Travis Kelce, for driving customer acquisition and sales. Despite some public criticism, the campaigns reportedly led to sellouts and significant traffic growth. The strong performance marks a turnaround for the retailer, which had previously been challenged by merchandising issues and economic pressures on consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The company cited strong performance at its 125 revamped "focus" stores and growth across all its brands, including Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, as key drivers of its success. CEO Tony Spring noted that despite economic pressures like tariffs, the consumer remains resilient, with strong sales in categories like denim and women's apparel.

          <h2>As Gold Reaches New All-Time High, Analysis Shows Significant Gains for Recent Buyers</h2>

          <p>With the price of gold surging to a new record high of around $3,549 per ounce, investors who purchased the metal recently have seen substantial returns. For example, a one-ounce gold bar bought from Costco in September 2024 for $2,679 would now have an unrealized gain of over $800, representing a more than 30% increase. Investors are reportedly turning to gold as a "fear hedge" amid economic uncertainty, global conflicts, and concerns over U.S. debt. The article notes that sellers should account for dealer fees and taxes on collectibles, which can reduce the final profit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers in Morocco have discovered more complete remains of Spicomellus, an ankylosaur from over 165 million years ago that possessed an extraordinary array of body armor. The new findings reveal that the car-sized herbivore had meter-long spikes on its neck, large spikes over its hips, and ribs fused with outward-projecting barbs—a feature never seen before in any vertebrate. Scientists believe this complex armor was used for both defense against predators and for display to attract mates or deter rivals. The discovery changes scientific understanding of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting such elaborate armor developed much earlier than previously thought.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision, a Long Island judge has ruled that advanced whole genome sequencing can be used as evidence in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann. This sets a legal precedent in New York state for admitting DNA evidence extracted from degraded, rootless hair samples. Prosecutors used this cutting-edge forensic technique to link Heuermann and his family members to hair strands found on the remains of multiple victims. The defense immediately challenged the ruling, arguing the lab is not licensed in New York, but the decision marks a major victory for the prosecution.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department has issued a preliminary list of 68 jobs that will qualify for President Trump's "no tax on tips" deduction, which is set to be in effect from 2025 through 2028. The provision, part of a larger tax bill, allows eligible workers in industries like hospitality and personal services to deduct up to $25,000 in tip income annually. The list is expected to be finalized after a public comment period. The deduction is designed to reduce taxable income for many service workers, though it does not affect state taxes or payroll levies for Social Security and Medicare. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A painting stolen by the Nazis 80 years ago has been recovered by authorities in Argentina after it was discovered in a surprising way. The artwork, a portrait by Giuseppe Ghislandi, was spotted hanging on a wall in a photograph for an online real estate listing in the city of Mar del Plata. The home belonged to the daughter of a former high-ranking Nazi official who moved to Argentina after World War II. After an initial raid failed to locate the painting, authorities placed the occupants under house arrest, leading to the eventual recovery of the long-lost piece.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk anticipates receiving U.S. approval for its daily obesity pill by the end of this year, with a planned market launch in early 2026. The drug is an oral version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in its highly successful injectable weight-loss drugs, Wegovy and Ozempic. In trials, the pill demonstrated significant weight loss of up to 16.6%, comparable to the injectable version, which could give it an edge over competitors. The development of an effective pill is seen as a major step in making obesity treatments more accessible and potentially more affordable for a wider patient population.</p>

          <p>The remains of Jerome M. Mullaney, an 18-year-old Navy seaman killed during World War II, have been officially identified by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Mullaney died in June 1944 when his ship, the USS Glennon, struck a mine off the coast of France two days after D-Day and subsequently sank under German artillery fire. His remains were recovered from the wreckage by salvagers in 1957 but could not be identified at the time and were interred in Belgium as an unknown. Modern forensic techniques, including DNA analysis, finally confirmed his identity, allowing for his return home to Pennsylvania for burial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang ties. The court found that the current situation does not legally constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion," which is the required condition for invoking the wartime statute. The administration had argued that mass illegal migration encouraged by another country met this standard, an argument the court rejected. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction, blocking the use of this specific law for these deportations, marking a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration strategy.</p>
