          <p>In Lecheng, Hainan, China, patients are accessing experimental cancer drugs long before they are available on the mainstream market. The town is a medical special zone with over 30 state-of-the-art hospitals, offering cutting-edge stem cell treatments and gene therapies. One patient with early-stage lung cancer is receiving the LK101 injection, a personalized mRNA vaccine designed to reduce the risk of relapse. The hospital suites feature floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking tropical gardens, providing a serene environment for patients undergoing these advanced treatments. This initiative marks a quiet revolution in China's approach to medical innovation and patient care.</p>

          <p>The government is planning new rules that could allow local councils to take control of unfinished housing sites from developers who fail to complete projects in a timely manner. These measures are part of a broader plan to address the housing crisis, aiming to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029. Developers will be required to commit to delivery time frames and submit annual progress reports to councils. Those who repeatedly fail to meet targets could face penalties, including losing land and paying thousands of pounds per unbuilt home to local planning authorities. </p>
