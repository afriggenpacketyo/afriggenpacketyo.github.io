        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is introducing a new sanctions regime aimed at disrupting the global networks behind small boat crossings in the English Channel. The measures will target gang leaders, corrupt officials, and companies supplying boats with asset freezes, travel bans, and financial restrictions. Foreign Secretary David Lammy described the policy as a first-of-its-kind effort to combat the criminal enterprises preying on vulnerable individuals. While the government asserts this will dismantle smuggling networks, critics and migration experts express skepticism, arguing that enforcement alone is insufficient without providing safe and legal migration alternatives.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 61 leading companies, including Siemens, Volkswagen, and Nvidia, has launched the "Made for Germany" initiative, pledging to invest €631 billion in the country over the next three years. The investment aims to revitalize the German economy, which has faced recession and low investment, by funding new factories, research, and development. This corporate optimism is bolstered by the new government's pro-business policies, such as tax relief and reduced bureaucracy. Chancellor Friedrich Merz hailed it as one of Germany's largest investment initiatives in decades, signaling a potential economic turnaround. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has emerged as a highly influential figure in Washington, reportedly surpassing tech leaders like Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla's Elon Musk. Due to the critical role of Nvidia's chips in the AI revolution, Huang has successfully navigated the complex political landscape of the U.S.-China trade war. His lobbying efforts are seen as a key factor in the U.S. administration's decision to allow the resumption of some AI chip sales to China. This growing influence highlights the strategic importance of AI technology in global politics and solidifies Huang's position as a key business envoy.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Note Recent Days Have Been Fractionally Shorter Due to Earth's Faster Rotation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists who monitor Earth's rotation have observed that recent days have been slightly shorter than the standard 24 hours, sometimes by more than a millisecond. This phenomenon is caused by minor, albeit complex, variations in the planet's spin speed, influenced by factors like the moon's gravity, atmospheric winds, and the movement of Earth's liquid core. While the long-term trend is for days to lengthen, the recent spate of shorter days has sparked discussion about the potential future need for a "negative leap second," an unprecedented step to adjust atomic clocks. Experts emphasize these are normal fluctuations, crucial for precise navigation and other technologies.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old man diagnosed with glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of brain cancer, shows no signs of the disease after participating in a clinical trial. The patient, Ben Trotman, was treated with an experimental immunotherapy drug called ipilimumab, which helps the body's immune system attack cancer cells, in conjunction with standard chemotherapy and radiation. His oncologist noted the complete disappearance of the tumor is highly unusual and offers a glimmer of hope in treating this deadly cancer. A new, larger clinical trial sponsored by University College London is now recruiting patients to further investigate the drug's potential.</p>

          <p>Cities across the U.S. are celebrating the 35th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a landmark law signed in July 1990 that prohibits discrimination based on disability. Events like inclusive rollerskating parties commemorate the progress made in accessibility and civil rights for the disabled community. Activists reflect on life before the ADA, recalling fights for basic accommodations like curb cuts, and celebrate the increased inclusion in public life. However, the celebration is tempered by concerns over potential cuts to Medicaid and new eligibility requirements that could threaten the independence and well-being of many people with disabilities.</p>

          <p>The UK government has signed a deal with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to explore using artificial intelligence to enhance public services and boost economic growth. The agreement could involve using OpenAI's software in sectors like education, defense, and the justice system, and may include an information-sharing program with government data. As part of the partnership, OpenAI will also expand its London office. While the government hails the move as fundamental to driving change, the eager adoption of AI has drawn criticism from campaigners concerned about issues like copyright and data protection.</p>

          <p>A father is being praised as a hero after he saved his four-year-old child from a mountain lion attack in Washington's Olympic National Park. The family was walking on a popular trail when the cougar attacked, biting the child. The father successfully intervened to get the child away from the animal. The child was subsequently airlifted to a trauma center and has since been released. Park rangers located and killed the mountain lion, which was fitted with a tracking collar, and stated there is no further threat to the public. Witnesses at the scene credited the father's heroic actions with saving the child's life.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has announced plans to invest $50 billion in its U.S. manufacturing and research operations by 2030. This move follows similar commitments from other major pharma companies and comes as the industry faces potential trade tariffs from the Trump administration aimed at reshoring domestic production. A key part of the investment is a new multi-billion dollar facility in Virginia, which will focus on producing the company's weight management and metabolic drugs. The company stated the investment underscores its confidence in American biopharmaceutical innovation and will support its goal of reaching $80 billion in annual revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The small Norwegian village of Ulefoss is located above Europe's largest known deposit of rare earth elements, critical metals for modern technology that the EU currently imports almost exclusively from China. A mining company, Rare Earths Norway, plans to access the deposit through an "invisible mine," using a diagonal tunnel to excavate from below without displacing the town. The project aims to avoid subsidence issues seen in other mining towns by backfilling excavated areas. If successful, the mine could provide the EU with a secure, internal supply of these vital materials, reducing its strategic dependence on China.</p>

          <p>Kimi K2, a new artificial intelligence model from the Alibaba-backed startup Moonshot AI, is rapidly gaining popularity in China. Launched on July 11, the large language model has drawn praise from industry experts for its cost-efficient design, which uses a mixture-of-experts (MOE) architecture. This approach divides the model into specialized sub-networks, significantly reducing computation costs and achieving faster performance compared to models from competitors like OpenAI. The model is available for free, and its development at a fraction of the typical cost highlights a potential shift in AI development strategy toward greater efficiency.</p>

          <p>Italy, considered a dark horse in Euro 2025, is set to face England in the semi-finals, marking their first appearance at this stage in 28 years. Led by captain and top scorer Cristiana Girelli, the team has shown tactical flexibility under coach Andrea Soncin, adapting their formation to exploit opponent weaknesses. Experts suggest Italy could target England's left-back position and use their skilled wing-backs to create opportunities. The team's success reflects the recent professionalization of women's football in Italy and the strong chemistry between players from top clubs like Juventus and Roma.</p>
