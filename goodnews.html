        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares have seen a staggering 5,502,284% increase since Warren Buffett took over in 1965, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 39,054% rise over the same period. This equates to a compounded annual return of 19.9% for Berkshire, nearly double the S&P 500's 10.4%. The company's success reflects Buffett's strategic investment decisions over six decades, transforming Berkshire from a failing textile company into a diversified conglomerate. Buffett's decision to step down as CEO after 60 years marks the end of an era, with Greg Abel set to take over the role, while Buffett will remain as chairman.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Rates Unlikely to Drop Significantly After Fed Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 10:20:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady at its May meeting, making a significant drop in mortgage rates unlikely. While a rate cut is not anticipated for May, there is a possibility that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could hint at a potential rate cut in June, which could lead to a slight decline in mortgage rates. Borrowers looking to secure an affordable mortgage rate should focus on improving their credit score and shopping around for the best terms. Proactive monitoring of the market is advised to capitalize on any opportunities that may arise.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a decline as investors responded to Warren Buffett's announcement to step down as CEO, with Greg Abel succeeding him.

          <p>Spanish authorities have launched an investigation into the theft of copper signaling cables from the high-speed rail line connecting Madrid and Andalusia, causing significant travel disruptions and leaving thousands stranded. Transport Minister Oscar Puente described the incident as a "serious act of sabotage." The theft affected commuters traveling ahead of Seville's Feria festival.

          <h2>CD Interest Rate Forecast for May 2025 Suggests Stability or Slight Decrease</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts anticipate that CD interest rates will likely remain steady or slightly decrease in May 2025, influenced by the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting and potential future rate cuts. While an increase in CD rates is unlikely, the possibility of a rate cut by the Fed could lead to a decrease in interest rates on certificate of deposit accounts. Savers focused on securing the highest CD yields may consider locking in rates now, as rates are expected to become less competitive once the Fed lowers rates. Shorter CD account terms often come with higher interest rates.</p>

However, some Latino activists and scholars note that commercialization and stereotypes have led to a disconnect from the day's historical significance. The day often is mistaken for Mexican Independence Day, which is in September. The article also touches on the political rhetoric surrounding Mexican immigrants.</p>
