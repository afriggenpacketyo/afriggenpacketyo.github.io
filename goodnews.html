          <p>Samsung is set to introduce a slimmer version of its foldable smartphone to compete with Chinese rivals like Honor and Oppo, who have already released thinner and lighter devices. These Chinese companies have used their slim designs to differentiate themselves from Samsung in the foldable market. Market analysts suggest that the demand for thinner foldable phones is growing as consumers are unwilling to compromise on thickness and weight. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo indicates that Apple is also planning to enter the foldable iPhone market next year, intensifying competition in this niche segment. The newest Galaxy Z series is the thinnest, lightest and most advanced foldable yet ‚Äì meticulously crafted and built to last.</p>

          <p>Yoshua Bengio, a leading figure in AI, has launched LawZero, an organization focused on preventing AI from harming humanity, and is developing 'Scientist AI' as a safety mechanism. Scientist AI is designed to calculate the probability of harm from other AIs' actions and block risky ones, acting as a guardrail. Bengio expresses concerns about AI systems developing goals and agency, potentially leading to unintended consequences and loss of human control. He emphasizes the importance of democratically establishing moral guidelines for AI, suggesting Scientist AI can help rationalize ethical debates and ensure AI actions align with human safety specifications. The goal is to design AI that inherently lacks the incentive or ability to cause harm, ensuring that it remains a tool for human benefit.</p>

          <p>A Japanese district court has ordered the state to compensate two asylum seekers with 1.2 million yen for unjust repeated detentions by the immigration agency. The court ruled that the agency did not adequately consider their physical and mental health conditions during detention. The plaintiffs, a Kurdish man and an Iranian national, had been detained and released multiple times over a decade, leading to the lawsuit in 2022. The court found that some detentions violated international human rights covenants and Japan's immigration law, highlighting concerns about the treatment of asylum seekers in Japan.</p>

The OfS has released guidance for universities in England on upholding free speech, following a fine issued to the University of Sussex for restricting it. The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities to protect free speech and academic freedom, with the potential for significant fines for non-compliance. The guidelines cover various aspects of university life, balancing the right to peaceful protest with the need to ensure no students are intimidated or prevented from attending lectures.</p>

          <p>Doctors Without Borders collaborated with community healers and midwives in Alto Baud√≥, Colombia, to create rituals addressing mental health risks caused by ongoing violence. The project includes tearing and sewing back together photographs as a metaphor for healing, along with using fragrant herbs for comfort. The organization also trained community members as health workers to provide basic medical services in the isolated region. The project, documented in Fernanda Pineda's photography series, highlights the resilience of women and the power of visual storytelling to illuminate overlooked global health crises.</p>

          <h2>China Wary of US-Backed Stablecoins and Potential Dollar Dominance</h2>

          <p>Former Chinese central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan has warned that US dollar-backed stablecoins could accelerate the "dollarisation" of the international monetary system. His concerns reflect the Chinese government's interest in the underlying technologies and their potential role in cross-border finance. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins aim to combine the efficiency of digital assets with the reliability of traditional money. The US Senate's recent passage of landmark stablecoin legislation has intensified these concerns, creating a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth highlights the significant contributions of Black America to U.S. cuisine, particularly through soul and Southern food traditions. Enslaved West Africans introduced foods like sweet potatoes, black-eyed peas, and collard greens, along with cooking methods such as barbecuing and deep-frying. These traditions, passed down through generations, have become integral to American culture and cuisine. The traditions that surround this holiday are how they've been a part of me ‚Äî and a part of Black and American culture.</p>

          <p>A judge has ruled that messages between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift can be handed over to Justin Baldoni as part of their ongoing legal battle. Baldoni is pursuing the communications regarding the environment on the set of It Ends With Us. Lively is being sued by Baldoni and his studio, after she claimed to have been sexually harassed on set and that he led a campaign to "destroy" her reputation. In turn, he counter-sued, but his defamation lawsuit was dismissed by a judge last week.</p>
