          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated that the company will prioritize growth and investment in AI model training over short-term profitability, even after the launch of its advanced GPT-5 model. Despite being on track for over $20 billion in annual recurring revenue, the company continues to operate at a loss, which Altman views as a rational strategy while AI capabilities are rapidly improving. With OpenAI reportedly in talks for a stock sale at a $500 billion valuation, the focus remains on spending heavily on compute and development, leveraging its position as a private company free from public market pressures.</p>

          <p>Shares of MP Materials, a U.S.-based rare earth miner, surged after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the second quarter, driven by record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. This key material is essential for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles and other advanced technologies. The positive financial results and ramp-up of its Texas magnet facility come after the U.S. Defense Department became its largest shareholder with a $400 million investment, signaling strong government backing for domestic rare earth production.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, financial experts suggest that now may be an opportune time for savers to open a short-term certificate of deposit (CD). Locking in a high rate on a CD with a term of 12 months or less can protect savings from the anticipated drop in yields. The article argues that for a substantial deposit, such as $10,000, this strategy allows savers to maximize interest earnings while maintaining flexibility for future financial moves once the CD matures.

          <p>This article provides an overview of current average interest rates for mortgages and refinancing as of early August 2025, noting that rates remain elevated compared to recent years. For a 30-year mortgage, the average rate is around 6.75%, while a 15-year loan is near 5.99%. The report suggests that while the rate environment is challenging for homebuyers, strengthening one's credit profile and comparing offers from multiple lenders are key strategies to secure the best possible rate. It also notes that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring relief for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of August 8, 2025, the price of gold is approximately $3,395 per ounce, though this value is subject to constant change. The article explains that gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, with its price influenced by multiple factors. These include basic supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Currency movements, particularly the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the policies of central banks that hold large gold reserves also play a significant role in its valuation.

          <p>Scientists using the James Webb Space Telescope have found strong new evidence of a giant gas planet in Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our own. Located just over four light-years away, the potential planet is thought to be similar to Jupiter or Saturn and orbits a star much like our Sun. While the gas giant itself would be uninhabitable, astronomers are excited by the possibility that it could host moons with conditions suitable for life. Confirming the planet's existence remains challenging due to the brightness of its star, but future observations are planned.</p>

          <p>A recent Emerson College poll reveals significant voter indecision in California regarding the 2026 governor's race and a potential ballot measure to redraw congressional districts. In the gubernatorial field, former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter leads with 18%, but a large 38% of voters remain undecided. Similarly, voters are split on a Democratic-led proposal for mid-decade redistricting, with 42% unsure about the effort, which is intended to counter Republican gerrymandering in other states. The poll suggests the political landscape for these key issues is still highly fluid.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared with President Trump to announce a $600 billion U.S. spending plan, a move seen as a strategic effort to appease the administration's "Made in America" push without committing to final iPhone assembly in the U.S. The plan focuses on expanding partnerships with long-standing American suppliers like Corning and Texas Instruments for key components. This allows Apple to take credit for supporting U.S. jobs and manufacturing while avoiding the immense cost and logistical challenges of relocating its entire supply chain, a gambit that appeared to satisfy the president for now.</p>
