          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 06:20:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has proposed extending the ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method considered destructive to the seafloor, across a larger area of English waters. The ban would expand from 18,000 km2 to 48,000 km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas, aiming to safeguard rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats. This proposal is subject to a 12-week industry consultation. Separately, President Macron of France called for a moratorium on deep sea mining at the UN Ocean Conference, expressing concerns about the potential disruption to deep seabed biodiversity and ecosystems. The UK has yet to ratify the High Seas Treaty, and the push for ratification is underway. </p>

          <p>Faced with rapid population growth and climate change, St. George, Utah, is exploring an unconventional solution to water scarcity: recycling sewage. The city plans to build a wastewater reclamation plant that will treat effluent for use in irrigation, eventually integrating it directly into the drinking water supply. This initiative is part of a broader effort to conserve water, including incentivizing residents to remove lawns and adopting stricter conservation rules for new developments. Other cities in the Western U.S., like Las Vegas, are also demonstrating the potential of wastewater reuse to alleviate water stress. </p>

These arrangements, requiring no congressional authorization unless threatening federal supremacy, could also involve interstate criminal task forces to combat corruption and protect consumers and the environment. This collaboration would foster competition among states and encourage residents and businesses to relocate to those prioritizing health and safety. </p>

          <p>A study by Vote Forward reveals that personal letters sent to millions of potential voters had no effect on turnout in the 2024 election, prompting calls for Democrats to reassess their organizing tactics. The study highlights the risk of ineffective or even counterproductive field operations, especially in presidential elections where voters are already saturated with information. Progressive groups are urged to be more transparent about campaign failures and to invest in deeper engagement with voters beyond election cycles. The study also suggests that novelty is key in political campaigns, as traditional methods become less effective over time. </p>
