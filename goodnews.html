          <p>Major newspapers are reporting on the prospect of peace in Gaza, with headlines like "Peace within reach" and "A moment of shared hope" following a ceasefire agreement. The Daily Mirror urges the U.S. and allies to ensure the deal leads to a comprehensive peace, warning of potential derailment. The Daily Express and Daily Mail credit President Trump for achieving the tentative accord, despite the Daily Telegraph highlighting vague points and Hamas's reservations. Uncertainties remain regarding Hamas's disarmament and the composition of an international stabilization force.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants secured a decisive 34-17 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, who are the defending Super Bowl champions. The game sparked controversy when the Eagles repeatedly ran the "tush push" play four straight times to score an early touchdown, drawing criticism from prominent figures like Micah Parsons and Dave Portnoy. Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart led his team to victory despite an injury scare, with fellow rookie Cam Skattebo contributing three rushing touchdowns. This marked a significant win for the Giants, their fourth against the Eagles in 18 games.</p>

          <p>Eva Maria Pommer, a 35-year-old German citizen, has been identified as the woman whose body was found on a Dutch beach in 2004, solving a 21-year-old cold case. Her identification resulted from a crucial tip-off following an international police campaign, Operation Identify Me, which publicly released Interpol "black notices." Pommer's body was discovered in sand dunes near Wassenaar with no obvious injuries, and a key linked her to Bottrop, Germany. This breakthrough highlights the success of international collaboration and public appeals in identifying long-missing persons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have made a breakthrough, finding that adding salt to ice enables it to generate electricity when bent. This discovery, detailed in a Nature Physics paper, leverages flexoelectricity—the generation of an electrical charge under non-uniform strain. The team fabricated devices from saline ice, demonstrating its potential as a low-cost, clean energy source for cold environments. This innovation could open new avenues for harnessing power in previously challenging climatic conditions.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a slight decline after Israel and Hamas agreed to the initial phase of a peace plan for Gaza, easing the market's geopolitical risk premium. Brent crude and U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures saw modest drops, having previously risen due to stalled Ukraine peace talks. The agreement, which includes a ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange, shifts market focus back to a potential oil surplus as OPEC+ unwinds production cuts. Concerns about a prolonged U.S. government shutdown also loom, potentially dampening American oil demand.</p>

          <p>A tsunami alert has been lifted for the Philippines, Palau, and Indonesia following a powerful magnitude 7.5 earthquake off the southern Philippines. The quake struck near Manay in the Mindanao region, initially prompting warnings of destructive tsunami waves. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stated authorities are assessing the situation and deploying search-and-rescue teams. While the immediate tsunami threat has passed, the event highlights the region's vulnerability to seismic activity and the importance of rapid response protocols.</p>

          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) have issued a joint policy paper to address disorderly price competition. The initiative seeks to limit price wars and self-destructive cost-cutting practices, which are deemed detrimental to industry development and product quality. Regulators will guide industry associations in setting reasonable prices, issue warnings for suspected price wars, and conduct interventions when necessary. This move aims to maintain market order and foster healthy economic growth.</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, is reportedly set to announce her campaign for the U.S. Senate next week, challenging longtime Republican Senator Susan Collins. Mills, who is term-limited as governor, gained national attention for publicly confronting President Trump over his administration's stance on transgender athletes. Her entry into the race is seen as a significant opportunity for Democrats to potentially flip a GOP-held seat and contest the Republican Senate majority in a state that leans Democratic. The race is expected to be one of the most closely watched contests in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

This approach aims to reduce reliance on China and bolster security autonomy.
