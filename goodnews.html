        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the surprising $258.4 billion budget surplus reported by the U.S. Treasury for April 2025, the second-largest monthly surplus in U.S. history. The surplus was driven by large individual tax deposits, reflecting final payments on prior-year taxes and quarterly estimated taxes. Despite this positive result, the article notes that the U.S. government still faces a significant deficit for the fiscal year. The article then transitions to offering personal finance advice on how individuals can create their own budget surplus by cutting wasteful spending and creating passive income streams.

          <p>This article in The Atlantic explores the evolving role of college chaplains, highlighting how they are adapting to meet the needs of a less religious student body. While religious affiliation among young adults is declining, college students are attending religious-life programs in larger numbers than in decades, with many chaplains taking inspiration from figures like William Sloane Coffin Jr. Modern chaplains are taking on a broader range of duties, including helping students navigate housing insecurity, safety threats, and campus protests, while also embracing alternative forms of spirituality and self-care.</p>
