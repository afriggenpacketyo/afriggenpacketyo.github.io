          <p>Automaker Stellantis has unveiled a redesigned 2026 Jeep Cherokee, featuring the company's first hybrid system in North America, in an effort to reverse six consecutive years of declining sales for the brand. The new model is larger, offers 30% more cargo space, and boasts a fuel-efficient hybrid powertrain with a range of over 500 miles. The company hopes that reintroducing the popular Cherokee nameplate, which was discontinued in 2023, will reinvigorate its market share in the competitive mid-size SUV segment. The vehicle's production will take place in Mexico, with arrivals at dealerships expected late this year.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who was mistakenly deported to a high-security prison in El Salvador, could be released from criminal custody in Tennessee on Friday. After being returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, a federal judge has blocked immigration authorities from detaining or deporting him upon his release. The judge ordered that Abrego Garcia be restored to ICE supervision in Maryland, where his family resides, to ensure he receives due process. His attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges, arguing they are a form of vindictive prosecution.</p>

          <h2>Kenyan Cash Grant Experiment Reduced Child Deaths but Proved Less Cost-Effective Than Other Health Interventions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 07:15:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study in rural Kenya found that one-time cash grants of about $1,871 to impoverished households led to a remarkable 48% reduction in infant and child mortality. The study by GiveDirectly suggests the cash allowed families to afford hospital deliveries and better nutrition, effectively functioning as a paid parental leave program. However, despite the significant impact on saving lives, the program's cost per life saved was approximately $299,418. This figure is considerably higher than other highly effective interventions like Vitamin A supplementation or malaria prevention, highlighting a trade-off between direct poverty reduction and cost-effectiveness in public health.</p>

          <p>A Milan court has freed Manfredi Catella, founder of the real estate firm Coima SGR, from house arrest without imposing alternative restrictions. Catella was arrested in July as part of a broader investigation into alleged crimes related to urban planning that fueled Milan's recent real estate boom. The inquiry also involves senior city officials, including the mayor, all of whom have denied wrongdoing. The investigation, which was prompted by resident complaints about a surge in multi-story buildings, has reportedly caused construction activity in Italy's financial capital to stall since it began in 2022.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. lawmakers and regulators are exploring a knowledge-based test that would allow more retail investors to qualify as "accredited" and access private market assets like pre-IPO companies and hedge funds. Currently, accreditation is primarily based on income and net worth thresholds, which haven't been adjusted for inflation in decades. Experts say designing a fair test is challenging, as it must assess an investor's understanding of complex risks, including limited liquidity and subjective valuations. This move is part of a broader push to democratize access to investments traditionally reserved for the wealthy. (not investment advice)</p>

The dinosaur, now named Istiorachis macaruthurae, lived 125 million years ago, and its fossils were initially found by a local fossil hunter. A scientist officially identified it as a new species after noticing its unusually long neural spines, which may have been used for display.

          <p>India's Supreme Court has modified a controversial order that would have required all stray dogs in Delhi to be moved into shelters. Following protests from animal welfare groups, a new ruling clarifies that healthy strays should be released after vaccination and sterilization. However, dogs found to be rabid or overly aggressive must be kept in shelters, and feeding strays in public spaces is now banned, with designated feeding areas to be established. The initial order was a response to the growing number of dog bites in the city, but critics argued it would lead to inhumane overcrowding and culling.</p>

          <p>A new poll indicates that Governor Gavin Newsom's proposal to temporarily redraw California's congressional districts to favor Democrats has more support than opposition among voters. The plan, a countermeasure to Republican gerrymandering in Texas, is supported by 46% of registered voters, with 36% opposed and many undecided. Support is strongest among Democrats and regular voters, while Republicans are overwhelmingly against it. The high-stakes measure could influence control of the U.S. House and has boosted Newsom's approval ratings as he takes a more combative stance against President Trump and national Republicans.</p>

The unions argue that mega-sporting events often displace low-income residents and fail to deliver on economic promises. Olympic organizers have stated their commitment to creating good-paying jobs and positive economic impact, but the unions are pushing for concrete commitments to address the region's housing crisis.</p>

          <p>Following a recent case of the plague in a South Lake Tahoe resident, public health experts are clarifying the risks of the ancient disease today. Caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, the plague primarily affects wild rodents and is transmitted to humans through infected flea bites, typically in rural or wilderness areas. While the disease was devastating in the Middle Ages, it is now rare and treatable with modern antibiotics if caught early. Experts state that eradication is not feasible as the bacterium persists in animal populations, but the plague has been effectively eliminated as a serious public health problem in the U.S.</p>
