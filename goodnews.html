          <p>A prominent Beijing-based think tank has recommended that China issue 30 trillion yuan (US$4.2 trillion) in treasury bonds to swap for the hidden debts of local governments. This measure aims to tackle significant financial risks and stimulate economic growth, which has shown signs of stabilization but remains fragile. The proposal from Tsinghua University's economic center argues that resolving the local debt crisis is crucial for China's financial stability and long-term economic health. The report also suggests additional bonds to support the property market and boost consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of a new interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, which is the third such object known to have passed through our solar system. The comet, spotted using a telescope in Chile, is currently 420 million miles from Earth and poses no threat. Scientists are actively monitoring the object to determine its size and composition as it approaches its closest point to the sun in late October. The discovery is considered exciting for astronomers, providing another rare opportunity to study a visitor from another star system.</p>

          <p>Following the passage of President Trump's major tax and spending package, House Speaker Mike Johnson celebrated the outcome as a demonstration of the "beauty of unified government." He highlighted the close coordination between the White House and congressional Republicans, which he said was essential to passing the first major legislation of the new administration. Johnson credited President Trump for being generous with his time to answer members' questions and persuade holdouts. The Speaker framed the bill's success as a necessary step to fix policies he described as disastrous under the previous administration.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece outlines a strategy to make popular GLP-1 anti-obesity drugs more accessible and affordable under employer-sponsored health insurance plans. The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons, proposing that manufacturers charge health plans the same direct-to-consumer price of around $500 per month. Employers could then contribute a portion of this cost, significantly lowering the out-of-pocket expense for employees. This approach would simplify pricing, increase access to transformative medications for metabolic health, and reduce the administrative burden of prior authorizations for doctors.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Passage of Major Bill Seen as Significant Extension of Trump's Political Power</h2>

          <p>This analysis piece argues that the successful passage of his signature tax and spending bill marks a major legislative victory that consolidates and extends President Trump's political power. The article details how Trump used a combination of charm, pressure, and direct engagement to secure the votes of reluctant Republican lawmakers, overcoming internal party doubts and external criticism. Despite the bill's unpopularity in some polls and concerns about its impact on the national debt, its passage demonstrates the president's firm control over the Republican party. The legislation is described as a capstone achievement for his second term.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: The American Revolution's Roots Are in Biblical Inheritance, Not Individualism</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence were rooted more in the nation's biblical inheritance than in Enlightenment-era individualism. The author contends that the founders were seeking to restore their rights as Englishmen, which they felt King George III had violated. The famous proclamation that "all men are created equal" is presented not as a self-evident rational truth, but as a concept derived directly from the Judeo-Christian belief that humanity is created in God's image. The article concludes that political and biblical heritage were more formative for the U.S. than revolutionary liberalism.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' expectations and demonstrating the labor market's continued resilience despite slowing economic growth. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest level since February. Job growth was led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the federal workforce continued to shrink. The strong report suggests the Federal Reserve will likely hold off on cutting interest rates in the near term as it monitors the potential economic impact of new trade tariffs.

          <p>A new Republican spending bill contains several new tax breaks for individuals, but four of them are temporary and scheduled to expire at the end of 2028. These include federal income tax deductions for tips and overtime pay, both of which were key campaign promises from President Trump. The other temporary provisions are a deduction for interest on new auto loans and the creation of new government-seeded children's savings accounts, called "Trump accounts." While these tax changes are currently set to sunset, their long-term future could be subject to further legislative action. (not investment advice)</p>
