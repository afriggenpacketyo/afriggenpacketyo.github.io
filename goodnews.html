          <p>OpenAI and Oracle have activated the first data center for their ambitious 'Stargate' project in Abilene, Texas, a key part of a $500 billion initiative to build the necessary infrastructure for future artificial intelligence. The facility, equipped with Oracle Cloud infrastructure and Nvidia chips, represents a significant step in addressing the global shortage of computing power required for advanced AI models. With plans to expand to a gigawatt of capacity and additional sites across the U.S., the project aims to reshape the American power grid and solidify U.S. influence in the AI sector. The initiative is funded through a combination of partner investments, debt financing, and OpenAI's own cash flow.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, President Trump stated he believes Ukraine is capable of winning back all of its territory from Russia, including land annexed in 2014. This marks a reversal from his previous position, which suggested Kyiv might need to concede territory to Moscow to achieve peace. After meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump posted on social media that Russia now looks like a 'paper tiger' due to its economic troubles and the prolonged conflict. The statement reflects his growing frustration with Vladimir Putin and aligns with his recent actions, such as sending Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball announced it will introduce an automated ball-strike (ABS) challenge system starting in the 2026 season for all regular and postseason games. The new rule will allow batters, pitchers, and catchers to challenge an umpire's call, with each team receiving two challenges per game. If a challenge is successful, the team retains it. The system, which has been tested extensively in the minor leagues, aims to correct missed calls in critical situations while preserving the human element of umpiring. Player feedback heavily favored this challenge format over a fully automated system for calling every pitch.</p>

The company has benefited significantly from the artificial intelligence boom, as high-end AI chips require large amounts of its specialized high-bandwidth memory products. Micron's largest business unit, which serves cloud providers, saw its sales more than triple compared to the same period last year. The strong performance and robust forecast for the upcoming quarter caused the company's stock to rise in after-hours trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Consumers are rushing to dealerships to purchase electric vehicles before federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs expire on September 30. The credits, part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, are being phased out under President Trump's new legislation, leading to a record surge in EV sales in August. In response, dealerships are offering significant incentives, with some lease rates dropping to as low as $40 per month, to clear out inventory. While the deadline is creating a short-term boom, industry experts express concern about a potential sharp decline in EV sales starting in October.</p>

          <h2>Calculating Monthly Costs for a $40,000 Home Equity Loan After Fed Rate Cut</h2>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing against home equity has become more affordable for homeowners. A new $40,000 home equity loan with a 10-year repayment term now costs approximately $494 per month, while a 15-year term costs around $389 per month. These payments are slightly lower than they were earlier in the year and in late 2024, reflecting the more favorable interest rate environment. The article also compares these fixed-rate loans to variable-rate Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which currently offer lower initial payments but carry the risk of future rate increases.

          <p>At the UN General Assembly, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva delivered a sharp rebuke of Washington, criticizing its use of tariffs and military actions while advocating for closer ties with China. Despite the critical tone, Lula's speech was followed by an unexpected diplomatic overture from U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump told reporters that he and Lula had 'excellent chemistry' during a brief encounter after the address and that they had agreed to meet next week. The exchange came amid heightened tensions between the two countries, including significant U.S. tariffs on Brazilian imports.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after her iconic song 'Lovin' You' topped the charts, the late singer Minnie Riperton will be honored with a tribute concert at the Hollywood Bowl. The event will feature performances by Stevie Wonder, who co-produced her 'Perfect Angel' album, along with George Benson, Lizz Wright, and other artists. Riperton, known for her five-octave vocal range and 'whistle register,' died of breast cancer in 1979 at age 31. Her music has seen a resurgence in recent years, being sampled by hip-hop artists and featured in films, cementing her legacy as an influential yet underappreciated talent.</p>

          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued in Pembroke, Maine, after it fell into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well on private property. The landowner discovered the animal with only its antlers visible and alerted the state's wildlife department. A team of wardens and a biologist responded, first sedating the moose and then using straps and an excavator to carefully lift it out of the well. The entire operation took five hours, after which the moose, unharmed, ran off into the woods once the sedation wore off. The family has since capped the previously unknown well.</p>

          <p>Leading health organizations worldwide, including the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency, are forcefully rejecting President Trump's recent claims that acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy is linked to autism. In statements, officials emphasized that available scientific evidence has not established a causal link and that the drug remains a crucial and safe option for treating pain and fever in pregnant women. They warned that avoiding necessary treatment could pose risks to both the mother and the unborn baby. Health officials also pushed back against Trump's suggestions that vaccines cause autism, calling the idea disproven science.</p>

          <p>England has announced its squad for the upcoming Ashes series in Australia, notable for what is being described as its most hostile group of fast bowlers in decades. The attack, featuring Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, and Josh Tongue, is designed to counter Australia's pace on its home pitches, a strategic shift from previous tours. With captain Ben Stokes recovering from injury, the team's plan is to fight 'fire with fire' in the opening Tests in Perth and Brisbane. The selection marks the first Ashes tour in over 20 years without James Anderson, signaling a clear transition to a new generation of bowlers.</p>

          <p>A massive $100 billion partnership between OpenAI and Nvidia was finalized through a series of hurried, last-minute negotiations between CEOs Sam Altman and Jensen Huang. The deal, which will see Nvidia invest in OpenAI and supply chips for a new wave of AI supercomputing facilities, was struck just hours before Altman was scheduled to announce a new infrastructure project in Texas. The arrangement deepens the ties between two of the most influential companies in the AI boom. It also repositions OpenAI's relationships with other key partners, including Microsoft, which was reportedly informed only a day before the deal was signed.</p>

          <p>Boeing's stock gained over 1% following reports that the U.S. and China are in the final stages of negotiating a massive order for its jets. The potential deal, which could involve as many as 500 aircraft, is seen as a key component of President Trump's broader trade talks aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Beijing. This development aligns with a pattern of large Boeing orders being included in trade agreements with various countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Qatar. The news reinforces the investment case for the aircraft manufacturer, which has seen its stock rise 22% year to date. (not investment advice)</p>
