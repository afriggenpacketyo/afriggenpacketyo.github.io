          <h2>New Exhibit Highlights the Introduction of Surfing to the U.S. Mainland by Hawaiian Royalty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 08:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, celebrates the 140th anniversary of surfing's introduction to the American mainland. The story centers on three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—who were studying at a nearby military school in 1885. Nostalgic for their home, they crafted surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated the royal sport at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. This act of "surf diplomacy" was documented in local newspapers and is now recognized as the seed of surfing culture in the Americas, a legacy that predates the more famous efforts of Duke Kahanamoku.</p>

          <p>Brentford striker Yoane Wissa has publicly accused the club of breaking its word and is demanding a transfer to Newcastle United before the deadline. In a statement, Wissa claimed he had written promises that he could leave if a reasonable offer was made, but Brentford has rejected two bids from Newcastle, the latest worth a potential £40 million. The DR Congo international expressed immense frustration, stating the club is unfairly standing in his way and that being forced to stay would tarnish his four years there. He has not been training with the first team as he tries to force the move.</p>

          <p>The iconic Honey Deuce cocktail at the U.S. Open, priced at $23, has become a symbol of rising costs for event attendees. While its price is unchanged from last year, the beverage has seen a 53% increase since 2015, when it cost just $15. This price hike significantly outpaces the broader U.S. inflation rate of approximately 36% over the same period, as tracked by the Consumer Price Index. If the drink's cost had risen in line with general inflation, it would be priced around $20.33 today. Despite the steep price, the cocktail remains immensely popular, with over 550,000 sold last year.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at New York's Jewish Museum showcases 40 portraits of Ada Katz, the wife and lifelong muse of acclaimed painter Alex Katz. Over their 50-year marriage, he has painted her approximately 300 times, capturing her distinctive American beauty and style. Katz, who came of age during the abstract expressionism movement but remained committed to his own brand of realism, sees his wife as a constant source of visual inspiration. Curators note that his interest lies more in style, fashion, and the play of light across her face than in deep emotional exploration, creating detached yet captivating works.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Arundhati Roy's forthcoming memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," offers a poignant reflection on her tumultuous and formative relationship with her mother.

          <h2>Opinion Piece Explores the Morality of Personal Happiness Amid Global Crises</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary addresses the common feeling of guilt associated with experiencing personal joy while the world faces numerous crises. The author argues against this binary choice, drawing on philosophical and religious traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body. Instead of only feeling the pain of others, we should also embrace "sympathetic joy," or the happiness derived from others' successes and well-being. Acknowledging both the world's horrors and its delights allows for a more balanced and resilient emotional state. This perspective is presented not as an acceptance of injustice, but as a form of resistance against the despair that political turmoil seeks to create.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has issued guidance clarifying how consumers can still access the up to $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, even after its scheduled expiration on September 30. According to the IRS, a taxpayer can qualify for the credit if they have a "written binding contract" to purchase an EV on or before the deadline, even if they take physical possession of the vehicle at a later date. This provides a crucial window for buyers who may not be able to drive a car off the lot by the end of the month. The clarification applies to new, used, and leased EVs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., is encountering significant resistance within the federal court system. In at least five instances over the past month, grand juries have refused to indict individuals charged with assaulting federal officers, signaling skepticism from the public. Federal magistrate judges have also expressed frustration with prosecutors over sloppy casework and unnecessary delays. The high rate of case filings, combined with the unpopularity of the federal deployment among D.C. residents who make up the jury pool, suggests the administration's law-and-order surge is struggling to hold up under legal scrutiny.</p>

          <p>With the transfer deadline approaching, Manchester United is reportedly considering a move for Aston Villa's goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez. The club has been actively seeking to resolve its goalkeeping situation and, while negotiating for a younger prospect from Royal Antwerp, may turn to the highly experienced Martinez. The 32-year-old is a World Cup winner with Argentina and a two-time FIFA Goalkeeper of the Year, offering the high-level experience that United currently lacks in that position. The potential move comes as United's head coach, Ruben Amorim, acknowledged the immense pressure on the team's current goalkeepers.</p>

          <p>A global craze for matcha, fueled by its superfood reputation on social media and a post-pandemic tourism boom, has created a severe supply shortage and driven prices to record highs in Japan. The price for tencha, the tea leaves used to make matcha, has skyrocketed, and retailers are struggling to keep the green powder in stock, often imposing purchase limits. The labor-intensive process of growing and milling high-quality matcha, combined with an aging farming population, has created a production bottleneck. Major beverage companies like Ito En are now creating dedicated divisions to secure supply chains as they face intense competition for the popular product.</p>

          <p>As UK students return to school, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is warning parents about the critical importance of attendance in the first week of term. New data reveals that over half of pupils who missed some school during the first week of the 2024 academic year went on to become "persistently absent," compared to just 14% of those with full attendance. While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains higher than pre-COVID levels. Phillipson urged schools and parents to "double down" on efforts to ensure a strong start to the year to protect students' long-term life chances.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece revisits a 1995 speech by Toni Morrison, arguing that her dissection of fascism's gradual rise is profoundly relevant today. Morrison traced fascism's genealogy not to European analogues but to the history of American racism, its "succubus twin," implicating a broader cultural complicity beyond a single political party. The author suggests that the path to resisting modern authoritarianism lies in the lessons of Black history: a resilient belief in democratic ideals, a multifaceted strategy of resistance, and an abiding faith in the face of systemic oppression. These historical examples provide a powerful model for defending democracy against its current threats.</p>

          <p>While the Democratic Party's public approval ratings have hit a 30-year low, some strategists see reasons for optimism. President Trump's own declining popularity and an energized Democratic base, eager to fight his policies, are creating a potential path for a political rebound. Leaders like California Governor Gavin Newsom are becoming more vocal, and recent polling shows a slight lead for Democrats in generic congressional ballots.

          <p>As Britain experiences hotter summers, the use of home air conditioning is on the rise, sparking a debate about its broader impacts. While providing relief from heat that affects sleep, work, and health, air conditioners contribute to climate change through the use of potent greenhouse gases like HFCs and increase electricity consumption at a time of high energy costs. Experts advise consumers to choose energy-efficient models and dispose of old units properly to mitigate environmental harm. The discussion also touches on potential solutions, such as government incentives for air-to-air heat pumps that can both heat and cool homes efficiently.</p>
