          <p>The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) has informed its foreign partners that it anticipates the C929, China's domestically developed widebody passenger jet, will commence its maiden commercial flight by 2035. This timeline, although more extended than prior projections, aligns with the development timelines of Boeing and Airbus for their initial widebody aircraft. Comac expects the C929, resembling the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 series, to receive certification in China by 2032. The C929, designed to accommodate up to 440 passengers, will feature a maximum range of 12,000km, approximately the distance between Shanghai and New York, marking a significant advancement in China's aviation industry.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are scheduled to sign a peace agreement on June 27, facilitated by the United States, aiming to resolve the conflict in eastern Congo. Technical teams from both countries have already begun drafting the agreement, which is expected to be formally signed in Washington next week, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio attending the ceremony. The peace deal seeks to end the fighting in eastern Congo, where Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have made significant advances, capturing key cities, and includes provisions for respecting territorial integrity, ceasing hostilities, disarming, and integrating non-state armed groups. Previous ceasefires have failed, but the US hopes this agreement will bring stability and economic opportunities to the mineral-rich region.</p>

This discovery sheds light on the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London," and suggests the presence of skilled artists who traveled the Roman empire.

Manager Dave Roberts praised Sheehan's performance, noting his ability to attack the strike zone and keep hitters off balance.

          <p>China has urged the US to "look at the whole picture" regarding tariffs to understand the true nature of their trade ties, as a recently agreed framework to ease trade tensions remains uncertain. Chinese ambassador Xie Feng stated that the trade relationship is "generally balanced" and that tariffs on Chinese imports are "still unreasonably high." He argued that the US goods deficit would not shrink as long as export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms persist. China has expressed a willingness to buy more from America, but notes that US restrictions on exports and investment hinder progress.</p>
