          <p>Former President Trump's repeated calls to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco are creating tension amidst the city's significant post-pandemic resurgence, largely driven by the artificial intelligence boom. Data indicates a 30% drop in crime rates, record-low homicides, and a surge in venture capital funding, particularly in AI. While tourism and real estate are recovering, issues like homelessness and drug use persist in certain areas. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff initially supported Trump's proposal but later retracted his stance, emphasizing the city's improved safety. This article highlights the complex interplay between political rhetoric, urban recovery, and the burgeoning tech sector in San Francisco.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cannabis-infused nonalcoholic beverages are experiencing a surge in popularity across the U.S., coinciding with a decline in alcohol consumption among Americans. Sales of these THC and CBD drinks are projected to reach $5.6 billion by 2035, attracting consumers seeking low-calorie alternatives without hangovers. While major retailers like Target are exploring sales, medical experts caution about potential side effects such as anxiety, paranoia, and memory issues, and the risk of cannabis-use disorder. The expanding market, including traditional alcohol brands, highlights a significant shift in consumer preferences for social beverages, particularly among women in their 30s and 40s.</p>

          <p>A new Los Angeles museum exhibition, 'Monuments,' transforms ten decommissioned Confederate statues into art, challenging the 'Lost Cause' narrative and confronting America's history of white supremacy. The exhibit features a melted Robert E. Lee statue, its bronze recast, and a graffitied equestrian monument of Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Artist Kara Walker's 'Unmanned Drone' reinterprets Jackson as a headless, ghostly figure, symbolizing the deconstruction of historical myths. This powerful artistic statement opens amidst ongoing political debates, including former President Trump's calls to reinstall such monuments, highlighting the contentious nature of historical memory and public symbols.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines Boeing 737 en route from Denver to Los Angeles was forced to make an emergency landing in Salt Lake City after its windscreen cracked mid-flight. The incident, which occurred near Moab, Utah, resulted in the pilot sustaining a bloodied and cut arm. All 140 passengers and crew aboard Flight 1093 landed safely and were subsequently transferred to a different aircraft to continue their journey. The National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation into the cause of the windscreen damage.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking clinical study has demonstrated that a tiny microchip eye implant combined with special glasses, known as the PRIMA system, helped many legally blind patients with geographic atrophy regain the ability to read. The implant, placed under the retina, works with glasses that project images via infrared light, leading to 'meaningful improvement' in visual acuity for 26 out of 32 participants. While the technology is not yet licensed and requires intense concentration, it offers significant hope for the five million people worldwide affected by geographic atrophy, a leading cause of blindness for which previous treatments only slowed progression.</p>

          <p>LeBron James is no longer facing a small claims lawsuit after a fan, Andrew Garcia, withdrew his complaint following a settlement with the fantasy sports app PrizePicks. Garcia had sued to recoup $865.66 spent on Lakers tickets, mistakenly believing James' 'Second Decision' announcement implied his retirement. PrizePicks intervened, depositing the full ticket amount in promo funds into Garcia's account, along with an offer for future game tickets and merchandise. This amicable resolution demonstrates how a company leveraged a viral moment to engage with its users and resolve a public dispute.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the enduring history and intended adaptability of the U.S. Constitution, highlighting its design for continuous amendment via Article V. Historians emphasize that the founders anticipated constant revisions, leading to significant changes like the Bill of Rights and post-Civil War amendments abolishing slavery and granting suffrage. However, concerns are raised that the system's checks and balances are currently faltering, with Congress becoming less effective and the Supreme Court asserting undue power in political matters. Despite these challenges, experts affirm the Constitution's timeless principles remain vital for a free society.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Halloween celebrations are expected to reach a record $13.1 billion in consumer spending this year, but price hikes may make the holiday 'scarier' for wallets. Candy prices, particularly chocolate, have surged due to cocoa prices more than doubling since early 2024, a result of extreme weather impacting West African yields. Additionally, tariffs on imported spirits and Chinese-made costumes contribute to increased costs. Consumers are adapting by embracing budget-friendly strategies like DIY decorations, early shopping, and opting for generic brands to manage their holiday expenses.</p>

          <p>Cleveland-Cliffs, a prominent steelmaker, experienced a more than 20% surge in its shares after CEO Lourenco Goncalves announced the company is exploring rare earths mining. Geological surveys at two sites in Michigan and Minnesota indicate potential for commercially viable deposits. This strategic diversification aligns with the Trump administration's broader national goal to establish a domestic critical mineral supply chain, reducing U.S. dependence on China, which currently dominates the global rare earths market. Investors are anticipating further government support for such domestic ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

This strategic shift underscores the Trump administration's commitment to winning the 'second space race' against China and ensuring multiple avenues for achieving its ambitious space exploration goals.</p>
