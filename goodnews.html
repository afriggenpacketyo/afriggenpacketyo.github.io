          <p>The UK and the US are preparing to sign a significant agreement to accelerate nuclear power development, aiming to create jobs and enhance Britain's energy security. The deal, expected during President Trump's state visit, could unlock billions in private investment. Prime Minister Starmer highlighted the partnership's goal to lead global innovation in nuclear energy, fostering commercial collaborations between UK and US companies. Key proposals include X-Energy and Centrica building advanced modular nuclear reactors in Hartlepool, potentially powering 1.5 million homes and creating thousands of jobs. The agreement also covers fusion energy research and aims to end reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028. Optimism surrounding this agreement is high, with hopes that it will lead to stable energy prices for UK consumers. </p>

          <p>Despite starting the season 0-2, the New York Giants displayed significant improvement in their recent game against the Dallas Cowboys. Quarterback Russell Wilson had an outstanding performance, throwing for 450 yards and three touchdowns, showcasing a strong connection with rookie receiver Malik Nabers. The Giants showed fight and moxie, with rookies like Marcus Mbow and Cam Skattebo making notable contributions, though penalties continued to plague their performance. While the Giants ultimately lost in overtime due to a late interception, the game highlighted emerging stars and a more watchable squad, offering fans a glimmer of hope for the season. The team's progress suggests a potential for more thrilling games ahead, despite the challenging road to the playoffs. </p>

          <p>Data from China's central bank indicates that households are increasingly moving savings into the stock market, suggesting potential for a continued rally. Deposits at non-banking financial institutions rose significantly in August, following a similar increase in July, indicating a shift of capital towards brokerages and mutual-fund companies. The M1 money supply gauge also rose, suggesting money is being primed for investment after conversion from term deposits. Analysts believe low-interest-rate policies are driving this trend, as investors seek better returns than traditional banking deposits offer. Chinese stocks are becoming more attractive due to higher earnings yields compared to government bonds and deposit rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is exploring the possibility of converting existing coal-fired power plants into nuclear facilities, leveraging fourth-generation reactor technology. This initiative, proposed by China Energy Engineering Group Co., Ltd (CEEC), offers a direct path to decarbonization while preserving valuable infrastructure, especially in coastal areas. These reactors could also have a greater chance of meeting site safety requirements and public acceptance. China has over 1.19 terawatts of coal-fired power capacity, with approximately 100 gigawatts expected to retire by 2030. This C2N initiative could be a solution to replace this energy output. </p>
