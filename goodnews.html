          <p>This obituary recounts the life and career of David H. Souter, a former US Supreme Court Justice, highlighting his unexpected shift from a perceived conservative appointment to a key figure in upholding abortion rights. Souter's decision to uphold Roe v Wade in Planned Parenthood v Casey confounded conservatives, leading to a vetting process for ideological purity in future Republican nominees. The obituary details Souter's background, his appointment by George H.W. Bush, and his judicial philosophy rooted in legal positivism and respect for precedent.

          <p>The European Commission has proposed weakening environmental conditions tied to subsidies for farmers, aiming to boost competitiveness and reduce administrative burdens. The proposal comes after farmers across the European Union staged protests over issues including EU regulations and cheap imports. The changes could save farmers up to ‚Ç¨1.58 billion per year and limit on-site checks on farms to once per year. Smaller farmers would be exempted from conditions tying subsidies to environmental regulations, and certified organic farms would be considered as automatically meeting certain environmental regulations. </p>
