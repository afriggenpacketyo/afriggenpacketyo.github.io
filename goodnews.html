          <p>Law enforcement in New Orleans has successfully apprehended Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center six weeks prior. The capture occurred peacefully at a local residence, leaving only one fugitive, Derrick Groves, still at large. The jailbreak, which involved exploiting a faulty cell door, has drawn significant criticism towards the management of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's office. Authorities have also arrested at least 16 individuals accused of assisting the inmates during their escape, and a $50,000 reward remains for information leading to the final capture.</p>

          <p>The BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," created by and starring sister duo Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, is returning for a new series. The show, known for its dark humor, follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial struggles and chaotic relationships. The creators discuss how their all-female upbringing and the "bleak" modern dating scene influence the show's content, which tackles taboo subjects like mental health and abortion. The success of the first series has emboldened them to explore even more depressing, yet humorous, storylines in the follow-up.</p>

          <p>A century-old former Russian Consulate in Hakodate, Hokkaido, is being repurposed as a luxury hotel named Hotel Biaclyn Hakodate. The historic redbrick building, constructed in 1908 and vacant for nearly 30 years, is the only surviving imperial Russian consulate in Japan. After being acquired by a Nagoya-based company in 2021, the building underwent extensive restoration to blend its original Western architecture with modern Japanese design. The hotel aims to preserve a piece of local history while creating a new tourist attraction featuring six high-end suites, private saunas, and fine dining.</p>

          <p>Japanese farmers and chefs are exploring the culinary potential of prickly pear cactus, incorporating it into dishes like tempura, quiche, and pizza. Recognized as a "superfood" rich in minerals and fiber, the cactus is gaining popularity for its health benefits and mild taste. Research from Chubu University suggests it can enhance immune function, and its resilience makes it a promising food source in the face of climate change. Local schools in Kasugai, a city known for cactus cultivation, have even started serving cactus-based meals, signaling a growing acceptance of this unconventional ingredient in Japanese cuisine.</p>

          <p>A BBC correspondent highlights the renewed scientific interest in bacteriophages, or "phages," which are viruses that specifically target and destroy bacteria. This century-old concept, known as phage therapy, is being re-examined as a promising alternative to antibiotics amid the growing crisis of drug-resistant superbugs. The article details a project where individuals can submit samples from their environment to find new phages, with one found in a toilet proving effective against a patient's persistent infection in a lab setting. While challenges remain in bringing phage therapy to mainstream medicine, it represents a hopeful frontier in the fight against untreatable infections.</p>

Using a unique P-band radar frequency, the satellite can penetrate foliage and clouds to measure the amount of carbon stored in tree trunks. This groundbreaking technology will allow scientists to create a global 3D map of forests, offering a much more accurate understanding of their role in mitigating climate change. The initial images have already revealed previously hidden wetlands and concealed deforestation, providing a vital new tool for environmental monitoring and conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, an 18-year-old high school senior from Waunakee, Wisconsin, found a unique way to overcome her social anxiety and reconnect with her peers. Feeling isolated, she spent approximately 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 of her classmates whom she had grown distant from over the years. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with astonishment and appreciation. The project not only helped Schafer feel seen again but also prompted feelings of regret and reflection among her classmates about not paying more attention to others, offering a poignant lesson on connection.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has permanently blocked another of President Trump's executive orders aimed at punishing a prominent law firm, this time targeting Susman Godfrey. This marks the fourth such ruling where a court has found the president's actions unconstitutional. The executive orders sought to penalize firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president by suspending security clearances and ending government contracts. In her ruling, Judge Loren AliKhan described the order as "unconstitutional from beginning to end," reinforcing previous judicial decisions that found the orders to be an attack on the rule of law and the right to legal representation.</p>

The band played fan favorites like "Chocolate" and "Love It If We Made It," demonstrating their tight musicianship.

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the fund from $330 million to $750 million. The move, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, is designed to combat the long-term trend of productions leaving California for other locations with more generous financial benefits. Industry unions and professionals have applauded the decision, arguing it is a crucial step to reverse job losses and bring production back home. The expanded tax credit is seen as vital for maintaining Hollywood's status as the center of the entertainment industry. (not investment advice)</p>
