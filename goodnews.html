Waymo vehicles rely on cameras, sensors, and lidar to operate autonomously, claiming to have fewer crashes than traditional vehicles. The expansion follows recent vandalism incidents against Waymo vehicles during anti-ICE protests in downtown Los Angeles. </p>

          <p>Trump Mobile removed its coverage map shortly after its launch due to the body of water south of Texas being labeled as the Gulf of Mexico instead of the Trump-preferred name, Gulf of America. This issue arose after President Donald Trump signed an executive order renaming the international body of water, a name other countries reject. The Trump family licensed its name to the U.S. mobile service, which appears to have used T-Mobile's network data for its coverage map. The map stirred up chatter across social media before being removed. </p>

          <p>A $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family over the opioid crisis has garnered support from 55 attorneys general across the country. The settlement would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue and block the family from selling opioids in the U.S. The funds will be distributed over 15 years to compensate victims and abate the opioid crisis. The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. </p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was unlawful. Judge William Young stated that the cuts, targeting research with a perceived connection to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, represented unlawful discrimination. He ordered the reinstatement of grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said that the agency stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor. </p>
