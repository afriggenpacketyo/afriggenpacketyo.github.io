        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metropolitan Police has announced it will no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents, aiming to redirect officer focus to criminal matters. This policy change follows the controversial arrest of "Father Ted" creator Graham Linehan, whose case related to social media posts has now been dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service. The move is intended to provide clearer direction for officers and prevent them from policing "toxic culture war debates," according to a Met spokesperson. Non-crime hate incidents are acts perceived as motivated by prejudice but do not meet the criminal threshold.</p>

          <p>Millions of people participated in the "No Kings" demonstrations across the United States to protest the Trump administration, with the events remaining remarkably peaceful despite some Republican leaders predicting violence. The marches, organized by a coalition of liberal groups, were characterized by a mix of serious political messaging and irreverent humor, featuring a wide array of creative signs and costumes. The article suggests that this broad, diverse coalition is unified by a shared opposition to the administration's policies. The peaceful nature of the protests defied expectations of conflict and resulted in very few arrests.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Los Angeles is displaying decommissioned Confederate statues, including a melted-down monument of General Robert E. Lee from Charlottesville, as a way to re-contextualize their controversial history. The "Monuments" show at the Museum of Contemporary Art places these figures, who fought to preserve slavery, alongside contemporary art to challenge the "Lost Cause" ideology. Curators and activists involved argue that the exhibit confronts the narrative of white supremacy that these statues represent. The initiative comes as President Trump has ordered the reinstallation of similar monuments, highlighting the ongoing national debate over American history.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging the federal law that prohibits regular users of illegal drugs, including marijuana, from owning firearms. The case was brought by the Trump administration after a lower appeals court ruled in favor of a man charged with felony gun possession who acknowledged being a regular marijuana user. The central question is whether this prohibition is consistent with the Second Amendment, especially following the court's 2022 Bruen decision that expanded gun rights. The outcome could affect hundreds of prosecutions annually and clarify the constitutional limits on firearm restrictions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two major European clinical trials have found that a proprietary cannabis oil tincture provided better pain relief for low back pain compared to both a placebo and opioids. In one study, patients using the cannabis blend experienced fewer gastrointestinal side effects and reported better relief over six months than those taking opioids. While U.S.-based researchers consider the findings "groundbreaking," the specific full-spectrum cannabis oil, VER-01, is not yet approved in the United States. The research adds significant evidence to the debate on using medical cannabis as a viable alternative for chronic pain management.</p>

          <p>Despite facing challenges like tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions, the U.S. automotive industry has proven more resilient than many analysts initially predicted for 2025.

However, uncertainty persists due to slowing consumer income growth and the ongoing government shutdown, creating a cautious outlook as major automakers prepare to report third-quarter earnings.

The advice includes submitting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with deferential language, and oversharing information to satisfy their need for oversight. Other techniques involve preemptively asking for feedback to get ahead of criticism and directly asking for positive reinforcement to balance the focus on adjustments. These methods aim to manage the dynamic by catering to the boss's psychological needs, thereby creating a less frustrating work environment for the employee.</p>
