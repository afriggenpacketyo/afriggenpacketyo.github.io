          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao, marking the end of one of the agency's last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal coincides with the Trump administration's efforts to demonstrate its support for the crypto industry, including the Justice Department shutting down its crypto enforcement team. Binance is also expanding its operations in Pakistan and deepening ties with World Liberty Financial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A California court has sided with the California Coastal Commission, ordering Sable Offshore Corp. to halt construction and repairs on offshore oil pipelines until it obtains necessary permits. The ruling upholds a cease and desist order issued by the commission, which argues that Sable violated the Coastal Act by performing work without approvals. Sable insists it is operating under original permits from the 1980s and plans to appeal the judge's decision. The ruling follows Sable's announcement that it had resumed oil production, sparking outrage from environmentalists and state officials.</p>
