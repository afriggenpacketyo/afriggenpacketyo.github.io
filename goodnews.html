          <p>Britain and the European Union have announced a significant agreement aimed at resetting their relationship after the UK's departure from the bloc in 2020. The deal encompasses various sectors, including security, energy, trade, travel, and fisheries, and is viewed by British officials as a "historic day" that marks a "new chapter" following years of strained relations post-Brexit. The agreement seeks to reduce trade barriers, enhance security cooperation, extend fishing rights for EU trawlers in UK waters until 2038, and streamline travel for British holidaymakers through the use of eGates at EU airports.

          <p>The Democratic primary for mayor of Pittsburgh has evolved into a significant battleground reflecting the broader ideological struggle within the Democratic Party. Incumbent Mayor Ed Gainey, a progressive, faces a challenge from Corey O‚ÄôConnor, a more centrist candidate with strong ties to the city's establishment. The race highlights divisions over issues like affordable housing and the role of large non-profit institutions, with outside groups pouring money into the election to test messages and influence voters. The outcome of the primary is likely to shape the city's direction and provide insights into the Democratic Party's future trajectory.</p>

          <p>Portugal's governing center-right coalition secured a victory in the snap election, but failed to achieve a majority amidst a surge in support for the hard-right Chega party.

The outcome signals rising discontent with established political parties and highlights the evolving political landscape in Portugal, where the hard right had previously struggled to gain traction.</p>
