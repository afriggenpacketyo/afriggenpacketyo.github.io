          <p>Swiss brand On is emerging as a global challenger in the sportswear market, reporting a significant increase in net sales. Analysts attribute the brand's success to innovative products and strategic timing, capturing market share from legacy competitors like Nike and Adidas. On's unique shoe aesthetic and ability to fill retail space during Nike and Adidas' challenges have contributed to its growth. While Nike is implementing a turnaround plan, On faces tariff uncertainty due to its manufacturing in Vietnam. </p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments, as confirmed by the NHS. These clinics will be open to walk-in patients and referrals, staffed by specialists to treat acute mental distress. NHS England aims to provide appropriate care in a calm environment, avoiding long A&E waits. While the scheme is expected to expand nationally, some experts express skepticism and emphasize the need for proper funding and testing. </p>

          <h2>Record Number of Americans Seeking UK Residency</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 10:02:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Office reports a record number of Americans seeking residency, with over 6,000 applying for citizenship or indefinite leave to remain in the year leading up to March. The surge in applications, particularly at the start of 2025, coincides with Donald Trump's second presidency and increasing inquiries from American immigration lawyers. While the UK is attempting to reduce overall immigration, the increase in US applications may be driven by factors such as spousal or family links, as well as the polarized political climate in the US. </p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that America‚Äôs next-generation fighter jets and their ‚Äúloyal wingmen‚Äù drones could counter China‚Äôs fleet size advantage in the Indo-Pacific. The US Air Force is developing unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) as part of its collaborative combat aircraft program (CCA). These drones aim to augment crewed fighter aircraft in air-to-air missions. Ground testing of the initial CCA designs has begun, with production expected in 2026. </p>

          <p>Veterinary epidemiologist Stephanie Venn-Watson discovered a new essential fatty acid, C15:0, while studying aging dolphins. She found that dolphins with higher levels of C15:0 lived longer and healthier lives. Venn-Watson and her husband developed a C15:0 supplement for humans and published a book about her findings. To increase her intake of C15:0, Venn-Watson eats whole fat dairy, which contains C15:0. </p>
