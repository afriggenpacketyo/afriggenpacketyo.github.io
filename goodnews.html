          <p>New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr, 34, has announced his retirement from professional football due to a labral tear and degenerative changes in his right shoulder. Acquired by the Saints in 2023, Carr struggled with injuries and inconsistent performance, leading to the team drafting Tyler Shough as a potential replacement. Carr expressed gratitude to his teammates, coaches, and fans, stating he gave his all during his 11-year career, which included 4 Pro Bowl selections. With Carr's retirement, Shough and other younger quarterbacks will have an opportunity to compete for the starting position, and the Saints may consider bringing in a veteran QB through free agency.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng led the discussions, with the hope of scaling back the tariffs to relieve financial markets and companies reliant on U.S.-China trade.
