          <p>Kesha released a new cover for her single "Delusional" after facing criticism for initially using AI-generated artwork. The original cover, featuring misspelled words and brown handbags, was intended to convey the undervaluation of artists. Kesha explained that she decided to change the cover to align with her integrity, opting for a photograph of herself by Brendan Walter and crediting her team of human artists. The new artwork features Kesha zip-tied to a chair, symbolizing her commitment to human creativity over AI, and the song is part of her upcoming album "Period."</p>

          <p>The ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes has come into effect across the UK, aiming to protect children's health and reduce environmental waste. The ban targets the rising rates of youth vaping, with disposable vapes often cited as a key driver. While vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to address youth vaping. Retailers violating the ban face fines, and similar bans have been introduced in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p>Patti LuPone has issued an apology following an open letter from hundreds of Broadway performers criticizing her comments about Kecia Lewis and Audra McDonald. The letter condemned LuPone's remarks as "inappropriate and unacceptable," particularly her disrespectful language towards Lewis, a Black actress. The controversy stemmed from a noise dispute between the theaters where LuPone and Lewis were performing, and LuPone's subsequent criticism of Lewis and McDonald in an interview. LuPone expressed regret for her "flippant and emotional responses" and committed to making amends with the Broadway community.</p>

          <p>A scientist based in Singapore has warned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, could be vulnerable to hacking due to slight delays between its onboard lasers.

Quantum communication, which relies on encoding data in photons, is theoretically unhackable, but flaws in implementation can create vulnerabilities.</p>
