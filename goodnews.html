        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, *The Age of Diagnosis: How Our Obsession With Medical Labels Is Making Us Sicker*, argues that doctors are too quick to diagnose patients with medical problems, leading to potential harm. The author advocates for ‚Äúslow medicine,‚Äù emphasizing the importance of building doctor-patient relationships, monitoring symptoms, and exercising caution before labeling a condition. Overdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary treatments and increased anxiety, so a measured approach is essential. While slowing down could risk missing aggressive diseases, the book suggests that doctors often err too far toward overdiagnosis.</p>

Onosato expressed that he felt no pressure during the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament and dedicated his championship to the people affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake.

Prime Minister Mark Carney invited the King to formally open the parliament, a move seen as underscoring Canada's sovereignty amid strained ties with the United States.

          <p>An Austrian court has overturned the perjury conviction of former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who had previously received an eight-month suspended jail sentence for giving false testimony. The court panel acquitted Kurz after his appeal, reversing the earlier verdict related to statements he made to a parliamentary inquiry in 2020. Kurz had downplayed his role in appointing executives for the √ñBAG state holding company, leading to the initial conviction. He is still under investigation for corruption in a separate case.</p>
