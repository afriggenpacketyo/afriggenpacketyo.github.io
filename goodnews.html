        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce commented that the controversial "tush push" play will be under intense scrutiny from NFL referees going forward due to widespread criticism. Speaking on his podcast, Kelce warned that officials will be actively looking for any reason to penalize the play, such as offensive linemen lining up in the neutral zone or false starting. He defended his former teammates, stating that any early movement is an attempt to perfectly time the snap, not a deliberate effort to gain an unfair advantage. The play remains a major topic of debate among fans and analysts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the UK has become a showcase of "fashion diplomacy," with the sartorial choices of the First Lady and the Royal Family drawing significant attention. Melania Trump's attire, including a wide-brimmed purple hat and a classic Burberry trench coat, was seen as a nod to both her support for her husband and respect for British design. Meanwhile, the Princess of Wales and Queen Camilla also wore outfits by British designers, with color choices that appeared coordinated to reflect the US flag. These carefully selected ensembles are viewed by experts as powerful tools for sending diplomatic messages during high-stakes international events.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. household debt reaching record levels, many Americans are struggling with payments that exceed their income. This article outlines several strategies for managing overwhelming debt beyond simple budgeting. Options include debt consolidation, which combines multiple debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate, and debt management plans offered by credit counseling agencies to reduce rates and fees. For more severe situations, debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed, while bankruptcy can offer a complete financial reset as a last resort.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, setting the new target range between 4% and 4.25%. This marks the first rate reduction since December 2024 and comes as a response to a slowing labor market and concerns about weakening economic growth. Fed officials also projected two additional cuts in 2025, signaling a strategic shift to support employment amid what they now see as rising downside risks. The decision aims to encourage consumer spending and business investment while continuing to manage inflation, which remains above the central bank's 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the enterprise software company Workday rose by 7% after activist investor Elliott Investment Management disclosed a $2 billion stake. The announcement came after Workday revealed a multi-year plan to improve its operating model and capital allocation, a strategy that Elliott publicly supported as a driver for long-term value creation. Workday, which provides cloud-based software for finance and human resources, has seen its stock decline by roughly 9% year-to-date. The investment from a prominent activist firm signals confidence in the company's new strategic direction and leadership team. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Study Links Vitamin B3 Supplement to Reduced Risk of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study of nearly 34,000 veterans suggests that nicotinamide, a form of Vitamin B3, is associated with a lower risk of non-melanoma skin cancers in people with a prior history of the disease. Researchers found that patients who took a 500 mg supplement twice daily saw a significant risk reduction, particularly for squamous cell carcinoma. The most substantial benefit was observed in individuals who began taking the supplement after their first skin cancer diagnosis. These findings reinforce previous research and are prompting more dermatologists to recommend the widely available, over-the-counter supplement for secondary prevention.</p>

          <p>A dive team has identified a shipwreck located 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a World War I-era fishing boat that sank in a storm in January 1929. The vessel, which went down with 21 crew members aboard, was last seen sailing from New London, Connecticut. The discovery was made by Atlantic Wreck Salvage, which used sonar scans and diver observations of the ship's distinctive features, like its steam engine and trawl winch, to confirm its identity. The company hopes the finding will provide a measure of closure to the descendants of the men who were lost.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump was honored with a state banquet at Windsor Castle, a key diplomatic event during his visit to the UK. The guest list was notably heavy on political figures and technology executives, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, but lacked major entertainment celebrities. The seating arrangement placed President Trump between King Charles and the Princess of Wales. The elaborate event in St George's Hall is a traditional part of a state visit, designed to strengthen diplomatic ties through high-level hospitality, complete with royal toasts, fanfares, and fine dining.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act, is moving through Congress with the aim of protecting seniors and other vulnerable adults from financial abuse. The legislation would allow financial institutions, such as mutual fund companies, to delay transactions if they suspect a client is being exploited. The proposal, which has versions in both the House and Senate, also requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to report to Congress on further ways to prevent such abuse. Elder financial fraud is a significant issue, with older adults losing an estimated $28.3 billion annually to these schemes.</p>

          <p>Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organization, offered a surprisingly optimistic perspective on the global trade disruptions caused by President Trump's unilateral tariffs. Speaking at a WTO forum, she framed the challenges as an opportunity to rebalance supply chains, open new markets, and foster a new era of "reglobalisation." While acknowledging the system has been heavily disrupted, she pushed back against claims that the WTO is irrelevant, stating that nearly three-quarters of global commerce still operates under its rules. She expressed excitement about the potential for the trade system to evolve and adapt.</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle responded to comments from United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, who recently declared the ultra-low-cost carrier model dead. Biffle dismissed the criticism as "cute," arguing that the U.S. currently has a flight oversupply issue and that Frontier's lower operating costs give it a competitive advantage. The exchange highlights the intense pressure on budget airlines, which are struggling with higher costs, increased competition from major carriers' basic economy fares, and the recent bankruptcy of Spirit Airlines. Biffle asserted that Frontier serves a valuable market of price-conscious travelers.</p>
