          <p>The iconic 1950 film "Sunset Boulevard" is being celebrated on its 75th anniversary, recognized for its dark, witty, and groundbreaking portrayal of Hollywood. The article reflects on the film's legacy through interviews with 97-year-old original cast member Nancy Olson, and discusses its enduring themes of fame and obsolescence. It also covers the story's successful adaptations, including Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical and a recent Tony-winning Broadway revival starring Nicole Scherzinger. The piece highlights how the film's cynical yet truthful narrative continues to resonate with audiences and creators decades later.</p>

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following criticism that a shoe he designed in collaboration with Adidas culturally appropriated traditional Mexican huaraches. The "Oaxaca Slip-On" was reportedly made without consulting or crediting the Indigenous artisans who originated the woven leather sandal design, drawing condemnation from figures including the Mexican president. Chavarria expressed deep regret for not partnering with the Oaxacan community, and promotional images of the shoe have been removed. Adidas is reportedly in contact with Mexican officials to discuss restitution for the community.</p>

          <p>Branding expert and self-described introvert Goldie Chan advises that developing a personal brand is a key strategy for introverts to advance their careers. Chan argues that a personal brand, defined as what people know you for professionally, allows introverts to shape their own narrative and showcase their talents without being overlooked. She suggests starting with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month or posting online weekly, to build confidence and presence. The article emphasizes that branding isn't just online; engaging in offline groups and hobbies also helps build a unique and effective professional identity.</p>

          <p>Central Beijing was closed to the public as China conducted a large-scale rehearsal for a military parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of its victory over Japan in World War II. The rehearsal, which took place overnight near Tiananmen Square, was intended to test the organizational and command operations for the main event scheduled for September 3. The full parade will proceed along Changan Avenue and through Tiananmen Square, where President Xi Jinping is expected to be in attendance. The event marks what China refers to as its triumph over Japanese invasion and the global victory against fascism.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 10:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biographical analysis, "Electric Spark," re-examines the work of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her acclaimed wit is deeply rooted in her Roman Catholic faith. The article posits that Spark, often listed among top comic writers, was one of modern Britain's most significant religious authors, using narrative structure to explore themes of divine judgment and human fallibility. Her novels, influenced by the Book of Job, often employ an omniscient, god-like narrator to create absurdist scenarios that reflect the collision between God's unknowable will and human shortsightedness. This perspective challenges the common view of Spark as purely a satirist of social manners.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte stated that the upcoming summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will serve as an important "test" of Putin's seriousness in ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking to ABC News, Rutte emphasized the need to acknowledge Ukraine's sovereignty and its right to determine its own geopolitical future, expressing his belief that President Trump supports these principles. Rutte acknowledged the complex reality of Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine, noting that discussions will need to address security guarantees for Ukraine moving forward from any potential ceasefire.</p>

          <p>An American couple, Jason and Katie Lee, quit their jobs and moved with their young son to Taipei, Taiwan, for a 13-month sabbatical after saving $60,000 over five years. The primary motivation was to allow their son to bond with his paternal grandparents and for the family to experience a different pace of life. The career break has allowed them to focus on personal health and re-evaluate their career goals, realizing they can live happily on less than their previous incomes. Their sabbatical has been transformative, and the family is now preparing to return to the U.S. with a newborn daughter.</p>

          <p>As generative AI empowers cyberattackers with more sophisticated tools, corporations are increasingly drafting AI agents into their defensive forces. These autonomous AI teammates are being used to automate routine cybersecurity tasks like detection, analysis, and responding to alerts, freeing up human analysts to focus on more critical threats. Experts believe this technology is essential for defenders to keep pace with AI-driven attacks, such as highly realistic phishing emails. While not seen as a replacement for human workers, AI agents are augmenting cybersecurity teams, helping to address the industry's talent shortage and reduce burnout from mundane tasks.</p>

          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," is a weird and wild take on the historical witch-hunt narrative, set in 18th-century Oxfordshire. The story centers on five strange, inseparable sisters who are accused of transforming into dogs, a rumor that incites fear and rage in their drought-stricken village. The article analyzes how the novel directly engages with the subtext of witch stories, where powerful femininity itself is perceived as a menace. While the book's themes can sometimes feel predictable, its lush, violent prose and satirical take on the cultural fear of women's bodies offer a fresh perspective on a well-worn genre.</p>

Americans can stay in Albania for up to a year without a visa, making it an ideal place to "test drive" expat life. The cost of living is a fraction of that in the U.S., with comfortable apartments available for under $500 a month. The country also boasts a growing expat community, a pro-American sentiment among locals, and a landscape ranging from the Albanian Alps to the Adriatic coast.</p>

          <p>This year, 19 U.S. states are offering sales tax holidays, providing shoppers with temporary relief from state and sometimes local taxes on specific items like back-to-school supplies. While politically popular, tax experts argue the benefits are often overstated, as consumers may simply shift the timing of planned purchases rather than boosting overall economic activity. Wealthier taxpayers with flexible spending habits may benefit most, but the holidays are also a key money-saving tool for many middle- and lower-income families planning for large, essential purchases.

          <p>A schoolboy in Scotland made a remarkable historical discovery, finding the wreckage of a 275-year-old ship on a beach in the Orkney Islands. The ship's hull was uncovered after a storm, and community-led research identified it as the whaling ship Earl of Chatham, which sank in 1788. Further investigation revealed the vessel was originally the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy ship built in 1749 that was active during the Seven Years' War and the American Revolution. Archaeologists consider the find significant due to the ship's long service life and the extensive archival material available to confirm its identity.</p>

          <p>This article explores the concept of negativity bias, the evolutionary trait that hardwires humans to focus on threats and bad news, often obscuring real, tangible progress in the world. Despite a constant media deluge of negative headlines, the piece points to significant positive developments, such as a potential historic low in the U.S. murder rate and fewer global deaths from extreme weather. The author argues that focusing solely on what is broken can lead to despair and inaction. Embracing realistic optimism, by contrast, is a necessary tool for acknowledging and solving the world's major problems.</p>

          <p>Scientists have confirmed that a meteorite fragment that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, is approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than planet Earth. The object, a type of stony meteorite called a chondrite, created a loud boom and was seen as a fireball across the state before landing. Researchers at the University of Georgia analyzed fragments from the home and determined their ancient origins from the early solar system. The discovery marks the 27th meteorite recovered from Georgia, with experts noting that modern technology is helping recover them more frequently.</p>
