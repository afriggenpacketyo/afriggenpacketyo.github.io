          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 08:36:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Technology firm Oracle is reportedly part of a consortium involved in a framework deal to allow TikTok to continue its U.S. operations. The agreement, being negotiated between the Trump administration and China, aims to resolve national security concerns that led to a threatened ban of the popular video app. While the final structure remains unclear, the deal would address U.S. worries over data privacy and Chinese influence over the platform's algorithm, with both President Trump and President Xi expected to discuss the final terms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified what may be the world's oldest known mummies, dating back as far as 12,000 years, in various sites across Southeast Asia. The study suggests that ancient hunter-gatherer communities practiced smoke-drying bodies over fires, a form of mummification that predates previously known examples, like those of the Chinchorro people in South America, by thousands of years. This practice likely allowed people to maintain physical and spiritual connections with their deceased ancestors, reflecting a deeply human desire to keep loved ones close.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed confidence that a trade agreement with China is likely to be reached before a November deadline for new reciprocal tariffs. In a recent interview, Bessent stated that negotiations have become increasingly productive and that the Chinese side now sees a deal as possible. The administration aims to rebalance the trade relationship and significantly narrow the U.S. trade deficit with China, which stood at nearly $300 billion in 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's credible willingness to let TikTok be banned in the U.S. was the critical factor that advanced negotiations for a deal with China. Bessent explained that this firm stance on national security "turned the tide," pushing forward a framework agreement involving TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and a consortium of investors including Oracle. The administration has a September 17 deadline to finalize the divestiture, aiming to resolve concerns over data security and Chinese influence.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," which will create a legal "duty of candour" for public officials during investigations into major disasters. The legislation, championed for years by the families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster, aims to end a culture of cover-ups by making it a criminal offense for officials to fail to cooperate or be truthful. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the law will serve not only the Hillsborough families but also victims of other state-related scandals.</p>

          <h2>'Job Hugging' Trend Emerges as Workers Cling to Current Roles in Uncertain Economy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 08:15:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a cooling labor market, a phenomenon known as "job hugging" has emerged, with workers increasingly choosing to stay in their current positions rather than seeking new opportunities. The voluntary quits rate has fallen to its lowest sustained level since 2016, driven by economic uncertainty and a slower pace of hiring. Career experts advise that while staying put can feel safer, employees should avoid complacency and actively seek internal growth opportunities, build skills, and expand their professional networks to remain valuable and prepared for when the market eventually improves.</p>

          <p>World Athletics has stated it will "remind" the British team of its rules prohibiting religious and political slogans during competition after sprinter Jeremiah Azu wore a headband reading '100% Jesus'. The 24-year-old wore the headband during the men's 100m semi-finals at the World Championships in Tokyo. While no immediate sanction was issued, the governing body's statement serves as a warning ahead of Azu's potential participation in the upcoming 4x100m relay, highlighting the fine line between personal expression and sporting regulations.</p>

          <p>Luckin Coffee, the chain that surpassed Starbucks in China, is now expanding into the U.S. with five initial locations in New York City. The company operates with a cashierless model, relying on a mobile app for orders and employing an aggressive discounting strategy with frequent coupons to attract customers. Despite a past accounting fraud scandal that led to its delisting from the Nasdaq, Luckin has rebounded with new leadership and rapid growth, aiming to build brand awareness in its rival's home market, even if it means operating its initial stores at a loss.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical overview of Zionism, tracing its origins to the late 19th century as a nationalist movement akin to others emerging in Europe at the time. It emphasizes that the movement was never monolithic, containing diverse and often competing viewpoints on religion, politics, and the ultimate goal of a Jewish polity, which was not always envisioned as a state. The analysis also notes the early movement's significant blind spot regarding the existing Arab population in Palestine, a tendency that would shape the future of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history of free speech, arguing that it is not a timeless, absolute ideal but a dangerous and context-dependent concept that has always been contested. Historian Fara Dabhoiwala explains that speech is a form of action with real-world consequences, and its meaning is shaped by power dynamics and who is speaking. The modern American absolutist view, rooted in 18th-century political tracts, is an exception globally and struggles to address the challenges of the digital age, where platform algorithms have immense power to amplify or suppress voices.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump cannot remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook from her position, delivering a blow to the administration's efforts to influence the central bank. The 2-1 decision allows Cook, a Biden appointee, to participate in the upcoming policy meeting where an interest rate cut is expected. Trump had attempted to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, but the case is seen as a major test of the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference.
