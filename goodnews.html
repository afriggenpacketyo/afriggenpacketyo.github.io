          <p>China's private firms are set to gain new legal recourse with the implementation of the Private Economy Promotion Law, effective May 20. This legislation aims to provide a tangible demonstration of Beijing's support for the private economy. Observers and entrepreneurs are closely monitoring how the law will empower firms to challenge local governments in court and protect them from arbitrary fines. The law forbids the use of administrative measures to intervene in economic disputes, as well as unscrupulous, profit-driven fine collections and asset seizures.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is strategically using an upcoming visit from King Charles III to assert Canada's sovereignty amidst strained relations with the US. Carney announced the King's visit, coinciding with his first official visit to the White House after the federal election. The invitation is a deliberate nod to Trump's past remarks about making Canada the 51st US state, and a recognition of Trump's admiration for the Royal Family. Carney also emphasized his commitment to strengthening relationships with reliable trading partners and addressing domestic concerns about the cost of living and community safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, calling it an attack on the American legal system. The order, which imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients and causes disliked by Trump, was permanently blocked by Judge Beryl Howell. The judge framed the targeting of Perkins Coie as an assault on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. Perkins Coie welcomed the ruling, affirming core constitutional freedoms.</p>

          <p>The White House clarified that President Trump's announcement to rename November 11 as "Victory Day for World War I" was intended as an additional proclamation, not a replacement of Veterans Day. The initial announcement caused confusion, as establishing a federal holiday or observance requires congressional approval.
