        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major three-year study has clinically proven that specially designed group singing classes are highly effective in treating new mothers with postnatal depression. These unique sessions, which incorporate a mix of lullabies, folk, and gospel songs from various cultures, not only foster crucial social connections among participants but also significantly reduce stress. Researchers observed that the positive effects, including a decline in stress hormone levels, continued for six months beyond the program's conclusion. This successful initiative, Melodies for Mums, has expanded across the UK and is now being explored by the World Health Organization for international implementation, offering a promising and cost-effective alternative or complement to existing mental health support for new mothers.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Paralympic swimmer Jess Smith found that AI image generators initially struggled to accurately depict her missing arm, often creating a woman with two arms or a prosthetic. This highlighted inherent biases in AI, reflecting societal inequalities due to insufficient diverse data. However, upon a recent attempt, ChatGPT successfully generated an accurate image, marking a significant step forward for disability representation in technology. While progress is noted, other individuals with disabilities, like Naomi Bowman, still encounter issues where AI alters their features, underscoring the ongoing need for rigorous training and broader datasets to ensure fair and inclusive AI development.</p>

          <p>Comedian Marc Maron concluded his seminal podcast, "WTF With Marc Maron," after a 16-year run and nearly 1,700 episodes, marking the end of an era for the influential interview format. The final interview was with Barack Obama, a decade after their first groundbreaking conversation. Maron, who evolved from a struggling comedian to a respected actor and interviewer, built a career on vulnerability, fostering deep, candid discussions with guests from comedy, music, and politics in his garage. While proud of the show's impact, Maron expressed a desire to reclaim personal time, reflecting on the medium's evolution and the rise of troubling content like the "manosphere."</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to President Trump's characterization of him as "not the easiest guy to deal with," stating he hopes the remark stems from his unwavering toughness on issues critical to Israel's future. Netanyahu emphasized his responsibility to protect the Jewish state, citing 3,500 years of persecution and his actions against Iran, including "historic action" to prevent atomic threats. Trump's full comment, however, concluded by praising Netanyahu as "great" for his steadfastness. This exchange highlights the complex dynamic between the two leaders and Netanyahu's commitment to Israel's security.</p>

          <p>Wildlife photographer Wim van den Heever won the Wildlife Photographer of the Year award for his image of a brown hyena in Namibia's abandoned diamond mining town of Kolmanskop. The elusive brown hyena, the rarest species, took ten years to capture on camera, highlighting its solitary, nocturnal nature. The annual exhibition at London's Natural History Museum showcases this and other winning entries, including images of beetles facing habitat loss, peppered moray eels, and an orb-weaver spider. These photographs collectively emphasize critical environmental issues like habitat destruction, wetland preservation, and marine ecosystem vulnerability, alongside celebrating the natural world's beauty.</p>

          <p>The Republic of Ireland secured a vital 1-0 win against Armenia in a World Cup qualifier, with Evan Ferguson scoring the decisive goal. The match's turning point came when Armenia captain Tigran Barseghyan was dismissed for headbutting Ireland midfielder Finn Azaz, who described the opponent as having "lost his head." This numerical advantage allowed Ireland to break the deadlock and earn their first qualifying victory, moving them to third in Group F. Despite the nervy win, the team aims to build confidence for upcoming crucial matches, including a challenging encounter against Portugal, as they vie for a play-off spot.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is aggressively pivoting towards vertical integration, expanding into chipmaking and hardware development to control every aspect of its AI business. CEO Sam Altman announced a partnership with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators optimized for OpenAI's models, slated for deployment in late 2026. This strategy, akin to Apple's M-series chips, aims for deeper control over the entire technology stack. Concurrently, OpenAI's acquisition of Jony Ive's startup, io, signals a push into consumer hardware, exploring AI-native devices beyond traditional screens. These blockbuster deals, including massive investments in Nvidia and AMD systems, are part of the "Stargate" campaign, positioning OpenAI as a dominant force in AI infrastructure and ecosystem development.

          <p>NBA star Tyrese Haliburton, once a Milwaukee Brewers fan, is now actively rooting against them in the NLCS due to an alleged snub. Haliburton claims the Brewers canceled his ceremonial first pitch last summer after his Indiana Pacers eliminated the Milwaukee Bucks from the 2024 NBA playoffs. Since then, he has publicly worn jerseys of teams playing against the Brewers, including the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers. This personal anecdote highlights the intense loyalties and rivalries within professional sports. Despite his efforts, the Brewers remain in contention for a World Series berth, facing the Dodgers in the NL Championship Series.</p>

          <p>The article explores the evolving identity of urban professional women in China, exemplified by the social media phenomenon of "Tracy" transforming back into "Cuihua" when returning to her rural hometown for Lunar New Year. This contrast masks a deeper narrative of Chinese women rewriting their future after decades of struggle. The 1950 Marriage Law, China's first post-Republic law, committed to "equal rights for men and women," laying a foundational, though often challenged, framework for their progress. The article suggests a significant societal shift is underway, as women navigate their modern identities while retaining connections to their traditional roots and family expectations.</p>

Edge, known for his work on Southern food and culture, has released a new memoir, "House of Smoke: A Southerner Goes Searching for Home," delving into his own troubled family history.
