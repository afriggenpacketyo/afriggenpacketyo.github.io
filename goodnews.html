          <p>Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized with broken bones and other injuries after his vehicle was struck from behind at high speed in New Hampshire. According to state police, a Honda driven by a 19-year-old woman hit the back of a Ford that Giuliani was riding in. Before the crash, Giuliani had reportedly assisted a woman who was a victim of domestic violence, contacting 911 and remaining on the scene until officers arrived. Giuliani's son, Andrew, thanked people for their support after the crash, while authorities confirmed that the incident was not a targeted attack.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a downturn as investors assessed a U.S. federal appeals court ruling that deemed most of former President Donald Trump's "reciprocal tariffs illegal." The court ruled that Trump exceeded his presidential authority by imposing levies on virtually every country as part of his April 2 announcement. Investors are also monitoring developments in India-China relations, with leaders from both countries emphasizing their partnership. Chinese shares are under scrutiny, particularly Alibaba Group, following a surge in stock value after better-than-expected earnings results.</p>

          <p>Despite current US-China tensions, the American Volunteer Group (AVG), also known as the Flying Tigers, are still revered in China for their contributions during World War II. The AVG, comprised of American pilots and support personnel, helped defend China against Japan in the early 1940s. The daughter and granddaughter of the Flying Tigers' founder were invited to a military parade in Beijing commemorating the end of World War II. The Flying Tigers are credited with destroying as many as 497 Japanese planes while losing only 73, establishing a lasting legacy of camaraderie between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump's administration has significantly altered the decor of the Oval Office, adding numerous gold accents and increasing the number of paintings of presidential predecessors. Trump described the room as needing "a little life" and personally oversaw the addition of gold trimming across the ceiling, door frames, and fireplace. The changes have been met with mixed reactions, with some praising the room as a symbol of America's new golden age, while others criticize it as gaudy. The White House stated that Trump personally paid for the gold additions.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.1 billion, making it the game's fifth-largest prize. No one matched all six winning numbers on Saturday, but nine tickets across the U.S. matched all five white balls, with four of those tickets sold in California. The winner of Monday’s jackpot can choose between periodic payments totaling an estimated $1.1 billion or a lump sum estimated at $498.4 million.

          <p>Young Chinese professionals and entrepreneurs are increasingly seeking opportunities in Southeast Asia, with Malaysia being a popular destination. These individuals are drawn to the region by the perception of greater venture capital opportunities and a more favorable business environment compared to China. One Chinese entrepreneur cited easier access to venture capital and increased investor attention as key factors in his decision to relocate to Malaysia. This trend reflects a shift in career and business aspirations among some segments of China's younger generation.</p>

The rover will search for water and measure radiation levels on the lunar surface in preparation for future manned missions. The 35kg rover is scheduled to launch in 2029 and will land on the Moon's south polar region, one of the most inhospitable places on the lunar surface. The rover will demonstrate Canadian technology and contribute to a broader strategy of moving humanity off the Earth.</p>

          <p>The final phase of an expansion of publicly funded childcare support has begun in England, allowing more parents to access 30 hours of childcare per week. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a "landmark moment" for working families, but parents are facing long waiting lists due to staff shortages at nurseries. Some parents are even adjusting their C-section dates to meet funding eligibility criteria. Research suggests that workforce issues, including low pay, could hinder the delivery of the promised childcare offer.</p>

          <p>A global surge in matcha consumption is straining supply chains in Japan, leading to low supplies and high prices. Japan's exports of green tea have quadrupled in the last decade, with a significant portion heading to the U.S. as matcha powder. The Japanese government is considering subsidizing farmers to encourage them to dedicate more fields to tencha, the type of tea used to make matcha. However, labor-intensive harvesting and milling processes are creating bottlenecks, and some shops are rationing supply to cope with the demand.</p>

          <p>Two high school seniors, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, made a groundbreaking discovery by creating a new trigonometry-based proof of the Pythagorean Theorem, a problem that stumped mathematicians for centuries. The students, from St. Mary's Academy in New Orleans, independently developed their proofs as part of a school math contest. Their work has garnered international attention and challenged the long-held belief that a trigonometric proof of the theorem was impossible. The students have since submitted further proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem and are being celebrated for their mathematical achievement.</p>
