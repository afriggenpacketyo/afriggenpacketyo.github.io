          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rebuffed President Trump's overtures to make Canada the 51st state during an Oval Office meeting, declaring that his country is "not for sale, ever." Trump, known for his real estate background, romanticized the idea of merging the two nations, but Carney emphasized the importance of their partnership while firmly rejecting any notion of Canada relinquishing its sovereignty. Despite Carney's clear stance, Trump remained persistent, stating, "Never say never," highlighting the ongoing tensions and differing perspectives on the U.S.-Canada relationship under his administration. The meeting underscored Carney's commitment to defending Canada's interests and maintaining its distinct identity. </p>

          <p>After a historic draft day slide, Shedeur Sanders will wear No. 12 for the Cleveland Browns, as his preferred No. 2 is already taken by free agent DeAndre Carter. The announcement revealed jersey numbers for the Browns' rookie class and free agent acquisitions, though these are subject to change before the season begins. Sanders, one of five quarterbacks on the roster, joins a team with an uncertain quarterback situation due to Deshaun Watson's injury and the acquisition of Kenny Pickett and Joe Flacco. The article notes that it remains to be seen who will get the starting job for Week 1. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. intelligence memo has been declassified, revealing that the intelligence community does not believe Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro controls the Tren de Aragua (TDA) gang, contradicting claims made by President Trump. The memo states that while some members of the Maduro regime may tolerate or work with TDA, there is no evidence of widespread, organized cooperation or that Maduro is directing the gang's movements into the United States. This assessment undermines the Trump administration's justification for deporting alleged gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, which has been invoked to deport individuals without due process. The memo also suggests that TDA is decentralized and unlikely to coordinate large-scale human trafficking. </p>

          <p>DoorDash reported record first-quarter revenue, driven by an 18% increase in total orders and strong demand for grocery delivery, despite growing economic unease among Americans. The company is expanding its reach through the acquisition of Britain's Deliveroo for $3.9 billion and SevenRooms, a hospitality management software company, for $1.2 billion. These deals will broaden DoorDash's presence in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and the hospitality sector, with the SevenRooms acquisition aimed at helping merchants grow in-store sales and customer relations. While revenue fell short of Wall Street's expectations, adjusted earnings per share exceeded forecasts, although DoorDash shares declined following the announcement. </p>

          <p>A key Republican senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin to be the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, citing Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot cases. Tillis's decision effectively dooms Martin's chances of confirmation, as it would prevent the nomination from advancing out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley signaled similar concerns, indicating that he would only put forward nominees with sufficient support for confirmation. Martin's term as interim U.S. attorney for D.C. is set to expire on May 20th. </p>
