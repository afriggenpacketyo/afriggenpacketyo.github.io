        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has altered its welfare reform bill after significant pressure from over 100 Labour backbenchers threatened its passage. In a notable concession, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall confirmed that current recipients of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit will not be affected by planned cuts. These changes will now only apply to future claimants, a move seen as a major climbdown to ensure the bill passes. The decision follows intense negotiations and marks the third government U-turn in a month.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting of the New Champions, prominent economists argued that China must undergo structural reforms to transition into a consumption-driven economy. Professor Jin Keyu stated that China's long-term prosperity depends on becoming a major consumer country, not just a production powerhouse. She suggested that local governments should be evaluated on consumption metrics to incentivize this shift. The call for reform comes as China faces global trade tensions due to its highly competitive exports, emphasizing the need for more balanced economic relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

Additionally, strong performance in the U.S. tech sector, driven by optimism about artificial intelligence, boosted investor confidence in semiconductor stocks.

          <p>A project in Chelsea, Massachusetts, is providing a potential template for how cities can combat the urban heat island effect, where dense development creates dangerously high temperatures. The "cool block" initiative, led by the environmental group GreenRoots, has transformed a single city block by planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with lighter colors, and painting rooftops white to reflect heat. Research shows such measures can significantly reduce peak temperatures, a critical intervention as climate change intensifies heat waves. The project is an urban laboratory for solutions that can be replicated in other heat-vulnerable neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>Jos√© Adolfo Mac√≠as Villamar, the fugitive drug trafficker known as "Fito," has been recaptured in Ecuador more than a year after his escape from a high-security prison. Mac√≠as, leader of the "Los Choneros" gang and wanted in the U.S. on cocaine importation charges, was found hiding in the basement of a house in his hometown of Manta. His escape in early 2024 triggered a wave of violence across Ecuador, leading the government to declare war on criminal gangs. President Daniel Noboa announced the arrest and stated that proceedings for his extradition to the United States would begin.</p>
