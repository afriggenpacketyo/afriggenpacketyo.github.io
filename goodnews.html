          <h2>Former NFL Player Mo Lewis Discusses Historic Tackle That Led to Tom Brady's Rise</h2>

          <p>Former New York Jets linebacker Mo Lewis is reflecting on the 2001 tackle that injured New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe, paving the way for Tom Brady's legendary career. Lewis defends the hit as a standard football play, shifting responsibility to Bledsoe for choosing to run with the ball outside the pocket instead of staying protected as a passing quarterback. The article notes that Lewis, a three-time Pro Bowler, has largely avoided the spotlight since retiring, frustrated that his career is often defined by this single, history-altering moment. Lewis states the play is irrelevant to him personally, despite its immense significance in NFL history.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying the DNA of ancient English oak trees, including the 800-year-old "Druids Oak" in Buckinghamshire, to understand their remarkable longevity and resilience. The project, involving The Woodland Trust, aims to identify the specific genes that allow these trees to survive for centuries through climate change, disease, and other threats. This genetic information could be crucial for conservation efforts, helping to select the most robust saplings for reforesting Britain's depleted woodlands. Ancient oaks are vital ecological cornerstones, supporting over 2,300 species, and understanding their survival mechanisms is key to restoring these rich habitats for the future.</p>

          <p>Bev Johnson, a beloved radio host at WDIA in Memphis, is being celebrated for her 42 years of service to the community through the airwaves. WDIA made history as America's first all-Black radio station, providing not just music but also essential information and a voice for the Black community since 1947. The station played a crucial role during the Civil Rights Movement and was instrumental in fundraising efforts to preserve the Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Johnson continues this legacy, hosting experts who offer free advice to listeners, reinforcing the station's role as a vital community lifeline.</p>

The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for slightly older children. Previously, the vaccine was only available privately at a significant cost to parents. Health officials hope the program will protect children from rare but severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact caused by parents taking time off work to care for sick children, estimated to cost £24 million annually.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Kari Lake, a Trump administration official, cannot unilaterally fire the director of Voice of America (VOA), Michael Abramowitz. The judge stated that such an action is illegal without the backing of a congressionally mandated advisory panel designed to protect the broadcaster from political interference. Because President Trump has not filled the vacant seats on this panel, Lake lacks the legal authority to terminate the director. The ruling is a significant check on the administration's efforts to dismantle the international news agency and reinforces the legal firewall intended to maintain its journalistic independence.</p>
