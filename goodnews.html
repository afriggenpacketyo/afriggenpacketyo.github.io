        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by leveraging the "first sale rule," a decades-old U.S. customs law. This rule allows importers to calculate duties based on the initial sale price between a manufacturer and a vendor, rather than the inflated price from an intermediary. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales by independent parties, proof the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price. While this process can be complex and requires trust between parties, the potential cost savings make it worthwhile, especially for higher-value consumer goods and luxury products.

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage announced the party's intention to support more generous tax breaks for married couples and eliminate the two-child benefit limit to alleviate financial strain on families. Farage stated the goal is to assist lower-paid workers, not to promote a benefits culture. The party also plans to reinstate winter fuel payments for 10 million pensioners, reversing government cuts. Critics, like Liberal Democrat Sir Ed Davey, have raised concerns about the feasibility of these spending pledges, questioning how Reform UK plans to fund these policies.</p>

          <p>A shift towards nuclear power is gaining traction in Europe as countries seek greater energy independence. Denmark is reconsidering its 40-year ban on nuclear power, while Spain is reportedly open to reviewing the shutdown of its nuclear plants, and Germany has dropped its opposition to atomic power. This renewed interest is partly driven by the costs associated with renewable energy sources like solar and wind. Denmark plans to analyze the potential benefits and risks of new advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, to complement its renewable energy efforts.</p>

The IMF praised the government's planning reforms and infrastructure investment plans, but warned that the Chancellor must adhere to fiscal rules amid global uncertainty. It also suggested some changes to the government's self-imposed fiscal rules, including cutting the number of times the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) produces an assessment of the UK's finances to once a year, rather than twice.
