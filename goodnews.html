          <p>A small 3.0 magnitude earthquake, centered in Bergen County, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the New York City area on Saturday night. While the quake caused brief shaking and startled residents, no significant damage or injuries were reported. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that such tremors are relatively rare but not unexpected on the East Coast. This event follows a larger 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the region in April 2024.</p>

          <p>Florida has surpassed California in adding new utility-scale solar capacity, driven largely by utilities like Florida Power & Light rather than rooftop installations. A state rule that fast-tracks approvals for projects under 75 megawatts has accelerated development, making solar an increasingly cheaper option compared to natural gas. However, future growth faces challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and increasing strain on the existing power grid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on strategic offense and solid pitching rather than power hitting to secure a series victory. Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, while the offense manufactured runs through aggressive baserunning, a double-steal, and a sacrifice fly. The win concludes a nine-game road trip with a winning record, though concerns remain about the team's overall offensive slump through July and early August.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with potential payouts estimated to be under £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not finding hidden commissions unlawful, did deem extremely high commissions to be unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cover millions of agreements dating back to 2007, with the industry expected to cover the costs. (not investment advice)</p>
