          <p>Poland's Iga Świątek won her first Wimbledon singles title, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory. The match, which lasted less than an hour, marked only the second time in the Open era that a Wimbledon final was won with a "double bagel." The win is a historic first for a Polish singles player at the tournament. Anisimova's journey to the final was also notable, marking a significant comeback after she took an indefinite break from tennis in 2023 for mental health reasons.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' 23-year-old pitching prospect, Jacob Misiorowski, has been named an All-Star after just five major league games, a move that has generated significant controversy. While Misiorowski has demonstrated remarkable talent, including throwing at 103 mph and maintaining a 2.81 ERA, many critics argue the selection is unearned. Commentators and fans have pointed to more experienced, high-performing players like Philadelphia's Christopher Sanchez who were overlooked, sparking a debate about whether the honor was deserved or a marketing move by MLB.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. stock market has remained largely stable near record highs, even as the Trump administration has renewed its campaign of tariff threats against major trading partners like the EU, Mexico, and Canada. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiating tactics and are less prone to panic than in the past. The market's underlying strength is also attributed to powerful trends such as the growth of artificial intelligence and a deregulatory environment that encourages mergers and IPOs, which are seen as driving corporate earnings.

          <p>An alleged leader of Italy's powerful 'ndrangheta mafia, Giuseppe Palermo, has been captured in Bogota, Colombia. Palermo, wanted under an Interpol red notice, is accused of overseeing vast cocaine shipments from Latin America to Europe. His arrest was the result of a coordinated operation involving Colombian, Italian, and British authorities, along with Europol. The 'ndrangheta is one of the world's most influential criminal organizations, and Palermo's capture marks a significant blow to its international drug trafficking operations.</p>

          <p>Two fathers are seeking a judicial review of UK government guidance on smartphones in schools, aiming for a complete ban. They argue that the current policy, which allows headteachers to set their own rules, is unlawful and fails to protect children from online harms such as cyberbullying and access to violent or sexual content. The campaigners have sent a formal letter to the Education Secretary, threatening legal action if their concerns are not addressed. The Department for Education maintains that schools already have the power to ban phones.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Scotland have discovered the largest Neolithic wood hall ever found in the country, dating back to around 4,000 B.C. The monumental structure, unearthed at a high school construction site, was likely a ceremonial and feasting center for one of Scotland's first farming communities. Alongside the 115-foot-long hall, a significant hoard of Bronze Age weaponry was found, including a rare gold-decorated spearhead. The findings offer a unique glimpse into the sophisticated architectural skills and communal life of the region's ancient inhabitants.</p>

          <p>A new CNBC analysis has ranked the U.S. state economies based on their preparedness for a potential recession, with Florida, Texas, and North Carolina taking the top spots. The study evaluated states on factors including GDP and job growth, fiscal health, and the number of major corporate headquarters. It also weighed each state's vulnerability to federal budget cuts and the ongoing trade war. States with diverse economies, strong fiscal management, and less dependence on international trade or federal spending were rated as the most resilient. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to rising tariffs from the ongoing trade war, U.S. companies are increasingly using Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce taxes on imported goods. These customs-sanctioned areas allow businesses to store, assemble, or modify foreign components duty-free, with taxes only collected when the final product enters U.S. commerce. This strategy helps preserve cash flow, though recent executive orders have eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, which allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on the finished product.
