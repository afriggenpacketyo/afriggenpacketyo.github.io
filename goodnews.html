          <p>President Trump is actively pressuring Senate Republicans to finalize a major tax bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which encompasses a significant portion of their legislative agenda. The White House plans an "all-out advocacy effort" involving high-ranking officials lobbying senators, with potential travel to states if necessary. Key sticking points include concerns about the bill's cost and potential cuts to Medicaid, while Trump insists that only waste, fraud, and abuse will be reduced. The Senate must navigate the Byrd rule, which requires legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction, potentially necessitating changes that the House may need to accept.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump is promoting his "Big, Beautiful Bill" as a means to reverse what he describes as "four disastrous years" under former President Joe Biden. The bill, already passed by the House, aims to balance the budget through spending cuts and tax cuts, while also expediting energy permitting, refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and upgrading the air traffic control system. Trump asserts the bill will secure the border, deport criminal immigrants, and repeal Biden's EV mandate, but the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget estimates it would add roughly $3 trillion to the national debt. Senate Republicans are reviewing the bill and considering changes, potentially creating challenges for House approval.</p>
