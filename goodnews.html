        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new digital reconstruction of a crushed, million-year-old skull found in China suggests a more complex human evolutionary history. The study, published in the journal Science, posits that our ancestors may have diverged 400,000 years earlier than previously believed and potentially in Asia rather than Africa. While the findings could resolve long-standing debates, some experts urge caution, emphasizing the need for more evidence like genetic data to confirm these provocative conclusions. The research highlights the evolving understanding of our origins.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of more than $220 million worth of cocaine from multiple drug-smuggling vessels in the Pacific Ocean. Operations in August and September resulted in the confiscation of nearly 30,000 pounds of narcotics. The drugs were offloaded in San Diego and Florida. As part of the operations, the Coast Guard also released an image of one of the alleged drug boats on fire, though details on how the fire started were not provided. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to combat illicit narcotics trafficking at sea.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, held steady at a 2.9% annual rate in August. The overall headline PCE rate rose slightly to 2.7%, with both figures aligning with economists' expectations. The Commerce Department report also showed personal income and spending increased, suggesting consumer resilience despite economic pressures like tariffs. These stable inflation readings are unlikely to alter the Federal Reserve's course, with markets still anticipating further interest rate reductions this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The 178th edition of the event began with the traditional tapping of a beer keg by the city's mayor. The three-week festival, which originated as a harvest celebration in 1818, features fairground rides, parades, and food stalls, hoping to attract millions of visitors. However, organizers note that tougher economic conditions in Germany might affect attendance and spending compared to previous years.</p>

          <p>Shares of Paccar, the parent company of truck manufacturers Peterbilt and Kenworth, increased by approximately 5% after President Trump announced a 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks. The tariff, set to begin on October 1, is intended to protect domestic manufacturers from foreign competition. Paccar produces over 90% of its trucks for the U.S. market domestically. Analysts suggest the new trade policy directly addresses a price disadvantage Paccar faced against competitors manufacturing in Mexico, potentially giving the company a significant market advantage.

The FAA had halted Boeing's self-certification authority for the MAX in 2019 after two fatal crashes and for the 787 in 2022 due to production defects. This decision, which involves alternating certification duties with Boeing, signals renewed confidence in the manufacturer's quality control processes.

          <p>A bipartisan bill advancing in Congress, the Claiming Age Clarity Act, aims to make Social Security's retirement benefit options easier for Americans to understand by changing key terminology.

Many businesses are still struggling with debt and a 20% drop in vacation rental demand since the hurricane.

          <p>An intellectual property attorney advises that anyone starting a side hustle should, at a minimum, secure a trademark to protect their brand. Darlene Harris, a managing attorney, explains that a trademark acts like a deed to a house, establishing legal ownership of a business name, logo, or slogan. Failing to do so can expose an entrepreneur to lawsuits and financial claims from others who may have a similar brand. She recommends consulting an attorney to develop a broader intellectual property strategy, including copyrights and forming an LLC, to protect both current work and future growth.</p>
