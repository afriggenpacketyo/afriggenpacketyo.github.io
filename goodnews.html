        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia claimed a decisive 159-run victory over the West Indies in the first Test match in Barbados, driven by a powerful performance from bowler Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies, who were set a target of 301 runs, collapsed dramatically in the final session of the third day, losing all ten of their wickets. Hazlewood was the key architect of the collapse, taking five wickets for 43 runs and dismantling the hosts' top order. Despite some late resistance, Australia's bowlers completed the win with two full days to spare, showcasing their clinical approach to the game.</p>

The U.S. Marshals Service and Louisiana State Police confirmed Massey was found and arrested at a residence in New Orleans on Friday. At the time of his escape, Massey was incarcerated on charges including domestic abuse battery and motor vehicle theft. The other remaining fugitive, Derrick Groves, who was convicted of second-degree murder, is still at large, with authorities offering a significant reward for information.</p>

          <p>A team of highly skilled divers has completed the first-ever human exploration of the SS Nemesis, a steamship that sank during a storm in 1904 off the coast of Sydney, Australia. The wreck, which lies at a depth of about 525 feet, was only discovered in 2022. The divers navigated pitch-black conditions to survey and film the ship's remains, including its crumbled bow and smokestacks, during a brief nine-minute window at the bottom. The challenging six-hour ascent was required for safe decompression, and the team is already planning a future mission to create a detailed 3D scan of the historic site.</p>

          <p>A Corona, California man has been sentenced to over a year in federal prison for tax fraud related to the sale of memorabilia signed by comic book icon Stan Lee. Mac Martin Anderson, 59, failed to report over $1.2 million in income earned between 2015 and 2018 from selling autographed Marvel items. Anderson, who had a personal relationship with the late Spider-Man co-creator, pleaded guilty to two counts of filing a false tax return. In addition to his prison sentence, he has been ordered to pay $482,833 in restitution to the IRS for the unpaid taxes.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be imminent, telling reporters he believes a deal is close and could be finalized within the next week. The administration has been actively pushing for a pause in the conflict, which began after Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023. A previous proposal for a 60-day ceasefire was rejected by Hamas earlier this year. The ongoing war has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, with over 56,000 Palestinians killed, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 index closed at a new all-time high, driven by growing investor optimism over signs of de-escalating global trade tensions. The market has seen a remarkable recovery since a sharp downturn in April, with the S&P 500 rising approximately 24% since the announcement of tariffs. Analysts attribute the rebound to calmer rhetoric from the White House on trade and expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Recent inflation data showed a slight increase, but this did not deter the market's upward momentum, with the Nasdaq also setting a new record. (not investment advice)</p>

The order was part of a broader campaign targeting several major law firms perceived as political adversaries of the president. Judge Loren AliKhan found that the order, which sought to limit the firm's access to federal buildings and review its employees' security clearances, violated the First and Fifth Amendments. The ruling described the executive order as a threat to the independence of the legal profession and an unconstitutional abuse of power.</p>

          <p>Prominent financial advisor Ric Edelman is now recommending that investors consider allocating between 10% and 40% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, a significant increase from his previous advice of a low single-digit percentage. Edelman attributes this shift to the evolution of the crypto industry, which he now views as a mainstream asset class with government regulation and institutional adoption resolving earlier uncertainties. He also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio is obsolete due to increased human longevity, making crypto's potential for higher, non-correlated returns essential for modern long-term investment strategies.

Alaska's wage will rise to $13.00 per hour, while Oregon's will increase to $15.05.
