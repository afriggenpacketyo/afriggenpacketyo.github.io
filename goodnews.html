          <p>Democratic socialist India Walton, who won the 2021 Democratic mayoral primary in Buffalo, warns fellow progressives against moving toward the political center during Donald Trump's presidency. She argues that moderating her own message on issues like charter schools and policing ultimately cost her the general election and weakened her populist appeal. Walton contends that the Democratic Party's losses among working-class voters stem from abandoning bold economic policies in favor of catering to corporate interests. She advises emerging progressive candidates to remain steadfast in their principles to energize voters.</p>

          <p>The English Premier League (EPL) has evolved from a struggling domestic competition in the early 1990s into the world's most dominant and wealthiest club soccer league. Its financial power, fueled by massive broadcast deals worth over $5 billion annually, allows it to attract top international talent, creating a highly competitive environment unlike any other league. While other European leagues may have a couple of elite teams, the EPL's top-to-bottom quality ensures unpredictability and global appeal. The challenge now is for the league to maintain its top position and avoid the stagnation that befell its former rivals.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has reached a tentative agreement with the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants, bringing an end to a strike that affected approximately 130,000 travelers daily during peak season. The airline announced it would gradually restart operations, though a full restoration of the schedule could take over a week. A key part of the agreement guarantees pay for work performed while planes are on the ground, a major point of contention for the union. The deal was reached after the union defied a government order to return to work, escalating pressure for a negotiated settlement.</p>

          <p>U.S. investors are increasingly pouring money into European soccer, now holding stakes in a majority of England's Premier League teams, including iconic clubs like Manchester United and Liverpool. This trend is driven by the explosive growth in revenue, which has ballooned over 750% since the mid-1990s, leading to soaring club valuations. For American investors, European soccer clubs represent a more accessible alternative to the higher price tags of NFL or NBA franchises. This influx of private equity is also popularizing multi-club ownership models, a strategy that is beginning to draw regulatory scrutiny from governing bodies like UEFA. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home Depot maintained its full-year sales forecast, anticipating 2.8% total sales growth, even after missing Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for the second consecutive quarter. The home improvement retailer reported earnings of $4.68 per share on $45.28 billion in revenue, slightly below analyst predictions. Company leadership noted that while homeowners are still showing a "deferral mindset" on large projects, there are encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in transactions over $1,000 and improving sales trends throughout the quarter.

          <h2>Belgian Cities Utilize Restored Wetlands to Combat Increased Flooding and Drought</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Flanders region of Belgium, authorities are combatting the dual climate challenges of intense rainfall and severe drought by restoring natural wetlands and giving rivers more space. Decades of urban sprawl and agricultural development had increased flood risks, but projects under the comprehensive Sigma Plan are reversing this by "depoldering" land to create controlled flood zones. These restored natural areas act as sponges, absorbing excess water during heavy rains and slowly releasing it during dry periods, protecting urban areas like Mechelen while also creating valuable nature reserves and recreational spaces.</p>

          <p>Dan Gilroy, the Emmy-nominated writer for the "Andor" episode "Welcome to the Rebellion," provides an annotated breakdown of Mon Mothma's powerful speech to the Galactic Senate.

The speech was designed to condemn the complicit politicians while simultaneously awakening the galaxy's inhabitants from the helplessness imposed by authoritarian rule. The analysis reveals the deep thought and historical context behind one of the most significant monologues in the "Star Wars" canon.</p>

          <p>An article analyzes Harrison Ford's first-ever Emmy nomination for his supporting role in the comedy series "Shrinking," placing it in the context of his long and celebrated career. Despite his iconic status, Ford has received remarkably few major competitive award nominations, including only one Oscar nod for "Witness" in 1986, and has never won. While he has numerous lifetime achievement awards, the piece notes the irony that a television award could become a career highlight. At 83, Ford is considered a frontrunner to finally win a major acting award for his well-received performance.</p>
