          <h2>The Rise of 'Tipflation' and Consumer Confusion in Modern Tipping Culture</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 11:13:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores 'tipflation,' a growing phenomenon causing confusion and frustration among consumers regarding modern tipping practices. The rise of digital payment systems and touch-screen terminals has led to an explosion of pre-calculated tip requests, often setting default options at 15-25% in unexpected scenarios like fast-food takeaways. This trend, accelerated by the pandemic's shift away from cash, pressures customers into tipping situations where it was not traditionally expected. Experts advise understanding local tipping norms, staff wage structures, and payment interface designs to navigate this evolving social etiquette, cautioning against "guilt tipping" which can negatively impact customer experience.</p>

          <h2>Hamas Responds Positively to US-Mediated Gaza Ceasefire Proposal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 11:07:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hamas has announced a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal in the Gaza conflict, signaling readiness for immediate negotiations on its implementation. This follows President Trump's earlier assertion that Israel had agreed to a two-month ceasefire, though Israeli confirmation remained pending. Hamas is reportedly seeking specific amendments, including guarantees for an Israeli withdrawal to prior positions, an end to the war after a 60-day truce, and the disbandment of the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The ongoing conflict has tragically resulted in over 57,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, underscoring the urgent need for a resolution.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 11:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Group D of the Women's Euro 2025, featuring England, Wales, the Netherlands, and France, is widely considered the tournament's "toughest" by experts and coaches, with three of the four teams ranked in FIFA's top 11. Opta's supercomputer reinforces this by predicting a 37% chance of a Group D team winning the tournament, significantly higher than any other group. England aims to defend its title, while the Netherlands seeks to reclaim its 2017 victory, both under the guidance of coach Sarina Wiegman. Despite being tournament debutants and underdogs, Wales has demonstrated the ability to compete with higher-ranked teams, promising a highly competitive and unpredictable group stage for all participants.</p>

          <h2>Doctors Skeptical of Viral 'Cortisol Cocktail' for Stress Reduction</h2>

          <p>The article examines the viral TikTok trend of the "cortisol cocktail," an alcohol-free drink combining coconut water, orange juice, lemon, magnesium powder, sea salt, and sparkling water, which is purported to reduce stress and lower cortisol levels. Medical experts, including endocrinologists, express skepticism about its direct ability to significantly lower cortisol, a vital hormone that is naturally difficult to track and rarely targeted for reduction unless in cases of severe conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. While the drink may offer hydration benefits and potentially aid relaxation through magnesium, doctors emphasize that proven stress-reduction methods like prioritizing sleep, regular exercise, connecting with others, and seeking professional mental health support remain the most effective strategies for overall well-being.</p>

          <p>The article details the rediscovery of the MingKwai, a unique Chinese typewriter prototype from the 1940s invented by linguist Lin Yutang, previously thought lost to history. This machine is considered pivotal to the origin story of modern Chinese computing, demonstrating how complex pictographs could be integrated into mechanical systems. Lin's ingenious design broke down characters by their shapes, enabling the retrieval of up to 90,000 characters through an "magic eye" screen, a foundational concept that underpins how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed today. Its recent acquisition and restoration by Stanford University offers new insights into Lin's ambitious globalist vision for language and technology, challenging the notion that modernity required abandoning traditional Chinese culture.</p>

          <p>Financial analyst Jim Cramer has identified Bank of America (BAC) as "the weakest" among its peer group, despite the bank's recent 7.7% dividend increase and a 2.3% yield. Cramer's analysis highlighted that both Bank of America and Wells Fargo trade at a premium of nearly two times tangible book value, a significantly higher valuation compared to Citi. He also pointed out their higher price-to-earnings ratios, at 13 and 14 times earnings respectively. While acknowledging BAC's almost 11% year-to-date gain, his commentary suggests a relative underperformance or less attractive valuation compared to other banking stocks in the current market.

          <p>Parisians celebrated a historic moment as the Seine River opened for public swimming for the first time in over a century, following a comprehensive $1.5 billion cleanup project tied to last year's Olympics. The river had been closed to swimmers since 1923 due to severe pollution and navigation risks. Mayor Anne Hidalgo and environmental authorities confirmed the water now consistently meets European quality standards. Designated swimming areas, including two newly built wooden decks near the Eiffel Tower and Île Saint-Louis, have been established with strict safety measures. This initiative fulfills a promise dating back to 1988, reflecting a collective effort to reclaim the iconic waterway for recreational use, especially amidst recent record-breaking temperatures in Europe.</p>

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a happiness researcher and former Google X executive, shares his "90-second rule" for managing anger and upset, a practice he adopted after his son's tragic death. Based on neuroscientific insight from Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, the rule posits that stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline are flushed from the body within 90 seconds. Gawdat advises allowing oneself to fully experience upset for this brief period, then consciously choosing to redirect focus, preventing rumination from prolonging negative emotions. He also proposes three key questions to quickly assess and address sources of unhappiness: Is it true? Can I do something about it? Can I accept it? This approach encourages realistic expectations and conscious reactions to life's challenges to foster greater fulfillment.</p>

          <p>The article highlights a dramatic 90% reduction in heart attack deaths between 1970 and 2022, attributing this significant progress to a combination of public health campaigns and medical advancements. Key factors include the substantial decline in smoking rates, the widespread adoption of statins for cholesterol management, and improved emergency interventions like CPR, portable defibrillators, and artery-opening stents. While heart attacks are now considerably less fatal, heart disease remains a leading cause of death, with increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes posing new challenges. The author emphasizes the potential of GLP-1 inhibitors and broader access to advanced screenings like CAC tests to further prevent cardiac events and improve overall heart health before they reach a critical stage.</p>
