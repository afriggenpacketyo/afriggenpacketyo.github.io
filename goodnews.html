          <p>Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen has openly stated for the first time this season that winning a fifth world championship is a realistic possibility, following a commanding victory at the United States Grand Prix. Previously dismissing the idea due to a large points deficit to McLaren drivers, Verstappen's recent string of wins has dramatically closed the gap. He described the situation as "positive pressure" and confirmed his team is going "flat out" for the remainder of the season. His recent performance has been remarkable, gaining 64 points on the championship leader in just four races.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 4.8 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2025, a figure that slightly exceeded economists' forecasts and aligns with market expectations. This performance brings the nation's economic growth for the first three quarters of the year to 5.2 percent, positioning it to meet its official annual target of "around 5 percent." Despite facing increasing external uncertainties and global economic pressures, the data suggests resilience in the Chinese economy. A spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics characterized the country's economic development path this year as "extraordinary."</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw gains after China's central bank decided to keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. The stability in policy helped boost investor confidence, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rising over 2% and Japan's Nikkei 225 gaining 1.6%. This market activity occurred as investors awaited key economic data from China, including the third-quarter GDP figures. The positive sentiment in Asia followed a higher close on Wall Street, where traders reacted to a softer U.S. tone on trade talks with China.</p>

          <p>According to preliminary results, centrist candidate Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential run-off election with over 54% of the vote, marking a significant political shift after two decades of rule by the leftist MAS party. The election was dominated by the country's severe economic crisis, including a US dollar shortage and soaring inflation. Both Paz and his right-wing opponent, Jorge Quiroga, campaigned on promises of economic change, including attracting foreign investment and restructuring state-owned enterprises. The outcome is expected to pivot Bolivia's foreign policy away from China and Russia and towards stronger relations with the United States.</p>

          <h2>LiDAR Maker Founder Argues Against Elon Musk's Vision-Only Approach to Self-Driving</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Steven Qiu, founder of the leading LiDAR manufacturer RoboSense, asserts that a multi-sensor system incorporating LiDAR is essential for safe autonomous driving, directly challenging Elon Musk's vision-only strategy for Tesla. Qiu argues that vision-only systems cannot account for numerous "corner cases," such as distinguishing a stationary white car from a cloud, and are insufficient for achieving Level 3 or higher automation. While Musk has criticized LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," Qiu notes that costs have fallen dramatically. Many automotive executives, including the CEOs of Ford and Li Auto, also consider LiDAR critical for safety.</p>

          <p>A new art exhibit in Los Angeles, titled "Monuments," features 18 decommissioned Confederate statues, including a massive monument of General Robert E. Lee that was melted down into bronze ingots. The exhibit aims to confront the historical narrative of the Confederacy and its leaders, who fought to preserve slavery. Curator Hamza Walker argues that lionizing these figures promotes a racist ideology. The show comes at a time of national debate over American history, with some advocating for the preservation of such monuments while others see them as symbols of white supremacy that should be removed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To combat workplace burnout and establish healthier boundaries, career experts suggest a simple but powerful linguistic change: replacing the phrase "I can't" with "I don't." Career coach Helen Tupper explains that "I can't" often invites negotiation, whereas "I don't" presents a more definitive and less challengeable statement about one's personal rules, such as "I don't attend meetings after 5 p.m." This strategy helps individuals reclaim personal time and avoid the slippery slope of overcommitment that can lead to burnout. The advice comes as research indicates a rising number of workers are experiencing extreme levels of stress.</p>

          <p>Millions of people in India are celebrating Diwali, the festival of lights, one of the most significant holidays in Hinduism. The festivities involve lighting lamps, exchanging sweets, and decorating homes, but the widespread use of firecrackers remains a major concern due to its impact on air quality. This year, India's Supreme Court has permitted the use of "green crackers" in Delhi, which claim to be less polluting, though critics question their effectiveness. Despite restrictions in many states, the rules are often flouted, leading to a sharp decline in air quality following the festival.</p>

Driving 130 miles per day for his commute, he had previously spent $400 per month on gas. After switching to the electric vehicle, his charging costs totaled only $24 for the month, largely because he was able to charge for free at his workplace.

          <p>China's Five-Year Plans, the blueprints for its economic and political goals, have historically had profound global repercussions. The "Reform and Opening Up" policy of the early 1980s transformed China into a manufacturing powerhouse, leading to the "China shock" that shifted industrial jobs from the West. Later plans focused on "strategic emerging industries," which allowed China to dominate green technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels. The current focus on "high quality development" aims to challenge U.S. technological supremacy, escalating geopolitical tensions as China's top leaders prepare their next plan for 2026-2030.</p>

Liu Qian discusses the nature of Chinese innovation, the broader ideological and technological competition with the U.S., and the critical importance of including women's voices in policymaking.
