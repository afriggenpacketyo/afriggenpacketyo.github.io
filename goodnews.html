          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to "stay the course" and remain invested in the stock market despite a challenging geopolitical environment. He argued that selling based on political news, such as tariff announcements or changes in government agency leadership, often causes investors to miss out on subsequent market rallies. Cramer suggested that many of the administration's actions can be undone if they prove problematic and that major companies have demonstrated an ability to adapt and remain profitable.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, mandating improved conditions for immigrant detainees at a facility in Manhattan. The ruling requires ICE to reduce the number of detainees and provide basic necessities such as sleeping mats, hygiene products, and access to legal counsel. The order followed a lawsuit from the ACLU and other advocates who described the conditions as "inhumane," with a government lawyer conceding to the lack of services. The facility must now be cleaned three times daily and provide adequate space per detainee.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has signed the Sonya Massey Act into law, which mandates more thorough background checks for police officer candidates statewide. The legislation was inspired by the 2024 shooting death of Sonya Massey by a sheriff's deputy who had a documented history of misconduct at previous jobs. The new law requires law enforcement agencies to review an applicant's complete prior employment records before making a job offer. The goal is to prevent officers with histories of serious disciplinary issues from being hired by other departments.</p>

          <p>A Union Pacific freight train derailed in Palo Pinto County, Texas, with emergency services responding to the incident. Officials reported that approximately 35 cars were involved in the derailment, some of which were carrying hazardous materials. However, initial assessments indicated that none of the cars were leaking their contents, and no injuries were reported. The incident, which occurred over a railroad bridge, is being treated as a hazardous materials situation as a precaution, and a small grass fire was contained at the scene. An investigation into the cause is now underway.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Vice President JD Vance are scheduled to participate in a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. This development comes just before Trump's in-person summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The meeting follows a recent call where, according to Zelenskyy, a U.S. envoy signaled that Russia may be ready for a ceasefire. Zelenskyy has stressed that any talks about Ukraine's future must include Ukraine, and this virtual summit appears to be a step to address those concerns.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce admitted in a recent interview that his on-field performance has not met his own high standards over the past two seasons. He suggested that his focus may have "slipped a little bit" due to his increasing off-field ventures, which include hosting television shows and his high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift. Kelce, who fell short of 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in seven years, clarified that he does not regret the opportunities but is motivated to return to his peak form.</p>
