          <p>Erin has strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane, becoming the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, and is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane over the weekend. While its current path is not projected to impact the U.S. mainland, it is expected to pass just north of several Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Forecasters are urging residents in these areas to monitor the storm closely and prepare for the potential of heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and life-threatening surf conditions.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. police chief Pamela Smith will remain in her role after the Trump administration agreed to rescind an order that would have replaced her. The reversal came after the city filed a lawsuit to block the federal takeover of its police force, and a judge expressed skepticism about the administration's legal authority. While the chief retains command, a new directive maintains that the department must cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, leaving some aspects of the power struggle between the city and the White House unresolved.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have agreed to scale back the federal government's takeover of the city's police department following a significant legal challenge. After a federal judge expressed skepticism about the legality of the move, a deal was reached ensuring that D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith would remain in command. The revised arrangement still allows the administration to direct the police for federal purposes, including cooperation with immigration enforcement, which remains a point of contention.</p>

This milestone is the result of a local ordinance passed last year designed to create more affordable homeownership options. Officials are hopeful that this innovative housing model, often referred to as a new form of starter home, will be replicated across the state to help alleviate California's severe housing shortage.</p>

          <h2>Dust from Salton Sea Shoreline a Minor Contributor to Regional Air Pollution, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 20:39:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report has found that dust from the exposed shoreline of California's shrinking Salton Sea accounts for less than 1% of the harmful small particle pollution in the surrounding Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust suppression projects at the sea have been central to efforts to combat the region's high rates of asthma and other respiratory diseases. The study's authors suggest that a more effective public health strategy would be to pivot towards protecting people where they are exposed, such as by improving indoor air filtration in homes and schools.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two new clinical studies from India are challenging the long-held belief that people with diabetes must strictly avoid mangoes. The research indicates that when consumed in moderation as a replacement for other carbohydrates, such as white bread, mangoes can result in a similar or even lower glycemic response. An eight-week trial further demonstrated that participants with type 2 diabetes who substituted mango for bread at breakfast saw improvements in key metabolic health markers, suggesting the fruit can be safely incorporated into a controlled diet.</p>

After its parent company, Arcadia, collapsed in 2020, the brand was acquired by online retailer Asos.
