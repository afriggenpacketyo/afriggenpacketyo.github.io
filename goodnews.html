          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" delves into the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, capturing his last significant burst of creativity. The collection highlights his evolution into an expressive ballad singer, influenced by his personal struggles, and showcases his collaboration with the TCB Band. This release offers a poignant look at a period of artistic potential just before his career declined, following a missed opportunity to star in "A Star Is Born," a disappointment friends believe contributed to his tragic end.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its market share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This resurgence is largely attributed to the growing popularity and innovation of Samsung's foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors compared to the standard iPhone design. By providing a wider range of devices at various price points, Samsung is effectively competing on both the low and high ends of the market, prompting speculation that Apple may release its own foldable device by 2026.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction to halt the Federal Trade Commission's investigation into the progressive advocacy group Media Matters. The investigation began after Media Matters published research showing corporate ads on X appearing alongside offensive content, which led to an advertiser exodus. The judge ruled that the group's research was "quintessential First Amendment activity" and that the FTC's probe appeared to be a "retaliatory act," a decision that raises concerns about government overreach against newsgathering and reporting organizations.</p>

The standout performance came from Jordan Cox, who smashed 86 not out from just 29 balls, including a record-equaling ten sixes. This dominant display of power-hitting propelled the two-time defending champions to the top of the league table, continuing their strong form in the competition.</p>

          <p>The late Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman, Charlie Munger, stated that once he became wealthy enough, he stopped carrying insurance for risks he could afford to cover himself, such as fire insurance on his homes. He argued that intelligent people should self-insure against manageable losses to avoid the waste, fraud, and administrative costs inherent in the insurance industry. Munger's philosophy was that insurance should only be used for catastrophic events that one cannot afford to pay for out-of-pocket, a stance he held despite Berkshire Hathaway's significant presence in the insurance sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals over 60, cardiologists strongly recommend incorporating salmon into their diet to support cardiovascular health. Salmon is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower "bad" LDL cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and support healthy blood vessel function. As the heart is a muscle, consuming adequate protein is crucial for maintaining its strength with age. Experts suggest eating at least two servings of omega-3-rich fish per week, prepared through healthy methods like baking or grilling rather than frying.</p>

Industry experts note that while nostalgia for the brand is high, its success will depend on its ability to reclaim its "cool" factor and compete in a challenging retail environment dominated by fast fashion and different consumer priorities.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed the week with gains and reached several new record highs, driven by investor optimism following favorable inflation data. Tuesday's Consumer Price Index report, which showed inflation cooling more than expected, increased market speculation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. While a subsequent report on wholesale inflation was higher than anticipated, it did not significantly dampen expectations for a rate cut, keeping market sentiment positive throughout the week.
