          <p>Formula 1 driver George Russell has voiced skepticism about the recent changes to swearing rules implemented by the FIA, the sport's governing body, noting a lack of communication from senior FIA officials. These changes, prompted by FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, aim to give stewards more control, taking circumstances into account when penalizing drivers for swearing. Other drivers like Oscar Piastri acknowledged the positive aspect of the changes regarding abuse of officials but felt some areas were overly harsh. Russell also endorsed Carlos Sainz Sr's potential bid for the FIA presidential election, believing it could benefit the sport due to Sainz's extensive motorsport knowledge.</p>

          <p>Walmart has cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on Chinese imports, consumers may soon face higher prices on some products. CEO Doug McMillon stated that tariffs continue to exert cost pressure, particularly in categories like electronics and toys, though the retailer will strive to mitigate the impact on food prices. This warning comes amid broader economic uncertainty and ongoing trade negotiations, leading Walmart to pull its quarterly profit outlook. Economist Tuan Nguyen noted that reduced consumer spending, driven by tariffs, could further pressure demand in the coming months.</p>

          <p>A group of environmental researchers is urging California Governor Gavin Newsom to fund soil testing at homes destroyed by the Eaton and Palisades wildfires in Los Angeles County. The researchers argue that the state should adhere to its wildfire-recovery protocols, which include soil sampling after cleanup crews remove toxic ash and topsoil. Federal disaster agencies have declined to conduct soil sampling, prompting concerns about public health and economic recovery. Recent testing revealed elevated lead and arsenic levels at homes cleared by federal debris removal crews, raising fears of potential contamination for returning residents.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed bill in the House proposes a series of tax cuts, including making the 2017 tax cuts permanent and adding new reductions for senior citizens and parents. The bill aims to provide taxpayers with an average $1,300 tax reduction, but it also includes cuts to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs. Key provisions include a new $4,000 deduction for people 65 and older, an increase in the standard deduction, and an extension of the Child Tax Credit. Some Democrats criticize the bill for making certain tax cuts temporary while prioritizing permanent cuts for the wealthiest. (not investment advice)</p>

He also warned that higher real rates could unleash greater inflation volatility than what the U.S. experienced during the "inter-crisis period of the 2010s."

          <p>Tommy Paul secured a spot in the Italian Open semifinals after beating Hubert Hurkacz, but off the court, he has been dealing with a "stressful week." Paul revealed that his truck was repossessed after he missed a couple of payments. He said he had to win a couple of matches so he could pay that off and get it back, which cost him $1,000. The former Australian Open semi-finalist is guaranteed prize money of about ¬£245,000 this fortnight.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan pleaded not guilty to federal obstruction charges stemming from her allegedly helping a man evade immigration authorities during a federal law enforcement operation at her courthouse. Dugan was arrested in April by the FBI after she "intentionally misdirected federal agents away" from an illegal immigrant who had a criminal court hearing in front of the judge and was set to be arrested after his hearing ended. A federal judge set Dugan's trial to begin the week of July 21.</p>
