        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released its annual inflation adjustments for federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year. This move is designed to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets without a real increase in income. The adjustments mean Americans will need to earn more before moving to a higher tax rate, providing potential relief. The article details the new standard deduction amounts for various filing statuses and explains how the progressive tax system works. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is now in effect, with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) repositioning troops along agreed-upon lines within Gaza. This marks the first phase of a broader peace deal, which triggers a 72-hour countdown for the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas. In exchange for the hostages, Israel is set to release over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The agreement also includes provisions for increased humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip, though specific details are still being finalized.</p>

          <p>This article examines the monthly repayment costs for a $200,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) in the current interest rate environment. With average HELOC rates falling to around 7.84%, it has become a more affordable borrowing option compared to previous months. The analysis provides specific monthly payment estimates for 10-year and 15-year repayment periods, highlighting the potential savings due to declining rates. It also advises borrowers to calculate payments under various rate scenarios due to the variable nature of HELOCs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Plaid Cymru, a political party in Wales, has announced a major policy promise ahead of the next Senedd election, offering universal free childcare for children from nine months to four years old. Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth presented the plan as a "transformative" policy to assist families with living costs, aiming to provide at least 20 hours of care for 48 weeks a year by 2031. The proposal aims to be the most generous childcare offer in the UK and is a key part of the party's platform to replace Labour as the governing party in Wales.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump announced that eight Ukrainian children, who had been taken by Russia during the war, have been successfully reunited with their families. She stated this was the result of an "open channel of communication" established with Russian President Vladimir Putin after she sent him a letter on the matter. The effort to repatriate Ukrainian children, whose removal has been classified as a war crime by the International Criminal Court, is reportedly ongoing. The announcement highlights a rare diplomatic channel focused on a key humanitarian issue of the conflict.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Pressure Was Key to Securing Israel-Hamas Ceasefire Deal</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Donald Trump's direct and forceful intervention was the primary catalyst for the recent Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement. The author contends that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had previously resisted similar terms, was left with no alternative but to accept the deal once Trump applied significant pressure. The analysis suggests Trump's motivation was partly a response to an Israeli attack on Hamas negotiators in Doha, which he viewed as a personal affront. While crediting Trump for stopping the violence, the article also criticizes him for not acting sooner.</p>
