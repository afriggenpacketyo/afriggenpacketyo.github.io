          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 00:26:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sport of pickleball is experiencing a significant boom in China, mirroring the craze seen in the United States. Online sales of related equipment have increased more than six-fold year-over-year, reflecting a broader cultural shift towards active lifestyles. This growth is driven by social media influencers and a renewed interest in racquet sports. Unlike in the U.S., the sport's expansion in China is largely fueled by for-profit businesses building courts in dense urban areas, creating a unique and systemized market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to soaring housing costs, Utah's Governor Spencer Cox has launched a goal to build 35,000 affordable starter homes within five years. The initiative aims to combat a market where the median age of first-time homebuyers has reached a record high of 38. While the state has offered low-interest construction loans to incentivize developers, progress has been slow, with only about 5,100 homes started. However, some developers are embracing the challenge, creating entire communities of starter homes to help young families achieve homeownership.</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, emphasizing the "necessity for generational change in the party." The 78-year-old Democrat, first elected in 1992, stated that a younger successor might be better equipped to face current political challenges. Nadler served as the chair of the House Judiciary Committee during the first impeachment of Donald Trump and was a prominent figure in Democratic leadership for decades, leaving a significant legacy in Congress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team from the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre in Beijing has designed a potential solution for doing laundry in space. They have developed a compact, 12kg washing machine that cleans clothes using an ultra-fine mist and ozone, requiring almost no water and no detergent. The device uses just 400ml of water per cycle to clean up to 800 grams of clothing, with ultraviolet light generating ozone to sterilize the garments. This innovation could significantly improve hygiene and comfort for astronauts on long-duration space missions.</p>

          <p>Marie Tidball, a newly elected Labour MP with a congenital disability, is drawing attention to the significant accessibility challenges within the historic Houses of Parliament. In a tour of the building, she pointed out numerous barriers, including heavy doors with difficult handles, a lack of accessible toilets near key rooms, and archaic procedures that are physically demanding. Her advocacy has contributed to an ongoing review by the House of Commons Modernisation Committee, which aims to make the institution more inclusive for disabled MPs, staff, and visitors.</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, stands as a landmark of American architecture and is considered the grandfather of national park lodges. Built in 1904 from thousands of locally sourced logs, its rustic style, known as "parkitecture," was designed to harmonize with the natural environment. The inn's success popularized this architectural approach, influencing the design of other famous lodges in national parks across the country. Today, it remains a beloved and historically significant destination for millions of visitors.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an emergency order blocking the Trump administration from deporting hundreds of unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following an urgent lawsuit from attorneys who argued the plan was unlawful. The lawyers contended that the deportations would violate laws protecting these minors, denying them the right to seek asylum or other humanitarian protection from abuse and persecution they might face if returned to their home country.</p>

          <p>England's Premier League clubs have set a new transfer spending record, with their collective outlay during the summer window surpassing £3 billion for the first time. The final total of £3.087 billion was driven by a series of high-value deadline day deals, including Liverpool's British record £125 million signing of Alexander Isak. This massive expenditure is greater than the combined spending of the top-flight leagues in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy, highlighting the Premier League's immense financial dominance in European football.
