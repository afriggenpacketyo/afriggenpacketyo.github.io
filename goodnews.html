          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export agreement, a £10 billion deal to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support approximately 4,000 jobs in the UK, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow. This strategic partnership aims to strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates to counter Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic. The deal was chosen over competing offers from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>At 39 years and 239 days old, Brighton's James Milner has become the second-oldest goalscorer in Premier League history after converting a penalty against Manchester City. This milestone adds to his distinction as being the league's second-youngest scorer, a record he set in 2002 at age 16. Milner's goal, his first in six years, was crucial in Brighton's 2-1 comeback victory. Colleagues and commentators praised his longevity and fitness, celebrating him as a "legend of the game" for his extensive career spanning over 640 top-flight appearances.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the U.S. government from deporting 10 unaccompanied children back to Guatemala. The order, which lasts for 14 days, responds to a legal challenge arguing the removals would violate U.S. laws designed to protect vulnerable minors. The lawsuit was filed after the Trump administration announced an agreement with Guatemala to facilitate such deportations. Pro-immigration advocates claim the children could face abuse, persecution, or torture if returned to their home country.</p>

          <p>During an informal meeting in Copenhagen, EU foreign ministers brainstormed new ways to support Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. Key proposals discussed included imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" production sites for Ukrainian arms companies on EU soil. Ministers also revisited the idea of seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Ukraine's reconstruction, though some member states remain hesitant due to legal and financial risks. The talks signal the EU's commitment to finding long-term, impactful methods to aid Ukraine and pressure Russia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A massive kelp restoration project off the coast of Southern California has achieved remarkable success by removing 5.8 million voracious purple sea urchins from the seabed. Led by The Bay Foundation, the 13-year effort has cleared over 80 acres, allowing the vital kelp ecosystem, known as the "sequoias of the sea," to regrow. The decline of the kelp was caused by a combination of warming waters, pollution, and the explosion of the urchin population. This successful restoration provides a model for other regions and has helped revive local biodiversity and fisheries.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Arch Manning took responsibility for his performance after No. 1 Texas lost its season opener 14-7 to Ohio State. In his debut as the full-time starter, the highly touted nephew of Peyton and Eli Manning completed 17 of 30 passes for 170 yards with one touchdown and one interception. While Manning stated he needed to "play better," Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian criticized the "out of control" external expectations placed on the young player.

          <p>A woman in Llanharan, Wales, who was pet-sitting her brother's pregnant Labrador, Tilly, had to play midwife when the dog went into labor a week early. The dog, initially expected to have about six puppies, ended up giving birth to a massive litter of 14 over a 15-hour period. The pet sitter, Rhian Boxall, described the experience as a "rollercoaster of emotions" as she worked with an emergency vet over the phone to save the pups. Twelve of the fourteen puppies survived, and the owner returned from his holiday abroad to a much larger canine family than he had anticipated.</p>

          <p>The author, a self-described liberal, makes a case for hunting as a more honest, ethical, and sustainable way to consume meat compared to factory farming. She recounts her personal journey from a city-dweller with a typical left-leaning disdain for hunting to becoming a hunter herself in Montana. The article argues that hunters are often deeply invested in conservation, funding wildlife management through licenses and taxes on firearms and ammunition. It challenges the stereotype of hunters and suggests that those who care about ecosystems and animal welfare share more common ground with hunters than they might realize.</p>
