          <p>Apple is significantly increasing its iPhone production in India, aiming for a majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. to originate there, as part of a strategy to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. While this shift presents a major opportunity for India, challenges remain, including higher production costs compared to China and potential labor market rigidities. India needs to invest heavily in infrastructure and skills to become a truly independent manufacturing hub for Apple, but geopolitical tensions could hinder the transfer of technology and expertise from China.</p>
