          <p>Defensive lineman Desmond Watson, nicknamed "the tush push terminator," is turning heads at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers rookie minicamp. The undrafted free agent signing, who weighed 437 pounds at minicamp after previously being 464 pounds, is working to cut weight to make the Bucs' roster. Watson's ability to stuff the line of scrimmage could be an asset in stopping the short-yardage play popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles. Watson hopes to play for the team he grew up near, as he's from Plant City, which is east of Tampa.</p>
