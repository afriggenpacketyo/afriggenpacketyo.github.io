          <p>Chinese scientists have tested key components for a quantum-based network during a rocket flight to assess their resilience to space travel conditions. The experiment involved a laser module and a phase encoding device aboard a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket, which reached an altitude of 2.5km. This test is a crucial step toward building an integrated space-ground system for ultra-secure communications that do not require encryption keys. The successful completion of this test signifies China's progress in establishing a quantum secure direct communication network, which is considered a highly efficient and secure form of communication.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is implementing more aggressive tactics to address its ongoing homelessness crisis, including targeted sweeps of homeless encampments. Between June 2024 and June 2025, nearly 1,000 people have been arrested or cited for illegal camping, though few are ever charged. Mayor Daniel Lurie emphasizes that the city leads with services and aims to get people off the streets and into shelters, mental health care, and drug treatment programs. Despite criticisms regarding the suitability of available shelters, the city reports that nearly half of its 8,000 homeless individuals are now sheltered, a 35% increase since 2019, and business leaders are showing renewed engagement and optimism.</p>

          <p>A preliminary NTSB report indicates that an American Airlines flight that caught fire after takeoff from Denver International Airport in March had engine parts installed incorrectly. The report revealed a loose part inside the right engine, installed in the wrong direction, and fuel leaking from an incorrectly fastened fitting. Passengers and crew members noticed fire and smoke filling the cabin shortly after landing, leading to an evacuation on the plane's wings. The aircraft sustained substantial damage, and twelve passengers along with six crew members sustained minor injuries.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is cautioning residents about fraudulent online advertisements on social media offering discounted vehicle registration renewals. These deceptive ads request personal information and payments through unofficial channels like Cash App. The DMV emphasizes that it never asks for personal data or payments via social media or transaction apps. To avoid these scams, the DMV advises renewing vehicle registrations directly through the official DMV website, at a DMV kiosk, or by scheduling an appointment at a DMV office.</p>

'Ballerina' offers entertaining action sequences but lacks a compelling story, while 'Dangerous Animals' is praised for its suspense and strong performances. 'The Ritual' disappoints due to its weak plot and misuse of Al Pacino's talent, despite a commendable performance by Abigail Cowen. The reviews provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each film, catering to different audience preferences.</p>

          <p>Handwritten notes reveal Winston Churchill's frustration over the slow progress in securing penicillin supplies before D-Day. The documents show the prime minister's concern about Britain lagging behind the US in producing the "wonder drug," despite its British discovery. Although sufficient supplies were eventually obtained, mostly from the US, they were initially only for battle casualties. This highlights the critical importance of penicillin in treating wartime injuries and Churchill's determination to ensure its availability for the troops.</p>

Developers will be required to add panels unless the buildings meet specific exemptions, such as being shaded. The Home Builders Federation supports the initiative but cautions against burdensome paperwork that could hinder the construction of new homes.</p>
