          <p>Shari Redstone, chairwoman and controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, has been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. She underwent surgery last month to remove her thyroid gland, but the cancer had spread to her vocal cords, requiring ongoing radiation treatment. The news comes as Redstone navigates a turbulent sales process for Paramount, including a government review of the Skydance Media sale complicated by President Trump's lawsuit against CBS. Redstone has sought to settle the lawsuit, which alleges deceptive editing of a ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, but the situation has caused unrest within the company.</p>

"Ballerina" is praised for its action sequences and Ana de Armas' performance, while "Dangerous Animals" is noted for its suspense and credible acting. "The Ritual" is criticized for its hand-held camera style and reliance on jump scares, though Abigail Cowen's performance as the possessed Emma Schmidt is highlighted as a positive aspect.</p>

Developers will be required to add panels unless the buildings fall under certain exemptions such as being covered by shade. The regulations will be included in the Future Homes Standard, detailing a wider plan for improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. The move aims to save the typical household ¬£500 a year on energy bills, though the Home Builders Federation cautioned against burdensome paperwork that could harm efforts to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029.</p>
