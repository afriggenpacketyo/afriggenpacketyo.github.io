          <p>Oakland Athletics outfielder Brent Rooker humorously reacted on social media after ESPN's Jeff Passan suggested a different lineup for the MLB All-Star game's first-ever swing-off tiebreaker. Passan's preferred list did not include Rooker, who participated in the event, prompting the player to jokingly ask if he wasn't good enough. Rooker later clarified his comment was in jest, admitting he would also have chosen the players Passan listed over himself. The exchange highlighted a lighthearted moment amid discussions about player selections for the new All-Star format.</p>

          <p>A complex prisoner swap between the United States, Venezuela, and El Salvador has resulted in the release of ten Americans who were detained in Venezuela. The deal involved El Salvador returning 252 Venezuelan nationals, who had been deported from the U.S. and held in a high-security prison, to Venezuela. Among the freed Americans is former Navy SEAL Wilbert Joseph Castaneda, whose family stated he was an innocent man used as a political pawn. In return for the Venezuelans, the Maduro regime also released dozens of its own political prisoners.</p>

          <h2>Golfer Shane Lowry Expresses Disappointment Over Two-Stroke Penalty at The Open</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 18:08:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the second round of The Open, Irish golfer Shane Lowry received a two-stroke penalty after officials determined his ball moved during a practice swing in the rough. Lowry stated he did not see the ball move and expressed frustration over the lack of definitive camera angles, but ultimately accepted the penalty to protect his reputation. The R&A, the sport's governing body, explained that video evidence showed the ball's movement was discernible to the naked eye, which is the standard for the rule. The penalty changed Lowry's score from a 70 to a 72, leaving him further behind the tournament leader.</p>

          <p>Over 200 Venezuelan migrants, controversially deported from the U.S. to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison, have been sent to Venezuela as part of a major prisoner exchange. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele confirmed the deal, which also secured the release of 10 Americans and numerous political prisoners held by Venezuela. The migrants were initially deported under the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, with many families denying the U.S. government's claims of gang affiliation. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the maneuver, suggesting the administration was trying to avoid judicial accountability for detaining the individuals without due process.</p>

          <p>Shares of the fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, surged more than 10% in extended trading following the announcement that it will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often leads to a stock rally, as index funds and other portfolio managers must purchase the shares to rebalance their holdings. Despite being down 14% for the year, Block's addition reflects the increasing weight of the technology sector in the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has revised its internal practices to prevent engineers based in China from providing technical support for the company's U.S. defense and government cloud clients. The change is a direct response to a ProPublica report that raised national security and cybersecurity concerns about the arrangement. Previously, the work of Chinese engineers on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform was monitored by U.S.-based "digital escorts," a system the report suggested could leave the Pentagon vulnerable. The policy shift affects a significant part of Microsoft's business, which derives substantial revenue from government contracts.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans support the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Approximately two-thirds of the public favor these space exploration goals, with particularly strong support coming from younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also found that most people believe the 1969 Apollo 11 mission was a worthwhile endeavor. These views are broadly shared across different political and ideological lines, indicating a general consensus on the value of space exploration.</p>

This endorsement triggered a massive rally in the struggling company's stock, which had been at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq.

          <p>The price of the cryptocurrency Ether surged as President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, marking the first significant piece of crypto-focused legislation in the United States. The new law establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of digital currency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. This development, along with record inflows into Ether-based ETFs, has shifted the crypto market's spotlight toward Ether, which has gained nearly 44% in two weeks. The bill's passage is seen by the industry as a major step toward legitimizing digital assets within the traditional financial system.</p>
