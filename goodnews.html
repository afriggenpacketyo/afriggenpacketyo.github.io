        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will accelerate its military buildup to meet NATO's 2% of GDP defense spending target by March of next year, significantly earlier than the previously pledged 2030 or 2032 deadlines. This decision is motivated by increasing threats from Russia, China, and concerns about Arctic security, with Carney emphasizing the need for Canada to act in a world facing challenges akin to those at the end of World War II. The new strategy involves investing in soldiers and equipment, expanding military capabilities, strengthening the domestic defense industry, and diversifying defense partnerships, backed by a C$9.3bn cash increase for this fiscal year. The plan includes investments in new submarines, aircraft, ships, armored vehicles, artillery, drones, and sensors for Arctic monitoring, along with the creation of a new defense procurement agency to expedite decision-making.</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies has pledged to contribute $1,000 to so-called Trump accounts for newborns of its employees, matching the government's proposed contribution under a savings program for babies delivered in the United States, should it become law. CEO Michael Dell made this commitment during a White House roundtable with President Donald Trump, where Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs chief David Solomon also expressed support for the savings account plan. The program, previously referred to as "Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement" or "MAGA Accounts," would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. The provision to create these accounts passed the House as part of a major tax-cut bill and is currently pending in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Merck‚Äôs RSV shot, Enflonsia, for infants, creating a competitor to Sanofi and AstraZeneca's Beyfortus in the market for infant respiratory syncytial virus protection. Merck plans to begin taking orders for the shot in July, aiming to deliver shipments before the typical RSV season begins in the fall. This approval provides doctors with another option to combat RSV, a leading cause of hospitalization among newborns, and comes as Sanofi reveals efforts to increase the supply of Beyfortus following shortages in the previous season. Both Enflonsia and Beyfortus are preventative monoclonal antibodies, but they target different parts of the virus, and Merck's shot can be administered regardless of an infant's weight, offering potential dosing convenience.</p>

Host city committees are grappling with issues such as slow visa processing times, travel restrictions, and immigration raids that have led to the arrest and deportation of visa holders and permanent residents.

Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios, which he co-founded, filed the defamation suit in response to Lively's allegations and a related article in The New York Times. Judge Lewis J.
