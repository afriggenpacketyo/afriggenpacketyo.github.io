          <p>Elon Musk announced that Tesla's robotaxi service is tentatively scheduled to begin in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with a small initial rollout of 10 to 20 Model Y vehicles using an unsupervised version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology. The service will be geofenced, limiting initial operational areas, and remotely monitored by employees, with safety being the primary concern, potentially causing date shifts. Musk shared a video of driverless vehicle testing in Austin, while protests are planned by safety advocates and those opposing Musk's political views. The Dawn Project and other anti-Musk groups plan a demonstration to highlight safety concerns with Tesla's vehicles and driver assistance features. The new service is expected to be closely watched by both enthusiasts and critics alike.</p>

          <p>Mikie Sherrill, a U.S. Representative, won the Democratic primary for governor in New Jersey, defeating a field of experienced rivals with her background as a navy pilot and former prosecutor. She will face Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli in the November general election, seeking to maintain Democratic control of the governorship for a third consecutive term. Sherrill's campaign focused on making the state more affordable, with emphasis on lowering housing costs through development tax credits. Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker, aims to win back the governorship for the Republicans after narrowly losing to the incumbent in 2021, while balancing his relationship with President Trump.</p>
