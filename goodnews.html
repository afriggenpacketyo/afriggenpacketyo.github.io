According to royal lore, the Queen entrusted her jewels to her coiffeur before her attempted escape from Paris in 1791. The diamond is expected to sell for between $3,000,000 and $5,000,000, with the auction taking place on June 17.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that removing fluoride from public water supplies could lead to a significant increase in tooth decay and dental care costs for children in the United States. The study projects an additional 25.4 million cases of tooth decay and $9.8 billion in associated costs over five years if water fluoridation is halted. The effects would disproportionately impact publicly insured and uninsured children, who already face higher risks of unmet dental needs. The American Dental Association maintains that water fluoridation is safe and effective in preventing cavities, supported by decades of research.</p>

The MIND diet, a combination of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, emphasizes brain-healthy foods such as leafy greens, berries, nuts, and olive oil. Participants who closely followed the diet had a 9% lower risk of dementia, while those who improved their adherence over 10 years had a 25% lower risk.

          <p>For the first time in at least 25 years, more office space is being removed than added in the U.S., indicating a shift in the commercial real estate market. Office conversions and demolitions are projected to exceed new construction, shrinking the overall office footprint, according to data from CBRE Group. This trend is driven by the rise of remote work, leading to high office vacancies and a need to repurpose obsolete space.
