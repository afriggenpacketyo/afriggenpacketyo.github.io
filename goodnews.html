          <p>The sequel "M3GAN 2.0" expands its universe by pivoting from horror to action-comedy, introducing a new, more advanced military android named AMELIA to rival the titular killer doll. The film sees M3GAN's creator, Gemma, now an anti-technology advocate, while her niece Cady develops an interest in computer science. This article's review notes that the movie borrows heavily from classics like "The Terminator" but maintains a shaggy sense of humor, focusing on the blend between biological and synthetic beings. While deemed more silly than scary, the film is praised for its entertaining B-movie charm and self-aware gags.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has proposed changes that would lower capital requirements for the largest U.S. banks, signaling a shift toward looser financial regulation under the Trump administration. The proposal would adjust the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio on a bank-by-bank basis, potentially freeing up capital for lending, bond purchases, and shareholder returns. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman stated the move aims to address unintended consequences of post-crisis rules and is a first step toward broader reforms. However, the proposal faced dissent from other Fed governors who warned it could increase systemic risk. (not investment advice)</p>

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the deadlines are "not critical" and could be pushed back, offering a signal of flexibility in ongoing trade negotiations. The administration had granted a 90-day pause on its "reciprocal tariffs" to allow time for deals to be made. With the deadlines approaching and few agreements finalized, officials suggest that extensions are likely for countries engaged in good-faith negotiations with the United States.

          <p>After a period of decline, interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have recently ticked up, but homeowners may see relief later this summer. This article outlines three key dates when variable HELOC rates could potentially fall. The first is the release of the June inflation report on July 15, as a favorable reading could encourage lenders to lower rates. The other two opportunities are the Federal Reserve meetings in late July and mid-September, where the central bank could either cut its benchmark rate or provide strong signals about future reductions, influencing the broader rate environment.
