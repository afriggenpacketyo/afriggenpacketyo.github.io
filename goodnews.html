          <p>Consumers planning holiday decorating are advised to shop early due to anticipated shortages and higher prices for artificial Christmas trees, lights, and wreaths. A major importer, National Tree Company, reduced imports by 25% and raised prices by 10% because of trade war tariffs. This trend, confirmed by import data, suggests a challenging retail season for holiday goods. The Christmas Trade Group is engaging with the administration to mitigate these impacts for consumers.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard a case challenging Illinois's voting regulation allowing mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days post-election, brought by a winning candidate claiming harm to his victory margin. Both conservative and liberal justices expressed skepticism towards the arguments presented by the plaintiff, Representative Michael Bost, and the state of Illinois. The court's questioning highlighted concerns about the standing of candidates to sue over election rules when they ultimately win, and the broader implications for electoral challenges.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is slated for a 'routine yearly checkup' at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, marking his second such visit since April. The White House stated he would also meet with troops. Previous medical reports declared Trump 'fully fit,' despite a recent diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency and visible bruising attributed to frequent handshaking. The visit comes amidst ongoing public speculation about the 79-year-old president's health, which the White House has previously dismissed.</p>
