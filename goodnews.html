          <p>Former LSU gymnast Livvy Dunne has once again spoken out against a 2022 New York Times article that featured her under the headline "Sex Sells." Dunne claims the newspaper's staff instructed her to wear her team leotard for the photoshoot, which they then used to argue that female college athletes are rewarded for "traditional feminine desirability" over athletic skill. She recounted how she mocked the headline on social media, an act which she says led to a modeling opportunity with Sports Illustrated. Dunne has previously called the piece "BS," stating the reporter asked "weird" questions about her appearance.</p>

          <p>This article collection reflects on the modern family vacation, suggesting that such trips are not a cure-all for life's tensions and will not fundamentally change who people are. It explores how family travel has evolved, with a growing trend of multi-generational trips, which can reveal new dimensions of relatives' personalities. The piece also offers practical advice for a happier vacation, such as planning ahead and avoiding the pressure to post on social media. Ultimately, it encourages embracing the experience for what it is, without placing unrealistic expectations on it to solve deeper issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kayem Foods Inc. is recalling more than 24,000 pounds of its "al fresco" brand ready-to-eat chicken sausage products due to possible contamination with pieces of white plastic. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued the announcement after the company received three consumer complaints. The recall affects 11-ounce packages of "SWEET APPLE" chicken sausage with a "use/freeze by" date of October 1, 2025. While no injuries have been reported, consumers are advised to discard the product or return it to the place of purchase.</p>

          <h2>Bestselling Author Argues "Follow Your Passion" is Poor Career Advice</h2>

          <p>Author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway identifies "follow your passion" as the worst piece of career advice, suggesting it's typically given by people who are already wealthy. Instead of blindly pursuing a passion, he advises finding an intersection between one's talents and what is financially viable. Galloway emphasizes the importance of resilience and enduring rejection to find success. This sentiment is echoed by Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach, who recommends combining passion with personal strengths and what the world values, a process that may involve pivoting and learning from setbacks.</p>

          <h2>UK Faces Further Rain and Thunderstorm Alerts with Threat of Flash Floods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 09:50:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is under yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms across all four nations, with the Met Office cautioning about potential flash flooding, power cuts, and travel disruption. An earlier, more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the feared widespread flooding, though some areas received significant rainfall. The wet weather follows a heatwave that left the ground dry and less able to absorb water, increasing flood risk. Further alerts are in place for the coming days, covering large parts of England and Scotland.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona has reportedly initiated talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, a move the player is said to prefer. The proposed deal would be an initial loan with an option to buy. Rashford, who has been told to train separately from the main squad, has reportedly fallen out of favor with head coach Ruben Amorim. For Manchester United, the transfer would provide a significant wage bill saving, freeing up funds for new signings. Barcelona's sporting director has previously expressed admiration for Rashford, who himself has stated a desire to play alongside Barcelona's young stars.</p>

During the trip, Huang announced that Washington had approved the export of a less powerful, made-for-China AI chip, the H20, following a ban on more advanced models. His visit to the China International Supply Chain Expo, where US firms were the largest overseas contingent, was seen as a charm offensive. However, despite the positive gestures and recent progress in trade negotiations, underlying tensions and fears of a renewed trade war continue to lurk.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Americans on average believe they would need a net worth of $839,000 to feel financially comfortable, financial experts argue this metric can be misleading. A certified financial planner suggests that net worth is just a snapshot in time and doesn't capture the full picture of one's financial health, such as cash flow or alignment with personal values. True financial comfort, the article posits, comes from ensuring money management aligns with core values, like freedom or security. Experts advise focusing less on a target number and more on what that money would enable you to do. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fact-check by DW refutes social media claims that sunscreen use increases the risk of skin cancer, labeling the assertion as false. Public health officials confirm there is no scientific evidence to support this link. The article explores reasons for the myth, noting that rising skin cancer diagnoses are likely due to better detection, increased sun exposure, and historical use of less effective products. While global sunscreen sales are rising, data shows inconsistent use by the public, with many applying it only on vacation or in summer, not as a daily protective measure.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a stake in Global Payments, a payment processing company whose stock has fallen significantly since 2021. The company's recent, poorly received acquisition of Worldpay has lowered investor confidence, creating an opening for an activist investor. Elliott is expected to push for changes to restore credibility, such as reconstituting the board with members experienced in large integrations, holding management accountable, and focusing on deleveraging. The analysis suggests that with shareholder representation from a firm like Elliott, Global Payments has a better chance of successfully integrating Worldpay and increasing its value.

The Lions established a dominant 24-5 lead early in the second half with tries from Sione Tuipulotu, Tom Curry, and Dan Sheehan, looking poised for a comfortable victory. However, their performance faltered in the final 30 minutes, allowing the Wallabies to score two late tries and narrow the margin. While the Lions secured the win and a 1-0 series lead, the team's late-game loss of discipline and accuracy left a sense of confusion despite the victory.</p>
