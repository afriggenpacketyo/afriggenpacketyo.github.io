        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has recommended that veterinary practices be required to publish their price lists to increase transparency for pet owners. An investigation found that vet prices have risen at nearly twice the rate of inflation, with owners often unaware of costs for treatments that can amount to thousands of pounds. The watchdog's proposals aim to help consumers compare costs and make informed decisions, addressing concerns that large corporate vet groups charge significantly more than independent practices and that the current regulatory system is outdated.</p>

          <p>Semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML has sought to ease investor concerns by stating it does not expect its 2026 sales to fall below 2025 levels. However, the Dutch firm also warned of a "significant" decrease in customer demand and sales in China next year, a consequence of tightening U.S. export restrictions. Despite the geopolitical headwinds, the company is benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom, which fueled strong orders in the third quarter and has helped maintain a positive outlook for the current year.

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region posted gains, bucking the downward trend seen on Wall Street, which was affected by a renewed trade dispute between the United States and China. The positive performance in Asia came after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized China's purchasing of soybeans and threatened further "retribution," heightening market volatility. In the U.S., Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a potential halt to reducing bond holdings and suggested that more interest rate cuts could be forthcoming, influencing investor sentiment globally.

The Scottish sprinter, who earned silver and bronze medals at both the Tokyo and Paris Games, explained that he struggled to find the motivation to continue after the last Olympics. Carlin stated that after taking time away from the high-performance environment, the "fire to go" did not return, and he felt he could no longer give the 100% commitment required to compete at the elite level.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' success in the postseason has been significantly driven by the performance of the lower half of their batting order, as demonstrated in their 5-1 win over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 2 of the NLCS. While the team's top stars were kept relatively quiet, hitters from the sixth through ninth spots combined for seven hits and three RBIs, providing the crucial offense. This trend of lineup depth has been consistent throughout the playoffs, with these players collectively outperforming the top of the order and putting constant pressure on opposing pitchers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving the $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him fully intact. The ruling finalizes the penalty awarded to the families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims, whom Jones had falsely claimed were crisis actors in a staged event. Jones had argued that the default judgment against him was improper, but the high court's decision not to take up the case effectively ends his legal challenges to the massive verdict, though he is currently in bankruptcy proceedings.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has announced a significant policy shift for ChatGPT, stating that the platform will soon permit erotic content for verified adult users. This change, expected to roll out in December, is part of a principle to "treat adult users like adults" and comes as the company implements more robust age-gating and safety features. The move represents a relaxation of previous content restrictions, which were initially implemented to mitigate potential mental health risks but were seen by some as making the chatbot less useful for a broader adult audience.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a television advertisement from Red Tractor, the country's largest farm and food certification scheme, for making unsubstantiated environmental claims. The ruling found the ad was misleading because it exaggerated the environmental benefits of its certified products and provided insufficient evidence that its member farms comply with basic environmental laws. The complaint was brought by the environmental group River Action, which accused the organization of "greenwashing" its image to consumers.</p>
