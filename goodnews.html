          <p>A federal judge ordered Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate, to be released from immigration custody on bail while she challenges her detention following the revocation of her student visa. Judge William Sessions cited concerns about violations of her First Amendment and due process rights, noting the Trump administration's justification for revoking her visa was based on an opinion piece she co-authored about Israel's war with Hamas. Ozturk alleges her detainment is unlawful and has suffered multiple asthma attacks while in ICE detention.
