Reinhart, who scored four goals in the deciding game, expressed that the second win felt even sweeter than the first. The Panthers are the first team since the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2020 and 2021 to achieve back-to-back Stanley Cups, sparking discussions about whether they are on the verge of becoming a dynasty.

          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type, dubbed "Gwada negative," in a woman from Guadeloupe, marking the 48th blood group system recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion. The discovery was made after researchers analyzed a blood sample from the patient, revealing a unique antibody and a genetic mutation. The woman, now 54 and living in Paris, is believed to be the only known carrier of this blood type, making her compatible only with herself. Scientists hope to find others with the same blood group to improve care for patients with rare blood types.</p>

          <p>Jack Draper's aspirations to win the Queen's Club Championships were dashed by Jiri Lehecka in a semi-final match where Draper was suffering from tonsillitis. Despite feeling unwell, Draper battled through the match, losing 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, and expressed his determination to compete despite his condition. Lehecka's crucial break at 5-5 in the third set led to Draper smashing his racquet in frustration before Lehecka served out the victory. Draper now plans to rest before preparing for Wimbledon, which begins on June 30.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lemon water, a popular trend on social media, is often touted for its supposed detoxifying and weight-loss benefits; however, experts debunk these claims, emphasizing that the liver and kidneys naturally detoxify the body. While lemon water does not burn fat or boost metabolism, it can contribute to hydration and may replace sugary drinks, indirectly aiding in calorie reduction. Although lemons contain vitamin C, relying solely on lemon water is not a sufficient source, and its acidity can potentially weaken tooth enamel. Consuming lemon water as a morning ritual can be a healthy habit if it encourages greater water intake.</p>

          <p>Steve Bannon played an outsized role in President Trump's decision-making process regarding potential military action against Iran, despite holding no official government position. Bannon advised against a U.S. attack, citing concerns about the reliability of Israeli intelligence and the potential ineffectiveness of the "bunker-buster" bomb. While other advisors favored military action, Bannon's influence reflected the "America First," noninterventionist stance of the MAGA movement. Trump ultimately decided to hold off on a strike for now, but the situation remains fluid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches the US, experts are highlighting that American sunscreens may be less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. This is attributed to regulatory differences, with the FDA not approving new UV-filtering ingredients in over 20 years. Countries like Europe and South Korea have approved a wider range of ingredients, allowing for more advanced sunscreens. A bipartisan bill aims to modernize sunscreen regulations in the US, but dermatologists still stress the importance of wearing sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>
