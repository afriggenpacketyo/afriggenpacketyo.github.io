        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ryan Garc√≠a acknowledged the impact of a year-long period of inactivity following his defeat to Rolando Romero in New York. Garc√≠a, who lost by unanimous decision, admitted that the break, partly due to a suspension for a failed drug test, affected his performance in the ring. Romero's strategic approach and Garcia's cautiousness after an early knockdown contributed to the outcome. The fight casts doubt on a potential rematch between Garc√≠a and Devin Haney.

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amid a challenging economic backdrop marked by inflation and housing affordability issues. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton are vying for leadership, both acknowledging the country's difficult circumstances. Voters are primarily concerned with cost-of-living pressures, leading to a focus on economic policies during the campaign. The election also reflects a broader trend of voters moving away from the major parties, seeking alternative options.

          <p>The United States has implemented a 25% import tax on key car parts, adding to the challenges faced by the automotive industry. This tariff follows a similar tax on imported cars and is intended to incentivize domestic manufacturing. However, analysts predict that the tariffs will likely lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers. While companies have seen a temporary sales surge due to concerns about price hikes, warnings of increased costs and production risks have emerged.</p>

          <p>The elimination of tariff exemptions for inexpensive goods is impacting advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms. The expansion of the tariff-free shipment loophole allowed low-cost online retailers like Temu and Shein to flourish, which led to increased digital advertising. Now, with the end of the loophole, these companies are subject to tariffs, which is expected to deal a blow to their business model. Temu has already stopped shipping products directly from China to the US, and Shein has not yet responded to requests for comment, and both have reduced their advertising spending.</p>
