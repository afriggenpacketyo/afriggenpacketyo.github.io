          <p>The New York Knicks are expected to name Mike Brown as their next head coach, following the surprising dismissal of Tom Thibodeau after a successful playoff run. Brown, who most recently coached the Sacramento Kings, brings extensive experience, having previously led the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers. He has coached legendary players like LeBron James and Kobe Bryant and served as an associate head coach for the Golden State Warriors during their championship years. While a formal contract has not been finalized, the move concludes the Knicks' wide-ranging search to find new leadership for the team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's plan to severely restrict access to the U.S. asylum system for migrants crossing the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president's proclamation, which cited an "invasion" to justify the policy, unlawfully supplants the immigration laws established by Congress. The judge stated that neither the Constitution nor existing statutes grant the executive branch the unilateral authority to create an alternative immigration system. The order has been temporarily stayed for 14 days to allow the administration to appeal the decision, which marks a significant setback for its immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. The decision blocks a plan to end the program in September, months ahead of a previously established 2026 deadline. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan stated that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official expiration. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, arguing that district courts cannot prohibit the executive branch from enforcing immigration laws and that conditions in Haiti have improved sufficiently.</p>

          <p>As Europe experiences a record-breaking heatwave, the European Commission has formally proposed a new climate target to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. This goal is intended to keep the bloc on track for its 2050 net-zero target and provide certainty for investors in green technology. However, the proposal faces resistance from some member states who find it too ambitious. Additionally, a controversial clause allowing countries to use international carbon credits to offset a small portion of their emissions has drawn sharp criticism from environmental activists.</p>

          <p>India's captain Shubman Gill scored a patient century, helping his team reach 310-5 at the close of the first day of the second Test against England at Edgbaston.

England's bowlers managed to take key wickets, including Rishabh Pant and Nitish Kumar Reddy in quick succession after tea, but Gill remained composed.

          <p>Researchers are launching a new expedition to a remote Pacific island in hopes of solving the 88-year-old mystery of Amelia Earhart's disappearance. The mission was prompted by a 2015 satellite image of Nikumaroro island that may show part of Earhart's Lockheed Electra aircraft protruding from the sand. Purdue University, where Earhart taught, is organizing the trip to investigate the site, which may have been exposed by a cyclone. While some experts are skeptical, proponents point to the object's size and location near Earhart's intended route as strong evidence justifying the new search for the long-lost plane.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is scaling up a program to breed and release billions of sterile male screwworm flies over Mexico and southern Texas. This effort aims to combat the flesh-eating larvae of the New World Screwworm, a pest that can devastate livestock, wildlife, and occasionally infect humans. The technique involves releasing irradiated sterile males to mate with wild females, whose eggs then fail to hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This biological control method, which successfully eradicated the pest from the U.S. decades ago, is being revived as the fly has reappeared in southern Mexico.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For those considering depositing a significant sum like $10,000 into a certificate of deposit (CD), this article outlines several key questions to ask first. Savers should evaluate whether a short-term or long-term CD is more advantageous, as current rate trends have inverted historical norms. It is also crucial to assess one's ability to keep such a large amount of money inaccessible for the entire term to avoid early withdrawal penalties. Finally, individuals should compare the benefits of a CD against high-yield savings and money market accounts, which offer comparable rates with greater liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>
