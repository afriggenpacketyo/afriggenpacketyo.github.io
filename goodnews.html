          <p>Ticket reseller StubHub is targeting a valuation of up to $9.2 billion in its initial public offering (IPO), aiming to raise as much as $851 million. The company plans to sell over 34 million shares at a price range of $22 to $25 each, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." The move signals a rebound in the IPO market after a period of uncertainty. This is StubHub's latest attempt to go public, having previously postponed its efforts in 2024 due to market volatility.

After the father caught a home run ball and gave it to his son for his birthday, a woman was filmed aggressively demanding the ball from them. The father ultimately gave her the ball to de-escalate the situation. In response to the unpleasant incident, both the Phillies and the opposing Miami Marlins provided the boy with gifts, including a signed baseball bat from the player who hit the home run, turning a negative experience into a positive memory.</p>

          <p>The price of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin has surged over 8% amid growing speculation that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could soon approve the first-ever Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Investment firms REX Shares and Osprey Funds have filed a prospectus for a Dogecoin ETF, potentially using a faster approval path under the "40 Act." An approved ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin through traditional stock exchanges, potentially boosting its legitimacy and accessibility. The development has sparked bullish sentiment among crypto traders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new mural by the street artist Banksy has appeared on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork depicts a judge in a wig and robe striking a protester on the ground. Banksy claimed the piece on his Instagram, and its appearance follows a recent large-scale protest in the city. Court officials have covered the artwork and stated it will be removed, citing the building's listed status. The piece is consistent with the artist's history of creating politically charged works that are critical of government and authority.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run, a major half marathon in the UK, have apologized after finisher medals and T-shirts mistakenly featured an image of the wrong city. The design was intended to show an aerial view of the race route through Newcastle and Gateshead but instead depicted the nearby rival city of Sunderland and the River Wear. In a humorous apology, the Great Run Company admitted the mistake, calling the items the "most unique" in the event's history. The error amused many online, particularly given the historic football rivalry between Newcastle and Sunderland.</p>

While investors are closely watching the situation in Paris, broader market sentiment appeared to be influenced by hopes for a U.S. interest rate cut following weaker-than-expected jobs data. The market's positive performance suggests that, for now, concerns over French instability are being balanced by other global economic factors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld the $83.3 million jury verdict against President Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The three-judge panel unanimously rejected Trump's arguments that he was protected by presidential immunity and that the damages awarded were excessive. The court affirmed that the jury's conclusion was "fair and reasonable" given the "extraordinary and egregious facts" of the case. This ruling marks another significant legal defeat for Trump in the long-running legal battle initiated by Carroll after he denied her sexual assault allegations.</p>

Being added to the benchmark index typically boosts a company's stock price, as passive index funds are required to purchase its shares to track the S&P 500.
