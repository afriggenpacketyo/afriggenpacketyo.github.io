          <h2>Understanding Debt Management Programs for High-Interest Credit Card Balances</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 11:53:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains how debt management programs can provide a path out of high-interest credit card debt. These programs, offered through credit counseling agencies, work with creditors to lower interest rates and consolidate multiple payments into one manageable monthly bill. While they do not reduce the total balance owed, they can make repayment more affordable and predictable, though consumers should be aware of monthly fees and the requirement to close included credit card accounts.

          <h2>Exploring Options for Credit Card Debt Forgiveness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 11:52:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For those with overwhelming credit card debt, debt forgiveness presents a potential, though risky, solution. The primary methods are debt settlement programs, where a company negotiates to pay a lump sum that is less than the total balance, and bankruptcy, which can offer a complete financial reset. Both options can severely damage a person's credit score and may have tax implications for the forgiven amount, making it crucial to consider less drastic alternatives like consolidation loans or hardship programs first.

          <p>French Olympic fencer Ysaora Thibus has been cleared of a doping allegation after a sports tribunal accepted her defense of contamination through kissing. The Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed an appeal from the World Anti-Doping Agency, which had sought a four-year ban. The court found it scientifically plausible that the anabolic substance ostarine was transferred from her partner, U.S. fencer Race Imboden, who was unknowingly using a product containing it. This ruling allowed Thibus to compete in the Paris Olympics.</p>

          <p>A U.S. envoy has praised Lebanon's response to a Washington proposal for the complete disarmament of Hezbollah in exchange for an Israeli troop withdrawal from its southern region. The plan aims to de-escalate tensions and establish a path toward peace, with the envoy noting both Lebanon and Israel ultimately seek to avoid war. The article also suggests this diplomatic progress could potentially lead to Lebanon joining the Abraham Accords, normalizing relations with Israel, a key foreign policy goal for the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Wimbledon officials have adjusted their electronic line-calling system to prevent a recurrence of a controversial incident caused by human error. During a fourth-round match, an operator accidentally deactivated the Hawk-Eye ball-tracking technology, leading to a disputed call and a replayed point. In response, the All England Club has removed the ability for operators to manually disable the system. The incident has also renewed discussions about implementing a video review system for umpires, similar to those used in other major tournaments.</p>

          <p>Despite claims that President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security, the legislation does not actually change how benefits are taxed. Instead, it introduces a new, temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older who fall below certain income thresholds. Policy experts note this provides some relief but primarily benefits higher-income seniors, while doing little for low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax on their benefits.
