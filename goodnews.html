          <p>New York Mets pitcher Jonah Tong has shared a unique culinary preference that has captured the attention of baseball fans. The Canadian player revealed that his secret to a great grilled cheese sandwich is using maple syrup as a dipping sauce. Tong credits his grandfather with introducing him to the sweet and savory combination, which he describes as "unbelievable" and his favorite thing. The rookie pitcher recently made his major league debut after being selected by the Mets in the 2022 MLB Draft.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, Germany's former foreign minister from the Green Party, has officially started her one-year term as the President of the United Nations General Assembly. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot, reportedly at Russia's request, due to her vocal criticism of the war in Ukraine. Baerbock's nomination by the previous German government faced some domestic criticism, including from the new Chancellor Friedrich Merz. In her new role, she will chair meetings and help prepare for the election of the next UN Secretary-General, pledging to act as a unifier for all 193 member states.</p>

She describes the significant personal sacrifices required, including uprooting her family from their life in South Bend, Indiana, and the loss of privacy that came with intense public scrutiny. Barrett shares an anecdote about escaping media crews by scaling a fence in high heels after a church service.

          <p>Artist and mycologist Sam Shoemaker successfully paddled a 26.4-mile open-ocean route from Catalina Island to San Pedro, California, in a kayak he grew entirely from mycelium, the root-like network of fungi. The 12-hour journey aims to highlight the potential of mycelium-based materials, known as AquaFung, as a biodegradable alternative to plastics used in marine equipment. Shoemaker cultivated the kayak by growing a network of wild Ganoderma polychromum mycelium on a hemp substrate inside a fiberglass mold. His successful crossing marks a significant achievement for a nascent community of researchers exploring innovative and sustainable material applications for fungi.</p>

A United executive stated the new flights are intended to provide customers with alternative options in case of service disruptions from Spirit.

          <p>The US Eagles have been eliminated from the Rugby World Cup despite a commanding 60-0 victory over Samoa in their final pool match. Australia's subsequent performance against England was enough to secure the last quarter-final spot on points differential. While the team will be disappointed to miss the knockout stage, their performance highlighted the emergence of new talent. Young stars like 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored four tries against Samoa, and lock Erica Jarrell-Searcy represent a bright future for the team as they look ahead to the next World Cup cycle.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits, or "sleep hygiene," for babies is one of the most critical things parents can do for their child's future well-being. These habits are foundational for a child's physical, mental, and cognitive development, impacting their ability to learn and regulate emotions later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises that recreating a womb-like environment with warmth, white noise, and gentle motion can help newborns settle. He also recommends creating a flexible routine and ensuring the baby is well-fed and burped to promote deeper, more consistent sleep.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece makes the case that solar energy should appeal to right-wing survivalists, despite its association with left-leaning environmentalism. The author argues that unlike fossil fuels, which rely on complex and vulnerable supply chains, solar power offers true self-sufficiency and resilience. A solar panel and battery system provides a simple, durable, and long-lasting energy source that is independent of any grid or external supplier, making it ideal for weathering societal disruptions. The article suggests that this shared interest in self-reliance could be a point of unity in a polarized society.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first victory as head coach of the University of North Carolina football team with a 20-3 win over Charlotte. Following the game, he addressed reports about his relationship with his former team, the New England Patriots, confirming he has banned their scouts from UNC practices. Belichick stated that since he feels he is not welcome in the Patriots' facility, they are not welcome in his, signaling a clear deterioration of the relationship. The win provided a much-needed boost for the Tar Heels after an embarrassing season-opening loss.</p>

          <p>Vinted, the popular online marketplace for second-hand clothing, was founded in Lithuania in 2008 out of a simple necessity. Co-founder Milda Mitkutė needed to downsize her wardrobe of 300 items after moving to a smaller apartment. She discussed the idea of a website to sell her unwanted clothes with a friend, Justas Janauskas, and within two weeks, they had launched a basic site. The platform, which allows users to sell items without a commission fee, grew through word-of-mouth and expanded internationally. In 2019, Vinted became Lithuania's first "unicorn" startup, valued at over a billion dollars.</p>
