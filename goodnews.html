          <p>Fair Isaac's CEO, Will Lansing, has responded to criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency regarding price increases for FICO credit scores. Lansing argued that the cost, at $4.95 for a mortgage score, is a minor part of closing costs and not a barrier to homeownership. This defense comes after the FHFA allowed lenders to use rival VantageScore and disparaged FICO as a monopoly, a move Lansing claims raises safety and soundness concerns for the mortgage market.</p>

The article advises savers to act before their CDs automatically renew, potentially at lower rates, and to shop around for the best available terms, possibly locking in current high rates for an extended period.

The city's planning department had previously cited terrorism concerns for not publicizing the routes, a justification the law's author called a "dubious claim."</p>
