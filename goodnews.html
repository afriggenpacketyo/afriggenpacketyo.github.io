          <p>The United States and South Korea have finalized a trade deal, setting a 15% tariff on most South Korean goods, a reduction from the threatened 25%. As part of the agreement, South Korea will invest $350 billion in selected U.S. industries, including shipbuilding and semiconductors, and purchase $100 billion in American energy products. While Seoul successfully protected its sensitive beef and rice markets from further opening, the deal has been criticized for negating the benefits of the existing U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. Discrepancies remain between Washington and Seoul regarding the control and use of the investment funds. (not investment advice)</p>

In a statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she decided her public service would not be in elected office for now, though she intends to remain active in politics. A source close to Harris indicated that the decision keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential run and that she wants to focus on campaigning for Democrats and other public engagement.</p>

          <p>The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) has established a $1.3 million legal defense fund to support Christians and churches in Europe facing legal challenges over their biblical beliefs. The fund was seeded with money from legal settlements BGEA won in the U.K. after its events were canceled by venues. Franklin Graham and his daughter, Cissie Graham Lynch, stated the initiative is a response to a global crackdown on religious freedom and aims to combat the "silencing of Christians." They also emphasized the importance of defending religious speech in the United States.</p>

          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a rival proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which they claim would be less costly and disruptive as it would avoid the need to reroute the M25 motorway. This development introduces competition into the long-debated expansion project for the first time. The government is now set to review both proposals to determine the future of the critical infrastructure project.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported strong second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, with revenue climbing 45% year-over-year to $989 million. The company's net income more than doubled, and it added 2.3 million funded customers, bringing its total to 26.5 million. Growth was driven by strong net deposits and higher valuations in equities and cryptocurrency, though transaction revenue from crypto and equities slightly missed forecasts. The company is expanding into wealth management and plans to launch Robinhood Banking this fall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dodgers' two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani caused a moment of concern when he left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning accompanied by a trainer. The team later announced the issue was only cramping, a relief for the club despite their eventual 5-2 loss. Ohtani was able to remain in the game as the designated hitter, though his early exit from the mound highlighted the challenges of his return to pitching after surgery. The loss concluded a disappointing month for the Dodgers, who saw their division lead narrow.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The rate remains in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, though in an unusual move, two board members dissented, signaling growing support for lower rates. The decision comes as policymakers weigh the uncertain effects of new tariffs and tax cuts on the economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has argued for a cautious approach while the job market is stable, but acknowledges risks if tariffs begin to slow growth.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: The Science Behind How Earthquakes Generate Tsunamis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 20:03:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Russia, experts explain the science behind how such events create tsunamis. A tsunami is typically generated by a strong underwater earthquake, usually at least a magnitude 6.5, that causes a vertical shift in the seafloor. This displacement creates a series of powerful waves that can travel across deep oceans at the speed of a jet airliner. As the waves approach shallower coastal waters, they slow down and increase dramatically in height, releasing immense energy and causing destructive flooding, as this article details.</p>

          <p>A scientific expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed what they describe as "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led research team observed dense beds of clams, tube worms, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the scarcity of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest these "chemosynthetic" communities may be widespread in the planet's deepest trenches.</p>

          <p>A growing number of scientists are challenging the widely held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children's brains, arguing that the scientific evidence is often flawed and inconclusive. Researchers like psychologist Pete Etchells point out that many studies rely on unreliable self-reporting and fail to distinguish between different types of screen use. While some studies link high social media use to depression, others find little to no connection between screen time and poor mental health, suggesting factors like loneliness may be more significant. This scientific uncertainty complicates guidance for parents.</p>

          <p>Researchers have used near-infrared digital photography to reveal the stunningly intricate tattoos on a 2,500-year-old "ice mummy" from the Pazyryk culture of Siberia. The high-resolution images show detailed decorations of mythical creatures and animals that were previously difficult to see, showcasing a high level of sophistication. The analysis suggests the tattoos were likely made using a multi-pointed tool, possibly from animal bone, and a stencil. The discovery provides a closer look at the personal life and cultural practices of these ancient nomadic people.</p>
