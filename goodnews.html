          <p>A major power outage disrupted the final day of the Cannes Film Festival in southeastern France, affecting approximately 160,000 households and threatening the closing ceremony. The outage, caused by a fire at an electrical substation and damage to a high-voltage line, prompted a police investigation into possible arson. Power was restored hours before the ceremony, allowing scheduled events to proceed as planned. Traffic lights and train services were disrupted, and many shops remained closed during the outage, but festival organizers ensured the Palais des Festivals had an independent power supply to continue operations.</p>

          <p>Shoaib Bashir's impressive six-wicket haul secured a decisive victory for England against Zimbabwe by an innings and 45 runs within three days of their one-off Test match. Bashir's performance broke Zimbabwe's resistance, marking his best figures in Test cricket. Despite some lackluster seam bowling on the third morning, England capitalized on Bashir's talent, who became the youngest England bowler to reach 50 Test wickets and the fourth to achieve three five-wicket hauls before the age of 22. Harry Brook's spectacular catch at second slip further contributed to England's triumph.</p>
