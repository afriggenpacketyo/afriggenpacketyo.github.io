        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As gold prices surge due to market volatility and economic uncertainty, investors are increasingly turning to the gold-silver ratio to inform their strategies. The gold-silver ratio measures how many ounces of silver are needed to purchase one ounce of gold, providing insights into the relative value of each metal. Currently, with gold around $3,200 per ounce and silver at $32, the ratio is high, suggesting silver may be undervalued. While silver is more cost-effective, it's also more volatile than gold, which is often favored for portfolio diversification. Investors use the ratio as a guide to decide whether to buy or sell gold versus silver, though opinions vary on whether the ratio will return to its historical average.</p>

Musk made this declaration during an interview at Bloomberg's Qatar Economic Forum, addressing investor concerns about his dedication to Tesla. He emphasized his desire to maintain control over the company, citing the need for "sufficient voting control" to prevent ousting by activist investors. Musk clarified that his motivation is not financial gain but rather ensuring reasonable control over Tesla's future direction. This announcement led to a slight increase in Tesla's shares, reflecting investor confidence in his continued leadership.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 10:14:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior homeowners seeking to tap into their home equity have two primary options: a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a reverse mortgage. HELOCs offer a flexible credit line with lower interest rates than credit cards or personal loans, suitable for short-term needs like home improvements or debt consolidation. Reverse mortgages, available to homeowners 62 and older, allow seniors to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, ideal for those with limited income. While HELOCs require repayment, reverse mortgages are repaid when the homeowner dies, moves, or sells the home, but they accrue interest and fees over time. Experts recommend considering individual financial situations and consulting professionals to determine the best option.</p>

          <p>Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail announced that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. While Walmart has indicated it will need to raise prices to cover tariff costs, Home Depot aims to maintain current pricing levels. McPhail noted that over half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources, with no single country outside the U.S. representing more than 10% of purchases by next year. This strategy is intended to allow Home Depot to take market share during a period of sluggish housing market conditions.</p>

Edwards is also in communication with spinner Sophie Ecclestone, who was left out of the squad to play West Indies due to injury recovery.

The article also addresses claims that Biden's health diagnosis was covered up, noting that the White House has previously been transparent about his health.

Williams suggests that the left shifted its focus from economic stability for blue-collar workers to issues more relevant to college-educated elites. She emphasizes the importance of pre-distribution policies, such as fair wages and job guarantees, over redistribution. Williams criticizes the Democratic party's style as catering to college graduates and advocates for cultural competence to bridge the class divide. She argues that Trump's policies have created an opportunity for the left to win back working-class voters by addressing their economic anxieties.</p>

          <p>Norwegian energy company Equinor will resume construction on its offshore wind farm in New York, after the Trump administration lifted its order to halt work on the project. The Interior Department under the Biden administration approved the project last year after Equinor signed a lease issued by the department in 2017. Empire Wind 1 will be the first offshore wind project to deliver electricity directly to New York City. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday evening that Burgum and President Donald Trump agreed to lift the stop-work order and allow the project to move forward "after countless conversations with Equinor and White House officials." Equinor said it aims to execute planned installation activities this year and minimize the impact of the stop-work order in order to reach its goal of starting commercial operations in 2027.</p>
