          <p>Negotiating teams from the U.S. and China concluded two days of trade talks in Switzerland, citing substantial progress amid ongoing tensions between the world's two largest economies. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted the positive atmosphere and the creation of a new consultation mechanism involving senior officials from both countries. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng acknowledged remaining friction but described the conversations as candid and constructive. Investors are likely to react positively to this development, viewing it as a sign that disruptions to trade between the two countries could soon ease.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark has decided to stop offering Zepbound in favor of Wegovy for weight loss, a decision that will force many Americans to switch obesity drugs, despite research indicating Zepbound results in more weight loss. This move highlights the consequences of deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, which can limit treatment options for patients. Caremark claims the decision was made to lower drug prices for employers, but some patients and doctors are concerned about the impact on individual treatment plans. The decision will not affect patients who take versions of the drugs for diabetes, and Caremark will offer a case-by-case medical exception process.</p>

          <p>A head-to-head trial comparing weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy has revealed that Mounjaro is more effective. The trial, involving 750 obese individuals, found that Mounjaro led to a 20% weight reduction compared to Wegovy's 14% after 72 weeks of treatment. Researchers suggest both drugs have a role, but Mounjaro may be more beneficial for those needing to lose significant weight. Mounjaro flips two appetite switches in the brain, while Wegovy flips one, explaining the difference in effectiveness.</p>
