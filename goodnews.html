          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 11:23:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a partial reversal of the government's decision to withdraw winter fuel payments from most pensioners, citing an improved economy as the reason for the change. Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less will receive the payment this winter. Starmer defended the initial decision to withdraw the payments, stating that it was necessary to address a ¬£22bn black hole in the economy. The Conservative shadow work and pensions secretary criticized the government's U-turn, while the Liberal Democrats called for backdating the payments to those now eligible (not investment advice). The optimism score reflects the positive impact of the policy reversal on pensioners, balanced against the economic challenges that necessitated the initial cuts.</p>
