          <p>This article reports on the arrival of world leaders in China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin. The summit brings together leaders from over 20 nations, including Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi, signaling a potential thaw in relations between China and India after a border clash in 2020. Modi's visit to China is his first since 2018, and recent trade tensions with the United States have seemingly fostered closer ties between the two rivals. Putin is scheduled to discuss the Ukraine conflict with Erdogan and Iran's nuclear program with Pezeshkian, highlighting the summit's significance for addressing pressing global issues.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order to protect residents' rights amid concerns of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The order seeks to bar federal agents from concealing their identities and mandates compliance with local policies, aiming to prevent actions that could violate residents' rights to peaceful assembly and due process. The mayor's initiative comes in response to reports of possible militarized activity by the federal government, with the city prepared to pursue legal avenues to counter any coordinated efforts that infringe upon residents' constitutional rights. The White House has criticized the order as a publicity stunt, urging city officials to focus on addressing crime instead.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the changing beer consumption habits in Germany, where non-alcoholic beer is gaining popularity while overall beer sales decline. Sales of non-alcoholic beer have more than doubled since 2013, even as overall beer sales have reached their lowest level in over 30 years. Erdinger brewery, a major producer, now dedicates about a quarter of its production to non-alcoholic varieties, promoting them at sporting events as a healthy alternative to energy drinks. While non-alcoholic beer is gaining traction, full-strength beer remains dominant, with a significant gap in sales between the two.</p>

          <p>The Bayeux Tapestry, documenting the Norman invasion of England in 1066, will be closed to the public in France before its move to the British Museum in London. The French art world is fiercely opposed to the project, fearing the nearly 1,000-year-old masterpiece is too delicate to be transported. Critics describe the loan as a cultural crime, with a petition drawing thousands of signatures. The huge embroidery will be displayed in London from next autumn until July 2027, and in exchange, treasures will travel to museums in Normandy.</p>
