          <p>Due to staffing shortages at an air traffic control center, United Airlines is reducing its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by 35 roundtrip flights per day, approximately 10% of its daily schedule, starting this weekend. CEO Scott Kirby attributed the disruptions to air traffic controller staffing shortages and the FAA's technology problems, noting that 20% of the controllers for Newark had recently left their jobs. The FAA said that staffing issues were delaying operations at Newark, and Kirby said that the airline is urging the agency to establish flight restrictions like those in place at other congested facilities. The New York Times article emphasizes the effects of a runway closure as well, contributing to the flight delays.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election where major issues include the high cost of living and housing shortages, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor Party seeking a second three-year term. The election is taking place against a backdrop of what both sides of politics describe as a cost of living crisis, and soaring prices are a big headache. The central bank reduced the inflation rate by a quarter percentage point in February to 4.1%, and housing prices and rents have also soared as builders have gone broke because of inflation absorbing profit margins. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange endorsed Albanese on the eve of the election.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, permanently blocking the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell found that the order, which sought to punish the firm for representing Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hiring Christopher Steele, violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The ruling is a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's use of government power to target lawyers for their representation of disfavored clients.</p>

The airline is urging the FAA to more tightly control capacity at the airport, and Kirby praised the Trump administration for vowing to invest in and fix aging air traffic control infrastructure in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has ceased shipping products directly from China to U.S. customers, with all U.S. orders now being shipped from local warehouses in America. This change follows the Trump administration's decision to close a loophole that allowed low-cost Chinese-made items to enter the U.S. without import fees. The company said that pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as the platform transitions to a local fulfillment model, and it is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform.</p>

          <p>Wall Street stocks rebounded from losses incurred after President Donald Trump imposed global tariffs a month ago, with major US indexes all up at the close on Friday.

The Department of Labor reported that US employers had added 177,000 new jobs in April, and Beijing announced it was considering an offer from Washington to hold trade talks with the US.</p>
