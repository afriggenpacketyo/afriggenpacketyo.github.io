          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 11:25:40 EDT</div>

          <p>Citing concerns that market expectations are too high, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust has announced the sale of a small portion of its holdings in GE Vernova. The stock has seen a significant 75% run-up year-to-date, creating a high bar for its upcoming earnings report that could invite profit-taking even with strong results. The article notes that while the long-term outlook for the power generation company remains bright, especially due to AI-driven energy demand, the short-term risk of a post-earnings sell-off prompted the tactical trim. The sale locks in a substantial gain on shares purchased earlier in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, is speeding up its production timeline for its new U.S. facilities by several quarters. CEO C.C. Wei stated the move is a response to "strong interest" from its leading American customers for advanced semiconductors. This acceleration comes as TSMC proceeds with its $165 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, a key part of strengthening the domestic semiconductor industry. The company also acknowledged uncertainties related to potential U.S. tariff policies but noted no change in customer behavior so far. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Democratic Lawmakers Propose Bill to Classify Extreme Heat as a Major Disaster</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 11:13:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three Democratic lawmakers are reintroducing legislation that would amend the Stafford Act to classify extreme heat as a major disaster, making affected communities eligible for federal FEMA funding. The bill aims to help states and local governments fund cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects like planting trees. Proponents argue that extreme heat kills more Americans than any other weather event but is not explicitly listed as a disaster type. However, some, including a former FEMA administrator, argue that the Stafford Act already allows for such declarations and that the focus should be on pre-emptive hazard mitigation.</p>

          <p>A 49-year-old mother and her nine-year-old son were successfully rescued after being stranded for over 24 hours in California's Sierra Nevada forest. The pair became lost after their GPS signal failed in a remote area, but they were found thanks to a series of handwritten notes the mother left tucked under rocks. A volunteer search and rescue team, already in the area for training, followed the notes which led them directly to the duo. The mother and son, who had spent the night in their car, were found safe and assisted back to their waiting family.</p>

          <p>The city of Minot, North Dakota, is engaged in an escalating battle against a massive population of Richardson's ground squirrels. These small, native rodents have become a significant nuisance, with their extensive burrowing causing damage to sidewalks, lawns, and building foundations throughout the city. The squirrel population has grown dramatically in recent years, likely outnumbering the city's nearly 50,000 human residents. Despite efforts led by pest control professionals using traps and other methods, officials acknowledge that complete eradication is impossible and the goal is simply to manage and reduce the overwhelming numbers of the prolific creatures.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Salzburg Festival program is set to explore themes of power, conflict, and crumbling authority, mirroring current global crises. Artistic director Markus Hinterhäuser has curated a lineup of operas and plays, including Verdi's "Macbeth" and Handel's "Giulio Cesare in Egitto," that examine the downfall of rulers. The festival will also feature works by Russian artists who have distanced themselves from the Putin regime, such as director Kirill Serebrennikov. Despite a recent controversy over the dismissal of its Russian drama director, the festival maintains a strong focus on providing a platform for diverse artistic voices, including those from Ukraine.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo's stock saw a significant increase after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. Despite a recent period of weaker North American demand, CEO Ramon Laguarta expressed confidence that strategic changes will lead to a rebound in the coming quarters. The company is focusing on boosting its brands, embracing healthier snacking trends, and implementing cost-cutting measures, including closing two manufacturing plants. PepsiCo reiterated its full-year outlook, projecting low single-digit organic revenue growth as its new strategies take hold in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed its intention to lower the voting age to 16 across the entire United Kingdom before the next general election. This change, a key Labour manifesto promise, will enfranchise approximately 1.5 million 16 and 17-year-olds for all local and parliamentary elections. The plan also includes other electoral reforms, such as moving towards automatic voter registration, expanding the types of acceptable voter ID to include bank cards, and tightening rules on political donations to combat foreign interference. The move represents the most significant expansion of the electorate since 1969.</p>

The experiment, contained on a credit-card-sized chip, features living human brain cells, immune cells, and capillary-like vessels, creating a highly integrated model with a blood-brain barrier. This appears to be the first time such a complex brain model has been studied in orbit. Scientists hope the research will provide insights into the causes of dizziness, sleep problems, and cognitive changes experienced by astronauts, potentially leading to preventative measures for long-duration space missions.</p>
