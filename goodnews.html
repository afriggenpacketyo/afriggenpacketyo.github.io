        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant portion of Americans' rent payments are not reported to credit bureaus, leaving many renters "credit invisible" and hindering their access to loans and other financial opportunities. Esusu, a credit score reporting service, partners with rental companies and offers a direct line for renters to report their payments, aiming to address this financial inequity. The company reports that only 20% of landlords report rent payments, despite renters paying an estimated $1.4 trillion annually. Reporting rent payments can significantly boost credit scores, benefiting minorities and immigrants who are disproportionately affected by credit invisibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Savers with $20,000 face a decision between certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts, both offering higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts. Key considerations include interest-earning potential, upcoming rate changes, and access to funds. While CD rates are fixed for the term, high-yield savings account rates are variable and could decline with anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts. CDs require funds to remain untouched for the term, while high-yield savings accounts offer more liquidity, making the choice dependent on individual financial circumstances.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold has risen to become the second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, driven by central banks' increasing demand for the precious metal. This shift reflects concerns about sanctions and the potential erosion of major currencies in the international monetary system. While central bank purchases have cooled recently, gold's perceived role as a hedge against fiscal, inflationary, and geopolitical risks supports its continued attractiveness as a reserve asset. However, analysts suggest that some institutions may be nearing their fill of gold, indicating a potential slowdown in future purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz expressed strong support for current CEO Brian Niccol's "back to Starbucks" strategy, aimed at boosting sales and restoring the company's culture. Schultz, who previously criticized the company's performance under Niccol's predecessor, Laxman Narasimhan, lauded Niccol's plans to refocus on coffee and bring back seating inside cafes. Schultz had sold his Starbucks holdings sometime between the end of 2024 and early 2025. Niccol's leadership has seen Starbucks shares climb nearly 20% since April, signaling a potential turnaround for the company.</p>

          <p>The WTA Tour will now offer ranking protection to female tennis players who choose to freeze their eggs or embryos, allowing them to start families later without jeopardizing their careers. This protection is available to players ranked in the top 750 who spend more than 10 weeks out of competition. Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, praised the rule, saying it reduces the pressure on players to return to the court too quickly. Stephens herself has previously used the off-season to freeze her eggs and emphasizes the importance of not feeling forced to return early and risk their health.</p>
