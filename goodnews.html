          <h2>Chinese Study Challenges Darwinism with Lamarckian Findings on Rice</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by Chinese scientists published in Cell challenges Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that rice plants can inherit acquired traits without DNA changes. The research showed that rice plants exposed to cold stress passed on cold tolerance to subsequent generations through epigenetic modifications, specifically DNA methylation. This finding supports elements of Lamarckism, the 19th-century theory that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The study highlights the potential role of epigenetics in evolution and suggests that environmental factors can directly influence heritable characteristics in plants.</p>

          <p>The diamond industry faces multiple challenges, including potential tariffs and the rise of lab-grown diamonds (LGD).

LGDs, chemically identical to natural diamonds, are sold at a significant discount, impacting the demand for mined diamonds. De Beers, a major player, is doubling down on natural diamonds and closing its LGD jewelry brand, aiming to reinforce its commitment to natural diamonds amid these market shifts.</p>
