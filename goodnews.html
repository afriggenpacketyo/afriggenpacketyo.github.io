          <p>General Motors announced a $4 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing plants, which includes shifting or increasing production of Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox vehicles from Mexico to the United States. This decision comes as trade talks between the Trump administration and Mexico show little progress, with tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts already implemented. The investment will allow GM to assemble over two million vehicles annually in the U.S. by 2027. The move is seen as a potential win for President Trump's policies aimed at boosting American manufacturing. The investment reflects GM's commitment to American innovation and job creation, giving customers a wider range of vehicle choices. Optimism score is not included in the summary.</p>

The stock had previously dropped after the Musk-Trump dispute. The video displayed a Model Y SUV with "Robotaxi" branding navigating an intersection without a safety supervisor. Tesla is reportedly planning to launch a limited "pilot" program for its driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, using a new version of its Full Self-Driving technology and remotely monitored by employees. The company is listed as "testing" on Austin's official autonomous vehicle website. (not investment advice)</p>

Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat who previously ran as a Republican and independent, is also a strong supporter of Israel, which may have influenced his decision given the rise of progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani.

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is a worthy successor to the original, focusing on refinement rather than reinvention, and officially released June 5 for $449.99. It boasts improvements like magnetically connecting Joy-Cons, a 1080p screen with 4K TV support, and enhanced chat features. The Joy-Cons can now act as a mouse, benefiting strategy and first-person shooter games. While battery life may be a challenge, the Switch 2 feels fresh with brighter, crisper graphics, and it's easy to upgrade from a prior Switch. The console's initial exclusive game is "Mario Kart World," with other titles like "Donkey Kong Bananza" expected soon. Optimism score is not included in the summary.</p>

A key decision will be the allocation of funds to the health service, which constitutes a substantial portion of government spending, alongside increased defense spending in an era of low growth.

AI can generate endless variations, but it lacks the human discretion, cultural intuition, and lived experience necessary to make meaningful choices. Taste is cultivated through exposure, curation, and reflection, and it has an ethical dimension, demanding integrity and an awareness of context. As AI proliferates across industries, the ability to discern the most resonant and appropriate options becomes invaluable. Optimism score is not included in the summary.</p>
