          <p>Four astronauts from the Crew-10 mission have successfully undocked from the International Space Station, beginning their 17.5-hour journey back to Earth. The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, named Endurance, is scheduled for a historic splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California, a new landing location for NASA-sponsored flights. In a departure ceremony, the crew highlighted the importance of international cooperation in space, especially during tumultuous times on Earth. The mission, lasting 148 days, marks a significant milestone as their replacements from Crew-11 have already arrived and begun their tenure aboard the station.</p>

The two, who come from different sides of the political spectrum, have bonded over shared experiences of challenging childhoods and their Christian faith. This relationship is seen as potentially beneficial for U.S.-UK relations, particularly given the personalized nature of the Trump administration's foreign policy. While on holiday in the UK, Vance is staying with Lammy, highlighting a diplomatic bridge-building effort that extends beyond traditional party lines.</p>

Following an opening round of 63, Fleetwood shot a six-under 64, bringing his total to 13 under par as he seeks his first PGA Tour victory. Americans Collin Morikawa and Akshay Bhatia are tied for second at nine under. Play was halted due to lightning with 21 players, including England's Justin Rose who was also at nine under, still on the course, setting up a busy resumption of the FedExCup playoff event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To streamline the security process for travelers with young children, Orlando International Airport (MCO) has launched dedicated TSA family lanes at all its checkpoints. The new lanes are designed for adults traveling with children aged 12 and under, aiming to reduce stress for families and decongest other security lines by isolating bulky items like strollers and car seats. Airport officials believe MCO processes more child-related travel gear than any other airport, making it a logical choice for the initiative. The program is also being rolled out at several other U.S. airports and includes a discount on TSA PreCheck for families.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat rising loneliness, the city of Seoul has opened four "warm-hearted convenience stores" that provide a safe, welcoming space for socially isolated individuals. These centers offer free food, such as instant ramen, and a café-like atmosphere where visitors can chat with social workers or simply relax. The initiative has been unexpectedly popular, attracting 20,000 visitors since March, far exceeding projections. The program targets the city's growing number of single-person households and isolated youth, aiming to address the social fragmentation caused by rapid urbanization and economic pressures.</p>

          <p>A new executive order directs the Labor Department to potentially redefine qualified assets for 401(k) retirement plans, opening the door for investments in alternatives like cryptocurrency and private equity. Proponents suggest this could democratize investing and offer higher returns, while experts caution about the increased risks, higher fees, and lack of transparency associated with these assets. While the change could take years to implement and requires adoption by employers, it represents a significant potential shift in retirement savings strategy for American workers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The documentary "It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley" provides an intimate and honest look at the life of the late musician, who died in 1997 at age 30. Directed by Amy Berg, the film moves beyond the narrative of a doomed artist to explore his complex personality, creative process, and struggles with sudden fame. Using archival material and interviews with his mother, bandmates, and romantic partners, the film paints a portrait of a turbulent but gifted individual. It thoughtfully handles his death, presenting it as a tragic accident rather than an inescapable fate, offering a dimensional view of the man behind the iconic album "Grace."</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic achievement, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace deal at the White House, formally ending decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The agreement, brokered by the Trump administration, involves the two nations committing to respect each other's territorial integrity and establishing diplomatic relations. A key component of the deal is the creation of a trade and transit corridor through the South Caucasus, which will be developed with exclusive rights granted to the United States. Both nations' leaders praised the U.S. for its role and stated they would nominate President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe has issued an apology and a £1,000 charity donation after mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants." Lowe had posted on social media about a "dinghy" arriving near Great Yarmouth, alerting authorities and calling for mass deportations. It was later revealed the boat contained a crew, including a former Royal Marine, rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. The crew found the incident humorous, while Lowe defended his vigilance as a response to constituent concerns about a "national crisis."</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly rejected the idea of U.S. military intervention in Mexico, stating "there will be no invasion" in response to reports that President Trump directed the Pentagon to target Latin American cartels. Sheinbaum emphasized that while Mexico cooperates with the U.S. on security, it will never accept the presence of foreign troops on its soil. The statements aim to quell nationalist fears in Mexico, which have grown since the U.S. designated several cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a move many see as a potential prelude to unilateral military action.</p>

The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's meeting with President Donald Trump, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. During the meeting, Trump assured Cook that Apple's U.S. investments would exempt it from potential future tariffs on imported chips, easing investor concerns about profitability. The successful meeting, combined with strong quarterly earnings, propelled Apple's market value to $3.4 trillion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While the national housing market remains tight, home prices are showing notable declines in specific regions, particularly in the South and West. A Realtor.com report indicates that cities like Austin and Miami have seen the largest drops from their 2022 peaks, driven by rising inventory from new construction and homes staying on the market longer. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face tight inventory and rising prices due to fewer new homes being built. This regional divergence creates a varied experience for homebuyers and sellers across the country. (not investment advice)</p>
