          <p>The Supreme Court suggested that Federal Reserve board members have special protection against being fired by a president in a ruling concerning President Trump's attempt to remove two members of other federal agencies' boards. While the ruling allows Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, it implies that firing a Federal Reserve board member would face strong resistance. Justice Kagan dissented, arguing that the majority's exemption for the Federal Reserve lacks legal foundation. </p>

          <p>Black South Africans are responding with a mix of anger, disbelief, and humor to President Trump's false claims of genocide against white farmers in South Africa. Trump's plan to create an expedited path for white South Africans to resettle in the United States as "refugees" has sparked jokes and satire, highlighting the historical injustices of apartheid and the ongoing inequality faced by Black South Africans. Despite President Ramaphosa's attempts to focus on trade, Trump continued to make unsubstantiated claims about violence against white farmers. </p>

The settlement announcement came one day after the Pentagon formally accepted the airliner as a gift from the Qatari royal family. The company has not admitted fault or liability. </p>
