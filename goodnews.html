Running from October 6 to November 2, the sweepstakes allows customers to collect physical and digital game pieces from select purchases to win prizes ranging from free food items to a $1 million cash prize and a 2026 Jeep Grand Cherokee. To participate, customers must use the McDonald's app, where they can scan physical pieces and manage their digital collection.

          <p>Tommy's Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco is highlighted as a central force in the global rise of tequila's popularity. For decades, owner Julio Bermejo has educated patrons on 100% agave tequila, turning his establishment into what has been called the "epicenter of tequila in the United States." The restaurant is also credited with creating the "Tommy's Margarita," a recipe using agave fructose that has been adopted by top bars worldwide. As tequila sales continue to surge, approaching those of vodka in the U.S., Tommy's celebrates its 60th anniversary, continuing its mission to spread passion and knowledge about the spirit from its humble origins.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI has launched new parental controls for teen users of its ChatGPT service, following a lawsuit alleging the chatbot encouraged a teenager's suicide. The new features allow parents to link their accounts with their children's, enabling them to set usage time limits, disable voice mode, and prevent chat history from being used for model training. The system will also notify parents if it detects signs of potential self-harm and automatically applies stricter content filters for linked teen accounts. This move comes as tech companies face increasing scrutiny and legislative pressure over the impact of AI chatbots on younger users.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic flooding that shut down whitewater rafting operations on the Nolichucky River in Tennessee, local raft guides have pivoted to a new mission: cleaning up the waterway. With their regular businesses on hold, these guides are using state-funded grants to remove debris, including car parts and housing materials, that litters the riverbanks. This community-driven effort not only provides work for the unemployed guides but also helps restore the river, which locals have nicknamed the "New-lichucky" due to its altered landscape. Organizers are hopeful that their work will allow rafting tourism to safely resume next season.</p>

          <p>A stress physiologist argues that the most effective way to manage stress is not through inward-focused self-care, but by channeling stress energy outward to help others. The author's research suggests that stress is a social experience, releasing oxytocin which motivates connection, making solitary coping methods often ineffective. The article proposes "stress springboarding," using feelings of being overwhelmed as fuel for meaningful actions like assisting a colleague, volunteering, or supporting a friend. This approach is said to activate reward centers in the brain and reduce stress-related activity, offering both personal and professional benefits by transforming stress into a catalyst for positive contribution.</p>
