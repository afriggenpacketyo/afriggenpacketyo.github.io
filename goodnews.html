          <p>The UK government has altered its welfare reform bill after significant pressure from over 100 of its own backbench MPs. The changes will protect current recipients of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health component of Universal Credit from planned cuts, which will now only apply to future claimants. This move is seen as a major concession to prevent a parliamentary defeat and follows other recent government U-turns. The bill, aimed at saving ¬£5bn annually by 2030, will now likely pass its upcoming vote.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos," economists emphasized that China must transition into a consumption-driven economy to achieve long-term prosperity and global trade harmony. Professor Jin Keyu argued that China's production-focused model creates international friction and that increasing internal demand, particularly in the service sector, is crucial. The experts suggested that local governments should be incentivized to prioritize consumption as a key metric for success, which would help balance China's role in the global supply chain.

          <p>Jos√© Adolfo Mac√≠as, the fugitive drug trafficker known as "Fito," has been recaptured in Ecuador more than a year after escaping from a high-security prison. Mac√≠as, leader of the "Los Choneros" gang and wanted by the U.S. for cocaine importation, was found hiding in the basement of a house in his hometown of Manta. His escape in early 2024 triggered a national crisis, including riots, kidnappings, and a declaration of war between the government and drug gangs. Ecuador's president announced the arrest and stated they are awaiting a U.S. response regarding his extradition.</p>
