          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell is set to miss the autumn internationals, as he was not included in head coach Steve Borthwick's initial 36-man training squad. Saracens number eight Tom Willis was also omitted due to his impending move to play in France. The squad sees the call-up of former England Under-20s captain Emeka Ilione and 19-year-old wing Noah Caluori. Farrell, who returned to Test eligibility this summer, had been considered for a midfield spot but Borthwick opted for other options, extending Farrell's two-year absence from the national team.</p>

          <p>Tufan Erhurman, a moderate, has won the Turkish Cypriot presidential election with 62.8% of the vote, defeating hardliner Ersin Tatar. This victory signals a significant policy shift, potentially reviving stalled UN talks on reunifying Cyprus. Erhurman, a lawyer, advocates for a federal solution, contrasting with Tatar's and Turkey's two-state policy. Both Turkish President Erdogan and Greek Cypriot leader Nikos Christodoulides congratulated Erhurman, with Christodoulides expressing commitment to resuming peace talks. The outcome could influence Turkey's EU aspirations and offers a new diplomatic path for the island.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight en route from Denver to Los Angeles was diverted to Salt Lake City last week after pilots discovered a crack in one layer of the windshield. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident, and the Boeing 737's multilayer windshield is designed to remain functional even with damage to one layer. All 134 passengers and six crew members landed safely, with another aircraft completing their journey. Investigators will examine the windshield for impact and review flight data, though further information is limited due to an ongoing government shutdown.</p>

In a QVC spoof, Carpenter played a designer oblivious to the phallic resemblance of her neck pillow, mirroring real-life reactions to her album art and stage performances. Her opening monologue and a "girlboss" sketch further engaged with the discourse, dismissing accusations of subservience to misogynistic fantasies. The article highlights Carpenter's self-awareness and comedic talent in using the platform to respond to critics, especially other women, by being "in on the joke."</p>

          <p>Southeast Asia has achieved a dramatic decline in per capita tobacco consumption over two decades, with smoking prevalence falling from 54% to 23%, according to a WHO report. This success is attributed to strong political commitment, comprehensive policies, and community engagement, including higher taxes, advertising bans, and public smoking restrictions. However, the absolute number of smokers has risen due to population growth. Challenges persist, particularly in Indonesia, which hasn't ratified the WHO framework and scrapped a planned tobacco tax hike. The region also faces the rising popularity of e-cigarettes, with many countries banning vaping to prevent a new generation of nicotine users.</p>

The choice is between two conservative capitalists, Jorge Quiroga and Rodrigo Paz, both promising to address the country's severe economic crisis, characterized by a US dollar shortage, currency devaluation, and high inflation. Both candidates aim to fix the exchange rate, restructure state businesses, and attract foreign investment, while also seeking to maintain social welfare programs and tackle fuel subsidies.

While not speculating ahead of the Chancellor's November Budget, Miliband stated that "all of these issues" are being reviewed to address affordability. The government faces pressure to reduce household energy costs, with Labour previously pledging to lower average bills by £300 annually by 2030. Miliband emphasized the long-term solution lies in home-grown clean energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Such a cut could save average households £86 per year.</p>

He argued that an annual tax of 1% on assets above £10m and 2% on assets above £1bn could raise £15bn to £25bn annually. Polanski dismissed criticisms that such a tax would penalize savings or encourage capital flight, emphasizing its primary goal is reducing inequality rather than solely generating public investment. He also advocated for aligning capital gains tax with income tax, stressing that the wealthiest should bear the largest burden for public services. (not investment advice)</p>
