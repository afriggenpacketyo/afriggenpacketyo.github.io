          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 15:34:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As homeowners increasingly tap into their home equity amid firm interest rates, this article outlines several expensive errors to avoid. Key mistakes include choosing a variable-rate HELOC when predictable payments are needed, as this can expose borrowers to future rate hikes. Another significant pitfall is borrowing more than necessary, which increases interest costs and financial risk if property values decline or personal income changes. The summary also warns against ignoring closing costs and hidden fees, advising borrowers to compare the full Annual Percentage Rate (APR) across different loan offers to understand the true cost of borrowing.

          <p>Amazon is set to release its second-quarter earnings, with investors closely watching the impact of U.S. tariff policies and the company's investments in artificial intelligence. Analysts are monitoring revenue from key divisions like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising, which are expected to show continued growth. The company previously warned that tariffs could affect results, although some analysts believe Amazon has gained market share from Chinese competitors like Shein and Temu due to these same trade policies. Additionally, Wall Street will be looking for updates on Amazon's planned $100 billion AI-related spending and its effect on cloud business capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's management of a rising number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, he attributed the increase to presidents using executive orders to bypass congressional inaction, which naturally leads to more legal challenges requiring the high court's intervention. Kavanaugh stated the court has improved its process for these cases, sometimes scheduling emergency arguments to ensure a correct outcome. He also emphasized the strong collegiality among the justices, describing them as patriots who thoughtfully engage with difficult issues, even when they disagree.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving forward with a long-held plan to construct a new, grand ballroom at the White House, with work scheduled to begin in September. The project, estimated to cost $200 million, will be funded by Donald Trump himself and other private donors, according to the White House. The new ballroom will be located in the East Wing and is designed to seat 650 guests, significantly larger than the current East Room. This development fulfills a desire Trump has expressed for years to have a more permanent and impressive venue for large events like state dinners, instead of using temporary tents.</p>

The milestone was marked with a new branch in Charlotte, North Carolina, a key market for competitor Bank of America. This expansion is part of a multi-billion dollar plan to add over 500 more locations by 2027, which will bring its total to over 1,100 new branches since the push began. The strategy aims to capture more deposits and serve growing populations, running counter to the broader industry trend of branch closures since the 2008 financial crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched "Project Crypto," a new initiative aimed at updating financial regulations to integrate blockchain-based systems into U.S. securities markets. SEC Chair Paul Atkins stated the goal is to fulfill the administration's vision of making America the global crypto capital by adapting antiquated rules for on-chain technologies. The project will focus on enabling innovations like the tokenization of assets and the development of "super apps" that bundle various financial services. This move aligns with recommendations from the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets to bolster U.S. leadership in digital finance. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has uncovered that the modern potato originated from an ancient interbreeding event between a tomato ancestor and a wild potato-like species. Researchers found that around 9 million years ago, a hybridization event combined a key gene from the tomato, which signals the plant to form tubers, with a gene from the wild species that controls tuber growth. This genetic combination was essential for the evolution of the starchy vegetable we know today. The discovery, based on the analysis of over 500 potato genomes, finally solves the long-standing mystery of the potato's evolutionary origins.</p>

          <p>A registered dietitian explores the trend of food companies adding protein to products that naturally contain little of the nutrient, such as cereals, yogurts, and chips. While protein is essential for functions like muscle growth and immune support, the article questions whether these fortified foods are truly healthy or necessary for most people. Many such products also contain added sugar, salt, or fat to improve taste, potentially offsetting their benefits. The author advises consumers to prioritize whole-food sources of protein like meat, legumes, and dairy, and to read nutrition labels carefully on fortified products, suggesting they are often expensive and unnecessary for those with a balanced diet.</p>

His "Back to Starbucks" strategy centers on a new "green apron service model" focused on improving hospitality and efficiency to boost sales and customer experience. Key initiatives include reducing minimum staffing hours, implementing a smart queue system to shorten wait times, and encouraging more personalized employee-guest interactions. Despite recent lackluster earnings, some analysts are confident that Niccol's track record of corporate turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell bodes well for Starbucks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the consumer protection known as the "95% rule" for federally insured reverse mortgages, or Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). This rule allows the heirs of a homeowner to keep the property by paying off either the full loan balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value, whichever amount is less. This is particularly important when the accrued interest has caused the loan balance to exceed the home's market value. The provision offers peace of mind to senior homeowners, ensuring their loved ones will not be forced to pay more than the home is worth to retain it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of four spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission, ending a nearly two-year investigation by the Football Association. The Brazilian international was accused of deliberately receiving yellow cards to influence betting markets, allegations that could have resulted in a lifetime ban. While cleared of the main charges, Paqueta was found to have breached rules regarding cooperation with the investigation and will face a sanction for those failures. The verdict is a significant relief for the player, whose potential transfer to Manchester City in 2023 collapsed when the investigation became public.</p>
