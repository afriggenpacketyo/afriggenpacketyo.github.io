          <p>Apple has launched its new iPhone 17 series worldwide, attracting large crowds in key markets like China and Singapore. The launch is seen as a critical test for the company as it faces intensified competition from local Chinese brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi, which have eroded its market share. Beyond hardware sales, Apple is also under pressure to deliver on its artificial intelligence promises, with analysts noting that the company needs to demonstrate significant progress in AI to reassure investors and maintain its technological edge. Early demand appears positive, particularly for the base model, which offers upgraded storage at an unchanged price.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since 2011, the total number of refugees residing in Germany has decreased, falling by approximately 50,000 in the first half of 2025 to a total of 3.5 million. This decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including an increase in deportations, voluntary departures, and a significant number of naturalizations, with over 83,000 Syrians granted German citizenship. The figures include long-term residents and around 1.27 million refugees from Ukraine. Meanwhile, life in Berlin was disrupted as authorities worked to defuse two unexploded World War II bombs, requiring large-scale evacuations in different parts of the city.</p>

          <p>Canadian rugby star Sophie de Goede is set to play a pivotal role in the Women's Rugby World Cup semi-final against defending champions New Zealand. As a goal-kicking lock, de Goede is a rare and formidable talent, drawing comparisons to Australian legend John Eales for her unique skill set. Having recovered from a significant knee injury, she has been in exceptional form, earning player-of-the-match honors and leading the tournament in conversions. Despite Canada's amateur status, the team is ranked second in the world and is confident in its ability to challenge the powerhouse New Zealand Black Ferns for a place in the final.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts in Ohio are studying the state's largest-ever recorded fisher cat, which was recently found as roadkill, as a positive sign of the species' return after a 200-year absence. The recovery of the fisher, a member of the weasel family, is attributed to expanding biodiversity and improved forest habitats in the region, following the successful re-establishment of other species like bald eagles and river otters. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources is analyzing the 13-pound male to learn more about its genetics, diet, and health to support the species' continued expansion. Sightings of these elusive mammals are becoming more frequent, indicating a growing and migrating population.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan has decided to keep its policy rate steady at 0.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. The decision came as Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, fell to 2.7% in August, its lowest point since November 2024 and the third straight month of decline. Despite inflation remaining above the bank's 2% target for over three years, the BOJ is maintaining a cautious stance amid global economic uncertainty.
