          <p>David Litt, a former Obama speechwriter, explores the possibility of bridging political divides through an unlikely friendship with his brother-in-law, Matt Kappler, a Joe Rogan fan. Litt's new book, *It's Only Drowning*, chronicles how learning to surf together provided neutral ground for connection despite their differing backgrounds and ideologies. The article highlights the growing political and cultural divisions in America and suggests that shared activities can foster understanding between individuals with opposing views. Litt emphasizes the importance of finding non-political spaces to connect and avoid the constant barrage of divisive news.</p>

Firefighters have responded to a significant increase in wildfires, and the public is urged to be cautious. While the current heat is notable, temperatures remain below the June peak of 1976, though climate change is making heatwaves hotter and longer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's proactive approach to supply chain resilience offers a valuable lesson for Western nations facing China's dominance in critical minerals. Following a 2010 export ban on rare earths targeting Tokyo, Japan diversified its supply chains by investing in non-China projects, stockpiling resources, and promoting alternative technologies. As a result, Japan has reduced its reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. While challenges remain, particularly in heavy rare earths, Japan's experience underscores the importance of strategic planning and diversification to mitigate supply chain risks.</p>
