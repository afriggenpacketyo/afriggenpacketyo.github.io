          <p>In an effort to reverse a six-year trend of declining sales, Jeep has unveiled a redesigned 2026 Cherokee, featuring the brand's first hybrid powertrain in North America. The new model is larger, offers more cargo space, and is positioned to compete in the largest SUV segment in the U.S. market. Parent company Stellantis hopes the revitalized Cherokee, starting at just under $37,000, will reinvigorate the brand and help recover lost market share. The launch comes as Stellantis also navigates financial headwinds from U.S. tariffs, which are expected to impact costs across the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on his journey of finding love in Los Angeles, which went against his mother's wish for him to marry a Jewish woman. He humorously recounts a series of unsuccessful dates with a diverse range of women before meeting Carol, a Korean woman, with whom he built a lasting relationship. Their journey included navigating cultural differences, such as winning over her grandmother who affectionately called him "the Jewish man." The story culminates in their interfaith wedding, which blended Jewish and Korean traditions, and the birth of their daughter, celebrating a multicultural family that he believes his late mother would have ultimately embraced.</p>

          <p>The New Jersey Meadowlands, once infamous as a toxic dumping ground, has undergone a remarkable ecological resurrection, transforming into a vital salt marsh habitat for hundreds of species. This revival was achieved through decades of state and federal policies, including the Clean Water Act, which mandated that developers fund wetland restoration to compensate for environmental impacts. This unique model balances conservation with ongoing industrial and commercial use, creating a thriving ecosystem against the New York City skyline. However, recent Supreme Court rulings weakening the Clean Water Act now threaten the federal protections that made this Lazarus-like recovery possible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study in rural Kenya found that one-time cash grants of about $1,871 to impoverished households were associated with a dramatic 48 percent reduction in infant and child mortality. Researchers suggest potential mechanisms include increased spending on food, a higher rate of hospital births, and mothers working fewer hours around childbirth, functioning like paid parental leave. While the life-saving impact is significant, the program's cost-effectiveness is a major caveat; at nearly $300,000 per life saved, it is far more expensive than other proven interventions like Vitamin A supplementation. The findings highlight cash's potential health benefits while underscoring its limitations compared to targeted health charities.</p>

Sunkara credits Trump for reintroducing tariffs as a policy tool but criticizes his current methods as self-serving favoritism that could ultimately harm the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

However, experts express concern over the difficulty of designing a test that can adequately protect consumers, especially when many struggle with basic financial literacy.

The 125-million-year-old fossils were originally found by a local fossil hunter and were recently analyzed and identified as a unique species.
