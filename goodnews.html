          <p>China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with a private survey showing the fastest expansion in five months. The RatingDog purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 50.5, surpassing economists' estimates of 49.7, driven by increased new orders and a recovery in export business. This positive trend was partly attributed to a trade-war truce with the U.S. However, China's official manufacturing PMI still indicated contraction for the fifth consecutive month, albeit with a slight improvement to 49.4.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children without a formal deportation order. This decision came as planes carrying children were prepared for takeoff, following lawyers' alerts about a rushed government effort to repatriate hundreds of minors. The court aims to ensure these children receive legal protections, including the opportunity to apply for humanitarian protection, amid concerns they could face abuse upon return. The government claimed the repatriations were for family reunification, but attorneys disputed this.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong-listed shares surged by nearly 19% following better-than-expected net income in the June quarter, driven by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing unit and a revival of its e-commerce business. While overall revenue missed estimates, net income increased significantly due to equity investment gains and asset disposal. The company's cloud division saw a 26% revenue growth, fueled by robust AI demand, making AI-related products a substantial part of external customer revenue. Alibaba continues to invest heavily in AI and competitive instant commerce, balancing growth with market competition.</p>

Despite current tensions, the bond remains strong, with relatives of the Flying Tigers' founder invited to a military parade in Beijing commemorating the end of WWII.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.1 billion, making it the fifth-largest prize in the game's history after no one matched all six winning numbers on Saturday. Nine tickets across the U.S. successfully matched five white balls, with four of those sold in California, each winning over $1.1 million. The next drawing offers winners a choice between periodic payments totaling the estimated $1.1 billion or a lump sum of approximately $498.4 million, both before taxes. The odds of winning the jackpot remain 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Canadensys Aerospace is developing Canada's first lunar rover, marking the nation's inaugural Canadian-led planetary exploration endeavor. Scheduled for a 2029 launch as part of NASA's Artemis program, the 35kg rover will land in the Moon's south polar region to search for water and measure radiation levels. This mission aims to prepare for future human presence on the Moon, which is seen as a potential base for deeper space exploration. Engineers are tackling extreme temperature swings and the Moon's abrasive regolith, with water discovery holding significant implications for sustainable space travel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever publicly funded childcare expansion has begun, offering thousands of working parents 30 hours of government-paid childcare per week for children aged nine months to four years. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a landmark moment, parents report long waiting lists and nurseries warn of staff shortages limiting availability. The sector needs an estimated 35,000 more staff, and funding rates for providers are often lower than actual costs, leading to increased charges for parents. This creates a dilemma for families struggling to secure places despite the increased funding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global surge in matcha popularity, driven by its superfood reputation and social media trends, is causing supply shortages and price hikes in Japan. Demand has skyrocketed, with Japan's green tea exports quadrupling in a decade, primarily to the U.S. Japanese tea producers struggle to meet this demand due to labor-intensive cultivation of tencha (matcha's base) and an aging farming population. The government is considering subsidies to encourage more tencha farming, but record heatwaves threaten future harvests. Retailers are rationing supply, and the industry faces a bottleneck in milling and production capacity.</p>

          <p>Two high school seniors from New Orleans, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, achieved a remarkable mathematical feat by independently developing a new trigonometric proof for the Pythagorean Theorem. This problem had been considered impossible to solve using only trigonometry for over two millennia, with only one other documented proof existing. Their groundbreaking work, presented at an American Mathematical Society conference, garnered global attention and challenged preconceived notions about who can achieve such intellectual milestones. The students' accomplishment is a testament to ingenuity and rigorous academic support.</p>
