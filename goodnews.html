          <p>SK Hynix shares have reached a two-decade high following reports that SK Group plans to construct South Korea's largest AI data center in partnership with Amazon Web Services. The company's shares have already surged nearly 50% this year due to the AI boom, and the project is reportedly led by SK Telecom and SK Broadband, with support from SK Hynix. SK Hynix is a leading supplier of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and has become a leader in high bandwidth memory used in artificial intelligence servers, supplying to clients such as Nvidia. While SK Hynix is experiencing gains, its competitor Samsung is struggling to capitalize on AI-led demand.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his highly anticipated pitching debut for the Los Angeles Dodgers, marking his return to the mound after undergoing Tommy John surgery in September 2023. Ohtani pitched one inning, allowing one run on two hits while reaching 100 mph with his fastball, receiving a standing ovation as he took the mound. Initially, the Dodgers planned to delay Ohtani's pitching return until after the All-Star break, but Ohtani expressed concerns about the toll of simulated sessions on his body. Moving forward, Ohtani is expected to pitch once per week, gradually increasing his workload as the season progresses.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 22:30:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Commons is set to debate a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs, Tonia Antoniazzi and Stella Creasy, proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent the investigation, arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment of women who terminate their own pregnancies, arguing that investigations are dehumanizing and prolonged. Her amendment would maintain punishments for medical professionals and violent partners who end a pregnancy outside of the existing law, while Stella Creasy's amendment offers a different approach. Current law in England and Wales permits abortion up to 24 weeks and beyond in certain circumstances, subject to approval by two doctors.</p>

          <p>Boca Juniors and Benfica played to a 2-2 draw in their Club World Cup match in Miami Gardens, with Boca Juniors relinquishing a 2-0 lead. The game featured three red cards, one for each team and one for a Boca Juniors coach, and a late equalizer from Nicol√°s Otamendi for Benfica. The match was the opening game in Group C for both teams, and Boca Juniors' tactics involved a low block and fast breaks, while Benfica struggled to adapt. The game also highlighted the contrast between Boca Juniors' traditional football culture and the commodified nature of the FIFA Club World Cup.</p>

          <p>A Detroit detective, Sgt. Shannon Jones, is using DNA analysis to solve long-unsolved missing person cases by exhuming unidentified bodies from paupers' graves. Inspired by photographs of missing loved ones, Jones partnered with FBI Special Agent Leslie Larsen to launch Operation UNITED, which stands for Unknown Names Identified Through Exhumation and DNA. The operation has resulted in 33 positive identifications, providing closure to families who have long sought answers. The success of Operation UNITED has led other cities to reach out, seeking to implement similar projects in their communities.</p>

Tourists spend hours dressing up in elaborate costumes and posing at scenic locations, and the industry has seen significant growth in tourism income.
