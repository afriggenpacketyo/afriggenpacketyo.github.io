          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that the government is "not writing a blank cheque" for the Sizewell C nuclear project, despite committing ¬£14.2bn to the development. The project aims to create 10,000 jobs over the next decade and provide energy security for the UK. However, it has faced opposition due to potential costs and environmental impacts. The government hopes the investment will attract private funding and reduce household energy bills, though the plant is not expected to generate power until the mid-2030s.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has defended his government's decision to partially reverse cuts to winter fuel payments, attributing the change to an improved economy rather than political pressure. The revised policy will extend the payment to nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less. Last year, the government had withdrawn the payments from all but the poorest pensioners to address a ¬£22bn budget shortfall. The government claims better growth figures and trade deals have enabled the expansion of eligibility.</p>

          <p>Scrapping the two-child benefit cap could lift up to 470,000 children out of poverty by allowing low-income families to claim an extra ¬£3,513 per year in universal credit for each additional child. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated a willingness to consider lifting the cap, which was implemented by the Conservative government in 2017. There are 1.2 million families with three or more children in the UK, and around 370,000 of these are households on universal credit, and removing the cap could cost the government ¬£3.5bn in 2029/30.</p>
