        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region saw gains on Thursday, mirroring a positive trend from Wall Street where a tech rally boosted major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Japan's Nikkei 225, Australia's S&P/ASX 200, and South Korea's Kospi all recorded increases in early trading. This upward movement occurred despite underlying investor concerns about the broader economy and continued focus on global bond markets, where long-term borrowing costs remain under pressure. The rally in U.S. tech shares was partly fueled by optimism following a court decision in an Alphabet antitrust case, suggesting tech giants might withstand regulatory challenges.

          <p>Argentine authorities have recovered an 18th-century Italian painting, 'Portrait of a Lady' by Giuseppe Ghislandi, that was looted by the Nazis during World War II. The artwork was discovered after Dutch journalists spotted it in an online real estate listing for a home in Mar del Plata, which belonged to a descendant of a senior Nazi legal advisor. The painting was originally part of the collection of Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, whose assets were seized by top Nazi official Hermann Göring. Valued at approximately $50,000, the recovered portrait is reported to be in good condition and is being held for safekeeping.</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights that China's decade-long industrial plan, 'Made in China 2025,' is strategically positioning the nation to become a dominant force in technology. The policy was designed to shift the country from a low-tech manufacturer to a high-tech innovator, with information technology being a primary focus. The plan utilizes a coordinated approach, combining central government leadership with flexible local implementation and substantial state funding to overcome previous structural weaknesses. This institutionalized strategy is aimed at transforming China into a leading producer, not just a consumer, of advanced IT products and other key technologies on the global stage.

          <p>Following Representative Jerry Nadler's announcement that he will retire, speculation has arisen about who will seek his influential Manhattan congressional seat. A spokesperson for Chelsea Clinton confirmed she is not considering a run, dismissing rumors to the contrary. However, John F. Kennedy’s grandson, Jack Schlossberg, indicated that a campaign for the seat is "certainly a possibility," marking his most direct signal of political ambition yet. Nadler's decision to step down after over three decades opens up a key Democratic stronghold, potentially setting the stage for a high-profile primary contest as a new generation of leaders emerges.</p>

The controversial "Great Jeans" ad with Sweeney generated significant online buzz, leading to her signature jeans selling out within a week. The company plans to continue its partnerships with both celebrities to maintain its positive momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova secured a significant victory over second seed Iga Swiatek in the US Open quarter-finals with a 6-4 6-3 win. Anisimova revealed that she rewatched her lopsided 6-0 6-0 Wimbledon final loss to Swiatek to motivate herself and identify areas for improvement, calling the US Open win the "most meaningful victory of my life." Displaying fearless and high-quality play, the eighth seed overcame her opponent in a confident performance at Flushing Meadows. Anisimova, who has recently focused on her mental health, credited her improved mindset for her ability to bounce back and will now face Naomi Osaka in the semi-finals.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in grant funding for Harvard University was illegal, describing it as a "targeted, ideologically-motivated assault." Judge Allison Burroughs stated the administration used concerns about antisemitism as a pretext to retaliate against the university for not complying with demands that violated First Amendment rights, such as altering its curriculum and admissions. The ruling vacates the freeze, which had halted numerous critical research projects, including those on tuberculosis and for NASA. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, maintaining that Harvard failed to protect its students.</p>

          <p>China is making significant strides in developing artificial intelligence "agentic frameworks," which are the foundational tools for creating AI agents capable of autonomous tasks. Tech giant Tencent recently open-sourced its Youtu-Agent framework, joining other major Chinese players like ByteDance and Alibaba in the field. This move signals a growing effort within China to compete with leading U.S. firms such as OpenAI and AutoGen. These advanced AI agents are designed to perform complex operations for users by independently planning and executing a series of subtasks, marking a key area of development in the global technology race.</p>

          <p>Major Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers like Nio, Xpeng, and Zeekr must significantly increase their vehicle deliveries in the coming months to reach their 2025 break-even targets. While second-quarter losses have narrowed due to aggressive price discounts boosting sales, the intense competition and ongoing price war in the world's largest auto market continue to pose a challenge. Nio's CEO, William Li, stated the company aims to deliver 50,000 vehicles per month in the fourth quarter, a substantial increase from current levels. Analysts warn that failing to control losses could threaten the survival of some EV builders in the highly competitive market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants, stating that the situation does not meet the law's requirement of an "invasion or predatory incursion." The administration had used the obscure wartime statute to expel hundreds of alleged gang members, arguing their presence constituted an incursion. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this argument, finding that encouraging illegal immigration is not equivalent to an armed invasion. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction, marking a significant legal setback for the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, though the government can still seek removal under other authorities.</p>

          <p>The municipal government of Shaoxing, a city in eastern China, has introduced a new stimulus measure to boost local consumption by offering subsidies to people who host large banquets. Under the plan, individuals who host five or more tables and spend over 10,000 yuan on a meal will be eligible for a subsidy of up to 5,000 yuan. This initiative is part of a broader effort to encourage spending across various sectors, including dining, cars, and housing, amid concerns about strained economic growth. The policy highlights the challenge local officials face in promoting consumption while adhering to national anti-corruption campaigns that discourage extravagance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached between Democrats, voting rights groups, and the Department of Justice to ensure approximately 98,000 North Carolina voters will not be removed from the rolls. The DOJ, under the Trump administration, had sued the state to block these voters because their registrations lacked a driver's license or partial Social Security number. The Democratic National Committee intervened, arguing the move was partisan and violated federal law. The resulting consent agreement allows the affected individuals to provide the missing information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively preserving their ability to vote while satisfying the legal requirements.</p>

The move comes after the nonprofit organization, which provides unfiltered coverage of U.S. government proceedings, faced financial deficits due to the declining number of traditional pay-TV subscribers. C-SPAN's three channels will be added to the base packages of both services this fall. The deals follow a U.S. Senate resolution in June that urged streaming companies to carry the network to ensure Americans have continued access to its programming.</p>
