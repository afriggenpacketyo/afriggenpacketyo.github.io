The incident began when several inmates refused to comply with directives to return to their cells. Three guards were briefly held hostage but were released safely with minor injuries. Local law enforcement agencies assisted in securing the facility, preventing any inmates from breaching the main fence and escaping. One correctional officer sustained minor injuries and was treated at a hospital before being released. </p>

          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort, faces scrutiny for its lack of transparency as it becomes a major player in the fire insurance market. Unlike private insurers, the FAIR Plan does not publicly disclose basic financial data or hold open board meetings, raising concerns about accountability. New rules now require all property insurance policyholders to cover the FAIR Plan's debts, increasing the importance of public oversight. Following investigations, the FAIR Plan has agreed to release more information, including the composition of its board and its reinsurance structure.</p>
