          <p>In an economy marked by persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure savings option with returns that can outpace the inflation rate. Current national average yields for CDs vary by term, but top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some 6-month and 1-year CDs offering APYs over 4%. Experts suggest that short-term CDs currently provide better rates than long-term ones due to an inverted yield curve. Savers are advised to compare offers from different institutions, particularly online banks, to secure the most competitive rates for their savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid a challenging housing market with high interest rates, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance face affordability issues. As of early October 2025, the national average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is approximately 6.34%, while a 30-year refinance rate is around 6.64%. Experts suggest that while rates are higher than in recent years, borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable terms. To get the best rate, consumers are advised to strengthen their credit, pay bills on time, and compare offers from multiple lenders before making a decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British tennis player Sonay Kartal believes she is on the right path to breaking into the world's top 10, despite her quarter-final exit at the China Open. The 23-year-old lost to Linda Noskova after a notable tournament run that included a victory over world number five Mirra Andreeva. Kartal, currently ranked 81st, expressed that her performance in Beijing has given her significant confidence. She feels that with minor additions to her game, she can compete at a much higher level in the sport.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team began their Women's World Cup campaign with a decisive 10-wicket victory over South Africa in Guwahati. The English bowlers dismantled the South African batting lineup, dismissing them for a mere 69 runs in just over 20 overs. Left-arm spinner Linsey Smith was the standout performer, taking three key wickets for only seven runs. England's openers, Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont, then comfortably chased the small target, giving their team a significant net run-rate boost early in the tournament.</p>

By renting server capacity from smaller providers, Microsoft aims to alleviate the strain on its own data centers. This strategy allows the tech giant to redirect its internal resources toward serving its cloud customers and advancing collaborative projects with OpenAI. (not investment advice)</p>

He acknowledged that Bellingham, who is returning from injury, wanted to be included but had not yet regained his full rhythm at Real Madrid.

          <p>Scientists have detected a free-floating rogue planet experiencing a dramatic growth spurt, consuming surrounding gas and dust at an unprecedented rate of six billion tonnes per second. The planet, named Cha 1107-7626, is located about 630 light-years away and has a mass five to ten times that of Jupiter. Observations from the European Southern Observatory revealed that this accretion process is unstable, with the growth rate increasing eightfold in recent months. This discovery blurs the lines between star and planet formation, suggesting some rogue planets may form through star-like processes involving magnetic fields.</p>

          <p>Originating in Colombia, cumbia music found a fervent and lasting home in the migrant neighborhoods of Monterrey, Mexico, where it spawned a unique subculture. This scene is defined by "sonideros," vinyl-collecting DJs who accidentally created a slowed-down style called "cumbia rebajada." The music became intertwined with the identity of local youth, known as "cholombianos," who blended cholo aesthetics with a deep reverence for Colombian artists. Despite periods of intense violence when organized crime dominated the city, the cumbia scene has shown remarkable resilience and is returning to the streets.</p>

          <p>After nearly 34 years, law enforcement officials in Austin, Texas, have announced a major breakthrough in the infamous 1991 yogurt shop murders. New ballistic and DNA technology has linked the crime, in which four teenage girls were killed, to Robert Eugene Brashers, a serial killer who died in 1999. The connection was made after a shell casing from the scene was matched to an unsolved murder in Kentucky, and a fragmented DNA profile matched a case in South Carolina. This development brings long-awaited answers and is expected to fully exonerate two men who were wrongly convicted.</p>

          <p>According to Brendan Wallace, CEO of venture capital firm Fifth Wall, the property technology sector is emerging from a challenging three-year "winter," evidenced by recent successful IPOs and new unicorns. However, he notes that investment in climate-related property tech is struggling due to a negative shift in political sentiment away from sustainability and ESG initiatives. Despite this, Wallace remains optimistic about the long-term prospects for climate tech in real estate, citing the ongoing need for decarbonization and the potential for local governments to drive change through carbon taxes.
