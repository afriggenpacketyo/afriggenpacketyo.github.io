        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The urban planning philosophy long championed by King Charles is significantly shaping the design of a new generation of towns set to be announced by the English government. These new developments will prioritize walkability, environmental sustainability, and "gentle density" housing like terraces, moving away from high-rise buildings and car-centric designs of the past. Architectural experts note that the King's once-controversial views, which favor traditional styles and community-focused public spaces, have now become mainstream, influencing planners to create more humane and locally sensitive environments.</p>

          <p>As Beijing prepares to host a global summit on women's rights, the Chinese government is emphasizing its advancements in gender equality. A foreign ministry spokesperson stated that China is an "active actor" in promoting women's development, highlighting significant progress over recent decades. The summit is expected to include international officials, though domestic NGOs may not be invited unless sponsored by foreign entities. This focus comes as two new books by President Xi Jinping were published, featuring his speeches on topics ranging from gender equality to traditional family values.</p>

          <p>A specialized UK Ministry of Defence unit has solved a century-old mystery by identifying the remains of two Scottish soldiers killed in the Battle of Loos during World War One. The soldiers, Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan, were discovered during construction work for a new hospital in France. Investigators, nicknamed "war detectives," used regimental artifacts, census records, and even a set of tramway buttons found with one soldier to narrow down the identities before confirming them with DNA from living relatives. The soldiers were recently laid to rest with full military honors.</p>

This unusual summons of high-ranking officers from around the world has raised questions about the logistics, costs, and security required for such an event.

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic flooding and landslides in western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their crucial role in the immediate aftermath. With roads washed out and communication lines down, these pilots were among the first to witness the scale of the destruction and became a lifeline for stranded residents. They conducted dozens of rescue missions and flew in essential supplies like food and medicine, coordinating with groups like the United Cajun Navy. Their efforts, alongside the National Guard which performed hundreds of air rescues, were vital in saving lives and supporting isolated communities.</p>

          <h2>Entrepreneurs Discuss Overcoming Business Failure and Redefining Success</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Startup founders are sharing their experiences of navigating the emotional and professional challenges of business failure and finding new paths forward. Entrepreneurs describe the intense personal pressure, the difficulty of disappointing investors and employees, and the sense of lost identity that can follow a company's collapse. Some who return to corporate life face a stigma, though many argue their experience makes them highly capable employees with a broad understanding of business operations. Ultimately, many founders find that reframing success around a deep sense of purpose, rather than just financial metrics, is key to building resilience.</p>

          <p>In an effort to attract more foreign visitors and stimulate its tourism sector, China is continuing to relax its entry requirements. The country now offers several ways for travelers to enter without a visa, including a transit program that allows passport holders from 55 nations to stay for up to 10 days. Other policies permit longer visa-free stays for citizens of specific countries, with Russia being the latest nation whose citizens can stay for up to 30 days. These measures are designed to lower the bureaucratic and financial hurdles that have traditionally been part of visiting mainland China.</p>

          <h2>England and Canada's Rugby World Cup Final Highlights Stark Funding Disparities</h2>

          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada showcases more than just a battle for the title; it represents a clash of economic models in the sport. England, the world's best-funded team with 32 full-time professional players, faces a Canadian side whose athletes earn a fraction of that and rely on fundraising to cover costs. Despite the massive financial gap, Canada has proven to be a formidable opponent, with many of its players gaining experience in England's top domestic league. A Canadian victory could challenge the narrative that full professionalism is the only path to success in women's rugby.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As England prepares for the Women's Rugby World Cup final, the diverse off-field careers of its players highlight the sport's recent journey toward professionalism. Hooker Amy Cokayne, for instance, is also a police officer in the Royal Air Force, balancing her military career with elite rugby through the RAF's Elite Athlete Scheme. This contrasts with the 2014 World Cup-winning team, where players like Marlie Packer had to return to jobs as plumbers immediately after their victory. While top players are now fully professional, many had to support themselves in other jobs before contracts became available.</p>

          <p>A new and diverse peace movement is emerging in Germany, with recent demonstrations in Berlin drawing thousands to protest the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. Organized by prominent figures like politician Sahra Wagenknecht, the rallies call on the government to actively support peace negotiations and halt all arms deliveries to war zones. While the movement is currently fragmented and faces criticism for its positions, it reflects a growing anti-war sentiment in the country. Analysts suggest that the ongoing debate over reintroducing compulsory military service could further mobilize young people into a more powerful force.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is championing a new, "ambitious" youth migration agreement with the European Union, aiming to boost the nation's economic outlook before the upcoming autumn Budget. She argues that an exchange scheme for young workers aged 18 to 30 would stimulate growth and benefit businesses. Reeves is urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential positive economic impact of such a deal into its forecasts, which could help reduce the need for future tax hikes or spending cuts. The proposal faces criticism from opponents who view it as a partial return to freedom of movement.</p>
