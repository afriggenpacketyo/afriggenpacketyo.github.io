          <p>In Lexington, Kentucky, an 8-year-old boy mistakenly ordered nearly 70,000 Dum-Dums lollipops online, resulting in a $4,200 charge. After initially refusing a refund, Amazon eventually relented, and the mother, Holly LaFavers, decided to donate the candy to local organizations. The New York Times article details the community's response, with neighbors, churches, and businesses offering to buy or distribute the lollipops.

While hailed as a milestone, officials describe the deal as the "end of the beginning" of broader trade talks, with Starmer aiming to further reduce tariffs.
