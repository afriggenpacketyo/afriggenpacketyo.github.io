          <p>Tesla has signed an agreement to construct China's largest grid-scale battery power plant, marking its first such deal in the country amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. The project, valued at 4 billion yuan ($556 million), involves collaboration between Tesla, the Shanghai local government, and China Kangfu International Leasing. The grid-side energy storage power station will function as a smart regulator for urban electricity, addressing power supply pressures and ensuring stable electricity demand, with the Shanghai factory having already produced over 100 Megapacks in the first quarter of the year. The project is expected to be the largest of its kind in China upon completion, offering up to 1 megawatt of power for four hours per Megapack. The ability to adjust grid resources is considered a major factor in the plant's overall design.</p>

          <p>Circle's stock price has surged following the Senate's approval of the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Shares of Circle rose significantly after the bill passed the Senate and moved to the House of Representatives, with Coinbase shares also climbing due to their revenue share from Circle's USDC reserves. The GENIUS Act aims to modernize dollar payment rails, improve transparency, and promote dollar dominance, potentially attracting interest from major companies like Amazon and Walmart who are reportedly exploring stablecoins. Alex Thorn from Galaxy Digital noted the bill's potential to bring traditional finance onto public blockchains, fostering wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Silver prices are experiencing a significant surge, leading investors to consider its potential as a viable alternative to gold. Since the start of the year, silver has risen by 28%, driven by strong industrial demand, especially in solar panels. While gold has traditionally been viewed as an income protector, silver presents a more affordable entry point for investors looking to hedge against inflation and diversify their portfolios. Financial experts recommend a mix of precious metals, including silver, up to 10% of an overall portfolio, but the choice between gold and silver depends on individual budget and goals.

She highlights her commitment to prioritizing qualifications over party affiliation when confirming presidential appointments, citing her opposition to Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation as an example. Murkowski expresses hope that her story will inspire others to engage in public service and prioritize problem-solving over ideological purity, and she encourages voters to elect individuals dedicated to solving problems and representing their constituents' needs.</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with the first driverless trip from the factory to a customer's house planned for June 28. The initial rollout will involve a limited number of Model Y vehicles operating within a geofenced area, monitored by remote drivers as a backup. Access to the rides will be by invitation only, with some social media influencers reporting early access. Analysts believe successful implementation of robotaxis could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization, but the company faces pressure to deliver on Musk's promises.</p>

The changes, to be phased in over three years from 2026, aim to address the higher demand for council services and weaker council tax bases in poorer regions. While Labour ministers argue the current system reinforces the divide between deprived places and the rest of the country, rural councils have raised concerns about potential losses.

          <h2>Comparing $200,000 Home Equity Loan and HELOC Costs in 2025</h2>

          <p>With home equity levels rising, homeowners are considering home equity loans and HELOCs, but calculating repayment costs is crucial. In June 2025, the rates for home equity loans and HELOCs are similar, but HELOCs have variable rates, making long-term costs unpredictable. Home equity loans offer fixed rates, providing payment stability, but HELOCs offer interest-only payment options during the draw period. Borrowers should compare both options carefully and consider refinancing in the future if rates change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>How Did My MP Vote on the Assisted Dying Bill?</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>MPs in England and Wales have voted to legalize assisted dying, with the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill passing by a majority of 23 votes. The bill, introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, allows terminally ill individuals to end their lives under specific conditions, including being over 18, living in England or Wales, and having a life expectancy of fewer than six months. The bill now moves to the House of Lords for further scrutiny, and MPs were given a free vote on the issue, meaning parties did not instruct them on how to vote. The majority in favor has more than halved since MPs first backed proposals to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales.</p>

          <h2>Americans More Vulgar Online Than Brits, Aussies, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 10:38:00 EDT</div>

          <p>A linguistic study analyzing billions of words found that Americans swear more online than other English-speaking groups. Researchers assessed websites and blogs across 20 English-speaking regions, discovering that Americans use curse words 0.036% of the time, compared to the British at 0.025%. The study suggests the anonymity of the screen may contribute to the higher rate of vulgarity among Americans online. Linguists emphasize that understanding swearing in culture is valuable for integrating into new environments and improving communication skills, noting the importance of using language appropriately.</p>
