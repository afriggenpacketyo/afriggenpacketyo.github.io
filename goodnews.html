          <p>Democrats are attempting to leverage parental anxieties over rising baby gear costs, vaccine misinformation, and cuts to safe sleep campaigns, linking these issues to President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Rising prices of strollers and car seats due to Trump's tariffs, measles outbreaks, and the administration's approach to vaccines are fueling parental fears. Democrats are hoping to mobilize parents by highlighting these concerns, contrasting them with Republican messaging. Concerns are also growing over the safety and privacy of children's health, potentially motivating voters.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Barry Diller's memoir, "Who Knew," discusses the importance of instinct over excessive data analysis in creative and business decisions. Diller emphasizes that data can only reflect the past, not predict the future, and that relying solely on structured information can limit understanding. He recounts instances where instinct led to successful projects, such as the made-for-TV movies "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," illustrating the value of trusting one's gut feeling and common sense.</p>
