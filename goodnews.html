          <p>China's central bank has decided to keep its benchmark lending rates steady, specifically the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, following a previous rate cut in May. This decision comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and China have somewhat eased due to a recent trade agreement reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade while suspending prohibitive tariffs. Experts suggest that the reduced foreign exchange pressure on the renminbi gives the People's Bank of China greater flexibility in future policy maneuvers. Chinese officials are reportedly satisfied with the current monetary policy and are exploring alternative avenues to stimulate economic growth, while keeping interest rate cuts in a supporting role.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump likely acted within his authority when federalizing the California National Guard amidst protests over immigration raids. The court's decision effectively blocks a lower court order that would have returned control of the guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. The judges cited acts of violence during the protests, including protesters pinning down federal officers and damaging federal buildings, as justification for Trump's action. The appeals court order puts on hold the lower court's ruling, which had deemed Trump's action illegal and ordered the guard's control be turned over to Newsom.</p>

          <p>A California appeals court has temporarily sided with President Trump, allowing him to maintain control over California National Guard troops in Los Angeles. This decision rejects Governor Gavin Newsom's attempt to regain control of the Guard, which Trump federalized to prevent interference with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The court's order blocks a lower court ruling that had found Trump's use of the Guard illegal. Trump's lawyers argued he acted within his constitutional authority, citing instances where protests turned violent and impeded immigration agents.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump Administration cannot withhold billions of dollars in transportation grant funding from states refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. The judge granted a preliminary injunction in a case filed by 20 states, stating that large-scale irreparable harm would occur without the injunction. The ruling prevents the Department of Transportation from imposing conditions on funding that require states to adhere to an Immigration Enforcement Condition. The judge found no plausible connection between cooperating with ICE enforcement and the congressionally approved purposes of the transportation funding.</p>

The close ties between Beijing and the five Central Asian countries have raised questions about whether Russia's regional dominance is waning due to its preoccupation with the Ukraine war. While the Kremlin dismisses these concerns, diplomatic observers note that Moscow has limited capacity to counterbalance China's increasing influence, even though Beijing avoids directly challenging Russia's role as Central Asia's key security guarantor.</p>

          <p>AI avatars in China have demonstrated their potential to outperform human influencers in a recent livestreaming experiment. Chinese influencer Luo Yonghao and his co-host Xiao Mu used digital avatars based on Baidu's generative AI model, generating 55 million yuan ($7.65 million) in sales over six hours. This outperformed Luo's previous livestreaming attempt with human hosts, showcasing the effectiveness of AI-driven interactions. The avatars were built using Baidu's AI model, which learned from five years of videos to mimic their style and jokes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indiana Fever coach Stephanie White will be taking a leave of absence for personal reasons, causing her to miss the game against the Golden State Valkyries. Assistant coach Mike Kelly will serve as the acting head coach, marking his second time in the role this season. The team's message remains consistent: playing for each other, excelling on defense, and using that energy to fuel the offense. This is White's first season in her second stint as Indiana's head coach, having previously led the Fever from 2015 to 2016.</p>
