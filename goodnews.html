        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist skeptical of the EU and against military support for Ukraine, won the first round of the Romanian presidential election rerun. Simion, who garnered significant support from the Romanian diaspora, particularly in Italy, Spain, and Germany, is an admirer of Donald Trump and advocates for an EU of sovereign nations. He faces a runoff on May 18, with his potential victory causing concern in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow, given Romania's role as a transit route for weapon systems and ammunition to Ukraine. Simion has hinted at a less proactive approach to supporting Ukraine and calls for restoring Romania's old borders, having been banned from entering Moldova and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese scientists suggest that the "Shi's Star Catalogue," an ancient astronomical list, may be the world's oldest star log, dating back 2,400 years. Their study, published in Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics, indicates the catalogue was created around 335BC, predating the Greek Hipparchus star catalogue. By converting ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, the researchers confirmed the approximate years of observations. This finding challenges the long-held belief that the Hipparchus catalogue was the oldest known human record of the stars.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) is estimated to rank fourth among OECD members in 2024, falling behind Britain. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years. The OECD report also noted an overall decline in ODA by Development Assistance Committee members, primarily due to reduced contributions to international organizations and decreased aid for Ukraine.</p>
