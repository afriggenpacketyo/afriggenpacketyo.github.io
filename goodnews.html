          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days to de-escalate the trade war. Officials from both countries said they would suspend tariffs while they negotiate a sustainable, long-term, and mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship. Under the agreement, the United States would reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 30 percent from 145 percent, while China would lower import duties on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the consensus from both delegations is that neither side wanted a decoupling of the two economies.</p>

          <p>Suffolk County, New York, has strengthened its animal cruelty laws by making it a Class A misdemeanor for convicted animal abusers to own pets. The new law carries penalties of up to a year in jail or a $1,000 fine, expanding on a 2010 law that created an animal abuse registry. County Executive Ed Romaine emphasized the county's commitment to protecting animals, while Legislator Stephanie Bontempi highlighted the closure of a loophole in the existing law. The expanded legislation was enacted shortly after dozens of dead cats were discovered in a Long Island home.</p>

McIlroy has won multiple times at Quail Hollow, including victories in 2021 and 2024, and feels comfortable with the course's layout and the support from the Charlotte community. The course setup will be tougher than usual, with longer rough and softened slopes on the greens to challenge the field.

          <p>An essay discusses a student-led movement in Serbia that is challenging the country's increasingly autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic. The movement was catalyzed by a train station collapse in Novi Sad, which killed 16 people and sparked protests against corruption. Despite government attempts to undermine the protests, a massive demonstration occurred on March 15, with close to half a million people filling the streets of Belgrade. The article highlights the movement's unique approach, operating without leaders or hierarchies and emphasizing solidarity and horizontal decision-making.</p>

The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured funding to begin feasibility studies into their return, as elk are considered a "keystone" species that can create and maintain habitats for diverse other species. The funding will pay for a disease risk assessment, and the project will consult with local communities and landowners.

          <p>Hamas says it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who is believed to be the last living captive with US nationality in Gaza, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement. The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday. A senior Hamas official told the BBC that the Palestinian armed group was holding direct negotiations with a US administration official in Qatar. The Israeli PM's office said it had not committed to any ceasefire but only to a "safe corridor" for Mr Alexander's release.</p>
