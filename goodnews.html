          <p>Senator John Kennedy argues that the Supreme Court should use the current cases before it to end the practice of universal injunctions, which allow individual district court judges to halt federal government enforcement of a law or policy nationwide. He asserts that this power is not granted by the Constitution and undermines the judicial system by allowing a single judge to overrule the decisions of many others. Kennedy contends that universal injunctions force the Supreme Court to rush decisions on complex legal issues, disrupting the thorough and deliberative process the court prefers. He hopes the court will seize this opportunity to stabilize the judiciary and the system of government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants. The case primarily focuses on whether lower court judges can issue nationwide injunctions to block presidential orders. Trump argues that the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause does not apply to children of undocumented immigrants. Opponents contend that ending birthright citizenship would create a "second-class status" for those born and raised in the U.S., potentially rendering them stateless. The court's decision could significantly impact Trump's ability to implement executive orders without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive rhetoric and policies are reportedly costing the U.S. billions in international travel spending, as many people deem a trip to the U.S. not worth the risk. Immigration lawyers and civil rights experts suggest that enforcement has become more aggressive, with potential targeting of non-citizens based on viewpoints and ideology. Travelers should be aware of their social media activity and public expressions, particularly regarding criticism of Israel or support for Palestinian rights, as these may be scrutinized. Travelers are advised not to travel with data they wouldn't want the U.S. government to access and to understand the rules for their specific visa or immigration status.</p>

          <p>MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred's decision to reinstate Pete Rose and Joe Jackson to Hall of Fame eligibility has sparked debate, particularly given baseball's increasing integration with legalized gambling. Rose's ban for gambling on baseball, while managing, contrasts sharply with MLB's current partnerships with gambling entities like DraftKings, raising concerns about gambling addiction and the integrity of the sport. While Manfred argues that deceased players pose no threat, critics point to the damage Rose inflicted during his lifetime and his initial lack of remorse.

The volcano's eruptions create hydrothermal vents that release warmth and nutrients, making it a hotspot for unique plants and animals. While the eruption is not expected to impact humans, it will likely trigger small earthquakes. Scientists are using the Ocean Observatories Initiative to monitor the volcano and improve long-term underwater volcano forecasting.

Support for Reform has grown across various demographic groups, blurring traditional dividing lines such as age and gender. While the Conservatives maintain robust support among pensioners, Labour's share has declined across the country, with Reform leading in the Midlands and the South outside of London.

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, exceeding analysts' forecasts and providing a boost for the Labour government. The growth was primarily driven by the services sector, with a positive contribution from manufacturing. While some analysts suggest this growth may be temporary due to upcoming tariffs and tax increases, others point to business investment as a positive sign. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the figures as evidence of the UK economy's strength, while opposition parties cautioned against complacency.</p>

          <p>Marjut Hannonen, head of trade for the European Union‚Äôs delegation in Beijing, stated that the EU has no interest in reviving stalled talks on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) with China. Hannonen noted that trade ties with China have "steadily deteriorated" over the past 15 to 20 years due to increasing business barriers. Despite recent signs of thawing relations and the lifting of Chinese sanctions on EU officials, the EU remains uninterested in resuming negotiations on the investment deal, which was initially touted as a landmark agreement.</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul indicated that Berlin is willing to "follow" US President Trump's demand for NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. This announcement came after a meeting with the US Secretary of State at a NATO foreign ministers gathering in Turkey. While some countries deem this target unrealistic, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte suggested a compromise. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the need for strong links within the alliance.</p>

          <p>Ola Aina suggests that Taiwo Awoniyi's injury during a Nottingham Forest match could have been avoided if the assistant referee had flagged Anthony Elanga for being offside earlier. Awoniyi suffered a serious abdominal injury after colliding with a post while trying to reach Elanga's cross. Aina asserts that Elanga was "miles offside" and that the assistant referee's delayed flag, due to a protocol introduced in 2020, contributed to the incident. The article raises questions about the offside protocol's impact on player safety.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering doubling the supply of stockpiled rice to about 600,000 tons to combat near-record high rice prices. The measure involves releasing 300,000 tons of reserve rice over three months through July, in addition to 321,000 tons already auctioned. This action could reduce the stockpile to about a third of the appropriate reserve level, raising concerns about future responses to poor harvests. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements to encourage greater participation in auctions.</p>
