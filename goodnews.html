        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Francisco is embracing its role as an AI leader by rolling out Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o, to 30,000 city workers across various departments. Mayor Daniel Lurie announced this significant step, aiming to enhance city services, reduce response times, and streamline administrative tasks like data analytics and report drafting. A successful six-month pilot involving over 2,000 employees demonstrated productivity gains of up to five hours weekly, making San Francisco one of the largest local governments globally to leverage generative AI. The initiative utilizes existing Microsoft licenses, incurring no additional cost to the city, and is positioned as a beacon for other municipalities worldwide.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 17:03:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reddit has announced the implementation of age verification measures on its UK site, effective Monday, to prevent individuals under 18 from accessing "certain mature content." This proactive step ensures compliance with the UK's new Online Safety Act, which mandates "robust" age checking techniques for platforms displaying adult material. An external firm, Persona, will conduct the verification using either a selfie or a government ID, with Reddit only retaining verification status and date of birth to protect user privacy. Regulator Ofcom lauded Reddit's move, emphasizing that other companies must follow suit or face substantial fines and potential business disruption measures under the impending July 25th deadline.</p>

          <h2>New Tax Break for Car Buyers Introduced in "One Big Beautiful Bill Act"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 16:47:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of U.S. car buyers could soon benefit from a new tax break introduced as part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," signed into law by President Trump. Beginning with 2025 purchases, the legislation allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in qualified passenger vehicle loan interest annually, even if they take the standard deduction. However, this benefit is limited to new, U.S.-assembled light vehicles bought for personal use, excluding used cars and leased autos, and is subject to income limitations. Concurrently, the act eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles after September 30, altering incentives for car ownership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk has announced his intention to seek shareholder approval for Tesla to invest in his artificial intelligence company, xAI, while explicitly stating he does not support a merger between the two. This move comes as xAI, the developer of the Grok chatbot, recently secured a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense, despite earlier controversies regarding Grok's problematic outputs. Tesla shares saw a slight increase following Musk's announcement, although the company has faced challenges this year, including a significant drop in profits. The decision underscores Musk's continued focus on integrating his various ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is actively pursuing a potential record-breaking deal to acquire Eintracht Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike, who impressed last season with 15 goals and eight assists in the Bundesliga. Sources indicate that the 23-year-old French forward would likely command a transfer fee exceeding £70 million, making him the club's most expensive signing if successful. Despite this strong interest in Ekitike, Newcastle officials have affirmed that they have no intention of selling their current top scorer, Alexander Isak, who joined the club for £63 million in 2022. Ekitike, who moved to Frankfurt last summer after an initial loan spell, remains under contract for another four years.</p>

Trump cited concerns over fentanyl transport from Mexico and an unacceptable trade deficit with the EU as justifications for the duties.

Trump also issued a stern warning to Moscow, threatening 100% secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia if a peace deal to end the Ukraine war is not reached within 50 days.

While the sheltered homeless population saw a slight increase, LAHSA data indicates a growing number of people transitioning into permanent homes. Despite these positive trends, some county supervisors express that the pace of reduction is still too slow, and potential federal funding cuts could impede future efforts.</p>
