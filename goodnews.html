          <p>Chinese researchers have created an infrared contact lens that enables humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred due to light scattering, the lens allows users to recognize patterns and signals in the dark, even with closed eyes. The technology could have applications in surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations, although some critics argue that night vision devices are more effective.</p>
