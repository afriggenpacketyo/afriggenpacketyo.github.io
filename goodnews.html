          <p>Deliveroo, a UK-based food delivery app, has agreed to be acquired by DoorDash, a US firm, for ¬£2.9 billion, marking the latest instance of a UK-listed company being bought by an American entity. This deal will establish a combined presence in over 40 countries, serving approximately 50 million monthly users. While Deliveroo's CEO expresses pride in the company's achievements, he views the DoorDash deal as transformative, enabling greater investment in product, technology, and consumer value. The takeover requires shareholder approval, and Deliveroo's co-founder stands to gain a substantial sum from his stake.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have engineered the world's smallest and lightest wireless robot that can transform its shape to navigate various environments. Inspired by Lego bricks, the microrobot utilizes a "morphable actuator" to convert energy into force, enabling it to move on land and in the air. The team from Tsinghua and Beihang universities suggests that this versatile robot could be used in complex situations, such as disaster rescue operations. The researchers emphasize that their robot boasts the smallest size, lightest weight, and fastest ground movement speed compared to other known wireless land-air robots.</p>

          <p>The UK government is contemplating restricting visa applications from countries with high rates of visa overstays and asylum claims, including Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. The Home Office believes some individuals abuse the system by switching from work or study visas to asylum claims to gain permanent residency. While critics argue the impact on overall asylum numbers will be minimal, proponents assert it aims to reduce perceived abuses of the system. The government's upcoming Immigration White Paper will detail plans to restore order to the immigration system.</p>

          <p>Despite facing massive tariffs due to the closure of a trade loophole, experts believe Temu and Shein are likely to remain dominant forces in the U.S. e-tail scene. The de minimis rule, which exempted U.S. imports worth $800 from trade tariffs, has been closed for shipments from China, exposing Temu and Shein to duties. However, e-commerce and supply chain experts suggest that the companies are agile and have contingency plans in place, including accelerating localization strategies and onboarding American sellers. Experts say that Temu and Shein have previously been able to offer products at a third of the prices on Amazon for comparable goods.</p>

Weaker sales were primarily attributed to soft demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, due to consumer uncertainty.
