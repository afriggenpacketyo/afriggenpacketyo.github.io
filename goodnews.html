        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy demonstrated unexpected strength in the first three months of the year, expanding by 0.7%, exceeding analyst forecasts. The Office for National Statistics attributed this growth primarily to the services sector, with notable contributions from production. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed these figures as indicative of the UK economy's potential, shadow chancellor Mel Stride cautioned against complacency, citing downgraded growth forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility and the International Monetary Fund. This article notes the impact of impending US tariffs and increased employer taxes, which analysts believe may temper future growth.</p>

          <p>The Eurovision Song Contest in Basel is underway, but not without its share of political tensions and controversies. Protests have erupted over Israel's participation, sparked by the country's military operations in Gaza, with some demonstrators accusing Eurovision of complicity in genocide. The European Broadcasting Union has implemented a code of conduct to prevent political statements during the competition. The article also notes other controversies, including complaints about song lyrics and staging, as well as the absence of information about Israeli singer Yuval Raphael's experience as a survivor of the Hamas attack on the Supernova festival. This article highlights the delicate balance between celebrating artistic expression and addressing sensitive political issues at the international event.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 03:31:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is considering doubling the release of its rice reserves to approximately 600,000 tons in an effort to curb soaring rice prices. This action comes amid concerns about a rice shortage and hoarding by wholesalers and farmers. While the increased supply aims to stabilize prices, it would reduce the government's stockpile to a level that may raise concerns about future responses to potential harvest failures. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential benefits of nature in aiding recovery from physical injury, drawing on personal stories and scientific research. Sarah Allely's experience with a brain injury led her to discover the pain-reducing effects of spending time in nature. Studies suggest that time in nature can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, and may also help with physical pain. Experts say that nature allows the brain to rest and restore, which can positively impact emotional and physical wellbeing. The article emphasizes the importance of quality over quantity when it comes to spending time in nature.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, fueled by pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate, but potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are unlikely to be a major factor. The IMF noted that most Danish drug products are neither produced nor shipped from Denmark. Danish drugmakers rely on a system where the intellectual property is the main value, and manufacturing is contracted to other countries. The IMF said heightened trade tensions and policy uncertainty pose risks to the outlook. The article highlights the significant role of Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications in driving Denmark's economic growth.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Changi Airport has broken ground on its fifth terminal, expected to be operational in the mid-2030s, which will nearly double the airport's existing area. The new terminal will allow the airport to handle 140 million passengers per year, up from its current capacity of 90 million. Asia is set to see a travel boom, and countries in the region are gearing up to exploit this surge in demand. With Terminal 5, Changi will aim to connect with 200 cities, up from the current 170 city links it has now.</p>
