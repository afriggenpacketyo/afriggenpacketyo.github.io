          <p>The Trump administration fired Shira Perlmutter, the top copyright official in the U.S., shortly after terminating Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. Perlmutter, who oversaw the U.S. Copyright Office, received an email from the White House stating her immediate termination. Hayden had appointed Perlmutter in October 2020, and she was also notified of her firing via email. Perlmutter's office recently released a report examining whether AI companies can use copyrighted materials to train their AI systems, emphasizing the centrality of human creativity in copyright protections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A head-to-head trial comparing weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy revealed that Mounjaro is more effective, leading to a 20% weight reduction compared to Wegovy's 14% over 72 weeks. The trial, funded by Mounjaro's manufacturer Eli Lilly, involved 750 obese individuals and found that those on Mounjaro also experienced greater waistline reduction and better blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. While both drugs have a role, researchers suggest Mounjaro may be more beneficial for those needing to lose the most weight. Both medications are available privately in the UK, with Mounjaro sales currently surpassing Wegovy.</p>

This push comes amid economic headwinds and disruptions to global trade caused by Trump's import tariffs.
