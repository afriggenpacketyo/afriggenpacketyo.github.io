          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. This move follows advocacy from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has raised concerns about the health effects of corn syrup. While Coca-Cola has not explicitly confirmed the change, a spokesperson acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and hinted at upcoming product innovations. The company currently uses cane sugar in many international markets, including Mexico and the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has launched a new "everything app" called Base App, aiming to integrate crypto-based payments, social media, and other services into a single platform for consumers. The app, which replaces Coinbase Wallet, is built on the company's Base blockchain and seeks to attract users not primarily interested in speculative trading. By bundling various functions and leveraging its low-cost, high-speed network, Coinbase hopes to create a new economic model for content creators and expand crypto's utility in everyday life, reducing its reliance on trading revenue.

          <p>Fox News Media has signed a licensing deal with the popular conservative podcast "Ruthless," signaling a broader trend of traditional media outlets partnering with digital creators to reach online audiences. The move aims to attract younger demographics who are consuming less traditional television. This strategy mirrors similar efforts by other media giants, like ESPN's deal with Pat McAfee, to stay relevant in a changing media landscape. The "Ruthless" co-hosts will retain editorial control and also serve as contributors on Fox News television programs.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama have publicly addressed and dismissed persistent rumors about their marriage being in trouble. Appearing together on a podcast, they joked about the speculation, which had been fueled by Barack Obama attending several high-profile events alone. Michelle Obama explained her recent absences by stating that with her daughters grown, she feels free to make her own choices. She reaffirmed the strength of their marriage, stating there has never been a moment she considered leaving her husband.</p>

          <p>Continuing his late mother's advocacy work, Prince Harry walked through a minefield in Angola to raise awareness about the ongoing danger of landmines. The event was organized with the HALO Trust, the same charity Princess Diana worked with during her historic visit 28 years ago. Harry visited a village in Cuito Cuanavale that has been cleared of mines, highlighting the progress made but also the persistent threat from explosives left over from the country's long civil war. He emphasized that children should not have to live in fear from the remnants of war.</p>

          <p>Germany is set to pass new legislation by the end of the year to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants across the English Channel to the United Kingdom. The commitment is part of a new UK-Germany agreement on migration and defense, announced during the German chancellor's visit to the UK. The new law will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to the UK, which is not currently a crime if the destination is outside the EU. This will allow German authorities to target warehouses storing small boats used for the crossings.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have captured the birth of a planetary system around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315, located 1,300 light-years away. Using NASA's Webb Telescope and other observatories, scientists identified the formation of silicate minerals, the building blocks of planets, in the disc of gas and dust surrounding the protostar. This discovery provides a direct glimpse into the earliest stages of planet formation, offering a real-world example of what our own solar system may have looked like in its infancy. The findings will help scientists better understand planetary origins.</p>

          <p>Financial expert Humphrey Yang suggests that many people may be able to retire much earlier than they think and outlines several key indicators. Among the most important signs are having paid off one's mortgage, which is typically the largest monthly expense for most families. Other factors include understanding the difference between a savings rate and a total nest egg, and having established multiple, diversified streams of income beyond a primary job. These elements create a strong financial position that can make stepping away from traditional employment a viable option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers in the United Kingdom have successfully used a pioneering technique involving DNA from three individuals to prevent the transmission of incurable mitochondrial diseases. Eight babies, born through this method at the Newcastle Fertility Centre, are reported to be healthy and free of the devastating conditions that affected their families. The process combines the nuclear DNA from the parents with healthy mitochondria from a female donor, creating an embryo with genetic material from three people. This breakthrough offers hope to families plagued by these often-fatal hereditary disorders.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that China is making significant progress in controlling the flow of fentanyl into the United States. This positive assessment marks a shift from his previous rhetoric, where he has used the fentanyl issue to justify imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. The comments come as high-level trade negotiations between the two countries are ongoing. In February, Trump had explicitly linked the continuation of tariffs to China's efforts to stop the drug's supply, but he now appears to be acknowledging cooperation from Beijing on the matter.</p>
