          <p>President Trump signed executive orders to reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and expedite the deployment of new nuclear reactors. The orders mandate the NRC to decide on reactor licenses within 18 months and focus on small, advanced reactors while supporting large plants. Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez, present at the signing, highlighted regulatory delays as a major industry problem. The orders also establish a framework for the Energy and Defense departments to build reactors on federal land for defense facilities and AI data centers, and aim to boost uranium mining and reactor testing. Nuclear stocks saw a rally following these actions.</p>
