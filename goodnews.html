          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer, identified as Darcy Deefholts, has been rescued after being reported missing off the coast of Wooli, New South Wales. He was found safe on North Solitary Island, a small, uninhabited island located about seven miles offshore, after spending a night there. A land and water search was initiated after he failed to return from a surf on Wednesday afternoon. His father described the rescue as a "one in a million miracle," expressing immense relief after fearing the worst for his son, who is now receiving medical attention.</p>

          <p>More than 30 construction workers were successfully rescued after a section of an 18-foot-wide industrial tunnel they were building in Los Angeles partially collapsed. The workers, located about 400 feet underground and six miles from the entrance, had to climb over a 12-foot pile of debris to reach a tunnel boring machine, which then transported them to safety. Officials reported no major injuries, and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass praised the first responders and the workers' composure during the incident. The cause of the collapse is under investigation, and work on the wastewater tunnel project is suspended.</p>

          <p>There is growing optimism for the future of football in the Democratic Republic of Congo, fueled by both on-field success and off-field developments. The men's national team is currently leading its qualification group for the 2026 World Cup, which would be their first appearance since 1974. Simultaneously, a recent peace deal with neighboring Rwanda, if it holds, could bring stability to the violence-plagued eastern regions of the country. This peace could allow for investment in sports infrastructure and provide young people with alternatives to conflict, potentially transforming the nation's sporting landscape.</p>

          <p>A journalist shares a personal story of taking his nine-year-old, neurodivergent son to his first professional soccer match, a Club World Cup semi-final at MetLife Stadium. Initially overwhelmed by the loud noises, fireworks, and general sensory overload of the FIFA-organized event, the boy became distressed. However, the experience was saved by the empathy of two stadium employees who provided noise-canceling headphones and moved the family to a quieter area. This act of human kindness allowed the son to experience the game on his own terms, serving as a poignant reminder that even within highly commercialized sporting events, individual compassion can shine through.</p>

          <p>Owen Farrell has been included as a replacement for the British and Irish Lions in their upcoming match against an Australia/New Zealand Invitational side, his first game in over two months. The fixture is the final one before the Lions begin their Test series against Australia. Farrell, who recently rejoined the tour as an injury replacement, is part of a lineup that sees Ben White starting at scrum-half and Tadhg Beirne captaining the team from the second row. The selection gives several players a final opportunity to make their case for a spot in the squad for the first Test against the Wallabies.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third heatwave of the summer, with temperatures expected to rise over the next few days and peak at 34°C (93°F) on Friday and Saturday. Yellow heat health alerts are active across central and southern England due to the climbing temperatures. The heat is also moving into Scotland and Northern Ireland, which may see their hottest days of the year. While widespread, this heatwave is not expected to break the UK's highest temperature record for the year. Cooler weather is forecast to move in by early next week, bringing temperatures back below the heatwave threshold.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To encourage exploration beyond popular tourist sites, the Faroe Islands' tourism board has launched 30 self-guided driving tours with a unique twist: the destinations are kept secret. Travelers use a phone-based guide, but each stop along the three-to-six-hour journey is only revealed as they progress. The system, called "Auto Odyssey," is designed to prevent crowding by ensuring different travelers are on different routes at any given time. This initiative aims to provide a more authentic and unpredictable travel experience, guiding visitors to lesser-known villages, restaurants, and scenic lookouts across the archipelago.</p>

          <p>Italy is hosting the fourth international conference focused on rebuilding Ukraine, bringing together political leaders, businesses, and international organizations in Rome. The meeting aims to foster public-private partnerships for modernizing Ukraine's defense, energy, and mining sectors, even as Russia intensifies its attacks on the country. The event occurs amid growing uncertainty about the future of U.S. commitment to Kyiv's defense under the Trump administration. With Ukraine's recovery estimated to cost over $500 billion, the conference seeks to lay the groundwork for a massive reconstruction effort and support Ukraine's path toward EU membership.</p>

          <p>The upcoming "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, is intentionally political, framing the iconic hero as a symbol of "universal morality" rather than just American exceptionalism. Gunn described his Superman as representing an America that is "beat-up" but still stands for kindness, a concept he says some will find offensive. This portrayal, along with the character's origin as an "undocumented alien" from another planet, has drawn criticism from right-wing commentators who fear the hero has become "woke." The film taps into a long history of interpreting the superhero, created by Jewish immigrants, as a defender of the weak and an outsider.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant advance for autonomous robotic surgery, a machine has performed a realistic gallbladder removal on a life-like model with 100% accuracy. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University announced that the robot, trained on surgical videos using machine learning, operated with the skill of an expert human surgeon. The system was able to identify and manipulate organs, adapt to unexpected changes like the introduction of dye, and even respond to voice commands from the research team. While the procedure took longer than a human, the achievement demonstrates that complex surgeries could one day be performed autonomously.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vienna is often cited as a model for successful housing policy, largely due to its extensive social-housing stock, which accounts for 43% of all units in the city. This system, which serves not only low-income but also middle-class households, keeps rent levels significantly lower than in the private market and helps to moderate private rents as well. The stability of this sector, which has resisted the large-scale privatization seen in other European cities, is a key feature. While challenges related to accessibility exist, Vienna's long-term political commitment to prioritizing housing as a basic need offers important lessons for other cities grappling with housing crises.</p>

          <p>Top tennis players, including Wimbledon semi-finalist Amanda Anisimova, are speaking openly about the challenges of managing mental health on the grueling professional tour. Anisimova took a months-long break from the sport due to burnout, a decision she says was necessary and has helped her return stronger. Other players like Carlos Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka also emphasize the importance of finding joy, taking breaks, and having a strong support system to cope with the 11-month season, constant travel, and immense pressure to perform. Their experiences highlight a growing awareness within the sport of the need to prioritize mental well-being alongside physical fitness.</p>
