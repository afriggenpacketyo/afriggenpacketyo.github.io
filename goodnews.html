        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is actively lobbying Senate Republicans to support the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a massive tax bill that encompasses much of the Republican legislative agenda. The White House is planning an "all-out advocacy effort," with administration officials pressuring senators and potentially traveling to states to garner support. Key sticking points include concerns about the bill's cost and potential Medicaid cuts, requiring a delicate political balancing act given the narrow Republican majority in both the House and Senate. The White House acknowledges limited room for maneuver, emphasizing the House's framework as the foundation for the legislation.</p>

Glasnow's return timeline is now uncertain, while Blake Snell is making progress in his throwing program and could begin bullpen sessions soon. Shohei Ohtani is on track to return after the All-Star break, and Michael Kopech and Kirby Yates are nearing bullpen reinforcements.</p>

While Sunny has left the nest, Gizmo, the other eaglet, remains, with it being unclear when it will be ready to fly. Both eaglets are expected to remain in the habitat for one to three months after fledging before venturing out on their own.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has issued pardons to two divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr, who were convicted of theft for freeing sharks and a grouper from a fisherman's longline off the Florida coast. The divers believed the line was illegal and freed the animals, but were later charged with theft after it was discovered the fisherman had a permit. The pardons erase their felony convictions, allowing them to vote, own firearms, and travel freely. The divers' attorneys expressed relief and stated that the case should never have been filed.</p>
