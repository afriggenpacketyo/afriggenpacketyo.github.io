          <p>Former President Donald Trump addressed judicial nominations and immigration policies, threatening tariffs on all movies produced abroad. Trump stated that the U.S. needs judges who will not demand trials for every illegal immigrant, citing the burden on the justice system due to mass illegal immigration. He claimed his overhaul of U.S. immigration policies was his No. 1 campaign issue, blaming radicalized judges for delaying the process. Trump's comments reflect a continued focus on immigration and judicial appointments as key priorities.</p>

          <h2>Roses Were Likely Yellow Initially, Genetic Study Reveals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers suggests that the first roses were likely yellow, despite the familiar saying "roses are red." The study, published in Nature Plants, analyzed domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that their common ancestor probably had single-petal flowers with yellow color. Roses, known as the 'queen of flowers,' have been cultivated in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, becoming a symbol of love and beauty.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu argue that China is rapidly catching up to or surpassing the United States in key technologies, particularly in artificial intelligence. They highlight China's ability to quickly develop and disseminate state-of-the-art technology, as well as its manufacturing prowess. The authors contend that the U.S. must adapt and innovate to maintain its competitive edge in the face of China's growing technological capabilities. The essay suggests that America needs to openly share more of its A.I. technologies and research, innovate even faster and double down on diffusing A.I. throughout the economy.</p>
