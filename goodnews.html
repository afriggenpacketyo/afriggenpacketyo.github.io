          <h2>Researchers Investigate Why Electric Vehicles Are More Likely to Cause Motion Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies suggest that electric vehicles are more likely to induce motion sickness compared to traditional internal combustion engine cars. Researchers attribute this phenomenon to the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs, particularly the low-frequency movements caused by regenerative braking systems. As EV adoption grows, this issue of passenger comfort and health is becoming a more significant area of focus for automotive engineers and researchers looking for potential technological solutions.</p>
