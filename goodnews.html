          <p>Morgan Stanley has downgraded Wells Fargo's stock rating, citing a lack of near-term catalysts and potential headwinds from interest rate cuts. The analysts believe the bank's profit from net interest income will see limited upside. However, some investment experts argue this view is outdated, pointing to Wells Fargo's strategic shift towards fee-based revenue from investment banking and capital markets, which are less dependent on Federal Reserve policy. The bank is also expanding its credit card business to diversify its income streams and leverage its large customer base. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump expressed confidence that peace could be achieved soon, with his administration having presented a detailed 21-point plan to both sides. The meeting also occurred as Trump prepared to meet with congressional leaders to negotiate a continuing resolution and avert a government shutdown. White House officials stated their message to Democrats is simple: pass a clean funding bill, asserting there is "nothing to negotiate" on that front.</p>

          <p>Shane Lowry became the hero for Team Europe at the Ryder Cup, sinking a crucial 6-foot putt on the 18th hole to secure a tie and retain the trophy against a surging American team. With several of his teammates losing their singles matches, the pressure fell squarely on Lowry to prevent a dramatic collapse at Bethpage Black. His euphoric celebration highlighted a moment of personal redemption after a difficult debut in 2021 and solidified his role as a respected leader within the European squad. Teammate Rory McIlroy praised Lowry's performance as "immense," marking a significant achievement in the Irish golfer's career.</p>

          <p>Brandon Stanton, the photographer behind the popular "Humans of New York" project, has opened up about his personal history, including a past battle with Adderall addiction. After flunking out of college and hitting rock bottom, Stanton eventually found a job in finance, but being fired from that role led to a mental health crisis. He credits that moment with pushing him to pursue photography, which he started as a "life preserver." Now, over a decade later, his project has raised $20 million for various causes and resulted in a new book, "Dear New York," with all proceeds going to charity.</p>

The playful taunt was prompted by a text message that team member Rory McIlroy received from the U.S. president, who is an avid golf fan and was briefly in attendance at the tournament. President Trump responded good-naturedly on social media, confirming he was watching and congratulating the team. The celebration continued on the team bus, with Shane Lowry leading chants in a moment that echoed the festive atmosphere of their previous victory in Rome.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched a new feature called "Instant Checkout," allowing ChatGPT users in the U.S. to purchase products directly through the chatbot. The service is initially available for single-item purchases from Etsy sellers, with over a million Shopify merchants, including major brands, expected to be added soon. This move into e-commerce could create a significant new revenue stream for OpenAI, which will collect a fee from each transaction. The feature is powered by a new framework built in partnership with Stripe, aiming to streamline the shopping experience by allowing users to complete purchases without leaving the ChatGPT interface.</p>

          <p>A caller on "The Ramsey Show" who amassed $1.1 million by investing in just a few stocks received blunt advice to sell and diversify. Financial personality Dave Ramsey warned that concentrating a fortune in a small number of companies is an "unsustainable" and risky strategy, as the investor's wealth is entirely dependent on the performance of those few firms. He recommended she sell the stock, pay the capital gains taxes, and reinvest the proceeds into a balanced portfolio of assets like mutual funds or ETFs. This approach spreads risk and reduces the potential for catastrophic losses if one particular company falters. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many people struggle to follow through on their financial goals, but behavioral scientists suggest a simple two-step process can significantly help. The first step is to set a clear savings goal, and the second is to create a reminder to take action on that goal. According to behavioral economist Katy Milkman, these reminders can be as simple as a calendar nudge or asking someone for accountability. For even better results, experts recommend automating savings so that a percentage of income is transferred without requiring active thought. This strategy is most effective when initiated during "fresh start" moments like the beginning of a new year.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda, the ninth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday. However, weather maps from the National Hurricane Center show the storm's path moving away from the southeastern United States. As of Monday, Imelda was bringing heavy rain to the northwestern Bahamas and is expected to turn east-northeastward toward Bermuda later in the week. While direct landfall on the U.S. mainland is not anticipated, swells generated by the storm are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the East Coast.</p>
