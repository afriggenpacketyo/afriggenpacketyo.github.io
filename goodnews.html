          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 09:15:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the competitive streaming market, children's programming like "CoComelon" and "Bluey" has become a crucial tool for retaining subscribers and ensuring profitability. This type of content is cost-effective to produce and has high re-watch value, which helps reduce customer churn—a key factor in a streaming service's economic health. While live sports and blockbuster series drive new sign-ups, extensive kids' libraries give families a reason to maintain long-term subscriptions. Major players like Netflix and Disney are heavily invested in this strategy, even partnering with YouTube to maximize reach and discoverability among young audiences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron is set to complete its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation following a favorable ruling from the International Chamber of Commerce. The arbitration panel rejected Exxon Mobil's claim that it held a right of first refusal over Hess's significant oil assets in the Stabroek Block, located off the coast of Guyana. This decision resolves major uncertainty that had weighed on the deal, with Exxon stating it respects the ruling and will welcome Chevron to the joint venture. The outcome is a major strategic victory for Chevron in the energy sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions, rail-transport companies from the United States and China are expressing a strong commitment to deepening their cooperation. At a recent industry roundtable, representatives from both nations highlighted the potential for collaboration on projects, including in third-country markets in regions like Latin America and Africa. A US official noted that America's leadership in freight rail complements China's expertise in high-speed rail, creating opportunities for synergy. Chinese firms already utilize equipment from American companies like Caterpillar and Cummins, and are looking to expand these partnerships into joint financing and operations.

          <h2>Analysis Shows New Tax Law Benefits Higher-Income Households Most</h2>

          <p>President Trump's recently signed tax law, which extends the 2017 cuts and adds new breaks, is projected to provide an average tax saving of $2,900 per household in 2026. However, an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center indicates that the benefits are disproportionately skewed towards wealthier Americans. According to the report, approximately 60% of the tax breaks will go to the top 20% of earners. While all income groups will see some savings, higher-income households will receive a significantly larger reduction as a percentage of their after-tax income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition affecting veins in the legs. The disclosure came after photographs showed swelling in the president's ankles, prompting a medical evaluation. According to his physician, the condition is benign and occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart, causing it to pool. The doctor's report confirmed no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis and stated that the president "remains in excellent health."</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has announced plans to stimulate domestic service consumption by reducing restrictive measures and attracting more foreign investment over the next five years. Minister Wang Wentao acknowledged a "shortage of high-quality service" and stated that sectors like healthcare and elderly care would be priorities for enrichment. This strategic shift towards boosting internal demand is a response to the uncertain global trade environment and ongoing trade disputes. The government aims to make domestic consumption a more reliable engine for economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent polling data indicates a significant shift in American public opinion, with attitudes toward immigration becoming more positive since President Trump began implementing his restrictive agenda. After years of rising anti-immigrant sentiment, a record 79% of Americans now view immigration as a good thing for the country, according to Gallup. This reversal suggests a "thermostatic" effect, where the public moves in the opposite direction of a president's policies. While support for some enforcement measures remains, disapproval of Trump's specific actions, such as suspending asylum programs and increasing raids, is growing.</p>

          <p>Shares of Swedish defense company Saab surged over 14% after reporting second-quarter profits and sales that significantly exceeded analyst expectations. The company also raised its full-year sales growth forecast, attributing the strong performance to a dramatic ramp-up in production to meet high demand. This growth is fueled by a broader European "era of rearmament," with nations increasing defense budgets in response to regional security threats and pressure from the U.S. to take more responsibility for their own defense. Saab's stock has risen 131% since the start of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
