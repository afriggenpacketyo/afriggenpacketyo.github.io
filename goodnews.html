          <p>Hawksmoor, a London restaurant, asked Tommy Robinson, a far-right activist, to leave after staff members expressed discomfort. The restaurant stated that its decision was based on the discomfort of guests and staff, and was not related to politics or belief. Robinson accused the restaurant of "discriminatory behavior" due to his political views. Tripadvisor has temporarily suspended reviews on some Hawksmoor restaurants due to an influx of reviews "that do not describe a first-hand experience".</p>

          <p>NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter captured a first-of-its-kind image of Arsia Mons, a 12-mile-high volcano on Mars, poking through clouds at dawn. The image provides an unprecedented view of the volcano on the planet's horizon. Arsia Mons is often surrounded by water ice clouds, especially in the early morning, and is twice as tall as Earth's largest volcano. The angle of the camera allows scientists to observe changes in dust and water ice cloud layers over the course of seasons, providing new clues about Mars' atmosphere.</p>
