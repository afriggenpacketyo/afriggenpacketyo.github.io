          <p>Dongchoon Circus, South Korea's last circus and oldest, commemorates its 100th anniversary. Founded in 1925, Dongchoon flourished during the 1960s, entertaining audiences with animal acts and diverse performances. However, the advent of television, the internet, and animal rights concerns led to the decline of circuses in South Korea, leaving Dongchoon as the sole survivor. Headed by Park Sae-hwan, the circus now features only acrobatic performances with a troupe of Chinese acrobats, and is performing at a big top in Ansan, drawing hundreds of spectators on weekdays and up to 2,000 on weekends, contributing to local tourism.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 23:15:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower their duty liabilities amid rising tariffs. This legal practice involves altering a product's materials, dimensions, or composition to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower tariff rates. For example, some manufacturers bundle steel and aluminum elements into their products to qualify for lower duties, while others remove these elements when tariffs change. Companies such as Columbia Sportswear and Converse have also implemented strategic product tweaks to save on tariff costs; Columbia adds zippered pockets to shirts, and Converse adds fuzzy-felt fabric to sneaker soles.</p>

Classic navy walls in the bedroom are also highly desired, with buyers willing to pay an estimated $1,815 more for a home featuring this color. In living rooms, buyers tend to prefer dark gray, which can boost an offer by about $2,600, while bright, playful colors may deter buyers.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. CEO Eiji Hashimoto stated that United States Steel Corp. is of growing strategic importance, particularly with the likelihood of higher U.S. tariffs on steel products remaining in place. Hashimoto believes that while the acquisition of U.S. Steel will benefit the U.S. economy, trade levies alone will not revive its manufacturing sector. Nippon Steel finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly-owned subsidiary, having concluded a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, pledging to invest around $11 billion by 2028 and maintain the headquarters in Pittsburgh.</p>
