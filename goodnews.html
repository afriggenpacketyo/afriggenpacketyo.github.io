          <p>Amazon shareholders rejected a proposal that sought to require the company's CEO and board chair roles to remain separate, with approximately 82% voting against the measure. The proposal aimed to codify the existing structure, where the roles are split between CEO Andy Jassy and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, arguing it would enhance corporate governance. Amazon urged shareholders to vote against the proposal, asserting that the current policy enables the board to determine the appropriate leadership structure based on the company's evolving needs. Shareholder proposals seeking the separation of board chair and CEO roles have been on the rise in recent years. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's military parade to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday will include a dog named Doc Holliday, an Australian Cattle Dog from the Army's 1st Cavalry Division Horse Cavalry Detachment.

The event aims to strengthen the connection between America and its Army, with plans for the Golden Knights to parachute onto the White House Ellipse and offer the president a folded American flag. The President will also administer the constitutional oath to 250 Army enlistees. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court issued a ruling that suggests Federal Reserve board members have special protection against being fired by the president, while allowing President Donald Trump to fire members of other federal agencies' boards for now. The court's decision highlights the unique structure and historical tradition of the Federal Reserve. Justice Elena Kagan dissented, arguing the ruling unnecessarily creates a bespoke Federal Reserve exception. The ruling came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated he would not resign if asked by Trump and that the president lacks the power to fire him. </p>

          <p>Representative Andrew Garbarino, a New York Republican, missed a critical vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill after falling asleep, contributing to the bill's narrow passage by a single vote.

Garbarino expressed pride in his work on the bill, particularly regarding the lifting of the state and local tax deduction cap. The measure now proceeds to the Senate, where its future remains uncertain. </p>
