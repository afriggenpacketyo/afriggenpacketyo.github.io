          <p>Spanish-Georgian fighter Ilia Topuria captured his second UFC title by moving up to the lightweight division and defeating Charles Oliveira with a stunning knockout at UFC 317 in Las Vegas. Topuria, who remains undefeated, is now the tenth fighter in UFC history to hold championships in two different weight classes simultaneously. After vacating his featherweight title to seek this new challenge, his victory solidifies his position as a dominant force in mixed martial arts. Following the fight, Topuria engaged in a face-off with potential future opponent Paddy Pimblett, setting the stage for another high-profile bout.</p>

          <p>Social media influencer turned boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by a unanimous points decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight from the outset, as Chavez Jr. appeared passive and reluctant to engage, drawing boos from the crowd and visible frustration from his father at ringside. Despite the clear victory, with judges scoring it 99-91, 97-93, and 98-92, questions remain about the quality of Paul's opponents. Paul, now 12-1, used the platform to call out reigning champions, fueling speculation about a potential, albeit controversial, future title shot.</p>

          <p>After a six-year wait for justice, a jury has convicted Samuel Woodward of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 killing of Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old gay and Jewish university student. Prosecutors successfully argued that Woodward, who had ties to the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen, was motivated by hate. The defense conceded Woodward killed Bernstein but claimed it was an act of provoked manslaughter, an argument the jury rejected. Bernstein's family, who founded a kindness movement called "BlazeItForward" in his honor, expressed relief at the verdict, which carries a sentence of life without parole.</p>

          <p>France is leading a ‚Ç¨1.35 billion investment into satellite company Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink for satellite internet services. This move, which makes the French state Eutelsat's largest shareholder, is part of a broader push for European technological sovereignty in the space sector. However, experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance, citing a massive disparity in scale. Eutelsat's OneWeb constellation has about 650 satellites, compared to Starlink's more than 7,000, posing a significant hurdle to achieving global parity in the consumer market.</p>

          <p>Quemoy, an island group administered by Taipei but located less than 10 kilometers from mainland China, serves as a unique example of the geopolitical standoff across the Taiwan Strait. Once a heavily militarized front line, it has transformed into a quiet community caught between two powerful political systems. Despite its history as a symbol of Taipei's governance, the island's unique position reveals the practical limitations of influence for both Beijing and Taipei. On-the-ground observations show a community navigating a complex identity, separate from the direct control and rhetoric of either side of the strait.</p>

The rules are part of a government initiative aimed at protecting children from secondhand smoke and creating a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. Violators could face fines up to ‚Ç¨700, although a grace period will be observed initially. The ban, however, does not extend to the outdoor terraces of bars and restaurants, and e-cigarettes are not included in the new regulations. The move comes as France continues to battle a high smoking rate, with over 30% of adults still smoking.</p>
