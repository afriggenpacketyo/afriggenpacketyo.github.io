          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 20:34:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for the U.S. stablecoin market. The bipartisan legislation provides consumer protections and defines legal standards for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. This new law allows banks, nonbanks, and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins, a move supporters believe will foster innovation and enable faster, lower-cost financial transactions. The administration also approved two other crypto-related bills, signaling a significant step toward integrating digital currencies into the mainstream financial system.</p>

          <p>Shares of Block, the fintech company founded by Jack Dorsey, experienced a significant jump after it was announced that the firm will join the S&P 500 index. The company is set to replace Hess following its acquisition by Chevron. This inclusion is notable as stocks often rally upon being added to a major index, prompting fund managers to rebalance their portfolios. Despite this positive development, Block's stock has underperformed this year, and the company recently issued a cautious financial outlook, citing challenging macroeconomic conditions.

          <p>A U.S. envoy has announced that the leaders of Israel and Syria have agreed to a ceasefire following recent Israeli airstrikes in Damascus. The agreement, reportedly backed by Turkey and Jordan, aims to de-escalate tensions in the war-torn region. The U.S. ambassador, Tom Barrack, called on all factions within Syria, including the Druze, Bedouins, and Sunnis, to lay down their arms and work toward building a new, united Syrian identity. This development follows Israeli military action which it claimed was to defend the Druze minority after clashes in southern Syria.</p>

          <p>For the first time in its 180-year history, a Marine Corps general has been nominated to lead the U.S. Naval Academy. The Pentagon announced that Lt. Gen. Michael J. Borgschulte, a 1991 graduate of the academy, is slated to become its next superintendent if confirmed by the Senate. This landmark nomination is seen as a significant move toward greater "naval integration" between the Navy and Marine Corps. The current superintendent, Vice Adm. Yvette Davids, who was the first woman to hold the post, is being reassigned to a new role at the Pentagon.</p>

          <p>The White House physician has diagnosed President Trump with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after he experienced mild swelling in his lower legs. The condition, described as benign and common in older adults, involves veins struggling to transport blood effectively back to the heart, causing it to pool in the legs. According to medical experts, CVI affects millions of Americans and is often managed with lifestyle changes like exercise, leg elevation, and compression stockings. The president's doctor stated there were no signs of more serious issues and declared him to be in "excellent health."</p>

          <p>The "California Forever" project, a controversial plan by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city in Solano County, has announced its intention to develop a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub within the proposed community. Dubbed the "Solano Foundry," the site would aim to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other high-tech industries, with the goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state. The project's CEO, Jan Sramek, framed the plan as a way to "re-industrialize" and restore the magic of "designed in California, made in California." Local community groups remain skeptical of the project's promises and overall feasibility.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing a particularly strong year for wasps, with pest control services reporting an increase in callouts for nests appearing earlier in the season. Experts suggest that the very warm and dry spring weather has created ideal conditions for wasp populations to flourish. While many people dislike the insects, ecologists emphasize their crucial role as apex predators and natural pest controllers in the ecosystem. To coexist peacefully, experts advise against swatting at wasps and suggest distracting them with a small amount of a sugary substance placed away from picnic areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new theatrical production in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy saga inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." Written by Helen Serafinowicz, a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the show is a comedic homage that avoids targeting the famous couple. Instead, it uses a myth about Coleen's lost engagement ring as the basis for a "medieval caper" with jokes and songs. The play is characteristic of Liverpool's Royal Court theatre, which focuses on original, locally-relevant comedies to entertain its audience.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's public health service is expanding its RSV vaccination program to include premature babies, who are particularly vulnerable to the respiratory virus. Starting this autumn, a long-acting injection, Nirsevimab, will be offered to eligible infants who were born too early to benefit from the maternal vaccine offered during pregnancy. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of hospitalization in a child's first year. Health officials stated the new program will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness and help reduce pressure on hospitals and emergency departments.</p>

          <p>A remarkable story from 2005 is being recounted, in which a 12-year-old girl in Ethiopia was rescued from kidnappers by a pride of lions. The girl had been abducted by seven men attempting to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to police, the lions chased the men away and then "stood guard" over the girl until she was found. A wildlife expert at the time suggested the girl's whimpering may have been mistaken for the sound of a lion cub, preventing the animals from attacking her. The incident is still remembered as a "miracle."</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between a gut bacteria byproduct and a genetic variant that may trigger the inflammatory flare-ups of ulcerative colitis. The study, published in Science Immunology, found that a molecule produced by certain bacteria can over-activate an immune pathway in individuals with a faulty version of a gene meant to regulate it. This unchecked immune response leads to chronic inflammation in the colon. The findings help explain the disease's unpredictability and could pave the way for more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway.</p>

A senior U.S. official confirmed that with this exchange, no American nationals are currently detained by the Maduro government. The complex deal highlights the warming relationship between the Trump and Bukele administrations, which facilitated the agreement.</p>

The trip, which aimed to stabilize relations with Beijing after a period of tension, underscores the delicate balancing act many countries in the region face as they manage their economic ties with China and security alliances with the U.S.</p>
