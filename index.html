          <p>A tragic bus crash in western Afghanistan has resulted in the deaths of over 50 people, most of whom were Afghans recently deported from Iran. The bus, en route to Kabul, collided with a motorcycle and then a fuel truck, causing it to burst into flames. The incident highlights the perilous journey faced by many Afghans returning from neighboring countries amid pressure from Tehran to leave. According to the UN, over 1.2 million Afghans have been forced to return from Iran and Pakistan this year.</p>

          <p>Following high-level meetings, Ukraine and its allies are exploring "security guarantees" to prevent future Russian aggression after a peace agreement. While full NATO membership remains unlikely, options being considered range from policing Ukraine's airspace from neighboring countries to securing the Black Sea for commercial shipping. A key challenge is creating a framework robust enough to deter Russia without being so provocative that Moscow rejects it entirely. The involvement and commitment of the United States are seen as crucial for any guarantee to be effective.</p>

          <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has updated its immunization schedule, recommending the Covid-19 vaccine for children as young as six months, a stance that conflicts with current CDC guidance. The CDC, under the Trump administration, now advises "shared clinical decision-making" for this age group after halting its previous universal recommendation. The AAP's move has drawn criticism from the Department of Health and Human Services, which accused the organization of political motives and potential corporate influence, escalating the public health debate over childhood vaccinations.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, is churning off the U.S. East Coast, generating warnings for dangerous rip currents and potential life-threatening flooding from Florida to New England. While the storm is not expected to make landfall, its large size is creating hazardous coastal conditions, leading to mandatory evacuations on North Carolina's Outer Banks. The Category 2 hurricane, with winds of 105mph, has already caused power outages in Puerto Rico. Officials are urging beach-goers to exercise extreme caution as the storm moves north.</p>

          <p>Boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. has been deported from the United States to Mexico, just weeks after his loss to Jake Paul. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed the deportation, stating he is wanted in Mexico on an outstanding warrant for alleged arms and drug trafficking, as well as ties to the Sinaloa Cartel. Chávez Jr. was arrested in the U.S. for overstaying his visa and has a history of legal issues, including a pending gun charge and past DUI conviction. His deportation follows a determination by DHS that he posed a public safety threat.</p>

          <p>Texas State Representative Nicole Collier, a Democrat, has filed a court petition alleging "illegal restraint" after being told she required a police escort to leave the Capitol building. Collier and other Democrats had recently returned to Texas after leaving the state to block a vote on a Republican-led redistricting plan, and were assigned escorts to ensure their presence at the next session. She refused the escort and spent the night on the House floor in protest, arguing that while lawmakers can be compelled to attend a session, they cannot be detained once present.</p>

          <p>Rangers faced a significant setback in their Champions League aspirations with a 3-1 home defeat against Club Brugge at Ibrox. The Belgian side capitalized on Rangers' defensive vulnerabilities, scoring three goals within the first 20 minutes of the match. Despite a second-half goal that provided a brief glimmer of hope, the performance exposed deep-seated defensive issues under manager Russell Martin. The result leaves Rangers with a formidable challenge to overcome in the second leg in Belgium next week to advance in the competition.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to issue an executive order to end mail-in voting, which he has repeatedly claimed is corrupt and beneficial to Democrats. However, legal experts assert that the president lacks the constitutional authority to dictate how states conduct their elections. The U.S. Constitution grants state legislatures the power to determine the "times, places and manner" of holding elections, with a secondary role for Congress, but no specified role for the executive branch. This move sets up a potential legal and political clash over election administration ahead of the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of a new, small moon orbiting the planet Uranus, provisionally named S/2025 U1. The satellite, which is only about six miles in diameter, was identified using data from the James Webb Space Telescope. This discovery brings the total number of known moons orbiting the ice giant to 29. Researchers believe its small size is why it eluded previous observations, including those by the Voyager 2 spacecraft nearly 40 years ago. The new moon will eventually be named after a character from the works of Shakespeare or Alexander Pope.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the recent White House summit on Ukraine suggests a significant division between President Trump's approach and that of European and Ukrainian leaders. Trump appears to view the peace process as a sequence of meetings—first with Putin, then Zelensky, then a trilateral summit—focusing on the procedural steps to "get it finished." In contrast, his counterparts are more concerned with the substantive details, such as the specifics of security guarantees and the conditions for a ceasefire. This focus on the deal itself, rather than its contents, mirrors Trump's past diplomatic efforts and may pose challenges in achieving a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Samuel Kangethe, a Kenyan national who has lived in the U.S. for 16 years, has chosen to self-deport rather than risk being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A father of three U.S. citizen children with no criminal record, Kangethe was left in legal limbo after a 2014 ruling on a previous marriage and a subsequent court case that was dropped from the docket. Fearing separation from his family in a detention center, he viewed returning to Kenya as his "safest option," highlighting the difficult choices faced by those navigating the complex U.S. immigration system.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock saw a 3% increase after the retailer maintained its full-year outlook, despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter expectations for earnings and revenue. The company still anticipates 2.8% growth in total sales for the year, signaling confidence in its performance amid ongoing economic uncertainty. Executives noted that while homeowners still show a "deferral mindset" for large projects, there were encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in transactions over $1,000. The results reflect a slow but steady home improvement market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A political ideology known as "abundance liberalism," which advocates for overcoming bureaucratic hurdles to build more housing, clean energy, and infrastructure, is gaining traction among Democratic elites as a new vision for the party. Popularized by journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, the philosophy aims to shift from a liberalism of regulation to one of tangible construction and growth. However, the article suggests that this vision faces significant political challenges, particularly in affluent suburban areas where existing residents may resist the large-scale development, like new housing, that the policy promotes.</p>

          <p>After recent summits with both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, President Trump's push for a peace deal in Ukraine faces considerable hurdles. While Trump has shown openness to U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine and is facilitating talks, it remains unclear if Putin genuinely seeks an end to the conflict while his forces are advancing. The president's reliance on personal diplomacy and his vacillating positions create uncertainty for European allies. Furthermore, any long-term U.S. commitment to Ukraine's security could face skepticism from Trump's own "America First" political base.</p>
