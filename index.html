          <p>Following a loss to the Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Nick Castellanos was seen confronting a fan at Citizens Bank Park. The incident occurred after the game's final out, which was made by second baseman Bryson Stott. According to a witness, Castellanos was defending his teammate from a fan who had "crossed multiple lines" with verbal abuse. As a leader in the clubhouse, Castellanos's actions highlight the tensions that can arise between players and spectators, especially during moments of on-field frustration for the NL East-leading team.</p>

          <p>Hugo Calderano, a Brazilian table tennis champion, will miss a major tournament in Las Vegas due to being denied entry into the United States. U.S. authorities informed Calderano that his previous travel to Cuba in 2023 for an Olympic qualifying event made him ineligible for the standard visa waiver program available to Portuguese passport holders like himself. Despite his efforts to secure an emergency visa, the timeline was too short, forcing him to withdraw from the WTT US Smash event. The incident raises questions about travel restrictions impacting international athletes ahead of major U.S.-hosted events like the 2028 Olympics.</p>

          <p>A volatile July market presented significant challenges for small trucking carriers, including fluctuating rates, tight capacity, and spiking diesel prices. Successful carriers were those who focused on local or regional lanes, strengthened relationships with brokers and shippers during downtime, and prioritized driver safety coaching to maintain good CSA scores. In contrast, carriers who struggled often reacted to market conditions by taking unprofitable loads, ignored safety, and failed to budget for fuel price swings. The analysis suggests that disciplined planning and a focus on operational efficiency are key to navigating the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

The passage describes his mixed feelings of nostalgia and disappointment as he witnessed the changes to the landscape and the decline of the steamboat era.

          <p>An analysis of the U.S. tax system highlights the disparity between how wealth growth and traditional income are taxed, explaining why billionaires often have a lower effective tax rate on their overall fortune. The "buy-borrow-die" strategy allows the ultra-wealthy to live off loans against their appreciating assets, deferring or avoiding taxes that wage earners pay immediately. Taxing billionaires' wealth growth at rates comparable to middle-class income could generate hundreds of billions in additional annual revenue for the government.

          <p>As rescue workers begin the grim task of recovering victims from the deadly Texas flash floods, questions are being raised about the role of federal budget cuts. At least 27 people, including nine children, have been confirmed dead, with dozens still missing after the Guadalupe River rose dramatically. Some critics are pointing to the Trump administration's budget and job cuts at the National Weather Service, suggesting they may have impaired forecasting ability after local officials blamed an inaccurate forecast for the lack of warning.

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing criticism for sending an email that claims a new bill signed by President Trump eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security for most beneficiaries. Critics, including former SSA officials, have labeled the communication as misleading and partisan, stating that the bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals and $12,000 for married seniors. This deduction also phases out for higher-income retirees. The framing of the benefit has been called a "lie" by a top House Democrat, who notes the unusual political nature of the agency's message.</p>

          <p>A focus group of voters who supported the Labour Party in the 2024 election has expressed a general sense of disappointment with the government's first year in power. Participants from Kent, who were part of a significant swing to Labour, cited a lack of progress on key promises, particularly on immigration, and a feeling of being "lied to." While some were sympathetic to the challenges of governing, many were concerned by the party's frequent policy U-turns, viewing them as a sign of weakness or a lack of clear direction. The sentiment reflects Labour's declining position in national polls and the growing appeal of Reform UK for some voters.</p>

          <p>Reform UK Member of Parliament James McMurdock has voluntarily given up the party whip following newspaper allegations regarding his use of the government's COVID-19 Bounce Back loan scheme. The Sunday Times raised questions about whether two companies linked to McMurdock, which received a total of £70,000 in loans, were eligible for the support. McMurdock has denied any wrongdoing but stated he requested the whip be suspended as a "precautionary measure" while Reform UK conducts an internal investigation. He will now sit as an independent MP, reducing Reform's number of sitting MPs to four.</p>

          <p>Recent threats by President Trump against political and business opponents, including Elon Musk and prospective New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, have raised concerns among democracy advocates. The article details how the president has suggested punitive actions such as deportation, loss of citizenship, and arrest for those who challenge his agenda or policies. This pattern of retribution is viewed by critics as an assault on constitutional norms and freedom of speech, designed to intimidate dissent. The analysis suggests that the threats themselves, regardless of their legal viability, erode the principle that citizens can criticize the government without fear of retaliation.</p>

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently shared on the "Call Her Daddy" podcast that she consciously chose to be a single mother, a decision supported by relationship experts. Theron explained that her choice stemmed from her experiences with a tumultuous family dynamic involving alcoholism and her own tendency to lose herself in relationships with narcissistic partners. By being honest with herself about her capabilities, she decided against having children with a partner. Experts praise her decision as a sign of strength and self-awareness, noting that for many women today, partnership is a preference rather than a necessity for stability or family-building.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported eight men with serious criminal convictions to South Sudan, a conflict-ridden country with which none of them have ties. The men, originally from countries in Asia and Latin America, were the subject of a prolonged legal battle that temporarily halted their removal and saw them held at a U.S. military base in Djibouti. Following a Supreme Court ruling that cleared the way for the deportation, the men were sent to South Sudan. Human rights advocates have condemned the move as punitive and unconstitutional, expressing fears the men could face torture or other harms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of tipping has become increasingly complex and confusing for consumers, a phenomenon some call "tipflation." Digital payment systems and point-of-sale devices now prompt for tips in a wider range of service environments, from coffee shops to self-service kiosks, often with pre-set percentages of 15% or higher. This expansion of tipping requests, which accelerated during the pandemic, leaves many customers feeling pressured or uncertain about when and how much to tip. The design of these systems often makes it socially awkward to decline, influencing consumer behavior and blurring traditional norms around gratuity.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. military actions against Iran could reinforce North Korea's belief that a nuclear arsenal is essential for its survival, according to security analysts. Experts suggest that Pyongyang may view the strikes as evidence of American unpredictability, further diminishing any remaining possibility of denuclearization talks. This perception could drive North Korea to enhance its nuclear capabilities, focusing on making its arsenal more mobile, dispersed, and resilient to a first strike. The development may also be a point of concern for China, as it complicates regional stability and diplomatic efforts on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
