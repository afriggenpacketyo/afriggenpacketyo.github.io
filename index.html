        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowner insurance premiums are projected to rise across all 50 U.S. states this year, averaging around 8%, with significantly higher increases in disaster-prone areas like California (21%) and Louisiana (28%). This surge is primarily attributed to the escalating severity of natural disasters, coupled with rising home values and increasing replacement costs. National insurers are balancing their overall risk portfolios, leading to widespread premium hikes despite individual state regulations. This trend is fundamentally reshaping the financial stability of homeownership, making it a less predictable long-term investment, especially in vulnerable regions. Experts anticipate these increases to persist as environmental challenges intensify, signaling a continued shift in the cost of living. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Punk duo Bob Vylan has been dropped from music festivals in Manchester and France following their controversial Glastonbury performance, where the lead singer led chants of "death, death to the IDF." This prompted widespread criticism, including from the Prime Minister, who labeled it "appalling hate speech." The band defended their actions, asserting they were "targeted for speaking up" and clarified their opposition was to a "violent military machine," not any specific group. The BBC, which livestreamed the performance, also faced significant backlash and subsequently apologized for broadcasting the "unacceptable" sentiments, with regulator Ofcom expressing concern.</p>

          <p>President Trump's major tax and spending bill faces a challenging vote in the U.S. House of Representatives after narrowly passing the Senate. The legislation, which includes substantial tax cuts and significant reductions to healthcare and nutrition programs, is meeting resistance from both Democrats and a faction of conservative Republicans concerned about its impact on the national deficit and Medicaid. House Speaker Mike Johnson has a slim margin for error, with potential defections and weather-related travel disruptions further complicating the vote ahead of a July 4 deadline. The bill's passage is crucial for the president's second-term agenda, but internal party divisions pose a significant threat to its timely enactment.</p>

          <p>Del Monte Foods, a nearly 140-year-old canned goods company, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as part of a restructuring agreement with its lenders.

CEO Greg Longstreet emphasized that a court-supervised sale is the most effective path for their turnaround.

          <p>Wisconsin's Supreme Court, backed by its liberal majority, has struck down the state's 176-year-old abortion ban in a 4-3 ruling. The court determined the ban was superseded by a more recent state law that permits abortions until fetal viability. This 1849 law, which criminalized intentionally destroying an unborn child's life, had been dormant since Roe v. Wade in 1973 and conservatives argued its activation after Roe's overturn in 2022. The decision, stemming from a lawsuit by the Democratic attorney general, significantly enhances certainty for abortion providers and patients, solidifying abortion access in Wisconsin.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced plans to lay off approximately 9,000 employees, impacting less than 4% of its global workforce across various teams, geographies, and experience levels. This significant reduction, unveiled at the start of Microsoft's 2026 fiscal year, continues a trend of previous job cuts in 2025 and 2023, including a major reduction of 18,000 in 2014 after acquiring Nokia's mobile business. The company attributes these organizational changes to the need for better market positioning and a reduction in management layers. Despite reporting robust net income, Microsoft is streamlining its operations amidst a broader trend of workforce adjustments within the tech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

Catherine highlighted that this recovery process is a "rollercoaster" and a "life-changing experience" for both patients and their families, often going unrecognized.

The decision reverses a previous Biden administration plan to move the headquarters to Maryland, which had drawn criticism from Maryland Democrats.

          <p>An Atlanta-area county has appointed Gail Lee, a staunch election denier with a history of challenging voter registrations, to its board of registration and elections. This pivotal position raises concerns among voting rights activists and the county's Democratic committee, who had campaigned against her nomination. Lee has repeatedly challenged hundreds of voter registrations since the 2020 election, stating her belief that Donald Trump won. Critics argue her appointment undermines public trust in elections and perpetuates lies, emphasizing her role in mass voter challenges against her neighbors. The chief judge rejected another similar nomination due to public opposition.</p>

          <p>Australia's immigration minister revealed that American rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, has had his entry visa revoked due to his pro-Nazi song "Heil Hitler" and a history of antisemitic remarks. The song, which praises Adolf Hitler and includes a sample from a 1935 speech, has been banned from various online platforms. The minister stated Australia does not need to "import hatred" and emphasized that the decision was based on Ye's public advocacy of Nazism. This action follows years of controversial antisemitic statements by Ye, including past social media suspensions and declarations like "I AM A NAZI."</p>

          <p>The U.S. private sector experienced an unexpected contraction in June, losing 33,000 jobs, according to payrolls processing firm ADP. This figure significantly missed economists' expectations for a 100,000 increase and marks the first monthly decrease since March 2023, potentially indicating a softening economy. The bulk of job losses occurred in service roles, particularly within professional/business services and health/education, while goods-producing sectors saw some growth. This report suggests a prevailing hesitancy among businesses to hire and replace departing workers, prompting analysts to potentially adjust their forecasts for the more heavily weighted government jobs report.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Constellation Brands, owner of Modelo, reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed analysts' estimates, primarily due to the impact of aluminum tariffs and softer consumer demand. President Trump's increased trade duties on aluminum and imported canned beer affected the company's profitability, leading to a 150 basis point drop in operating margin. The company's beer business, which accounts for 80% of its revenue, saw shipment volumes fall, partly attributed to Hispanic consumers buying less due to fears over Trump's immigration policy. Despite the miss, Constellation reiterated its fiscal 2026 forecast, expressing confidence in future financial targets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis criticizes President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," arguing it will hinder U.S. AI development despite some congressional members' growing awareness of AI risks. The bill's provisions, including cuts to safety net programs and new work requirements, are seen as ill-suited for potential automation-caused job displacement. Furthermore, its energy policies, by repealing wind and solar credits and increasing reliance on slower-to-build fossil fuels, could make electricity for energy-intensive AI data centers more expensive and slower to deploy. Critics argue this policy risks ceding AI leadership to countries like China and the UAE.</p>

The mayors argue these policies, implemented without adequate public comment, create barriers to affordable coverage and will overburden city services.

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a binding target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, building on its existing 2030 goal. This ambitious plan aims to decarbonize the European economy by 2050 while offering a "more pragmatic and flexible way" for member states to achieve targets. Notably, the proposal allows carbon credits from non-EU countries to count for up to 3% of the reduction from 2036, a shift from previous domestic-only counting. This move seeks to balance climate action with economic competitiveness, addressing concerns from member states about the impact on heavy industry amidst global competition.</p>
