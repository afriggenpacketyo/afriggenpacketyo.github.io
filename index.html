          <p>Overnight Russian strikes across Ukraine resulted in at least seven deaths and 41 injuries, targeting civilian and energy infrastructure. Kharkiv experienced a particularly severe attack with numerous drones, guided aerial bombs, and missiles hitting homes and civilian facilities. Other regions, including Kherson and Donetsk, also suffered casualties and damage. The Ukrainian Air Force reported neutralizing a significant number of the launched projectiles, but the attacks highlight the ongoing conflict and its impact on Ukrainian civilians. The strikes underscore the need for increased international pressure on Moscow and further support for Ukraine. Optimism score reflects the severity of the attacks and the ongoing threat to civilian lives.</p>

          <p>The Met Office issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across southern England and Wales, predicting potential disruption to transport and services. The warning, in effect until 6 PM BST, anticipates 10-15mm of rain within an hour, with some areas possibly receiving 30-40mm over several hours. The weather agency cautioned about frequent lightning, hail, and strong winds as additional hazards. The storms are expected to ease off in the west by mid-afternoon, but isolated thunderstorms may still occur elsewhere in the UK. The warning highlights the contrast with the dry spring and the challenges of predicting localized thunderstorm activity.</p>

          <p>WorldPride 2025 concludes in Washington, D.C., with a weekend parade, marking the first time the city has hosted the international LGBTQ+ festival since its inception in 2000. This year also commemorates the 50th anniversary of Pride events in D.C., traditionally one of the largest celebrations in the country. However, organizers note that the current political environment, including executive orders limiting the rights of trans people, has dampened the excitement. Despite some corporate sponsors withdrawing support, law enforcement is preparing for a large celebration, though the National Park Service's decision to close Dupont Circle Park has sparked controversy.</p>

          <p>Despite bipartisan support for fiscal responsibility, the US national debt continues to climb, with Trump's proposed bill threatening to add trillions more. Republican senators and figures like Elon Musk have criticized the spending plans. Moody’s recently downgraded the US credit rating, citing failures to address deficits and rising interest costs. The debt ceiling has repeatedly sparked legislative battles, raising concerns about the reliability of US debt. Economists warn of a potential crisis, but Trump's tax cuts could exacerbate the problem, highlighting the ongoing struggle to balance policy priorities with fiscal constraints.

          <p>Foot care experts recommend six exercises to alleviate sore, achy feet, focusing on strengthening and increasing blood flow. These exercises include foot doming to target the 'foot core,' wall stretches for plantar fasciitis relief, and toe spreads to improve flexibility and stability. Toe yoga can enhance balance, while calf raises strengthen stabilizing muscles and ligaments. The final exercise involves massaging the feet to relieve tension and promote gratitude. Regular foot exercises can reduce injury risk, alleviate pain, and improve overall foot health, but consulting a healthcare provider is advised for those with pre-existing foot conditions.</p>

          <p>A case in Georgia is testing the implications of the state's fetal 'personhood' law, as a pregnant woman declared brain dead is being kept on life support. The law, known as the LIFE Act, grants a fetus the same rights as a person, raising questions about medical decisions in such cases. While some officials argue the law doesn't restrict options in this scenario, others believe doctors acted appropriately in maintaining life support. The case highlights the broader implications of personhood laws, including potential impacts on fertility treatment and pregnancy complications, and underscores concerns about the law's effect on medical care in a state with high maternal mortality rates.</p>

          <p>A survey by an association of agricultural corporations reveals that over half of large-scale rice producers in Japan believe store prices for rice are "too high." This concern aligns with consumer complaints about doubled rice prices over the past year, leading more than 40% of producers to worry about consumers shunning the product. The government has started selling rice stockpiles to curb prices, but forging a consensus on an appropriate price level remains difficult. The survey also highlights producers' concerns about high farming costs and potential price drops due to overproduction.</p>

          <p>The UK government is struggling to cut foreign aid spent on asylum seeker hotel bills, with the Home Office planning to spend £2.2 billion of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year. This is only marginally less than the £2.3 billion spent in 2024/25, primarily covering accommodation costs for asylum seekers. Despite promises to end asylum hotels, the supply of dispersal accommodation has not kept pace with asylum applications. Critics argue that the Home Office lacks incentive to reduce ODA spending, leading to cuts in humanitarian and development priorities worldwide.</p>

          <p>Russia's Wagner Group announced its departure from Mali after assisting the Malian junta in reestablishing control over regional centers. Despite Wagner's exit, Russia will maintain a presence in Mali through the Africa Corps, a paramilitary force also controlled by Russia. The Africa Corps stated that Wagner's departure would not alter the Russian contingent's mission. The Africa Corps was formed with the Russian Defense Ministry's support after a failed mutiny led by Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin. It remains unclear how many mercenaries are part of Wagner and how many are part of the Africa Corps, but US officials estimate around 2,000 mercenaries are deployed in Mali.</p>

          <p>Iran has denounced the US travel ban on Iranians and citizens of 11 other countries, calling it a sign of a "racist mentality" and deep hostility towards the Iranian and Muslim people. The ban, set to take effect on June 9, targets nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The Iranian Foreign Ministry official stated the policy violates fundamental principles of international law and deprives millions of people of the right to travel based solely on their nationality or religion.
