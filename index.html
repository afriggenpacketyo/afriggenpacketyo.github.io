            <p>A new Universal theme park is set to be built in Bedfordshire, UK, marking the company's first venture in Europe. The project, confirmed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is slated to open in 2031 and is expected to create around 28,000 jobs. Universal estimates that the 476-acre complex will attract approximately 8.5 million visitors in its inaugural year, boosting the local economy and tourism. While residents have shown positive responses to the plans, concerns have been raised about the infrastructure's capacity to accommodate the anticipated influx of visitors, prompting discussions about upgrades to transportation links and local amenities.</p>

            <p>The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations agency, is holding critical talks in London this week to establish binding regulations aimed at phasing out fossil fuel use in global shipping. Central to the discussions is the potential implementation of a global emissions levy, which could mark the world's first-ever carbon tax on a specific industry. If successful, this ambitious pricing mechanism would significantly reduce the climate impact of international shipping, which accounts for roughly 3% of global carbon emissions. However, concerns over U.S. tariffs and reluctance from some members pose challenges to reaching a consensus on a robust carbon pricing system.</p>

            <p>President Trump's new tariffs on imports from various countries, including a staggering 104% on Chinese goods, have officially taken effect, signaling a dramatic escalation in the global trade war. The tariffs, implemented to revive America's manufacturing base, have already sent shockwaves through financial markets and raised concerns about a potential recession. While the White House suggests the tariffs are designed to open negotiations with trading partners, China has vowed to retaliate, setting the stage for a prolonged and economically disruptive conflict. The tariffs could also lead to higher inflation and increased prices for consumers.</p>

            <p>President Trump's sweeping tariffs are now in effect, significantly impacting Southeast Asian countries, particularly Vietnam and Cambodia, which face tariffs of 46% and 49%, respectively. This poses a major challenge to the region's export-driven economies, with exports to the US contributing significantly to their GDP. Vietnam, under leader To Lam, aimed for high growth rates by exporting more to the US, but these plans are now jeopardized. While Southeast Asian governments are seeking negotiations, the Trump administration appears unwilling to compromise, potentially leading to economic and political instability in the region.</p>

            <p>India's central bank has reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6% in an effort to stimulate slowing economic growth, marking the lowest level since September 2022. This decision coincides with the implementation of U.S. reciprocal tariffs, which impose a 26% levy on goods from India. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cited increased uncertainties and new headwinds for global growth and inflation due to rising tariffs. While inflation is softening, the rate cut aims to address concerns about India's economic slowdown, with GDP growth weaker than expected and projections indicating a further slowdown in the coming year.

            <p>Britain is navigating a challenging relationship with the US under President Trump, particularly due to the imposition of tariffs. The UK is seeking to maintain diplomatic ties while acknowledging the changing nature of the transatlantic partnership. With limited power to retaliate economically, Britain is focusing on negotiating with the US and exploring alliances with countries that share a commitment to democratic values. Concerns are growing about the potential impact of US policies on British national security and the need for a more diversified approach to foreign policy.</p>

            <p>The UK's online regulator, Ofcom, has initiated its first investigation under the Online Safety Act into a pro-suicide forum exposed by the BBC. The forum, linked to at least 50 deaths in the UK, provides information on suicide methods and access to toxic chemicals. Families of victims have welcomed the investigation, urging swift action to shut down the site and prevent further tragedies. The investigation will assess whether the site has systems in place to remove illegal material, with potential consequences including fines or court orders.</p>

            <p>Ecuador has become a major transit point for cocaine destined for Europe, with 70% of the world's cocaine flowing through its ports. The country's role in the drug trade has led to a surge in violence and corruption, as European gangs, particularly the Albanian mafia, exploit Ecuador's location and legal exports. Rising demand in Europe and economic factors have contributed to the crisis, with authorities struggling to control the flow of drugs. The situation highlights the need for international cooperation to combat drug trafficking and address the root causes of the problem.</p>

            <p>President Trump's new tariffs, implemented to address trade imbalances and protect American jobs, have sent shockwaves through global markets. The measures include a 10% baseline tariff on most foreign imports, with higher reciprocal tariffs on countries deemed "worst offenders." China faces the highest tariffs, with a cumulative rate of 104% on its goods. Canada and Mexico are exempt from the baseline rate, while sectors like steel and aluminum face additional levies. The tariffs have sparked concerns about economic damage and potential trade wars.</p>

            <p>Hopes for a US-China trade deal are fading as tensions escalate, with both sides taking increasingly hardline positions. The US has imposed tariffs exceeding 100% on Chinese exports, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. Analysts warn that the trade war could extend beyond goods to technology, investment, and geopolitics. With no clear path to a resolution, the focus is shifting to how China will bolster its economy and whether the US will ease its decoupling efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have achieved a breakthrough in using a quantum computer to fine-tune an artificial intelligence (AI) model with 1 billion parameters. Using Origin Wukong, a 72-qubit superconducting quantum computer, the team achieved an 8.4% improvement in training performance while reducing the number of parameters by 76%. This demonstrates the potential of quantum computing to enhance AI training, particularly for large language models. The improved AI model also showed better results on specific tasks, such as mental health conversation and math problem-solving.</p>

            <p>The tiny country of Liechtenstein is facing surprisingly high tariffs of 37% on its exports to the US, nearly double the rate imposed on its European neighbors. This has left the country puzzled, as its economy relies on exporting high-quality products such as power tools and dental fillings. Liechtensteiners are struggling to understand why they are being penalized for selling goods that Americans want to buy, and the tariffs are creating uncertainty for the country's stable business environment.</p>

The MMR vaccine is safe and highly effective, but declining vaccination rates are contributing to the outbreak. Experts emphasize the importance of vaccination to prevent measles and its complications, with a booster recommended for those vaccinated before 1968.</p>

            <p>Chinese commentators suggest that China may retaliate against US tariffs by targeting the services sector, where the US has a trade surplus. Possible measures include restricting US firms from government procurement and limiting cooperation with US law firms and consultancies. Other potential countermeasures include increasing tariffs on US soybeans, banning imports of US poultry and Hollywood films, suspending cooperation on fentanyl control, and investigating US companies in China for intellectual property issues. These actions reflect China's determination to respond to US trade pressure.</p>
