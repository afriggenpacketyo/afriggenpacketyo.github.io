          <p>A Russian woman named Irina Krynina moved to Ukraine with her daughters to support Russian prisoners of war after her own partner was captured. She founded "Our Way Out," an initiative that helps relatives contact captured soldiers, records interviews, and facilitates communication, providing proof of life that is often hard to obtain from Russian authorities. Despite her partner's cold reception and their eventual separation, Krynina continues her work, believing it aids in prisoner exchanges and shows Russians the reality of the war. Her project has gained significant traction but has also led to her being labeled a "foreign agent" by Russia.</p>

          <p>China has launched a global action plan for artificial intelligence, advocating for international cooperation and the creation of a global AI organization. This move comes just days after the U.S. announced its own AI strategy, highlighting the growing formation of two distinct geopolitical camps in technology. Premier Li Qiang emphasized China's "AI plus" plan to integrate the technology across industries and offer support to developing nations in the Global South. The development occurs amid ongoing U.S. restrictions on China's access to advanced semiconductors, though China is actively developing domestic alternatives.</p>

          <p>A major security operation is underway in South Ayrshire, Scotland, for Donald Trump's four-day private visit to his Turnberry golf resort. The visit includes meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney, alongside protests in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Roads have been closed and a large security perimeter established, with police raising concerns about the cost and staffing impact. The visit has also drawn attention to the Scottish government's recent decision to provide public funding for a golf tournament at another of Trump's courses.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise album "Swag" is being positioned as a potential "song of the summer," offering a soothing and melancholic alternative to typical upbeat pop anthems. The album, his first since parting with manager Scooter Braun, leans into R&B and hip-hop with a unique, muffled production style influenced by indie artists. The lead single "Daisies" exemplifies this with its gentle, whispery vocals and themes of stability over passion. This article suggests this downtempo yet complex sound resonates with a broader cultural malaise, as listeners gravitate towards more reserved and introspective music.</p>

          <p>The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) recently avoided a $400 million funding cut, providing a moment of relief for global health advocates. However, the program's long-term stability remains in question due to proposed future cuts and major disruptions to its services over the past year. Since its creation in 2003, PEPFAR has been credited with saving 26 million lives, but recent policy shifts have halted most HIV prevention work and support for AIDS orphans. Experts worry that without its expired congressional authorization being renewed, the program's effectiveness will be severely diminished, impacting the global fight against HIV/AIDS.</p>

          <p>Brazil is scaling up a novel public health initiative by releasing millions of mosquitoes modified with Wolbachia bacteria to combat the spread of dengue fever. This naturally occurring bacteria prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside the Aedes aegypti mosquito, rendering it unable to transmit the disease to humans. A pilot program in Niterói demonstrated remarkable success, reducing dengue cases by approximately 90% and also significantly lowering rates of chikungunya and Zika. The Brazilian government is now investing in a massive new factory to produce billions of these "Wolbitos" to protect millions of citizens.</p>

          <p>The UK government is working with Jordan to airdrop humanitarian aid into Gaza, a move Prime Minister Keir Starmer acknowledged has come "far too late." The decision follows Israel's agreement to allow such deliveries, though aid groups argue airdrops are insufficient and potentially dangerous. This action occurs as Starmer faces increasing pressure from over 220 MPs, including many from his own party, to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Critics of the airdrop plan insist that the only effective solution is for Israel to open all border crossings to prevent a man-made famine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Harvard conversation expert, Alison Wood Brooks, recommends taking just 30 seconds before any casual interaction to mentally prepare. This brief practice involves thinking about potential topics, questions, and conversational goals, which can make a person appear more prepared, considerate, and influential. According to Brooks' research, this forethought helps individuals stay present during the conversation, as the brain is less overwhelmed with the task of generating talking points in real-time. This strategy is part of a broader set of skills for effective communication, which includes focusing on the other person and encouraging them to elaborate.</p>

Despite Trump's history of surviving scandals, the author notes that this issue has generated significant disapproval even among his base. The piece outlines several potential outcomes, from the story fizzling out to a deal being struck with Ghislaine Maxwell for curated information, or the scandal significantly harming Republicans in upcoming elections. The author ultimately argues that beyond the political maneuvering, the focus should remain on the victims who were failed by the justice system for years.</p>

The result means the KMT and its allies will retain their majority bloc in the legislature, posing a continued challenge to President Lai Ching-te's ruling Democratic Progressive Party. The outcome is seen as a setback for the pro-independence camp and could intensify political polarization on the self-ruled island.</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has blacklisted the Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR) for alleged bid rigging and collusion. The institute, part of the prestigious Chinese Academy of Sciences, is now suspended from participating in all military procurement activities. This is the second time this year the institute has been placed on a suspension list. AIR conducts critical research in areas directly related to military needs, including remote sensing radar and electronic countermeasure systems, making the ban a significant penalty for the key defense-related organization.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's bold pronouncements about impending driverless cars and an expanding robotaxi service, Tesla investors are increasingly focused on the company's immediate financial challenges. Following a weak earnings report showing a 16% drop in automotive sales, the company's stock fell, reflecting concerns over thinning profits, rising competition, and a political backlash harming the brand. Analysts noted that while long-term projects like robotaxis are interesting, the company needs to show growth in the present. Musk's futuristic vision, which once buoyed the stock, appears to be losing its power to distract from current performance issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's extensive use of tariffs is facing a significant legal test, with a federal appeals court set to hear arguments challenging his authority. The lawsuit argues that Trump has exceeded the power granted by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the law he has used to justify major tariffs on numerous countries. A lower court previously struck down the tariffs, but the decision was paused pending this appeal. The outcome of this case, which is expected to reach the Supreme Court, could invalidate nearly all of Trump's major trade deals and tariff actions. (not investment advice)</p>

From a difficult childhood and a prison stint, he rose to fame as a founder of Black Sabbath, was fired for his excesses, and then launched an even more successful solo career. The article recalls his notorious acts and struggles with addiction before his reinvention as a beloved, bumbling TV dad on "The Osbournes."

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, conditions in the country have deteriorated, according to analysts. The junta, which initially cited insecurity and economic hardship as justification, has overseen job losses in the nonprofit sector and a crackdown on press freedom and civil society. Niger has aligned with military-led Mali and Burkina Faso, withdrawing from the regional ECOWAS bloc. With the coup leader recently sworn in for a five-year term, prospects for a return to civilian rule appear increasingly remote, leaving many citizens who once supported the takeover disillusioned.</p>

          <p>A significant number of people in Germany, especially the young, are reporting feelings of loneliness, a trend experts link to the COVID-19 pandemic and the influence of social media. Studies show that one in five teenagers feels lonely, which can impact school performance and make them more susceptible to authoritarian thinking and political extremism. Sociologists note that chronically lonely individuals often feel rejected and can develop resentment, posing a potential threat to democracy. While often associated with the elderly, recent research indicates that unemployment and poverty are major drivers of loneliness across all age groups.</p>

Patients have shared stories of frustration and fear that the delays could worsen their conditions or even be a "death sentence."

In the 1990s, Combs was a formidable ambassador of "Black cool," teaching a generation about ambition, style, and how to claim a place in previously unwelcoming spaces. The author recalls how Combs made hard work and success seem attainable, representing a new kind of unrestricted Black identity.

          <p>Increasingly intense summer heat, driven by climate change, is forcing many Americans indoors, leading to a phenomenon some are calling "summer depression." This condition shares symptoms with winter-pattern seasonal affective disorder (SAD), such as low energy and sadness, but is linked to heat and social isolation rather than a lack of sunlight. Experts suggest that avoiding the sun to stay cool in air-conditioned spaces may mimic the conditions that cause winter SAD. As heat waves become more frequent, concerns are growing about the long-term mental health impacts of choosing between enduring dangerous heat outdoors and sacrificing social interaction and sunshine indoors.</p>
