          <p>Australia is investing an initial AU$12 billion ($8 billion) over a decade to upgrade its Henderson shipyard near Perth. This significant investment is part of the AUKUS security pact with the UK and US, aiming to establish a maintenance hub for a future fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. The project will also develop facilities for army landing craft and navy frigates, supporting approximately 10,000 local jobs. This strategic move strengthens Australia's defense capabilities and the AUKUS alliance in the Indo-Pacific, with potential US access to the facilities.</p>

          <p>George Smith IV vanished from his honeymoon cruise in 2005, leaving his family on a decades-long quest for answers. Suspicion initially fell on his widow, then shifted to a group of young men last seen with him, whose alibis and polygraph results were questioned. Despite a prolonged FBI investigation, including discovery of a bloodstain and a provocative video made by the men, the case was officially closed in 2015 due to insufficient evidence. The family believes it was murder, not an accident, with motives potentially linked to robbery, and vows to continue seeking justice, especially after one of the men was later killed in an unrelated incident.</p>

The incident sparked widespread reactions, including the suspension and firing of airline and Office Depot employees for inappropriate social media comments. FBI officials revealed the alleged assassin, Tyler Robinson, lived with a transgender partner, adding complexity to the investigation. Political figures, including Lara Trump and Oregon coach Dan Lanning, offered varied responses, highlighting the divisive impact of the event.

The AfD, classified as "right-wing extremist," has recently gained national traction and seeks to expand its influence in western Germany. This election is a crucial gauge of the political landscape and public sentiment towards the current government and rising populist forces.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, the new President of the UN General Assembly, has proposed deploying UN peacekeeping forces to Ukraine to secure a potential ceasefire and post-war peace. This deployment would require support from the majority of UN member states and, critically, Moscow's approval, given Russia's veto power in the UN Security Council. Ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia remain stalled, with Russia demanding that Ukraine's NATO and EU ambitions be addressed. The suggestion comes as Ukrainian President Zelenskyy warns of Russia's intent to occupy all of Ukraine, emphasizing the distant prospect of such a peace mission.</p>

Crucially, safety Bishop Fitzgerald made two interceptions, including a fourth-quarter pick that sealed the win, preventing a late Purdue comeback.

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 682, a measure to phase out PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," from cookware, cleaning products, and other household items. The legislation, now awaiting Governor Newsom's signature, is a response to the health risks associated with PFAS exposure, including cancer and organ damage. While environmental groups and actor Mark Ruffalo advocate for the ban, the cookware industry and celebrity chefs like Rachael Ray argue that certain PFAS, like PTFE (Teflon), are safe when used correctly. The bill sets compliance deadlines, with cookware needing to be PFAS-free by 2030, and aims to prioritize public health over corporate profits.</p>

          <p>Sikh truck drivers in the US are experiencing increased harassment and fear blowback after a fatal Florida crash involving an Indian-born Sikh driver. The Department of Homeland Security alleged the driver entered the US illegally and obtained a CDL despite failing an English exam, leading to a pause in work visas for foreign commercial drivers. This incident has intensified scrutiny and harassment, with Sikh drivers reporting racial slurs and reluctance to travel to certain states due to ICE raids. Community efforts, like language classes, are underway, but concerns persist about the impact on the trucking industry and potential for violence against the Sikh community.</p>

          <h2>Experts Warn of Increased Debt Risk with Unlimited Contactless Card Spending</h2>

          <p>Academics warn that removing or significantly increasing the limit on contactless card payments could lead to a rise in spontaneous spending and debt. Currently, the need for a PIN on purchases over £100 acts as a "friction point" that prompts consumers to consider their spending. While the UK's financial regulator proposes allowing banks to set their own limits or remove them entirely, critics argue this convenience comes at a cost, especially for credit card users. Concerns also include security risks and the potential for "limitless economic abuse" by controlling partners, highlighting the need for personal choice in setting limits.</p>

          <p>German customs officers arrested two men and seized over 400 kilograms of cocaine at Hamburg port, a major entry point for drugs into Europe. Dock workers alerted authorities after noticing the suspects boarding and disembarking a ship with numerous sports bags. This incident highlights a "cocaine surge" in Germany, with the drug trade increasingly concentrated in Europe due to saturation in the North American market. Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever recently appealed for US support to combat international drug smuggling, underscoring the growing challenge posed by illicit drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's unprecedented second state visit to the UK is seen by some as a strategic move to secure a strong bilateral relationship, while others view it as a "vanity trip."

The visit, featuring extensive royal pageantry, aims to solidify ties early in his second term. However, it remains controversial, with planned protests and the backdrop of recent scandals and geopolitical turmoil.

          <p>Congressional Democrats are making health care a key demand in negotiations to avert a government shutdown, insisting on the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits and a reversal of Medicaid cuts. Senate and House Democratic leaders, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, refuse to support GOP-backed spending bills without these provisions, setting up a bitter policy clash. If the tax credits expire, average premiums could surge by 75%. Republicans, including President Trump, have dismissed these demands, accusing Democrats of seeking a shutdown.

          <p>Earl Richardson, former president of Morgan State University, has died at 81, leaving a legacy of fighting for equitable funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). He spearheaded a 15-year lawsuit that resulted in Maryland agreeing to provide $577 million in supplemental funding to four HBCUs, addressing historical underfunding. Richardson's leadership during student protests against dilapidated facilities in 1990 helped pave the way for this landmark case. His work highlighted systemic funding disparities faced by HBCUs nationwide and contributed to Morgan State's "Renaissance," significantly expanding its enrollment and campus infrastructure.</p>
