          <p>Actress Barbara Eden, celebrating the 60th anniversary of "I Dream of Jeannie," shared her perspective on her iconic role, stating she never considered herself a sex symbol despite public fascination with her costume. She viewed her character, a 2,000-year-old genie, as lovable, honest, and learning about the modern world, emphasizing the comedic aspects of her non-human nature. Eden also recounted the unexpected public and studio focus on her concealed belly button, which led to costume modifications. She fondly remembered her chemistry with co-star Larry Hagman and dismissed any rumored feud with "Bewitched" star Elizabeth Montgomery, expressing contentment with her career beyond the show.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, has publicly pledged that if elected, he would order the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should he travel to New York. Mamdani alleges Netanyahu is a war criminal responsible for genocide in Gaza and would honor an international criminal court arrest warrant issued in November 2024. Legal experts, however, indicate such an action would be practically impossible for a mayor and could lead to direct conflict with the federal government, which does not recognize the ICC's authority. This controversial stance reflects a growing, though potentially polarizing, shift in public sentiment in New York regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, as Mamdani leads in recent polls.</p>

Standing beside his empty podcast chair, she thanked first responders, the White House, and emphasized Kirk's profound love for his family, President Trump, and the United States. Mrs. Kirk vowed that her husband's voice and the Turning Point USA campus tour would persist, stating his death had ignited a powerful fire within her to amplify his message globally. Vice President JD Vance transported Kirk's casket, and President Trump announced a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom, highlighting the deep political resonance of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Turkish authorities arrested Hasan Mutlu, the mayor of an Istanbul district, along with dozens of city officials, on charges including extortion, bribery, and fraud, intensifying a crackdown on the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). Mutlu vehemently denied the allegations, calling them "political operations and baseless slander." This incident follows a series of arrests of CHP mayors and staff, including former Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, President Erdogan's main challenger, which previously sparked significant protests. The arrests highlight growing political tensions and concerns about the independence of Turkey's judiciary, especially ahead of a critical court decision regarding the CHP's 2023 party conference outcome.</p>

President Trump sought to fire Cook, alleging she simultaneously claimed two properties as primary residences, a move aimed at reshaping the central bank to orchestrate steep interest rate cuts. Cook, who also described the property as a "second home" for security clearance, successfully secured an injunction to block her firing, the first time a president has attempted to remove a Fed governor. The Justice Department has opened an investigation into these allegations, which could influence the Fed's upcoming interest rate decision.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer denied knowledge of an alleged scheme to circumvent the NBA's salary cap, which reportedly involved Kawhi Leonard and the now-bankrupt company Aspiration. The NBA has launched an investigation into accusations that $28 million was funneled to Leonard via a "no-show" endorsement deal with Aspiration, a company Ballmer partially funded. Ballmer stated he merely introduced the deal to Leonard but was unaware of the endorsement contract's specifics, claiming Aspiration's co-founder, who pleaded guilty to fraud, had "conned" him. Leonard's agent has also denied any wrongdoing, asserting the endorsement deal was legitimate.</p>

          <p>A Georgia judge dismissed Rico conspiracy charges against 61 defendants involved in protests against the controversial "Cop City" police training center, marking a significant setback for state prosecutors. The judge ruled that the attorney general lacked the authority to bring the case without special permission from the governor, which was not obtained. This decision, following years of delays and prosecutorial sloppiness, validates critics who argued the indictment was fundamentally flawed and an overreach to criminalize a protest movement. The state intends to appeal, but defense attorneys view this as "probably the highest-profile failure of using conspiracy charges to indict a protest movement" in US history.</p>

          <p>A dermatologist explains that while popular lip oils can offer shine and hydration, certain ingredients may cause hyperpigmentation or dermatitis, especially if they lack UV protection. The skin on lips is much thinner and more susceptible to sun damage, making broad-spectrum SPF crucial in lip oil products to prevent post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Irritants like plumping ingredients or common fragrances can also lead to adverse reactions. The article advises consumers to prioritize beneficial ingredients such as linoleic acids, squalane, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid, while strictly avoiding fragrances and oleic acids. Consulting a medical professional is recommended for persistent pain, swelling, or unusual darkening of the lips.</p>

Trump criticized NATO's commitment to winning the war and the "shocking" purchase of Russian oil by some members, which he argued weakens their negotiating position.

          <p>The article explores how the Trump administration's recent ICE raids in Los Angeles evoke painful memories of past US xenophobic immigration policies, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and the mass deportation of Mexican Americans during the Great Depression. Four Californians share their families' intergenerational trauma from these historical periods, including forced expulsions, detention, and the breaking up of families. They draw parallels between past cruelties and current actions, emphasizing the lasting harms of such policies. Despite the ongoing challenges, some express hope that increased public awareness and collective activism against hypervisible ICE actions can lead to change and strengthen democracy.</p>

          <p>The article explores the paradoxical state of the dictionary industry, where a "golden age" of linguistic awareness coexists with a crumbling business model. Despite increased accessibility and public interest in words, traditional dictionaries face declining page views due to Google's algorithms and AI-generated definitions. Major players like Random House and Webster's New World have receded, leaving Merriam-Webster and Dictionary.com as the main contenders. Dictionary.com recently laid off its full-time lexicographers after a sale, highlighting the financial challenges of maintaining high-quality lexical work. The article argues for the urgent need to save this fading business, emphasizing its critical role in chronicling and explaining language, especially in an era dominated by contentious words.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police has suspended eight officers and referred itself to the police watchdog following a BBC investigation into Charing Cross police station. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating 11 current or former officers and one staff member for alleged misconduct, including excessive force, discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and failure to report inappropriate behavior. This comes after a 2022 IOPC report found "disgraceful" behavior at the same station, including a homophobic, racist, and misogynistic WhatsApp group. Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist described the alleged behavior as "disgraceful" and pledged to dismantle the custody team and scrutinize leadership.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have intensified their bombardment of Gaza City with heavy air strikes, marking a significant escalation and forcing mass civilian displacement. The IDF estimates 250,000 residents have fled, urging more to evacuate south to a "humanitarian zone" near Khan Younis. This offensive, targeting what Israel calls Hamas's last major stronghold, has drawn widespread international criticism, with the UN warning of an "even deeper catastrophe" amid declared famine conditions. Residents report the targeting of schools and makeshift shelters, often with minimal warning, and many face significant financial barriers to flee, while Hamas urges them to remain, exacerbating the dire humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes Charlie Kirk's significant role in transforming US higher education into a cultural battleground, pioneering ideological warfare against perceived leftist biases. Despite not holding a college degree, Kirk, through Turning Point USA, galvanized conservative students, creating "professor watchlists" and promoting an anti-woke agenda that has influenced government policy. His aggressive, often provocative debate style, though criticized for lacking genuine discourse, proved highly effective in mobilizing young conservatives and expanding the culture war beyond campuses. His recent assassination risks further intensifying these grievances and the broader political divisions impacting academic institutions, posing a threat to the project of teaching and learning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary article highlights a concerning resurgence of discussions questioning women's right to vote in America, fueled by conservative influencers and powerful figures. It cites examples like Braeden Sorbo, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and tech billionaires Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, who have either explicitly or implicitly amplified ideas about limiting suffrage to men or household heads. The author argues that these views, once fringe, are now being propelled into the mainstream through digital media and influential endorsements. The article warns against dismissing these sentiments, suggesting they represent a serious threat to universal suffrage and democratic principles, echoing past efforts to chip away at fundamental rights.</p>

          <p>The article starkly contrasts two separate but nearly simultaneous gun violence incidents: the assassination of Charlie Kirk in Utah and a school shooting in Colorado, both occurring within a minute. These events underscore the pervasive nature of gun violence in America, prompting widespread shock and debate, yet notably lacking meaningful discussion on gun control reform. Experts like Adam Winkler suggest that public opinion on gun policy remains hardened, despite such tragedies. The piece highlights Kirk's own staunch pro-gun views, arguing that the benefits of the Second Amendment outweigh the costs of gun deaths, a sentiment echoed by the Trump administration's stance against stricter regulations.</p>

          <p>The article details Peter Mandelson's controversial appointment as British ambassador to the US and his efforts to charm Donald Trump's inner circle, leveraging old contacts and the new media right. Mandelson, a former Labour politician with a history of scandals and a past association with Jeffrey Epstein, was credited with smoothing US-UK trade deal negotiations, even receiving praise from Trump. However, new revelations from Epstein's emails, including a "cosy message" and a photograph, led to Mandelson's forced resignation just days before Trump's state visit. This incident has created a significant political mess for the UK government, highlighting risks associated with his diplomatic approach and his problematic past.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article analyzes how President Donald Trump's new import tariffs, announced in April, have led to increased consumer prices across various sectors, pushing overall inflation higher and further from the Federal Reserve's 2% target. CPI data reveals significant price jumps in tariff-sensitive categories like coffee, jewelry, bananas, televisions, and toys, with some categories experiencing unusual increases compared to historical norms. With Americans now facing an average tariff rate of 17.4%, the highest since 1935, households are estimated to incur an extra $2,300 in 2025. The piece explains how these tariffs, applied unevenly through supply chains, are being passed on to consumers, impacting everyday household spending. (not investment advice)</p>
