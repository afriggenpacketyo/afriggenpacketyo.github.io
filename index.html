          <p>Senate Republicans are largely aligning with President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict, trusting his judgment on potential U.S. involvement. However, the issue has divided Trump's MAGA base, with some advocating for non-intervention in line with campaign promises. While most Republicans agree that Iran should not possess nuclear weapons, Democrats urge de-escalation and congressional approval before any military action. The article highlights concerns about the lack of a clear Iran plan from the Trump administration, raising questions about the extent of Republican awareness.</p>

          <p>According to a source familiar with intelligence, President Trump is reportedly becoming more open to the idea of military strikes against Iran's Fordo nuclear facility. The source indicates that preparations are underway for potential multiple strikes, and Trump is gauging the reaction of his MAGA base through discussions with Vice President JD Vance. Security at U.S. Army bases is also being assessed due to potential retaliation from Iran. This consideration comes after the Israelis discovered that some Iranian air defenses remained intact, increasing concerns about the situation.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick is rapidly intensifying as it approaches the coast of southern Mexico, prompting hurricane warnings and watches. The storm is forecast to become a major hurricane, bringing potentially destructive winds and life-threatening flash floods to the region. Heavy rainfall is expected across several Mexican states, leading to possible mudslides and flooding. The storm surge is also expected to create coastal flooding and large waves. Erick is on track to impact areas previously devastated by Hurricane Otis in 2023.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the ongoing situation with Iran, stating he has not made a final decision on potential U.S. action but is considering various options. He reiterated his demand for Iran's "unconditional surrender," clarifying that it means he has "had it" with the regime's nuclear ambitions. Trump also pushed back against MAGA voices advocating for non-intervention, asserting that his supporters are still aligned with him.

          <p>The United States is implementing new visa rules requiring foreign students to unlock their social media profiles for review. US diplomats will assess applicants' online activity for indications of hostility toward the U.S. or support for terrorism and unlawful antisemitism. Those who fail to comply will be suspected of hiding information. This directive affects applicants for F, M, and J visas, which are for academic, vocational education, and cultural exchanges. The policy aims to enhance security screening, but critics are concerned about potential impacts on free expression.</p>

          <p>During a White House visit, President Trump engaged the Juventus football squad in an awkward discussion about transgender women in sports. Trump, who has signed an executive order banning transgender participants from women's sports, directly asked the players for their views on the subject. The players appeared uncomfortable and did not offer a response, while Juventus's general manager attempted to deflect the question. Trump's comments come amid increasing hostility towards trans people in the U.S.</p>
