          <p>A new report concludes that the UK's National Health Service failed to heed a mother's concerns before the death of her five-year-old son, Yusuf Nazir, in 2022. Yusuf died from a severe lung infection days after being sent home from a hospital emergency department. The investigation, led by former Royal College of Nursing head Peter Carter, found that a reliance on clinical metrics over caregiver insight led to a lack of shared decision-making and trust. The family is demanding a full inquest and accountability to ensure similar tragedies are prevented in the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas has resigned from his position following mounting pressure from investigations into his business dealings. The probe centers on several allegations, including a past conviction for abuse of position and recent claims that a company partly owned by him received a subsidized state loan. Paluckas, who denies wrongdoing, stepped down before potential impeachment proceedings could be initiated by opposition lawmakers. His resignation will likely lead to the entire cabinet stepping down, prompting coalition talks to form a new government.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's second withdrawal from UNESCO is a significant moral and strategic error that undermines America's global standing. The authors contend the move is part of a broader pattern of disengaging from international bodies and reflects a disregard for art, culture, and free expression. They draw parallels between targeting cultural institutions and the rise of authoritarianism, citing examples from Russia and the Taliban. The piece urges Congress to oppose the decision and calls for increased support for cultural and free expression advocates globally.</p>

The award-winning paper details a "native sparse attention" mechanism, a key innovation that enhances the efficiency of DeepSeek's AI models. The recognition highlights a trend of Chinese researchers increasingly outperforming their U.S. counterparts in the field of natural language processing. At this year's ACL conference, over half of the first-named authors on accepted papers were from China, a significant increase from the previous year.</p>

          <p>Data from the first five months of the second Trump administration reveals a 120% increase in arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) compared to the same period in 2024. A CBS News analysis shows that a majority of the over 109,000 arrests occurred in Southern and border states, with Texas, Florida, and California seeing the highest numbers. The statistics reflect the administration's reversal of previous policies, broadening the scope of arrests to include non-criminals as part of a promised mass deportation effort. Most individuals arrested were from Latin American or Caribbean countries, aligning with broader immigration trends.</p>

The report details workers kicking cows, hitting them with metal pipes, and dragging them with tractors, continuing a pattern of similar findings at farms in the Fairlife supply chain since 2019. Despite Fairlife's marketing, which has emphasized humane animal treatment, these repeated investigations raise serious questions about industry self-policing and corporate accountability. The brand's continued success highlights a potential disconnect between consumer demand for high-protein products and awareness of animal welfare issues.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments regarding President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on U.S. trading partners. A lower court had previously ruled the president lacked this authority, but the tariffs were temporarily reinstated pending the appeal. The case, brought by states and small businesses, challenges the administration's claim that trade deficits constitute a national emergency justifying the use of IEEPA. The outcome of this legal battle, which is likely to reach the Supreme Court, will be a significant test of a key component of the administration's economic agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida is scheduled to execute Edward Zakrzewski, a man convicted of killing his wife and two children in 1994, which would mark the state's ninth execution of 2025. This sets a new modern-era record for the highest number of executions in a single year in Florida, surpassing the previous high of eight in 2014. Zakrzewski's case has drawn attention from opponents who note his military service and the non-unanimous 7-5 jury recommendation for his death sentence, a verdict that would not be sufficient under current state law. Two more executions are already scheduled for August, placing Florida ahead of all other states in capital punishment this year.</p>

This intervention follows Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement that the UK would move toward recognition unless Israel meets certain conditions.

Aid groups like Caritas International warn that these reductions will be felt by vulnerable populations in the Global South and will force them to eliminate vital projects. The cuts mean Germany will fail to meet its international commitment to spend 0.7% of its gross national income on development assistance.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Sean "Diddy" Combs are requesting that he be acquitted or granted a new trial on the two prostitution-related charges he was convicted of earlier this month. While the jury cleared him of more serious racketeering and sex-trafficking charges, they found him guilty of transporting individuals for prostitution. His defense team argues in a new motion that the evidence for these convictions was "thin at best" and that he is the only person ever convicted for such conduct without a commercial motive. Combs has been in prison since his arrest in 2024 and is scheduled for sentencing in October.</p>

          <p>Energy giant Shell reported better-than-expected second-quarter adjusted earnings of $4.26 billion, surpassing analyst forecasts despite the impact of lower global oil and gas prices. The company also announced it will continue its shareholder return program with another $3.5 billion in share buybacks over the next three months. The strong performance comes after the company flagged weaker results in some divisions, but CEO Wael Sawan expressed pleasure with the results in a challenging macroeconomic environment. The company's strategic focus on value creation, discipline, and simplification appears to be resonating well with investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, a victim of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly called on President Donald Trump not to pardon Ghislaine Maxwell. In a statement, they described Maxwell as a "monster who deserves to rot in prison" and questioned Trump's recent remarks about Giuffre being "stolen" from his Mar-a-Lago club. The family clarified that Maxwell preyed upon Giuffre during her time working at the club and expressed shock that Trump was aware of the situation. Their plea comes as Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence, is being interviewed by justice department officials.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam encountered severe turbulence, forcing it to make an emergency landing in Minneapolis and resulting in 25 people being hospitalized. Flight tracking data showed the aircraft experienced a sudden, sharp change in altitude approximately 40 minutes into the flight. Emergency responders met the plane upon its safe landing to provide medical care to the injured passengers and crew. While serious injuries from turbulence are uncommon, scientists suggest such incidents may become more frequent due to climate change altering atmospheric conditions.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the crucial but unheralded role of American cyclist Matteo Jorgenson in the 2025 Tour de France. As a "domestique" for his team's leader, Jonas Vingegaard, his job was to challenge and exhaust the dominant Tadej Pogačar, sacrificing his own ambitions. Despite struggling with bronchitis and seeing his team's main strategy fail, Jorgenson continued to push, making selfless attacks. His persistent efforts ultimately paid off on the final stage, wearing down Pogačar enough to allow his teammate Wout van Aert to secure a prestigious stage win, a testament to the unseen triumphs of teamwork in cycling.</p>

The data center, located in northern Norway, aims to house 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2026 and will run entirely on renewable hydropower. This move aligns with Europe's push for "sovereign AI," which requires data and AI workloads to be processed on European soil, addressing the continent's need for more computing infrastructure.</p>

The "Piprahwa Gems," unearthed in 1898, were scheduled for auction but the sale was canceled after diplomatic intervention. The Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the relics, facilitating their return for permanent public display in India. The planned sale had sparked a significant ethical debate over whether sacred objects connected to human remains should be treated as commercial commodities.</p>
