          <p>A former Disney World employee, Michael Scheuer, received a three-year prison sentence for hacking into the park's menu system. Scheuer, a former menu production manager, altered allergy information, added profanities, and changed fonts after a contentious termination. Although none of the changes appeared on the printed or digital menus, the damages exceeded $150,000. Scheuer initially denied involvement, claiming Disney was trying to frame him, but later pleaded guilty to the charges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A head-on collision on the Tohoku Expressway in Nasushiobara, Japan, resulted in three fatalities and ten injuries. The accident occurred when a driver traveled in the wrong direction, colliding with another vehicle, leading to a subsequent pile-up.

          <p>Brian Fanion, a Massachusetts detective, is under scrutiny after his wife, Amy, was found dead with a gunshot wound, and his web searches revealed inquiries about poisons and gunshot residue. The lack of gunshot residue on Amy's wound raised suspicions, leading investigators to examine Fanion's computer. Searches included 'household poisons,' 'how to make a murder look like a suicide,' and 'gsr testing,' which prosecutors argued were inconsistent with his duties. Fanion's trial began, focusing on his relationship with another woman and the circumstances surrounding Amy's death.</p>
