          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was detained by ICE in March but has returned to Massachusetts after a judge ordered her release. Ozturk expressed gratitude for the support she received during her detention, mentioning the letters and books read to her by her labmates. Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley welcomed her home, emphasizing the importance of due process and free speech. Ozturk's lawyers argued that her First Amendment rights were violated when she was detained for co-authoring an op-ed about Israel's war with Hamas in the Tufts student newspaper, which the Trump administration cited as the reason for revoking her student visa.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks with Ukraine to begin on May 15 in Istanbul, aiming to address the root causes of the conflict and move towards a lasting peace. This proposal comes after European leaders urged Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. Putin stated that new ceasefires or truces could be agreed upon during these talks and plans to discuss details with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Kyiv has not yet commented on Putin's proposal, which follows a visit by European leaders to Ukraine advocating for a month-long ceasefire starting Monday.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating tensions between India and Pakistan following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, the Trump administration grew concerned about the potential for the conflict to spiral out of control. Dogfights between the Pakistani and Indian Air Forces and drone incursions heightened fears, particularly after explosions hit the Nur Khan air base near Pakistan's nuclear command. The U.S. intervened through direct calls from Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and General Syed Asim Munir, respectively. President Trump announced that the two countries had agreed to a cease-fire, with Pakistan acknowledging U.S. efforts while India remained silent on the matter.</p>

          <p>Livestock farmer David Thornley is planning legal action against East Midlands Airport, alleging that a leaking pipe polluted a brook running through his rented land, leading to the loss of valuable pedigree lambs. Thornley claims 25 of his ewes lost their lambs after drinking from Diseworth Brook in 2022, which he believes was contaminated with sewage fungus due to airport de-icing chemicals. While the airport pleaded guilty to charges of exceeding environmental permit limits, it denies any connection between its discharges and the bacterial pollution in the brook. Environmental studies suggest that de-icing chemicals can affect water quality, promoting the growth of undesirable river biofilms.</p>

          <p>Bournemouth midfielder Alex Scott suffered a fractured jaw after being struck by an elbow from Aston Villa's Tyrone Mings during a Premier League match. The incident occurred in the sixth minute, and although Scott received treatment, he was eventually substituted at halftime. Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola expressed dismay that Mings did not receive a caution for what he described as a "very violent" elbow. Aston Villa were later reduced to 10 men, but the injury casts doubt on Scott's ability to finish the season.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to stop considering the economic damage caused by climate change when developing policies and regulations, except where “plainly required” by law.

While Trump urges rate cuts, Powell expresses confidence in the economy but faces pressure from survey data indicating heightened worries in manufacturing and consumer sectors.
