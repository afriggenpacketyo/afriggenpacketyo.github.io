          <h2>Jim Cramer Counters Morgan Stanley's Cautious Stance on CrowdStrike Stock</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Morgan Stanley's downgrade of CrowdStrike from "overweight" to "equal weight," CNBC's Jim Cramer voiced his disagreement, suggesting the subsequent dip is a buying opportunity. Morgan Stanley analysts cited the stock's high valuation after a 50% rise since April, indicating that near-term growth appears fully priced in. Cramer, however, remains confident in the cybersecurity firm's long-term potential, particularly anticipating a strong second half as customer package deals from a past IT glitch expire. The discussion highlights the debate between valuation concerns and growth potential for the leading tech company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On Bastille Day, British cyclist Simon Yates secured a victory in stage 10 of the Tour de France after a strategic attack on the final climb. The stage, a grueling 165.3km route through the Massif Central, saw a large breakaway group get significantly reduced. Meanwhile, Ben Healy made history by becoming the first Irish rider in 38 years to wear the coveted yellow jersey, placing him at the top of the general classification. Healy now leads defending champion Tadej Pogacar by 29 seconds as the tour heads into a rest day before resuming.</p>

          <p>Thirty-five years after the Americans with Disabilities Act, some prospective parents with disabilities still face outright rejection from adoption agencies. The article highlights the story of Kelly and Larry Peterson, a couple with spina bifida who were initially denied by an agency citing their disability as a disqualifying condition. They eventually found an agency that helped them adopt a young girl, Hadley, who also has spina bifida, demonstrating how their shared experience makes them uniquely qualified caregivers. The family's journey underscores the ongoing challenges and prejudices within the adoption system, while also celebrating their successful and loving family formation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated pressure on Moscow, threatening to impose 100% secondary sanctions on countries buying Russian exports if a peace deal for Ukraine is not reached within 50 days. This move, which would target major trade partners like China and India, could have a far more severe impact on Russia's economy than previous measures. The threat comes as Russia's wartime economy shows signs of slowing, with high interest rates and fading momentum from its initial GDP surge.

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett proposed a novel theory for why President Trump's tariffs have not yet caused significant price inflation, attributing it to a rise in "patriotism" among American consumers. He argued that Trump's leadership has encouraged people to buy American-made products, causing demand for imports to fall so sharply that it has offset any price increases from tariffs. This explanation was met with skepticism from other economists, who point to factors like importers stockpiling goods and suggest that the White House's data methodology may understate the true effects of the tariffs on consumer prices.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The passing of former Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has prompted reflections on his complex and controversial legacy. He is remembered by some for his anti-corruption stance and belief in Nigeria, while critics point to his autocratic tendencies, disregard for the rule of law, and flawed economic policies. His tenure saw Nigeria's first recession in a generation and a violent crackdown on the #EndSARS protests against police brutality. Having served as both a military ruler in the 1980s and a two-term civilian president, Buhari leaves behind a legacy described as being filled with both "praise and pain."</p>

          <p>The recent Club World Cup in the United States has served as a dress rehearsal for the 2026 World Cup, highlighting significant logistical challenges. Issues included record-breaking heat and humidity that affected players and led to multiple game delays due to lightning. Attendances were mixed, with some games sparsely attended due to high ticket prices and weekday afternoon kick-offs. Furthermore, transportation to some stadiums proved difficult, and the quality of the temporary grass pitches drew complaints. These experiences offer crucial lessons for FIFA organizers to address before the larger, 48-team tournament begins in two years.</p>

          <p>A new study has ranked the best states for quality of life, a crucial factor for businesses looking to attract talent in a competitive labor market. Vermont claimed the top spot for the fifth consecutive year, praised for its low crime rate, clean air, inclusive laws, and strong reproductive rights protections. The ranking methodology considers various factors including crime, air quality, child care availability, and legal protections for workers and against discrimination. Other top states include Maine, New Jersey, and Minnesota, while some states known for natural beauty, like Hawaii, ranked lower due to issues like the high cost and scarcity of child care.</p>

          <p>An Australian man has been charged with "malicious mischief" after allegedly smashing the glass case housing the Stone of Destiny at the Perth Museum in Scotland. The 335-pound sandstone block is an ancient and powerful symbol of Scottish nationhood, used for centuries in the coronations of Scottish and later British monarchs. The stone was famously returned to Scotland in 1996 after being held in London for 700 years. Officials confirmed that despite the damage to its protective case, the historic stone itself was not harmed during the incident on Saturday.</p>

Investors are optimistic as the U.S. House begins "Crypto Week," deliberating on bills aimed at creating a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry.

It shares the stories of individuals who spent thousands of dollars on courses from charismatic online gurus, only to end up in debt and feeling more lost. These coaches often lack formal credentials and can blur the lines into giving unqualified medical or mental health advice.

The move is part of a broader cabinet renewal aimed at strengthening Ukraine's government as the war with Russia continues. Svyrydenko, 39, has risen quickly through government ranks and played a prominent role in securing a key mineral deal with the United States. Her candidacy must be approved by Ukraine's parliament, and if confirmed, she would replace the incumbent Denys Shmyhal and become the nation's second female prime minister.</p>

          <p>Constance Marten, a British aristocrat, and her partner, Mark Gordon, have been found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence in the death of their newborn baby, Victoria. The couple went on a high-profile run from authorities in early 2023 to prevent their fifth child from being taken into care, living in a tent in freezing conditions. The baby's decomposed body was later found in a shopping bag in Brighton. The prosecution successfully argued that the couple's selfish and reckless actions, including failing to provide basic warmth and care, directly led to the infant's death from hypothermia or smothering.</p>

The author critiques the current state of consumer AI, noting that features like Apple Intelligence fail at basic tasks like searching personal files or photos, a goal Apple conceptualized as far back as 1987. The article argues that while generative AI excels at synthesizing public internet data, it has failed to solve the fundamental problem of helping users manage their own digital lives.

More significantly, the Lionesses are now on the opposite side of the bracket from World Cup winners and tournament favorites, Spain, whom they cannot meet until a potential final. While Sweden presents a tough challenge, avoiding both Germany and Spain in the path to the final is seen by many analysts as a preferable outcome.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a resident has died from pneumonic plague, a rare and severe lung infection. This is the first such death in the county since 2007. Pneumonic plague is caused by the same bacterium as bubonic plague but can be spread through airborne droplets, making it more contagious. While officials state the death is unrelated to a recent die-off of prairie dogs in the area, they have issued public health warnings advising caution around wild or dead animals. The CDC reports about seven human plague cases annually in the U.S., mostly in rural western areas.</p>
