        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have been deployed to the Los Angeles area to assist the National Guard in managing protests related to federal immigration enforcement, prompting California Governor Gavin Newsom to file a lawsuit seeking to block the deployment. The state's filing argues that the presence of soldiers on the streets is causing irreparable damage to the city and its residents, while emphasizing that the state is not attempting to prevent the forces from protecting federal property or personnel. The Marines, trained in de-escalation and crowd control, are awaiting specific instructions at a staging area. The LAPD chief expressed concerns about the logistical challenges posed by the arrival of federal military forces and the need for clear communication between agencies. Optimism regarding a peaceful resolution is somewhat tempered by the escalating tensions. </p>

Conservatives have praised Fetterman for his stance, viewing him as a voice of reason within the Democratic Party. This is not the first time Fetterman has broken ranks with his party, as he has also denounced anti-Israel protests and praised some of Trump's Middle East policies. </p>

Moran's post focused on Miller, characterizing him as richly endowed with the capacity for hatred, while describing Trump's hatred as a means to self-glorification. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he will restore the original Confederate names of several Army bases, undoing a renaming process ordered by Congress and completed under President Biden. However, the bases will now recognize other service members with similar names, rather than the original Confederate figures. For example, Fort Gordon will now honor Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon, while Fort Lee will honor Pvt. Fitz Lee. This decision reverses the work of the Naming Commission, which was created by Congress to remove Confederate symbols, and reflects Trump's desire to maintain historical connections to the bases. </p>

          <p>Tesla's stock has rebounded following a dip caused by a feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, fueled by renewed optimism about the company's robotaxi program. Musk shared a video on X showcasing Tesla's driverless vehicles being tested in Austin, Texas, without a human safety supervisor. Tesla is expected to launch a pilot program for its driverless ride-hailing service in Austin, utilizing the Model Y with an unsupervised version of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. The company will initially geofence the service and remotely monitor the fleet. </p>

          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, for "repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities" in the occupied West Bank. The sanctions include a ban from entering the UK and a freeze on any assets held in the UK. The move is part of a joint effort by the UK, Norway, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.
