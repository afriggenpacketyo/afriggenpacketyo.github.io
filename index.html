          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, with a 39.1% year-over-year increase that surpassed market expectations. This surge is primarily attributed to the high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips, which are produced for major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company's high-performance computing division constituted 57% of its revenue, with advanced chips of 7-nanometer or smaller sizes accounting for 74% of total wafer sales. This financial success highlights the ongoing boom in the AI sector and TSMC's critical role within the global technology supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy grew by a slight 0.1% in August, according to the Office for National Statistics, following a 0.1% contraction in the previous month. This marginal expansion comes as the government faces increasing pressure to stimulate economic growth ahead of the upcoming Budget. Economists and institutions like the Institute for Fiscal Studies have warned that tax increases or spending cuts may be necessary to meet borrowing rules. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has acknowledged that she is considering further fiscal measures to ensure the stability of public finances.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will halt its purchases of Russian oil, although a specific timeline for this action remains unclear. The move is part of Washington's effort to economically pressure Moscow over its war in Ukraine, with Trump stating he now needs to convince China to do the same. India's external affairs ministry has maintained that its import decisions are guided by consumer interests and energy price stability. This development highlights the ongoing diplomatic pressure the U.S. is applying to major buyers of Russian crude to limit Moscow's war-funding capabilities.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are poised for a negative start on Thursday, continuing a week of fluctuating trade as major indices in the U.K., Germany, and France are all projected to open lower. This follows a mixed performance where markets hit a two-week low on Tuesday before rebounding on Wednesday, partly driven by gains in luxury brands. Investors are keeping a close watch on corporate earnings from several major banks and companies, as well as forthcoming U.K. GDP data. The market volatility reflects broader economic uncertainties, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and trade tensions with China. (not investment advice)</p>

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the action as a U.S.-led effort at regime change, referencing past CIA interventions in Latin America.

          <p>The UK government is facing scrutiny after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped espionage charges against two men, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who were accused of spying for China. The Director of Public Prosecutions stated the case collapsed because the government failed to provide evidence officially labeling China a "national security threat" at the time of the alleged offenses, a new legal precedent. This has sparked a political dispute, with the Conservative opposition accusing the Labour government of undermining the case to maintain economic ties with Beijing.

          <p>President Donald Trump hosted a dinner for dozens of corporate executives and business leaders to raise funds for a new, privately financed ballroom at the White House. The guest list included representatives from major tech firms like Amazon, Apple, and Google, as well as leaders from the tobacco, telecom, and cryptocurrency industries. Trump announced that the $200 million cost for the 90,000-square-foot expansion has been "fully taken care of" by generous private donors. The fundraising effort has drawn criticism from some Democrats who question the motivations behind such large corporate donations for a project that will offer donors permanent recognition.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani is actively working to break out of a significant postseason slump, taking the rare step of participating in on-field batting practice ahead of the next NLCS game. Ohtani has struggled at the plate, going just two-for-25 with 12 strikeouts since the start of the playoffs. Manager Dave Roberts has emphasized the team's need for Ohtani's bat to succeed, while Ohtani himself has downplayed the idea that his return to pitching this season has negatively impacted his hitting. His visible efforts to recalibrate his swing signal an urgency to return to form for the crucial upcoming games against the Brewers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by two major unions after more than 4,000 workers received reduction-in-force notifications. The judge called the administration's actions "unprecedented" and cited President Trump's own social media posts suggesting the layoffs were intended to punish political opponents by targeting "Democrat Agencies." This legal intervention halts, for now, the administration's plan to use the shutdown to make what the White House budget director suggested could be over 10,000 job cuts.</p>

The award ceremony, which is being held in Newcastle for the first time, recognizes the best album from the United Kingdom and Ireland. CMAT is favored for her album "Euro-Country," while Pulp is nominated for their comeback record "More." Other notable nominees include Fontaines DC, PinkPantheress, and 84-year-old folk legend Martin Carthy, the oldest nominee in the prize's history. The event's move from London is part of a broader industry effort to decentralize and recognize talent across the entire country.</p>

          <p>A long-lost diary written by Chinese naval officer Lam Ping-yu has shed new light on the role of Chinese forces in the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944. The diary, rescued from a Hong Kong building slated for demolition, provides a detailed firsthand account of the landings from aboard the British battleship HMS Ramillies. Lam was one of over two dozen Chinese officers sent to train and serve with Allied forces in Europe. Historical researchers have since confirmed that at least 14 Chinese officers participated in the naval component of the invasion, adding a previously little-known international dimension to the historic operation.</p>

          <p>Lawyers representing 150 victims of the Jesus Army cult have condemned a plan that would allow former members, including some accused of child abuse, to receive a share of the group's estimated £50 million fortune. A BBC investigation found that 172 former loyal members are set to receive significantly larger payouts than the compensation awarded to victims through a redress scheme. While the trust managing the cult's assets stated it cannot disclose beneficiaries' identities to protect victim privacy, survivors have called the prospect of alleged abusers benefiting "sickening." Victims' advocates argue the remaining assets should be redirected for charitable use rather than distributed to former members.</p>

          <p>A scientist who was recently laid off from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that the Trump administration's workforce reductions during the government shutdown will lead to "more preventable deaths." The anonymous scientist, one of approximately 600 CDC employees terminated, described the situation as chaotic, with entire legally mandated programs being eliminated. The layoffs are part of a broader plan that the White House budget director suggested could exceed 10,000 federal jobs. The firings have significantly hampered the CDC's ability to respond to public health threats, such as ongoing measles outbreaks, at a time when its capacity is critical.</p>

His comments contrast with bipartisan calls for the resignation of those involved, including from the national Young Republican organization itself.

The project is reportedly being funded by private donors, with Trump suggesting that leftover funds from his White House ballroom project could be used.

An analysis of court data revealed that over 2.7 million people, or one in four summoned, did not show up last year, and about 21% of counties admit to not sanctioning no-shows at all. Legal experts worry this trend undermines the right to a fair trial by a jury of one's peers.
