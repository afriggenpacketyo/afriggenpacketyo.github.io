          <p>An adolescent loggerhead sea turtle named Dilly Dally was released back into the Atlantic Ocean after undergoing rehabilitation at a Florida turtle hospital. Dilly Dally had its front flipper amputated due to predator wounds sustained in January. The veterinary crew at Loggerhead Marinelife Center assisted in the turtle's recovery, and a crowd of beachgoers cheered as Dilly Dally made its way back to the water. A satellite tracking device was attached to the turtle's shell, allowing the center and the public to monitor its journey and gather data on the migration patterns of three-flippered turtles, aiding in future patient care and species conservation.</p>

Additionally, partial restrictions apply to travelers from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.

          <p>DiJonai Carrington, a player for the Dallas Wings, addressed criticism that she plays "dirty" in a social media post after being assessed a flagrant-1 foul during a game against the Seattle Storm. The foul occurred when Carrington made contact with Skylar Diggins' head while attempting to block a shot, resulting in Diggins crashing to the ground. This incident follows another recent event where Carrington screamed in the face of a referee, leading to security being called, which Carrington suggested was a "microaggression." Carrington has previously been involved in conflicts with Caitlin Clark and has also prompted criticism for her political expressions, including wearing a shirt with an anti-Trump message.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation prohibiting foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University, citing concerns that the institution is no longer a trustworthy steward of international students. Trump invoked the Immigration and Nationality Act, arguing that Harvard has refused to provide information about international students, has extensive entanglements with foreign countries, and has discriminated in their admissions practices. The proclamation also directed the secretary of state to consider revoking the visas of foreign students already in the U.S. to study at Harvard, representing an escalation of the White House’s fight with the university.</p>

The White House cites reasons such as lack of competent authorities, terrorist threats, and high visa overstay rates. Dual nationals and athletes participating in major sporting events are exempt, and the ban is likely to face legal challenges, echoing a similar order from Trump's first term that was later upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A popular Mexican band, Los Tucanes de Tijuana, was fined over $36,000 for performing songs glorifying drug cartels during a concert in Chihuahua. Nearly a third of their songs were "narcocorridos," which authorities said glorified crime or alluded to perpetrators of illegal acts. Several states in Mexico have imposed restrictions on this controversial subgenre of regional music, which is growing rapidly. The United States recently revoked the visas of another band for showing images of a wanted drug lord, highlighting the consequences for artists who extol criminals.</p>

The system, already used for payments at Whole Foods and other venues, is now being implemented at NYU Langone Health locations for patient check-in. While Amazon claims that Amazon One profiles are separate from Amazon.com profiles and palm data is not shared with advertisers, privacy advocates warn that the vast amount of data Amazon collects across its various businesses could lead to sensitive health information being inferred.

          <p>Tommy Robinson, a political activist, pleaded not guilty to two charges of harassing two Daily Mail journalists. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with harassment causing fear of violence towards the reporters in August. He was released on bail and is scheduled to appear at Southwark Crown Court for a further hearing in July. Additionally, Robinson is facing a trial in October 2026 over an accusation that he failed to provide the PIN for his mobile phone when stopped by Kent Police in July 2024.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's parliament voted to suspend three Māori MPs for performing a protest haka during a parliamentary session last year. Opposition MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke was suspended for seven days, while her party's co-leaders Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer were banned for 21 days. The MPs performed the haka in response to a bill redefining the country's founding treaty with Māori people, which drew nationwide outrage. Ngarewa-Packer stated they were "punished for being Māori" and prioritizing their people's needs, while a parliamentary committee ruled the haka could have "intimidated" other lawmakers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched an unprecedented crusade against legal immigrants, implementing lawless and cruel tactics. Actions include banning refugee resettlement, revoking temporary protected status, eliminating legal status for international students, arresting asylum seekers at check-ins, and canceling the CBP One app program retroactively. This contrasts with previous administrations that also regulated undocumented immigration but expanded legal immigration pathways. The administration's policies aim to deter immigration through cruelty, sending a clear message to immigrants: leave, or never come in the first place, even if you do it "the right way."</p>

          <p>A writer explores the world of personalized perfume styling by hiring Anna Dorn, a perfume stylist who offers scent fittings over text message. The process involves describing desired scents using evocative phrases and adjectives, rather than simply listing notes, leading to a selection of niche fragrances. This journey highlights the growing interest in scent as a nuanced form of self-expression, akin to storytelling and world-building. Rather than finding a signature scent, the experience becomes about developing the confidence to articulate the right scent for the right occasion, celebrating the multitudes we contain.</p>

          <p>As Elon Musk shifts his focus back to Tesla after a stint in Washington, the company faces several challenges, including rebuilding its reputation, delivering on autonomous driving technology, keeping up with competition, and completing a charging network. Musk's association with the Trump administration alienated customers, and the company's brand sustained damage. To remain viable, Tesla will have to reassess aspects of its business model, such as launching an affordable model and navigating the potential loss of a federal electric vehicle credit. The future of the company depends on whether he can follow through on autonomous driving technology, with the industry needing significant progress on the network of charging stations.</p>

          <p>A lethal algae bloom in Southern California has ended, but marine mammals still face risks, and scientists are investigating whether fire runoff contributed to its intensity. The bloom, one of the worst in recent history, killed hundreds of dolphins and sea lions, with researchers noting that it was particularly deadly for breeding females. Though the bloom is over, the work of rehabilitating rescued animals continues, and further outbreaks are still possible this year. Researchers are also grappling with the long-term environmental impact of recurring blooms during breeding season, at a time when research budgets are being cut.</p>

Other bills being considered would protect homeowners from price gouging, streamline the claims process, and offer financial protections for disaster victims. Most of the legislation aims to prevent and prepare for future fires, easing the permit process for rebuilding and extending provisions set by the governor during the state of emergency.</p>

Advocates fear this arrangement exploits a loophole, violating the spirit of sanctuary laws, and are urging the city to terminate the contract.

A comprehensive review suggests that populist narratives blaming this trade for U.S. economic decline are not supported by rigorous evidence. The steady decline in U.S. manufacturing employment began decades before China’s WTO entry, mainly due to technological advances and shifting consumer demand. The real shock America faces in 2025 is not from Chinese imports, but from a resurgence of misguided protectionism based on a misdiagnosed problem, with the path forward harnessing trade's real benefits rather than chasing economic illusions.
