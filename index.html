        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has been excluded from President Trump's executive order that doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%. The UK will maintain a 25% levy, conditional on compliance with the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (EPD) from May 8th, though this could increase if the UK does not comply with the EPD terms by July 9th. A UK government spokesperson affirmed commitment to safeguarding British businesses and jobs in key sectors, including steel, as part of their plan for change. This move highlights ongoing trade negotiations and economic relationships between the US and UK, emphasizing the importance of adhering to agreed-upon terms to maintain favorable trade conditions. Optimism is present in this situation for the UK, as they avoid the doubling of tariffs. </p>

          <p>Nvidia surpassed Microsoft in market capitalization, regaining the title of the world's most valuable publicly traded company for the first time since January. Shares of the artificial intelligence chipmaker rose about 3% to $141.40, marking a nearly 24% surge over the past month, driven by sustained growth despite export control and tariff concerns. The company's market cap reached $3.45 trillion, slightly ahead of Microsoft's $3.44 trillion. This achievement underscores Nvidia's dominant position in the AI chip market and its ongoing competition with tech giants like Apple and Microsoft for market leadership. </p>

          <p>Two Chinese nationals, Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu, have been charged with smuggling a fungus, Fusarium graminearum, into the U.S., which is classified as a potential agroterrorism weapon. The Justice Department alleges that Jian and Liu, who received Chinese government funding for their research, were associated with the University of Michigan. The complaint alleges Jian's electronics contain information describing her membership in and loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party, and that Liu admitted to smuggling the fungus through Detroit Metropolitan Airport for research purposes. This case raises national security concerns about potential biological threats and the integrity of research activities within U.S. universities.</p>

          <p>Former US Ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, advised caution regarding Beijing's involvement in the Ukraine-Russia peace talks, despite welcoming any potential role for Beijing. Speaking at the Brookings Institution, Burns suggested that China's growing interest in Ukraine's reconstruction is more of a strategic maneuver than a goodwill gesture, given Beijing's support for Moscow throughout the war. He emphasized that China is not neutral and is diplomatically, economically, and militarily aligned with Russia. This warning reflects Washington's concerns that China could leverage reconstruction aid to gain influence in Ukraine while avoiding accountability for supporting Russia's actions. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," calling it a "disgusting abomination" filled with pork that would massively increase the budget deficit. This critique comes after Musk's departure as a government employee, raising questions about the future of their relationship. While Trump downplayed Musk's departure, Musk's sharp criticism of the bill suggests a potential shift in their dynamic. The bill, which has already passed the House, faces hurdles in the Senate due to concerns about its impact on the national debt and access to Medicaid coverage. </p>

The image projects how Hardin might look after a week on the run, with facial hair and a slimmer appearance. Hardin, 56, was serving a decades-long sentence for murder and sexual assault at the North Central Unit in Calico Rock, Arkansas. Authorities are using tips from the public to guide their search efforts, and the reward for information leading to his capture has increased to $25,000. </p>

          <p>The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry is considering Michael Boren to oversee the U.S. Forest Service, despite his history of conflicts with the agency. Boren, an investment consultant and ranch owner, has had disagreements with the Forest Service, including disputes over building a cabin and managing land within the Sawtooth National Forest. During the hearing, Boren acknowledged some disagreements with the federal government but committed to making forest management more resilient and healthy. His nomination comes at a time of turmoil within the agency, with recent environmental protection rollbacks and staff reductions. </p>

          <p>Middle and major powers are increasingly using triangular diplomacy, balancing between two other powers to build leverage and reduce dependency. This approach, reminiscent of Cold War realpolitik, involves using trade, investment, and technology as weapons of influence.

Leaders negotiating a world with declining post-war institutions and reassessing multilateral commitments are finding this strategy increasingly relevant. </p>

While some stock gains already reflect the anticipated removal, further upside potential remains, as the firm works to shed its troubled past. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially altering longstanding U.S. immigration policy. This proposal would suspend the issuance of new work permits until USCIS decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a difficult timeframe given current backlogs. Even if the average is met, asylum-seekers would have to wait one year after filing their application to be eligible for a work permit.
