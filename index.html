        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles is under a second night of curfew after nearly a week of unrest sparked by US immigration raids, leading to multiple arrests for curfew violations and other offenses. Mayor Karen Bass blames President Trump's immigration policies for provoking fear and panic among residents, accusing the federal government of overreach. National Guard troops have been deployed and authorized to detain individuals until police arrive, escalating tensions between state and federal officials. The military deployment is estimated to cost $134 million, as Trump vows to quell the violence and state officials criticize the use of federal force. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing conflict and the potential for further escalation.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions, Chinese companies are increasingly focused on global expansion, with the U.S. remaining a key market. Camera company Insta360 recently had a successful Shanghai listing, noting that the U.S., Europe, and China each account for roughly 23% of its revenue. Other Chinese firms, such as battery giant CATL and robotic vacuum cleaner company Roborock, are also expanding globally. This trend reflects a shift from manufacturing for foreign brands to building independent international brands, driven partly by slowing growth in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial for sexual assault, concerns have emerged regarding the candor of a juror, potentially leading to a mistrial. The U.S. Attorney's Office has raised issues about a juror's truthfulness, suggesting possible bias or ulterior motives for wanting to be on the jury. Diddy's lawyers have objected to the removal of the juror, and the judge has assured that the issue will be fully addressed. Meanwhile, the accuser using the pseudonym "Jane" continued her testimony, detailing alleged drug use and hotel nights with Diddy, while Diddy maintains his innocence throughout the trial.</p>

          <p>China has entered the race to mass-produce high-performance photonic chips, which could lead to significant advancements in artificial intelligence, 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University's CHIPX has initiated production of 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate photonic chips, using light for information processing. While Europe and the US are already established in this field, China's pilot production line is showing technical gains, potentially overcoming limitations in high-speed optical links. This development signifies a major step for China in the competitive landscape of photonic chip technology.</p>

Former staff at Ticketmaster-owned resale sites claimed to have worked closely with touts, and court documents showed some staff even bought tickets for them. Touts were offered financial incentives and inside information, with evidence suggesting that one tout was offered a meeting with a top Ticketmaster lawyer to brainstorm ways the company could assist them. Ticketmaster denies the allegations, stating they refer to events from over a decade ago and have no relevance to today's ticketing landscape.</p>

The broadcasts, which included propaganda messages and K-pop songs, were resumed last year in response to North Korea's trash-laden balloons.

          <p>As the U.S. restricts China's access to advanced semiconductors for AI development, China is focusing on building its domestic AI chip ecosystem, with companies like Huawei playing a key role. Despite U.S. export controls, China is making strides in AI chip design and fabrication, although challenges remain in manufacturing equipment and memory components. Huawei's Ascend chips are closing the performance gap with Nvidia's offerings, but SMIC, China's largest chip foundry, lags behind TSMC in advanced chip production. The U.S. restrictions are incentivizing domestic innovation, but also making it more difficult for Chinese firms to compete.</p>

          <p>The UK Chancellor's Spending Review has sparked varied reactions in the national newspapers, with headlines ranging from "renewing Britain" to "reckless splurge". While some papers highlight the increased spending on the NHS and defence, others warn of inevitable tax rises and potential cuts to other departments. The review is seen as a rejection of austerity, but economists caution about the fiscal challenges ahead. The newspapers also debate the political motivations behind the spending plans and their potential impact on the next election.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended a performance of 'Les MisÃ©rables' at the Kennedy Center amidst ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles, creating a scene of irony and political theater. Trump's presence was met with a mix of cheers and boos, while drag queens attended in response to his criticism of the venue hosting drag shows. The event was intended to boost fundraising for the Kennedy Center, but it also highlighted the cultural divide and political tensions in Washington. Quotes from Trump and his allies during the event revealed a blend of cultural ignorance and political maneuvering.</p>

          <p>A former nuclear cruise missile launch site in Okinawa, built during the U.S. military occupation, has been reopened to the public as a reminder of the region's dark legacy. The Mace B cruise missile launch site is the last remainder of four that were constructed in the 1960s. The United States occupied Okinawa from 1945 to 1972. The site serves as a stark reminder of the Cold War tensions and the deployment of nuclear weapons in Okinawa, which could strike China and parts of the Soviet Union. Despite Japan regaining sovereignty, Okinawa still hosts a significant portion of U.S. military facilities, raising concerns about the potential deployment of long-range missiles.</p>
