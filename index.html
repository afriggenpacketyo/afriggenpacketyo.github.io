        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesco has introduced AI-powered cameras at some self-checkouts to reduce shoplifting, a move met with mixed reactions from shoppers who either mock the technology or express concerns about surveillance. The system identifies when an item isn't scanned correctly and shows a video replay to the customer, aiming to make the checkout process quicker and easier. This follows a similar implementation by Sainsbury's, with both supermarkets citing a rise in shoplifting offenses across England and Wales. While some employees appreciate the added security, others worry about the implications of increased surveillance and data tracking. Optimism surrounding this technology is tempered by concerns over privacy and potential misuse of data.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Abortions in Missouri have been halted again after the state's Supreme Court ordered a lower court to reevaluate its previous rulings that allowed abortions to resume. The Supreme Court stated that the lower court should first consider the potential harms of allowing abortions to resume, particularly regarding regulations on abortion facilities. Attorney General Andrew Bailey praised the decision as a victory for women and children, while Planned Parenthood, which operates the state's only abortion clinics, criticized the ruling as political interference. The organization has started canceling appointments and hopes to return to court soon, while another ballot measure proposing an abortion ban with exceptions for pregnancies caused by sexual assault or incest may appear in 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Met Police and an MI5 boss, have raised concerns about the government's plans to release some prisoners early to ease overcrowding. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they argue the proposals could negatively impact public safety, citing potential costs of electronic tagging and the risk of repeat offenders avoiding jail time. While acknowledging the government's challenge, the letter emphasizes the importance of maintaining deterrent sentencing and robust management of high-risk offenders. The government maintains that the announced proposals have addressed many of the concerns, and that repeat offenders can still face short sentences under the changes, and terrorists will not be eligible for earlier release.</p>

          <p>A report backed by the London mayor advocates for the decriminalization of possessing small quantities of cannabis for personal use, recommending its removal from the Misuse of Drugs Act. The report, by the London Drugs Commission, argues that current laws disproportionately affect ethnic communities and fail to address medicinal use. Mayor Sadiq Khan supports the findings, citing a compelling case for decriminalization, while opponents argue it could send the wrong message about the harm of cannabis. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner stated that drug policy is a matter for parliament, and that the force will continue to enforce the current law.</p>

          <p>A German court in Hamm dismissed a climate case brought by a Peruvian farmer against energy giant RWE, who sought financial assistance for flood defenses due to melting glaciers near his town. The court stated that no appeal is possible, however, the environmental NGO Germanwatch, supporting the plaintiff, argues the judges made history. Saul Luciano Lliuya claimed RWE should cover a portion of the costs for flood defenses, but RWE argued that it complies with national regulations and questioned why it was singled out. Despite the dismissal, the case has sparked discussion about corporate responsibility for global emissions and may set a precedent for future climate litigation.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined Â£122.7 million for breaches related to sewage operations and shareholder payouts, marking the largest penalty ever issued by the water regulator Ofwat. The fine includes Â£104.5 million for sewage operation violations and Â£18.2 million for "undeserved" shareholder payouts that didn't reflect the company's performance. This action comes amidst ongoing criticism of Thames Water's performance, including sewage discharges, leaks, and a substantial Â£20 billion debt. While the fines will be paid by the company and its investors, household water bills have recently increased, and the company remains in a precarious financial situation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to remove judge-ordered restrictions on deportations to third countries. The administration argues that a mandate issued by a Massachusetts judge has created diplomatic and logistical problems, harming efforts to remove criminal aliens. The judge's order requires detainees to be given notice of their destination and time to raise safety concerns, but the administration insists it has already provided adequate due process. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that non-citizens on U.S. soil must be afforded due process, but the specifics remain contested, and the court is weighing the ability of individual judges to issue nationwide orders.</p>

This marks Zelenskyy's third meeting with Chancellor Friedrich Merz in recent weeks, highlighting Germany's increasing role in supporting Ukraine amid weakening U.S. commitments. Zelenskyy stated that securing around $30 billion annually is crucial to funding domestic arms production at full capacity, focusing on equipment such as attack drones, interceptors, and ballistic systems. With neither side achieving major breakthroughs, the arms race becomes increasingly important, with Ukraine relying on aid from Europe and the U.S., while Russia receives support from China, Iran, and North Korea.</p>

Pop Mart, founded in 2010, has rapidly expanded internationally with over 500 stores in more than 30 countries and regions.

The funds will be used to rehabilitate burned areas, restore wildlife habitats, and improve forest resilience to future wildfires. While Edison agreed to the settlement without admitting wrongdoing, the agreement provides compensation for the costs of fighting the fire and the extensive damage it caused to public lands.</p>

          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts, potentially up to Â£1,000 each, and may have debts written off due to the forced installation of prepayment meters. Energy companies will pay over Â£70 million in compensation and financial support following a review by Ofgem, the energy regulator. The review found that suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their agreement, and the payouts range from Â£40 to Â£1,000 depending on the circumstances. A new code of practice is now in place to prevent future inappropriate installations, but enforcement investigations are continuing for some suppliers.</p>

          <p>Japan's bond market is causing concern about potential capital flight from the U.S. and an unwinding of the carry trade, as long-dated yields approach record highs. Higher yields on Japanese government bonds could lead Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially triggering a global financial market crisis. The steepening of Japan's yield curve is due to structural factors and the Bank of Japan scaling back bond purchases. Some analysts warn of a carry trade unwind, where borrowing in low-interest-rate currencies like the yen to invest in higher-yielding assets abroad reverses, impacting global markets.

Despite these challenges, European companies are increasingly buying components from Chinese companies, making their supply chains more dependent on China. This trend is driven by lower prices and the weakening of Chinaâ€™s currency, which makes Chinese components more attractive.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" during its ninth flight test after successfully reaching orbit. A propellant leak caused a loss of attitude control, resulting in the spacecraft spinning and re-entering Earth's atmosphere at an unfavorable angle. SpaceX mission control lost contact with the upper stage as it burned up over the Indian Ocean. Despite this, the mission achieved the milestone of reaching orbit and marked the first launch of a flight-proven Super Heavy booster. The company will analyze the data to improve Starship's reliability for future missions.</p>
