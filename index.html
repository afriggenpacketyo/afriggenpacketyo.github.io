          <p>Lenton Vanburen, one of the remaining fugitives who escaped from a New Orleans jail on May 16th, was captured in Baton Rouge, according to Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill.

This arrest marks the sixth fugitive captured after ten inmates made a brazen escape from the Orleans Parish jail earlier this month.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump granted an unconditional pardon to Scott Jenkins, the former sheriff of Culpeper County, Virginia, who was convicted on federal bribery charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Trump stated that Jenkins and his family were unfairly targeted by a corrupt and weaponized Biden Department of Justice, claiming the judge in Jenkins' trial suppressed exculpatory evidence. Jenkins was convicted in December 2024 on charges including conspiracy, honest services fraud, and bribery related to federally funded programs, where he received over $75,000 for appointing businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs.</p>

          <p>The UK government is shifting apprenticeship funding to focus on individuals under 21 in England, with plans to scrap funding for postgraduate apprenticeships. This change aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults and those needing retraining. Funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, will be eliminated for those over 21, potentially impacting advanced training in sectors like healthcare. Critics argue this move will harm public services and limit professional opportunities for young people who do not attend university.</p>

          <p>In the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, federal prosecutors have called 16 witnesses over two weeks to prove that Combs used violence and threats to coerce women into sex and protect his music empire. Star witness Cassie Ventura testified for four days, alleging a decade of abuse, while other witnesses corroborated her testimony, describing Combs' violence. Combs' lawyers argue that his domestic violence was driven by jealousy and drug addiction, and his sexual activities were private business, not sex trafficking. Prosecutors plan to call Combs' former assistant and representatives from Los Angeles fire and police departments when court resumes.</p>

He was instrumental in persuading Hillary Clinton to run for Senate from New York and was a key member of Harlem's "Gang of Four," which included David Dinkins and Percy Sutton; however, his career was marked by an ethics censure in 2010, which forced him to relinquish his chairmanship.</p>

          <p>As rocket launches become more frequent, physicists are studying the sounds of spaceflight to understand and mitigate the noise impact on communities. Researchers, like Kent Gee at Brigham Young University, are analyzing SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches to determine why they produce a three-part sonic boom. With SpaceX testing the larger and louder Starship rocket, understanding and addressing rocket noise is crucial before it becomes a pervasive problem, potentially influencing launch regulations and community acceptance. The goal is to gather data that could lead to strategies for lessening disruptions caused by rocket launches.</p>

The decision to have King Charles open Canada's Parliament, a task typically performed by the governor-general, is seen as a symbolic move to emphasize Canada's distinct heritage and independence. The visit, which included meetings with indigenous leaders and a tree-planting ceremony, reflects Canada's efforts to maintain its identity separate from the United States.</p>

          <p>Former referees' boss Keith Hackett has criticized the Professional Game Match Officials Limited for appointing Thomas Bramall to officiate Aston Villa's defeat by Manchester United. Hackett believes Bramall's inexperience contributed to a "big mistake" that cost Villa a goal and a chance at Champions League qualification. He suggested that a more experienced referee, such as Michael Oliver, should have been assigned to such an important match.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Vladimir Putin for the escalating attacks in Ukraine, describing his actions as "absolutely CRAZY." However, Trump has not taken concrete steps to increase pressure on Russia, refusing to join European allies in imposing new sanctions. This approach has drawn criticism, as some see it as a strategic void that allows Russia to continue its attacks without facing significant consequences from the U.S.</p>

          <p>A police pursuit that began in Imperial Beach and ended on Interstate 5 near Carmel Valley caused significant traffic delays in both directions. The pursuit involved a reckless driver in a Toyota Corolla, who was eventually stopped using a pit maneuver. The prolonged closure of the freeway snarled traffic for miles, creating what authorities described as a "traffic nightmare."</p>

          <p>The European Union and the United States are set to resume trade negotiations after President Trump delayed imposing tariffs. However, significant differences in priorities and demands between the two sides could hinder a swift agreement. The European Union remains committed to constructive efforts, but it also prepares retaliatory measures if negotiations fail. Negotiations are to resume quickly, but the partners have been talking for some time without breakthroughs.</p>
