          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a previous ban, allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to Chinese companies. This decision is contingent on a controversial "revenue-sharing" agreement where the companies will give 15% of their revenue from these sales to the U.S. government. Trade experts and some lawmakers have raised concerns that this sets a dangerous precedent, suggesting that national security-based export controls could be influenced by financial deals and lobbying. The legality of the arrangement, which critics liken to an export tax, is still under review by the Department of Commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United's new head coach, Ruben Amorim, is implementing significant changes to restore the club's success following a self-described "disaster season." His strategy involves a tactical shift to a 3-5-2 formation, which has required major roster changes, including nearly £200m in new attacking players. Amorim is also fostering a more positive and player-led dressing room culture, a departure from the previous manager's prescriptive style. The club faces a difficult early schedule, which will be a crucial test for his new system and leadership approach.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has broken her social media silence three weeks after her "Great Jeans" ad campaign for American Eagle sparked online debate. The campaign, which played on the term "genes," drew criticism from some for perceived racial undertones, while others defended it as a rejection of "woke" advertising. The article notes that Sweeney has not directly commented on the controversy but returned to Instagram with photos from a night out with friends. Public relations experts quoted in the article offer differing opinions on whether the controversy will positively or negatively impact her career.</p>

          <p>An incident in San Bernardino involving federal immigration agents resulted in shots being fired at a vehicle with people inside. The Department of Homeland Security stated that officers were injured when the driver refused to exit and drove his car at them, prompting an officer to discharge their firearm in self-defense. Conversely, the driver and an immigrant justice group claim agents smashed the car's windows without a warrant and fired, calling it an abuse of power. The San Bernardino Police Department responded but cited the California Values Act, which prohibits local law enforcement from assisting with federal immigration enforcement.</p>

The restaurant, known for its red-checkered tablecloths and discreet service, has been a favorite of figures from Elizabeth Taylor to George Clooney. Tana sold the establishment in 2009, but it continues to operate under new ownership, preserving its historic charm.</p>

India has criticized the tariffs as unfair, pointing out that many Western nations also continue to trade with Russia. The U.S. is India's largest single export partner, making the stalled negotiations a significant concern for Indian manufacturers and the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified to become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, reaching Category 4 strength after a period of rapid intensification. The storm is currently impacting Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with heavy rain and strong winds, with tropical storm watches in effect for the Turks and Caicos. While the majority of forecast models predict Erin will remain offshore, the U.S. East Coast is expected to experience large waves and life-threatening rip currents between August 20 and 27. A cold front is anticipated to help steer the storm away from making landfall on the U.S. mainland.</p>

          <p>A long-standing principle known as the "85th percentile rule" is being reconsidered by some states and federal agencies for setting speed limits on U.S. roads. This rule suggests that the speed limit should be set at the speed at or below which 85% of drivers travel, effectively letting the fastest drivers determine the legal speed. Critics argue this creates a dangerous feedback loop where speed limits continually increase, especially in urban areas with pedestrians and cyclists. In response to rising traffic fatalities, officials are now encouraging a more context-sensitive approach that considers road usage and safety for all users.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the National League West. The win was significantly aided by a series of mistakes from the Padres in the early innings.

The Dodgers capitalized on the sloppiness, scoring five runs in the first two innings despite having only one hit, largely thanks to six walks issued by the Padres' starting pitcher.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's upcoming visit to Washington D.C. for peace talks is fraught with diplomatic peril following President Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin. After the meeting, Trump abruptly shifted his stance, suggesting a permanent peace deal could be reached without a preceding ceasefire, a move that aligns with Russian interests and alarms Kyiv. This creates a difficult position for Zelenskyy, who must participate in the talks to avoid being portrayed as an obstacle to peace, while risking an ambush where he could be pressured into accepting unfavorable terms. The dynamic suggests Trump holds a deference to Putin that contrasts sharply with his apparent disdain for Zelenskyy.</p>

          <p>The trial of Bryan Patrick Miller, known locally as the "Zombie Hunter," for the Phoenix canal murders of the 1990s featured a unique defense strategy. His lawyers admitted he committed the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity due to severe childhood abuse by his mother. The defense claimed this trauma led to a dissociative condition, causing him to have no memory of the killings. Prosecutors countered this by highlighting Miller's memory of other violent incidents and presented testimony from his ex-wife about his deviant and violent behavior, ultimately leading to a guilty verdict and a death sentence.</p>

Other triggers include having poor boundaries developed from being a parentified child, being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage, or experiencing a recent significant loss.

          <h2>Trump Reportedly Backs Putin's Proposal for Ukraine to Cede Donbas for Peace</h2>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump has reportedly told European leaders he supports a peace plan that would require Ukraine to give up the Donbas region. Sources familiar with the talks state Putin's offer involves a Ukrainian withdrawal from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in exchange for Russia freezing the current front lines elsewhere. This represents a significant concession, as Ukraine still controls key fortified areas within Donetsk that have been defended at great cost. The proposal places immense pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ahead of his visit to Washington to discuss a peace agreement.</p>

          <p>Following his meeting with President Trump in Alaska, Russian President Vladimir Putin described the summit as "timely and very useful" for discussing a potential resolution to the war in Ukraine. During the meeting, President Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Putin, which reportedly raised concerns over Ukrainian children abducted by Russia during the conflict. The White House also dismissed an NPR report about summit documents being found on a hotel printer as "hilarious," stating it was merely a lunch menu. President Zelenskyy has previously stated that thousands of Ukrainian children have been kidnapped by Russia.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases, with the Southwest showing the highest positivity rates at 12.5%. The spike is attributed to the new, highly contagious "Stratus" variant, which now accounts for two-thirds of detected virus variants. This increase in infections coincides with students returning to school and follows a controversial change in CDC policy, under which updated COVID shots are no longer universally recommended for healthy children. Leading medical organizations have criticized this policy reversal, arguing it is baseless and contradicts scientific advice that boosters significantly reduce hospitalization and death.</p>

          <p>A former software CEO, Mike Conner, has completed a nearly five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. After purchasing the abandoned island for £555,000 in 2017, he undertook the immense challenge of making it habitable, which involved overcoming the lack of electricity and running water. The historic fort is now a fully modernized space with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub, and is back on the market for £3 million. The arduous renovation process required helicopters to bring in equipment and a team of workers living on-site for years.</p>

          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are using meticulous planning and creative strategies to feed their children affordably during the six-week school summer holidays. Some parents rely on "yellow sticker" reduced-price items, which they freeze for later use, and turn aging fruit into frozen yogurt snacks to avoid waste. Others organize their food into daily portions to make it last and utilize local food pantries that provide surplus groceries for a small fee. These tactics have become essential as many families struggle with the loss of subsidized school meals and the increased costs of having children at home.</p>
