          <p>NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter has captured a unique image of Arsia Mons, a 12-mile-high volcano on Mars, seen through the clouds at dawn. This marks the first time one of the volcanoes in the Tharsis Mountains has been imaged on the planet's horizon. The image, taken on May 2, allows scientists to observe changes in dust and water ice cloud layers over the Martian seasons, offering new clues about the evolution of Mars' atmosphere. Arsia Mons is roughly twice as tall as Earth's largest volcano, Mauna Loa, and is often surrounded by thick clouds, especially during the Red Planet's aphelion. The spacecraft, launched in 2001, continues to provide valuable data about the Martian atmosphere and surface features.</p>

          <p>Tensions between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have escalated, potentially creating divisions within the Republican party ahead of the midterm elections. Musk's criticisms of Trump's policies and his suggestion of a new political party have caused concern among some Republicans, who worry about the impact on upcoming legislative efforts. Trump has dismissed Musk's criticisms, but the billionaire's past financial support for the GOP and his influence on social media could make the feud a significant challenge for the party. While some Republicans believe the dispute will eventually be resolved, others fear it could undermine Trump's agenda and create further chaos.</p>

          <p>An upcoming Spending Review in the UK is expected to reveal substantial increases in government spending, but the distribution of funds remains a point of contention.

The Home Office, for example, is reportedly in dispute with the Treasury over funding for police, while the NHS is set to receive a substantial boost.
