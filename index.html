        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With patents for popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic expiring in China soon, dozens of local pharmaceutical companies are developing generic alternatives. Analysts predict this will lead to a significant drop in prices, making treatments for obesity and diabetes more accessible to a wider population. Currently, around 60 similar drugs are in clinical trials, positioning Chinese firms to compete in a global market valued at over $150 billion. The influx of generic versions is expected to intensify market competition and drive down costs for consumers.</p>

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has initiated a $365-million expansion project despite a recent slowdown in cargo movement attributed to rising international tariffs. The project, led by terminal operator International Transportation Service, aims to increase cargo-handling capacity by 50% to accommodate larger vessels. Officials acknowledge the current uncertainty in global trade but express confidence in the long-term necessity of the infrastructure investment. The expansion is expected to strengthen the supply chain and create new jobs in the region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, halting what immigrant rights advocates describe as unlawful and indiscriminate immigration enforcement tactics in Southern California. The ruling found sufficient evidence that federal agents were stopping individuals based on factors like race, language, or location, which does not meet the 4th Amendment's requirement for reasonable suspicion. The order prohibits agents from using these factors for detention and mandates that detainees at a specific facility be given 24-hour access to legal counsel.</p>

However, a coalition of architects and preservationists, backed by a public petition and UNESCO, contends that the bridge can be repaired in place for less money.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against New York City Mayor Eric Adams in his lawsuit challenging the Campaign Finance Board's decision to deny him public matching funds. The judge affirmed the board's decision, citing the Adams campaign's failure to respond to a records request and meet a disclosure deadline as valid grounds for the denial. However, the judge rejected the board's reasoning related to a now-dismissed federal bribery case against Adams, stating it inappropriately shifted the burden of proof. The mayor's team expressed optimism that they can still secure the funds by submitting the required documentation.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products if President Trump enacts a threatened 50% tariff. Trump's threat is explicitly linked to his opposition to the criminal trial of his political ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which he called a 'witch hunt.' Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will use a reciprocity law to match the U.S. tariffs, escalating the risk of a trade war. The move has united Brazilian politicians in defending the nation's sovereignty against foreign interference.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 35% tariff on all goods from Canada, set to take effect on August 1. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump cited Canada's alleged failure to stop fentanyl trafficking and its own retaliatory tariffs as reasons for the move. This represents a significant escalation in trade tensions with one of America's largest trading partners. The announcement is part of a broader strategy that has seen the Trump administration send similar letters to over 20 other countries, signaling a dramatic expansion of its tariff-based trade policy.</p>

          <p>The BBC is confronting a difficult decision regarding the broadcast of its latest MasterChef series, which was filmed with presenter Gregg Wallace before he was dismissed over misconduct allegations. While the production company investigates the claims, the BBC has not yet announced whether it will air, shelve, or modify the completed season. Airing the show could provoke a backlash and be upsetting to the women who have come forward, but canceling it would be a major disappointment for the contestants and crew. The situation highlights the challenges broadcasters face when dealing with allegations against prominent figures.</p>

          <p>A large-scale federal raid on the Glass House cannabis operation in Southern California resulted in the detention of nearly 200 people, including several minors, and sparked chaos. Farmworker advocates reported that one laborer was critically injured after falling from a greenhouse roof while trying to flee agents. The raid, part of the Trump administration's intensified immigration campaign, targeted a major legal cannabis company, fueling dueling political narratives about undocumented labor and government overreach. The incident has terrified local immigrant populations and sent a warning shot to the state's legal cannabis industry.</p>

          <p>A White House investigation into cost overruns for a Federal Reserve headquarters renovation project is intensifying speculation that the Trump administration may seek to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell. While President Trump has openly criticized Powell's interest rate policies, the probe focuses on alleged mismanagement of the renovation, which could provide a 'for cause' basis for dismissal. This move is seen by many as a pretext to exert political control over the central bank's monetary policy, a development that could severely rattle financial markets and undermine the Fed's traditional independence.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who won an election vowing to stand up to U.S. trade pressure, is now facing questions about whether he is backing down from President Trump's threats. Despite Trump's new threat of a 35% tariff, Canada has recently made concessions, such as scrapping a planned digital services tax. While some analysts believe it is too early to judge the outcome of ongoing negotiations, critics argue that Carney's 'elbows up' approach has so far yielded little benefit for Canada, raising concerns about his ability to secure a fair trade deal.</p>
