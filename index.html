          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, has announced it will eliminate 9,000 jobs, constituting 11% of its workforce. This decision follows a warning that profits would decline due to the emergence of competing drugs and marks a significant move by the new CEO to address evolving market pressures. The company faces intensified competition from rivals like Eli Lilly, which has recently increased the price of its drug Mounjaro. Novo Nordisk aims to reduce costs by approximately £927 million by the end of next year to improve organizational efficiency and ensure long-term success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Poland's military, with assistance from NATO allies, scrambled fighter jets to shoot down multiple Russian drones that violated its airspace during a large-scale attack on Ukraine. Prime Minister Donald Tusk described the incursion as an "unprecedented" act of aggression, prompting Warsaw to consider invoking Article 4 of the NATO treaty for consultations. European leaders condemned the violation, with some suggesting it was intentional, representing a dangerous escalation in the ongoing conflict. The incident marks the first time NATO aircraft have actively engaged hostile drones over an allied country's territory, heightening regional tensions significantly.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Turkey have unearthed a 2,000-year-old Roman council hall in the ancient city of Laodicea, a location mentioned in the Bible's Book of Revelation. The massive structure, which served as a political and judicial center, contains significant early Christian carvings, including a cross and a Chi-Rho monogram. The discovery provides a tangible link between the Roman era and the nascent Christian communities of the time. This find is part of a series of recent archaeological discoveries in the region that shed new light on biblical history and the lives of early Christians in Anatolia.</p>

          <p>Peter Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, has stated that he anticipates the release of further embarrassing communications between himself and the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This follows the recent publication of a letter where Mandelson referred to Epstein as his "best pal" over two decades ago. While expressing deep regret for the association and profound sympathy for Epstein's victims, Mandelson affirmed that the Prime Minister still has confidence in him. The ongoing revelations raise questions about his judgment and are likely to create continued political difficulties for the government.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in Washington has cautioned that a US proposal to shorten visas for its journalists could trigger a new round of "media warfare." The Department of Homeland Security has suggested capping the stay for mainland Chinese reporters at 90 days, a significant reduction from the previous policy tied to employment duration. Beijing has labeled the proposed rule a "discriminatory step" and a regression from prior commitments made by the United States. This move is part of a broader trend of escalating diplomatic and media tensions between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has accused President Trump of attempting a political power grab by repeatedly threatening to send National Guard troops to Chicago, ostensibly to combat crime. Pritzker suggests the President's goal is to normalize military intervention in civilian areas ahead of the 2026 congressional elections. While Trump lacks the authority to deploy troops without the governor's request, the Department of Homeland Security has initiated an operation to detain undocumented immigrants in the city. Pritzker condemned the federal actions, arguing they foster a climate of fear and draw parallels to authoritarian tactics.</p>

          <p>This article traces the history of originalism, a judicial philosophy championed by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, arguing it has effectively halted the process of constitutional amendment. The summary explains how this shift has increased the political stakes of Supreme Court nominations, particularly concerning landmark cases like Roe v. Wade and Second Amendment rights. The article contends that as amending the Constitution became nearly impossible due to political polarization, both conservatives and liberals turned to the judiciary to enact change. This has led to an increasingly politicized court and a decline in public trust.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, the first Black woman to hold the position. The judge ruled that Cook demonstrated a strong likelihood that her removal, based on mortgage fraud allegations from before she joined the Fed, violates the "for cause" provision of the Federal Reserve Act. This decision allows Cook to continue her duties and participate in the upcoming Fed meeting, where an interest rate cut is anticipated. The case represents an unprecedented attempt by a president to remove a Fed governor, raising significant questions about the central bank's independence.</p>

Currently capped at £100, the change would enable higher-value purchases without requiring a PIN, aligning card payments with the unrestricted limits of digital wallets on smartphones. While the move reflects evolving payment habits, it has raised concerns about fraud, though the FCA insists providers would be responsible for losses and would only permit it for low-risk transactions.

          <p>President Trump's 30-day emergency authority over Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department is set to expire, with Congress showing no intention of granting an extension. Trump invoked the Home Rule Act in August to declare a "crime emergency," but has recently praised Mayor Muriel Bowser for cooperation and a drop in crime. While federal control of the local police force ends, other federal elements like the National Guard and immigration agents remain. The episode has renewed debate over D.C.'s home rule, with Democrats calling for more autonomy and some Republicans seeking to repeal it entirely.</p>

          <p>Nepal's army is patrolling the streets of Kathmandu following days of intense anti-corruption protests that led to the prime minister's resignation and widespread violence, including the storming of parliament. The youth-led "Gen Z" groups that initiated the peaceful demonstrations now claim their movement was hijacked by opportunistic infiltrators responsible for the arson and destruction. While a tense calm has returned to the capital, a nationwide curfew is in effect. The military has invited protest leaders for talks as the nation grapples with a leadership vacuum and its worst civil unrest in decades.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request for an expedited hearing to appeal lower court rulings that declared many of the President's tariffs illegal. The administration warned that without a swift decision, it could be forced to refund up to $1 trillion in collected duties. The case centers on whether the President usurped congressional authority by using emergency powers to impose wide-ranging "reciprocal tariffs" on imports from numerous countries. The court will hear oral arguments in November, signaling a potentially rapid resolution to the high-stakes trade policy dispute.</p>

          <p>Following Western sanctions that drastically reduced its energy sales to Europe, Russia has pivoted to Asia, with the proposed Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline to China being a cornerstone of this new strategy. However, this article argues that China, not Russia, stands to gain the most from the deal. With Europe no longer a primary customer, Moscow has lost significant leverage, allowing Beijing to dictate more favorable terms for gas prices and supply. Russia's share of EU pipeline gas imports has plummeted from over 40% in 2021 to around 11% in 2024, highlighting its increased dependency on the Chinese market.</p>

The innovation aims to alleviate the strain on surgical teams, which are facing growing clinical demand due to aging populations. By automating simpler tasks, the technology has the potential to improve efficiency in the operating room and help reduce surgical wait times.</p>

While the universities will retain their individual names and campuses, they will operate under a single leadership structure. The move has been welcomed by regulators as an innovative approach, but the University and College Union has warned that redundancies are almost certain.</p>
