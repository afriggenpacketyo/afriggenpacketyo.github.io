          <p>Former NFL quarterback and Fox Sports commentator Mark Sanchez was arrested for battery, unlawful entry of a motor vehicle, and public intoxication after being stabbed in downtown Indianapolis. Police responded to a disturbance where two people were injured, one identified as Sanchez, who was initially in critical condition but is now stable. The circumstances surrounding the attack remain unclear, with the suspect detained. Sanchez was in Indianapolis to call a Colts game for Fox Sports, having joined the network in 2021 after a 10-season NFL career.</p>

          <p>Police in Tbilisi, Georgia, used water cannons and pepper spray to disperse anti-government protesters who tried to storm the presidential palace. The country has been in crisis since the ruling Georgian Dream party's disputed election victory last year, which the opposition claims was stolen and led to a halt in EU talks. Tens of thousands marched, with some calling for the arrest of Georgian Dream leaders. The protest occurred amid local elections largely boycotted by the opposition, following a recent crackdown on activists and independent media.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, halting a Trump administration initiative that would have transferred immigrant children to adult detention centers upon turning 18. This ruling by US District Judge Rudolph Contreras reinforces a 2021 court order requiring these individuals to be released to the least restrictive setting unless deemed a danger or flight risk. The Trump administration faces ongoing criticism for its immigration policies, including accusations of offering financial incentives for self-deportation and reviving family separation tactics.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, 64, has been elected leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), placing her on track to become the country's first female prime minister. A former heavy metal drummer and TV host, Takaichi is known for her conservative views, though she has recently softened her stance on social issues like childcare and women's health. A protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, she plans to revive his "Abenomics" economic vision and supports easing constitutional restrictions on Japan's Self-Defence Forces. Her victory comes as the LDP seeks to regain voter trust amid scandals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker vehemently criticized the Trump administration's decision to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard members, calling the move "outrageous and un-American." The Trump administration authorized the federalization after Pritzker refused to deploy state troops to quell protests, particularly around an ICE facility in Broadview. Pritzker asserts that local law enforcement is sufficient and that Trump's actions are a "manufactured performance" aimed at control rather than public safety. This dispute follows earlier calls by Pritzker for the 25th Amendment to be invoked against the president.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israelis rallied in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square, expressing cautious optimism and gratitude towards President Trump for the potential Gaza ceasefire deal with Hamas. Many protesters credited Trump for brokering a plan that could lead to the return of hostages, a goal they felt Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu had failed to prioritize. The US-brokered 20-point plan includes a hostage-prisoner exchange, phased Israeli withdrawal, and a technocratic Palestinian committee to govern Gaza. Critics accuse Netanyahu of prolonging the conflict for political gain, with some fearing he might still sabotage the agreement.</p>

          <p>A recent explosion and fire at Chevron's El Segundo refinery, a facility with a history of safety and environmental violations, has raised concerns about public safety and environmental oversight. The investigation into the incident is severely hampered because federal safety agencies, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Chemical Safety and Hazard Mitigation Board, are largely furloughed or defunded due to the ongoing government shutdown and Trump administration budget cuts.

While the FBI had discussed sending "large, beefy" agents to escort Comey to his arraignment, his attorneys were reportedly planning a more common, less public arrival.

          <p>Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Virginia attorney general, is facing widespread bipartisan backlash over violent and inflammatory text messages from 2022. In the messages, Jones expressed a hypothetical desire to shoot Republican Speaker Todd Gilbert, stating he would choose Gilbert over Adolf Hitler or Pol Pot. Jones has issued a "deepest apology" to Gilbert and his family, taking full responsibility for his "embarrassing" and "sickening" words. Both Democratic and Republican political figures have condemned his remarks, with some calling for him to withdraw from the race, highlighting the intense political climate in Virginia.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's new goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, made a memorable debut, earning a clean sheet and receiving an unexpected serenade from fans comparing him to Peter Schmeichel. The 23-year-old Belgian, signed for £18.1m, demonstrated agility with a low save and composure in a one-on-one situation, despite a couple of early mishaps. Coach Ruben Amorim explained the delay in his debut was for adaptation. This positive performance contributes to United's recent home winning streak and offers a hopeful sign for the team, though Amorim acknowledges the need for consistent away results.</p>

          <p>Turkey faces increasing pressure from the US and G7 nations to reduce its significant energy dependence on Russia, which currently supplies 66% of its oil and 41% of its natural gas. Despite this, Turkey benefits from lower Russian energy prices following the Ukraine invasion. In response, Turkey is pursuing a diversification strategy, signing new long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts with US and Australian firms, and promoting domestic and renewable energy sources. This balancing act reflects Turkey's efforts to ensure energy security while improving strained relations with the US and dealing with sanctions impacting projects like the Russian-assisted Akkuyu nuclear plant.

          <p>Jack Daniel's distillery has ended its 45-year practice of providing free spent grain for cattle feed to local Tennessee farmers, a move that threatens to devastate their businesses and the local economy. The company, owned by Brown-Forman, justifies the change by citing global environmental goals and the need to meet sustainability standards through a new anaerobic digester facility. Farmers feel betrayed, arguing the company is abandoning its local roots. This situation highlights a growing tension in rural America between corporate sustainability objectives and the survival of long-standing community relationships, leaving locals questioning the brand's commitment.</p>

          <p>Traditional piano sales have drastically declined since 1925, with only 17,294 units sold in 2024 compared to over 300,000 a century ago, reflecting shifting cultural trends and economic pressures. Piano technician Hannah Beckett notes that millennials' struggles with homeownership impact luxury purchases like acoustic pianos. However, the article highlights the rise of digital and hybrid pianos as more affordable and space-efficient alternatives.

US Treasurer Brandon Beach shared a draft design showing Trump's profile and the phrase "Fight, Fight, Fight," referencing his words after a 2024 assassination attempt. A law signed by Trump in his first term permits commemorative $1 coins for the semiquincentennial. However, there are existing provisions, like the 1866 Thayer Amendment, that generally prohibit living persons from appearing on US currency, though Congress has made exceptions in the past.</p>
