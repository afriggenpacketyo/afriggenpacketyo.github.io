          <p>According to U.S. intelligence sources, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained injuries during a recent Israeli attack on Iran. The sources confirmed Iranian state media reports that Pezeshkian was hurt while escaping a Supreme National Security Council meeting that was targeted. It remains uncertain whether the president was an intentional target of the strike. This incident occurred within the context of a 12-day conflict between the two nations that also saw the deaths of several high-ranking Iranian military commanders.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum toured Alcatraz as part of a Trump administration directive to convert the historic site back into a federal penitentiary. The plan aims to house the "most ruthless and violent offenders," though it requires significant rehabilitation of the deteriorating facilities. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from local officials like San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who highlighted the loss of significant tourism revenue and called the idea foolish.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its long-standing rules regarding liquids in carry-on luggage. This follows a recent policy change that eliminated the need for passengers to remove shoes during standard security screenings. Noem stated she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the liquid size restrictions could be the next major policy to be updated, though no specific timeline was provided. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners that provide more detailed baggage imaging.</p>

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee advanced the judicial nomination of Emil Bove, a former lawyer for President Trump, to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The vote occurred amidst chaotic scenes as Democratic members walked out in protest after being denied the opportunity to have a whistleblower testify against Bove. The nominee faces serious allegations of unethical conduct, including pushing for a quid pro quo and suggesting the administration ignore court orders. Despite the committee's approval, his confirmation by the full Senate remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Members of Congress from both parties joined together to play in the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game, setting aside political divisions for a charitable cause. The event, which pits "Team Congress" against a team of journalists, raises money for the Young Survival Coalition, an organization supporting young adults with breast cancer. Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a cancer survivor herself, the game has raised nearly $5 million. The event highlights a rare moment of unity and collaboration on Capitol Hill for a shared purpose.</p>

          <p>Japan's core consumer inflation, which excludes fresh food, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, largely due to easing rice prices. While this marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, the cooling trend provides some relief. The data comes as the nation faces economic growth concerns tied to potential U.S. tariffs and cost-of-living issues. Despite persistent inflation, some analysts believe the Bank of Japan will wait until 2026 to consider a rate hike. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. consumers are facing record-high beef prices, with a pound of ground beef averaging $6.12 in June, a nearly 12% increase from the previous year. This price surge is attributed to a long-term decline in the U.S. cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951. Factors contributing to the tight supply include persistent drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices rather than breeding them. The situation is further exacerbated by a ban on cattle imports from Mexico and the potential impact of widespread tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Abbott Laboratories CEO Robert Ford stated that the significant drop in the company's stock price following its latest earnings report was an "overreaction." While Abbott beat revenue and earnings expectations, investors were disappointed by tightened full-year guidance, causing the stock to fall over 8%. Ford acknowledged that the diagnostics business in China was weaker than anticipated but emphasized that the fundamentals of the company's other divisions, particularly medical devices, remain strong. He expressed confidence that the issues in China are temporary and that the company is actively managing the situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, the Department of Justice under the Trump administration is recommending a sentence of just one day in prison for Brett Hankison, a former police officer convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights. Hankison blindly fired ten shots into Taylor's apartment building during the fatal 2020 raid. The sentencing memo requests that Hankison receive credit for time served, meaning he would face no additional jail time. This recommendation starkly contrasts with the previous administration's focus on police accountability following the widespread protests sparked by Taylor's death.</p>

The map, pushed by Governor Ron DeSantis, dismantled a North Florida district where Black voters had consistently elected their candidate of choice. The court's majority opinion argued that while the new map did reduce Black voters' electoral ability, creating a non-diminishing district would have improperly prioritized race over other redistricting criteria.

          <p>Legal experts are expressing growing concern over the Supreme Court's increased use of its "shadow docket" to issue emergency rulings, often with little or no explanation. This trend has been particularly noticeable in cases involving the Trump administration, which has frequently received favorable outcomes on major policy decisions before lower courts have fully ruled on their legality. This practice allows policies to proceed without a full legal review or public justification. Critics argue this approach undermines the Court's transparency and risks damaging its legitimacy by making it appear to be a political actor.</p>
