          <p>Wealthy individuals are increasingly storing gold in Singapore due to rising economic and geopolitical uncertainties. A precious metals repository called "The Reserve" has seen an 88% increase in orders to store gold and silver compared to last year. Singapore is viewed as a safe jurisdiction with political and economic stability, making it an attractive location for the ultra-rich to park their assets. Investors are also opting for physical gold bars over paper gold to avoid counterparty and geopolitical risks, reflecting a growing distrust in the global financial system. The article highlights the trend of high-net-worth individuals seeking safe havens for their wealth amid global instability.</p>

          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, has become the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about shark conservation. Pugh swam approximately 60 miles over 12 days in cold waters, aiming to change public perception of sharks, which he says were unfairly portrayed in the film "Jaws." Despite challenging weather conditions, Pugh completed the swim, emphasizing the need to protect sharks, which are being killed at an alarming rate. The swim coincided with the New England Aquarium's first white shark sighting of the season, and Pugh was accompanied by safety personnel using a shark deterrent device.</p>

This increase is attributed to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and improvements in Tripadvisor's detection systems. The company uses a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews. Most fake reviews fall into the categories of boosting and member fraud, with paid reviews being a smaller but more concerning category, originating mostly from Asia.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese automakers are declining for the second consecutive day due to concerns about a potential price war and increased regulatory scrutiny. BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares fell significantly after the company announced price cuts on several electric and plug-in hybrid models. China's commerce ministry is reportedly meeting with industry bodies and automakers to address the practice of marking cars as sold to meet targets, which are then resold on the secondhand market. The price cuts are expected to put pressure on BYD's vehicle margin in the short term, although the company hopes to offset the impact through larger sales and lower battery costs.</p>

The recording highlights concerns about the appropriateness of police involvement in abortion cases and the impact on women seeking medical care.

          <p>Elisabeth Moss discusses the ending of "The Handmaid's Tale," highlighting June's evolution from an ordinary woman into a symbol of resistance. Moss, who also directed episodes, emphasizes that the series was always about the women's stories, not just the dystopian setting. The finale shows June beginning to write her memoirs, mirroring the start of Margaret Atwood's book. Moss sees the ending as perfect but not conclusive, noting that the war is not over, and June's journey continues, as well as the series in the form of a sequel.</p>
