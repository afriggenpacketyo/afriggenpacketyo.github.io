          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula generated tsunami waves that reached Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan. While the initial quake caused flooding and evacuations in Russia, subsequent waves led to advisories and minor flooding in Hawaii and along the U.S. coastline. Authorities urged caution, noting that a tsunami is a series of waves and the danger could persist for hours. The event prompted an international response, with multiple Pacific nations issuing alerts and monitoring the situation closely.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed an executive order to end the "de minimis" trade provision for all countries, which previously allowed imported goods valued under $800 to enter the U.S. without duties. This new rule, effective August 29, expands on a previous order that specifically targeted shipments from China and Hong Kong. The move is expected to significantly impact e-commerce retailers like Temu and Shein, which have heavily utilized the loophole to ship cheap products directly to American consumers tax-free. The change aims to level the playing field for domestic retailers.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced a new 50% universal tariff on copper imports, set to take effect on Friday. This measure is the latest in a series of steep import taxes targeting metals, following similar 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum. According to the administration, the primary goals of these tariffs are to bolster domestic industries and correct perceived trade imbalances. The action represents a significant escalation in the administration's protectionist trade policies, aiming to shield American producers from foreign competition.</p>

          <p>In a notable display of internal disagreement, the Federal Reserve voted to maintain its key interest rate, with two governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut. Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller broke from the consensus, arguing for an earlier start to easing monetary policy due to controlled inflation and potential labor market weakening. This represents the first time in over 30 years that multiple governors have voted against the chair's rate decision. The division highlights the growing debate within the central bank over its path forward.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, holding it in the 4.25% to 4.5% range while citing ongoing economic uncertainty. The central bank's rate-setting committee noted that while the labor market remains strong, economic growth moderated in the first half of the year and inflation remains somewhat elevated. This "wait-and-see" approach continues as the Fed assesses the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices. The decision was widely expected by Wall Street and reflects a cautious monetary policy stance.</p>

          <h2>Treasury Secretary Advises Against Panic Over Potential August 1 Tariff Hikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 13:47:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged businesses and international partners not to panic if new trade deals are not finalized by the administration's August 1 deadline. He clarified that failure to reach an agreement would simply revert a country's tariff rate to the higher reciprocal levels announced in April, and that negotiations could continue. Bessent suggested the deadline is a negotiating tactic to pressure countries into accepting new terms, anticipating a "busy August" of trade talks. The statement aims to calm market fears of abrupt economic disruption.</p>

          <p>A significant backlog of nearly 65,500 applications for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Buyback program is preventing eligible public servants from receiving promised student debt relief. The program allows borrowers to make retroactive payments for periods of forbearance to qualify for forgiveness after 10 years of service, but processing has slowed dramatically. Critics attribute the delays to staff reductions at the Department of Education, rendering the program "functionally unavailable." This leaves many borrowers in financial limbo, unable to finalize forgiveness they have already earned.</p>
