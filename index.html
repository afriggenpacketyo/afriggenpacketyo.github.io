        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Commerce Department's latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, showed prices rose at a 2.6% annual rate in July, unchanged from June. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, increased slightly to 2.9%, its highest level since February, driven by a rise in services costs. The report also indicated robust consumer spending, which grew by 0.5%, suggesting economic resilience despite ongoing price pressures. These figures reinforce the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to potential interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace is actively trying to sign two new central defenders before the transfer window closes, a move that is expected to facilitate defender Marc Guehi's potential transfer to Liverpool. While Liverpool and Palace have held talks regarding a £35 million deal, no agreement has been reached, but Palace appears prepared to sell the England international. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, and the club is reluctant to lose him on a free transfer next summer. Palace is reportedly in advanced talks for Toulouse's Jaydee Canvot and has also approached Manchester City for Manuel Akanji.</p>

Decker is wanted on multiple counts of murder and kidnapping after his three young daughters, aged 5, 8, and 9, were found dead in his truck on June 2. Nearly 100 personnel participated in the extensive grid search, covering approximately 250 acres near the Rock Island Campground.

          <p>A session in the Mexican Senate escalated into a physical brawl between two senior politicians following a contentious debate regarding U.S. military involvement in combating drug cartels. The confrontation occurred between Alejandro Moreno of the opposition PRI party and Gerardo Fernández Noroña of the ruling Morena Party. Tensions flared after the Morena party accused opposition lawmakers of supporting U.S. military intervention, a claim they denied. The incident, which was captured on video, has led to accusations of death threats and plans for a criminal complaint and potential expulsion proceedings.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast, it is remembered as one of the costliest and deadliest storms in U.S. history, ultimately causing nearly 1,400 deaths. The catastrophe was exacerbated by the failure of the levees in New Orleans, which led to at least 80% of the city being flooded and a delayed federal response. The storm left a lasting impact, with communities like the Lower Ninth Ward still struggling to recover two decades later. The event highlighted critical failures in infrastructure and disaster response, serving as a stark reminder of the region's vulnerability.</p>

          <p>In response to Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawsuit to block her dismissal, the Trump administration has filed a court response calling her request "meritless." The filing argues that allegations of deceitful conduct regarding mortgages constitute sufficient "cause" for removal and that the President's judgment on this matter is not subject to judicial review. This development is part of a larger conflict where President Trump seeks to exert more control over the central bank. The legal battle is seen as a significant test of the Federal Reserve's traditional independence from political interference.</p>

While overall company revenue slightly missed forecasts, the strong performance in the high-margin cloud sector and a revival in e-commerce have been well-received by investors.

This could encode flawed assumptions about race and gender into clinical tools, similar to how past medical practices led to underdiagnosis in marginalized communities.

          <p>The Israeli military has announced the "initial stages" of its planned offensive into Gaza City, declaring the area a "dangerous combat zone" and suspending daily humanitarian pauses for aid delivery. The expansion of the war comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that the bodies of two hostages, including Ilan Weiss, had been recovered from the enclave. This escalation has drawn widespread international condemnation and protests within Israel from citizens and hostage families, who fear for the safety of those still held by Hamas. The move signals a significant intensification of the nearly two-year-long conflict.</p>

          <h2>Chinese EV Maker BYD Reports Profit Decline as Domestic Price War Offsets Overseas Sales Growth</h2>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has reported a nearly 30% drop in its second-quarter profits compared to the previous year, earning 6.4 billion yuan. The decline is attributed to an intense price war and aggressive marketing in the competitive domestic Chinese market, which has squeezed profit margins. This downturn in profitability occurred despite a massive 145% surge in the company's overseas sales during the same period. The results, which fell short of analyst expectations, highlight the significant challenges even major players like BYD face from fierce competition at home. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While the median price for condominiums in the U.S. has fallen by 2.1% over the past year, they may not represent a true bargain for buyers. An oversupply of condos, particularly in states like Florida and Texas, is driving prices down. However, rising costs for HOA dues, insurance premiums, and new building reserve requirements often offset the lower sticker price. Real estate agents caution that these additional monthly expenses can make the long-term cost of a condo comparable to that of a single-family home. Buyers are advised to scrutinize an association's financials to understand the full cost of ownership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, seeking a temporary restraining order to block his attempt to fire her from the central bank's board. Her lawyers argue the dismissal is illegal and based on "pretextual" allegations concerning a mortgage application made before she joined the Fed. The move is a critical development in Trump's broader effort to exert political control over the traditionally independent Federal Reserve. The case, which is expected to eventually reach the Supreme Court, represents a significant legal test of a president's authority to remove a Fed governor.</p>

          <p>A new book by music journalist Chris DeVille, "Such Great Heights," meticulously documents the "indie rock explosion" of the 2000s. The book traces the genre's evolution from a niche, do-it-yourself movement to a mainstream cultural force, influencing everything from television shows to Super Bowl ads with bands like Grizzly Bear and Modest Mouse. DeVille explores how the internet and music blogs fueled the scene's growth, eventually blurring the lines between "indie" and "mainstream." The review notes the book's elegiac tone, suggesting the era is over, but also reflects on indie's lasting idealistic approach to art.</p>

          <p>The UK government has admitted it did not perform its own cost analysis for the largest reorganization of local councils in England in decades, the BBC has learned. The government's claim that merging councils could save £2.9 billion over five years was based on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting the reorganization could potentially cost money and deliver no savings in certain scenarios. Critics have called it "astonishing" that the government would proceed with such a massive overhaul without commissioning its own independent financial analysis.</p>
