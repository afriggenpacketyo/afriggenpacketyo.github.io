          <p>South Korean prosecutors have indicted former first lady Kim Keon Hee on multiple charges, including bribery, stock manipulation, and violating political funding laws. She is accused of amassing over $720,000 in illicit proceeds through schemes dating back to 2010. The indictment is part of a broader investigation into the administration of her husband, former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached and arrested earlier this year over a controversial martial law declaration. These charges represent a significant development in the ongoing political turmoil that has gripped the nation following Yoon's removal from office.</p>

The meeting, involving ten ministers from each nation, focuses on aligning economic and security policies, with both leaders emphasizing their partnership as central to Europe's future. The council convenes as EU defense and foreign ministers meet separately to discuss bolstering military aid for Ukraine following intense Russian airstrikes. These diplomatic efforts highlight a push for greater European coordination on key issues, including new sanctions against Russia and long-term security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Matt Wright, the star of the Netflix show "Wild Croc Territory," has been found guilty on two counts of perverting the course of justice in Australia. The charges stemmed from the aftermath of a fatal 2022 helicopter crash that killed his co-star, Chris "Willow" Wilson. Prosecutors argued Wright attempted to tamper with evidence, including lying to investigators about fuel levels and pressuring the injured pilot to falsify records, out of fear he would be blamed for the crash. Wright, who was not on board the helicopter, has been released on bail and has indicated his intention to appeal the verdict.</p>

          <p>The United States has ended its "de minimis" exemption, which previously allowed parcels valued under $800 to enter the country tax-free. This policy change is causing significant disruption for small UK businesses, many of which rely on the American market for a substantial portion of their sales. Firms are now grappling with unpredictable new costs, potential price hikes for customers, and logistical confusion, leading some to halt US shipments altogether. The Federation of Small Businesses has warned that this creates new barriers for smaller companies trying to compete internationally, prompting calls for more government support.</p>

          <p>A major Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv has killed at least 23 people, including four children, and left dozens more wounded. The bombardment, described as the deadliest on the capital since July, destroyed a five-story residential building where most of the victims were found. The European Union's diplomatic mission and the nearby British Council office were also damaged in the strikes, drawing strong condemnation from European leaders.

In the United States, the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, is also due for release. This comes after recent comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell increased expectations for an interest rate cut in September. Despite a largely negative week influenced by French political issues and questions over Fed independence, the regional Stoxx 600 index is on track for its second consecutive monthly gain.

          <p>Researchers in China have developed and successfully tested a new vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone that bears a striking resemblance to the "Gimbal" unidentified aerial phenomenon filmed by US Navy pilots in 2015. The experimental aircraft features a radical aerodynamic design with an elliptical, ring-like wing integrated with a central wing section, which could enhance flight endurance and stability. Unlike conventional drones, its four rotors are mounted at the junctions of the elliptical wings and vertical stabilizers. This innovative design represents a potential leap forward in uncrewed flight technology, moving a mysterious shape from speculation into reality.</p>

Health officials hope the program will protect children from severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work to care for sick children.

          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has filed a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This new referral alleges she made misrepresentations on government ethics forms regarding a condominium in Massachusetts, which she reportedly claimed as both a "Second Home" on a mortgage application and an "investment/rental property" on ethics filings. This action follows an earlier referral concerning other properties and comes as Cook is suing President Trump to block his attempt to fire her from the Federal Reserve Board, escalating the conflict between the White House and the central bank.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Authorities have revealed that the individual who attacked a church in Minneapolis, killing two children and injuring 18 others, was "obsessed with the idea of killing children." Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara stated that the attacker, Robin Westman, did not appear to have a specific motive but expressed hatred towards many groups and sought notoriety. The suspect, who previously attended the church's school, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Investigators found that the attacker left behind notes and had written anti-religious and anti-political messages on the legally purchased firearms used in the assault.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year, have asked a federal judge to bar senior Trump administration officials from making "baseless public attacks" against him. The motion claims that officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, have made false and inflammatory statements calling him a gang member and predator, thereby violating his right to a fair trial. Abrego Garcia was recently released from pre-trial custody on human smuggling charges, only to be detained again by ICE for potential deportation. His lawyers argue the government's public campaign will taint any potential jury pool.</p>

          <p>Four senior officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have resigned following the recent firing of Director Susan Monarez. Among them, Chief Science Officer Dr. Debra Houry and immunization head Dr. Demetre Daskalakis cited growing political interference, particularly regarding vaccine policy and the suppression of scientific data that did not align with the administration's agenda. They expressed concern that decisions were being made without scientific backing and that their ability to protect public health was being compromised. The officials stated their resignations were intended to "raise the alarm" about the direction of the agency.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber became the 21st player in Major League Baseball history to hit four home runs in a single game. He accomplished the rare feat during a 19-4 victory against Atlanta, finishing the night with a team-record nine RBIs. The performance propelled Schwarber into the outright lead for home runs in the National League with 49 and brought him to within one of the major league leader. He is the first Phillies player to hit four homers in a game since Mike Schmidt in 1976 and the third MLB player to do so this season.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court is set to rule on the future of suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, a decision that could plunge the country into political turmoil. The case centers on accusations of poor ethical standards following a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader, Hun Sen, which some lawmakers claim undermined the Thai military. If the court removes Paetongtarn from office, she would be the fifth prime minister ousted by the court in 17 years, leaving the nation without a clear leader. The verdict comes just weeks after a ceasefire ended deadly border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia.</p>

          <p>The Colton Police Department in California has reopened its investigation into the 2010 death of four-year-old Timothy Thomas, following the recent arrest of leaders from a Hemet-based religious group. At the time of his death, the boy was in the temporary custody of Pastor Darryl Muzic Martin and his wife, Shelly Bailey Martin, who lead His Way Spirit Led Assemblies. The couple was arrested in August in connection with the separate suspicious disappearance of a former group member. This new development connects the alleged cult-like group to a second missing person and now a historical child death case.</p>

          <p>The White House has named Jim O'Neill, a deputy to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The appointment comes amid a deepening standoff with ousted director Susan Monarez, whose lawyers contend she will not leave her post unless formally dismissed by President Trump himself. O'Neill, a former investment executive with ties to tech investor Peter Thiel, lacks a medical or scientific background. His selection follows the resignations of four other senior CDC leaders who protested what they described as political interference and the spread of misinformation.</p>

          <p>The UK government has instructed contractor Mitie to remove several job advertisements for an immigration removal center near Heathrow Airport. The roles, which included tutors for floristry, cake decorating, and "ballooncraft," as well as a gym manager, drew public criticism and were labeled "indefensible" by the opposition. Home Office Minister Seema Malhotra stated that the government did not believe all the roles were necessary. The contractor, Mitie, defended the positions, citing a recent inspection report that found such activities helped detainees manage the stresses of detention at the facility, which has previously been criticized for its poor conditions.</p>
