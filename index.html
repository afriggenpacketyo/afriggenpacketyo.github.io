          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 01:26:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges related to the employment of his former son-in-law at a Thai airline. Prosecutors allege that Moon's son-in-law received significant compensation from the airline, which they consider a bribe paid by a South Korean businessman and former lawmaker, Lee Sang-jik, who controlled the airline. Lee purportedly favored Moon's family by appointing the son-in-law to an executive position despite his lack of qualifications, leading to this indictment. This marks another instance of a former South Korean leader facing criminal investigation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the United States has no specific currency targets in trade negotiations with Japan, amidst ongoing tariff talks. This statement comes ahead of a meeting with Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato, where currency policy is expected to be a key discussion point. Bessent emphasized that the U.S. expects Japan to adhere to the G7 agreement on currency valuation, while also addressing trade deficits, non-tariff barriers, and government subsidies. The Trump administration has prioritized negotiations with Japan, urging them to increase their financial contributions to host U.S. troops.</p>

          <p>The WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi vaccine alliance have jointly issued a warning about a global increase in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, meningitis, and yellow fever. They attribute this rise to funding cuts, misinformation, and humanitarian crises. Measles cases have seen a significant increase, and there's concern about a rise in children missing routine vaccinations, which threatens progress made over the past five decades. Gavi is seeking substantial funding to protect millions of children in vulnerable countries from these diseases, especially amid global health funding cuts and other crises.</p>

          <p>Victims of violent crimes are campaigning for the implementation of restricted zones where individuals convicted of murder, manslaughter, or stalking offenses would be required to live after being released from prison. These advocates argue that current exclusion zones around victims' homes are insufficient and that perpetrators should have their movements restricted to specific areas to ensure public safety. Some experts, however, raise concerns that such measures could infringe on the human rights of offenders, specifically their right to liberty and private life, as enshrined in the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jeffrey Frankel, a Harvard professor and former economic advisor, assesses the probability of a U.S. recession, citing indicators like an inverted yield curve, declining consumer confidence, and prediction market data. He notes that while these indicators suggest an increased risk, they are not guarantees. Frankel places the odds of a U.S. recession as high as 60% for the coming year, influenced by factors like Trump's tariffs and global economic uncertainty. He suggests that while official confirmation may lag, current data indicates a significant risk of economic downturn.</p>
