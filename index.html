          <p>A New York Times article reports that members of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's board engaged in a heated email exchange after a Biden appointee, Kevin Abel, criticized the museum's silence regarding President Trump's dismissal of Biden appointees. Abel invoked the Holocaust, stating the museum's silence echoed the dangers of not speaking out against hatred and retribution. Other board members responded with varying degrees of support and criticism, leading to a broader discussion about the museum's role in addressing political issues. Stuart E. Eizenstat, the board chair, cautioned against communications that could harm the museum, but the debate continued among members.</p>

          <p>This Yahoo! News article discusses a new study showing that chimpanzees drum with regular rhythm when they beat on tree trunks, indicating a form of ancient communication. Scientists believe that the ability to produce rhythm predates humans. Chimpanzees use drumming as a way of socially checking in and each chimp has its own individual signature, or pattern of beats. The research also showed that chimps from different regions of Africa drum with distinctly different rhythms.</p>

          <p>This Vox article analyzes whether focusing on climate change is an effective strategy for Democrats to win over Trump voters. While young voters are more concerned about climate change, it is not a top priority for most voters, including young ones.

          <p>This BBC article reports that the UK government has insisted that hormone-treated beef will not enter the UK market following the tariff deal agreed this week that boosts the trade in beef in both directions. The article notes that the UK stopped allowing hormone-produced beef in 1989. The government said that certification procedures and border checks would ensure hormone-reared beef would not enter the UK. Some farmers and consumers have expressed fears that the deal could open the door to beef from cattle raised using hormones to boost their growth.</p>

          <p>This BBC article reports that two men have been found guilty of criminal damage for cutting down the world-famous Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland. The tree had grown in a dip on Hadrian's Wall for more than 100 years before it was cut down in a "moronic mission". The article details the outrage caused by the felling of the tree and the men's attempts to blame each other. The article also mentions that 49 saplings grown from the tree are set to be distributed to charities and organisations across the country.</p>
