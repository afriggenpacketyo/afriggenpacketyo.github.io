          <p>Economic data shows that consumer prices rose by 3% annually in September, slightly below forecasts. The report, released during a government shutdown, is crucial for determining Social Security adjustments. Economists note that while tariffs are contributing to rising prices, the Federal Reserve is also weighing a slowing job market. Consequently, markets still widely expect an interest rate cut at the Fed's upcoming meeting to support employment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the 2018 Supreme Court decision that legalized sports gambling, the industry has exploded, generating billions in revenue through accessible mobile apps. However, this rapid growth has revived long-held fears about the integrity of professional sports, as evidenced by recent federal indictments against current and former NBA figures for involvement in betting schemes. The prevalence of "micro-betting" on small in-game events further increases the risk of corruption and problem gambling, posing significant social and financial costs.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United forward Anthony Gordon has been a standout performer in the Champions League, scoring in three consecutive games and earning man-of-the-match honors. However, his European success contrasts sharply with his domestic form, where he has yet to score or assist in the Premier League this season. Manager Eddie Howe and Gordon himself acknowledge the challenge of translating his big-game performances to consistent weekly output. The 24-year-old's ability to find this consistency is seen as key for both his and the club's ambitions.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a termination of all trade negotiations with Canada, a decision he attributed to an ad campaign by the province of Ontario. The advertisement featured archival audio of former President Ronald Reagan speaking out against the economic harm caused by tariffs. The Reagan Foundation criticized the ad for using the audio without permission, a point Trump highlighted in his social media post. This move escalates trade tensions between the two closely linked economic partners.</p>

The presence of colossal species like the Alamosaurus suggests that these creatures were flourishing right up until their abrupt extinction. While significant, experts note this is evidence from one location and more global research is needed.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing controversy surrounding his connection to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew's banner of arms has been removed from St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. The banner was associated with his membership in the Order of the Garter, a prestigious chivalric order he relinquished last week. This action follows his decision to stop using his royal titles and comes as he faces increasing pressure over his privileges, including his residence at Royal Lodge. The scrutiny intensified following the posthumous publication of a memoir by Virginia Giuffre.</p>

The current Labour government has been accused of weakening the case, but this letter suggests the assessment of China as a non-"enemy" predated their term.

          <p>This opinion piece contends that President Trump has transformed the Department of Justice and the FBI into instruments for a systematic campaign of political retribution. The author cites the firing of officials deemed disloyal, the prosecution of political opponents, and the pardoning of allies as evidence of a routine and institutionalized injustice. The article references a lawsuit by former FBI officials and the resignations of numerous federal prosecutors to argue that the rule of law is being subverted in favor of personal loyalty to the president.

          <p>This article explains how the U.S. income and estate tax systems, originally designed to be progressive, are no longer effectively taxing the nation's wealthiest individuals. Many billionaires avoid income taxes by taking minimal or no salary, instead building wealth through untaxed stock appreciation and using those assets as collateral for loans. The estate tax has been weakened by loopholes, allowing for the vast intergenerational transfer of wealth. This dynamic creates a system where the "working rich" pay high tax rates on their salaries while the "plutocratic rich" can legally circumvent the system.</p>

Smerk told investigators he had an uncontrollable compulsion to kill and chose his victim at random, expressing no remorse for the crime. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 70 years, bringing a long-awaited but painful closure to the victim's family.</p>

          <p>The experience of being a bridesmaid has transformed from a simple honor into a costly and time-consuming commitment, a phenomenon dubbed "bridesmaid inflation." Modern bridal party duties often involve expensive destination bachelorette parties, costly dresses, and numerous other expenses that can total thousands of dollars per wedding. This financial pressure is causing many young people, particularly Gen Z and Millennials, to make significant financial sacrifices, including on housing. The article explores the social pressure to participate and questions the sustainability of a wedding culture that places such heavy demands on friends.</p>

          <p>A recent robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where thieves stole jewels valued at approximately $102 million, has been described as both a "terrible failure" by officials and a thrilling, quintessentially French caper by others. The burglars exploited a significant security oversight in the Apollo Gallery, which was monitored by only a single, poorly angled outdoor camera. While fleeing, the thieves left behind a trail of equipment and DNA evidence, suggesting a less-than-perfect execution. The article argues that such crimes, while embarrassing for the institution, often increase the fame and public fascination with the stolen artworks.</p>

          <p>The French government, led by Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu, is facing a potential no-confidence vote over its 2026 budget bill. The Socialist party, a key swing group in the divided parliament, has threatened to vote down the government unless it includes a new tax on the country's wealthiest individuals. The proposed "Zucman tax" would levy a 2% minimum tax on those with assets over 100 million euros. The government has so far refused this demand, creating a political standoff that jeopardizes the passage of its austerity-focused budget.</p>

          <p>The total assets managed by the global hedge fund industry have reached a historic high of nearly $5 trillion, according to a new report from Hedge Fund Research. This growth was driven by the largest quarterly net inflow of new capital from investors in 18 years, combined with strong investment returns during the third quarter. The industry's main composite index gained 5.4% in the quarter, buoyed by successful bets on technology, artificial intelligence, and rising M&A activity. Analysts expect institutional investors to continue allocating capital to hedge funds to navigate geopolitical and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have dismantled a sophisticated, mafia-operated gambling scheme that allegedly cheated victims out of at least $7 million in high-stakes poker games. The plot involved luring wealthy individuals to games with the promise of playing alongside celebrities and professional athletes, including NBA coach Chauncey Billups. The conspirators allegedly used advanced technology like X-ray tables, pre-marked cards, and hidden cameras to ensure their targets could not win. This investigation also led to arrests in a related scheme where NBA players are accused of faking injuries to influence betting odds.</p>

          <p>German law enforcement is grappling with a significant increase in the trafficking and production of synthetic drugs. In 2024, police seized over 1,800 kilograms of new psychoactive substances, more than triple the amount from the previous year, with ketamine and potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl derivatives becoming major concerns. Officials warn that criminal labs are producing tons of these substances in short periods, adapting smuggling routes and methods. This drug crisis is one of several challenges facing the country, alongside economic issues like chip shortages impacting the auto industry.</p>

          <p>A Republican member of Georgia's state election board, Janice Johnston, is the beneficiary of an online fundraiser that accepts anonymous donations, raising ethics concerns. The campaign was established by a local election official who has ties to the "election integrity" movement and has business before the state board. Watchdog groups argue this creates a significant conflict of interest, as individuals with cases before the board have publicly donated to Johnston's legal defense fund. The situation highlights ongoing controversy and loss of public trust surrounding the board's actions since the 2020 election.</p>
