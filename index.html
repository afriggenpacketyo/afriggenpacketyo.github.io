          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed global business leaders at the Milken Institute Global Conference, urging them to invest in the United States despite concerns over President Trump's trade policies. Bessent defended the administration's economic agenda, emphasizing tax cuts and deregulation as catalysts for job creation and output. He reassured investors that tariffs are designed to encourage direct investment in the U.S., promising a favorable tax and regulatory environment. However, business leaders expressed unease about the tariffs' impact, with some delaying investments and preparing for economic headwinds, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the administration's approach.

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA following continued disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, which saw over 500 flights impacted on Sunday and dozens more delayed or cancelled on Monday. Schumer cited a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, DOGE-related cuts at the FAA, and outdated technology as contributing factors to the ongoing problems. He also questioned the FAA's decision to offer bonuses to air traffic controllers at select towers, excluding those in Washington, Philadelphia, and New York, which are facing the greatest need. The delays and cancellations at Newark are having a ripple effect on airports across the country, prompting calls for urgent action to address the staffing shortages and modernize the air traffic control system.</p>

The second dinner offers access to Trump's inner circle to holders of the $TRUMP token, with entry based on the number of tokens held.

          <p>Small business owners are expressing concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariff agenda, with many fearing for their survival. The uncertainty around tariffs is making it difficult for them to set prices that can absorb the cost of new duties on imports without deterring customers. Some businesses are already experiencing sharp price increases on imported goods, forcing them to raise prices and potentially lose customers. The situation is particularly challenging for small businesses that lack the resources to stockpile inventory ahead of tariff implementation, leading to job losses and potential closures.</p>

          <p>Jury selection has commenced in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs in New York, where the hip-hop mogul faces accusations of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and transporting individuals for prostitution.

Combs' attorney acknowledges his client is not a perfect person, citing issues with drug use and toxic relationships, but insists all sexual activity was consensual. The trial is expected to last at least six weeks and will not be televised, with an anonymous jury selected to ensure impartiality.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is set to implement a program offering $1,000 stipends and travel assistance to immigrants who agree to self-deport.

The program requires immigrants to use the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's "Home" app, with the stipend paid only after their arrival in their country of origin is confirmed.

          <p>For homeowners seeking affordable borrowing options, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may seem appealing due to its lower rates compared to credit cards and personal loans. However, qualifying for a HELOC in the current economic climate involves navigating a more cautious approval process. Lenders typically look for sufficient home equity (at least 15% to 20%), a strong credit score (620 or higher), a low debt-to-income ratio (ideally below 43%), and stable income and employment history. Borrowers can improve their chances of approval by checking their credit report, lowering their DTI ratio, shopping around for lenders, and considering a co-applicant.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a new plan for a "forceful entry" into Gaza, involving the deployment of tens of thousands of additional soldiers and the relocation of Palestinians to the south.

Critics argue that the expanded military campaign would endanger the hostages' lives and fail to fundamentally alter the conflict's dynamics. The Israeli government claims the offensive is intended to increase pressure on Hamas to release the hostages and destroy its infrastructure, while also implementing a new mechanism for distributing humanitarian aid.</p>

While Harvard President Alan Garber has undertaken reforms, the roots of the problem go far deeper, reflecting widespread attitudes among students, faculty, and staff.
