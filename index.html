          <p>A man has been sentenced to a minimum of 28 years in prison for murdering his estranged wife in Bradford, UK. The attack, described by the judge as "vicious and merciless," occurred in broad daylight as the victim, Kulsuma Akter, was pushing their infant son in a pram. Masum stabbed her 26 times, and the court heard the wounds were intentionally unsurvivable. The child was unharmed in the incident, which took place while Ms. Akter was living in a women's refuge.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 07:11:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The estimated cost for constructing the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk has escalated to £38 billion, a significant increase from the previous £20 billion figure. This rise is attributed to inflation and risk factors not included in earlier estimates and is expected to add about £1 per month to household energy bills during its decade-long construction. The UK government confirmed it will hold a 44.9% stake, alongside investments from companies like Centrica, with the plant anticipated to be operational in the mid-to-late 2030s. Critics have condemned the soaring costs, while proponents highlight the project's potential to create jobs and generate power for six million homes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has exceeded Wall Street's second-quarter expectations for both earnings and revenue, driven by robust demand in its European markets. The beverage company reported an adjusted earnings per share of 87 cents against an expected 83 cents, with adjusted revenue reaching $12.62 billion. This strong performance helped to counterbalance weaker sales volumes in other global regions. Following the positive results, Coca-Cola has narrowed its full-year earnings forecast to the upper end of its previously stated range, signaling confidence in its continued performance.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Labor is proposing to repeal or rewrite over 60 workplace regulations, a move the department claims will reduce burdensome rules and stimulate economic growth. The proposed changes would impact a wide range of areas, including minimum wage requirements for home health care workers, safety standards at construction sites and mines, and protections for migrant farmworkers. Critics, such as the AFL-CIO, argue these rollbacks would significantly increase the risk of injury and death for workers, with a disproportionate impact on women and minority groups. The proposals are now entering a public comment period before they can be finalized.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies secured a highly unusual 3-2 walk-off win against the Boston Red Sox due to a catcher's interference call. With the bases loaded in the tenth inning, Phillies batter Edmundo Sosa's bat made contact with the catcher's glove during a checked swing. This automatically awarded Sosa first base, forcing the winning run to score from third. This rare ending marks only the second time a Major League Baseball game has concluded on a walk-off catcher's interference since 1969, providing a crucial victory for the Phillies in their divisional race.</p>

The author also points to the federalization of the California National Guard against the governor's wishes and attempts to coerce Maine over its policies on transgender athletes.

          <p>Despite a period of close cooperation during joint airstrikes on Iran, the relationship between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly showing signs of strain. Recent points of contention include Israel's bombing of a Catholic church in Gaza and its unilateral military actions in Syria, which have conflicted with the Trump administration's diplomatic efforts to normalize relations with Syria's new government. An administration official described Netanyahu's actions as undermining U.S. policy goals in the region. This divergence suggests a return to previous tensions and complicates the U.S. goal of reducing its military footprint in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Despite being 99% effective at preventing HIV through sexual contact, the pre-exposure prophylaxis drug, known as PrEP, is taken by only about a third of the 1.2 million Americans who could benefit from it.

Stark disparities exist, with only 13% of at-risk Black people and 24% of at-risk Hispanic people using PrEP, compared to 94% of at-risk White people.

The union argues that the plan to minimize cancellations of routine procedures will overstretch the senior doctors who are covering for their striking colleagues. Dr. Emma Runswick, BMA deputy leader, stated this approach could lead to last-minute cancellations and, in the worst-case scenario, patient harm. This new NHS England policy marks a shift from previous strikes, where non-urgent care was widely rescheduled to ensure emergency services remained safely staffed.</p>

The author, citing a new report, notes that this spending enriches military companies and subsidizes underperforming weapons systems while key needs of military personnel and veterans are underfunded. The piece criticizes the focus on high-tech "miracle weapons" and the influence of both traditional and emerging tech firms on defense policy. It advocates for a strategy that prioritizes diplomacy, well-compensated troops, and reduced influence from corporate special interests in defense spending decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Courts Should Recognize Patient-Physician Privilege to Protect Transgender Healthcare</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that federal courts should establish a legal privilege for patient-physician communications related to transgender and reproductive healthcare. The authors contend that this is necessary to protect patients and doctors from government overreach, such as the recent subpoenas from the Attorney General targeting providers of care for transgender youth. While HIPAA offers some privacy protection, it does not shield information from legal subpoenas. The article suggests that by creating a privilege similar to attorney-client or spousal privilege, courts can shield sensitive medical data and prevent the chilling effect of such government investigations on essential healthcare.</p>

          <p>To better track air quality during post-fire reconstruction, UCLA researchers have deployed a new network of 20 air pollution monitors in northwest Los Angeles County. The sensors, located in areas from Topanga State Park to Santa Monica, are specifically designed to measure both fine and coarse airborne particles (PM 2.5 and PM 10) that can be kicked up by construction. The network provides real-time, hyperlocal data on a public online map, addressing a gap in existing monitoring systems which often don't track the larger PM 10 particles. This initiative aims to help residents make informed decisions about outdoor activities.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Northwestern University have developed a small, wireless device to help address a common anxiety for new mothers: knowing how much milk their baby is consuming during breastfeeding. The flexible electronic sensor, worn on the mother's breast, measures the volume of milk flow in real time by detecting changes in electrical currents in the breast tissue. The data is sent to a smartphone app, providing immediate feedback and reassurance to parents. Currently in development, the device aims to reduce the stress and uncertainty that can lead some mothers to abandon breastfeeding prematurely.</p>

          <p>Paying for parking in the Los Angeles area has become an increasingly complicated and frustrating experience for many drivers. A proliferation of different payment methods across various municipalities—including coins, credit cards, and multiple competing smartphone apps like Park Smarter and ParkMobile—has created a confusing patchwork system. Drivers report encountering jammed coin slots, unreadable QR codes, and the inconvenience of having to download a new app for each city. Experts suggest that the region is in a transitional phase and that a more standardized, streamlined system, similar to those in Europe, would greatly reduce driver frustration and improve compliance.</p>

Tingirides will become the assistant chief overseeing patrol operations, making her the highest-ranking Black woman in the department's history.
