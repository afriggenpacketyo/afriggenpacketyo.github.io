          <h2>Cameroon Faces Overlooked Refugee Crisis Amidst Ongoing Conflicts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 02:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report highlights Cameroon as facing the world's most neglected displacement crisis, marked by insufficient political and media attention, as well as underfunding. Over 1.1 million people are internally displaced, with an additional 480,000 refugees seeking shelter from neighboring countries. Cameroon is grappling with two major conflicts: a civil war in the western regions driven by secessionist movements and Islamist militant activity in the Lake Chad region. The lack of renewed political, humanitarian, and media attention suggests a bleak outlook for Cameroon in 2025, compounded by budget cuts in development and humanitarian aid from major Western countries. The current global military spending far outweighs the funds needed to address humanitarian crises, underscoring a solvable problem given sufficient political will.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to directly pay their athletes, marking a significant shift in collegiate sports. The settlement includes provisions for schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and allocates $2.7 billion to compensate former players who were previously barred from receiving revenue. Payouts will vary based on the sport and career length, with some football and basketball players potentially receiving up to $135,000 each, while the highest payouts could reach nearly $2 million for lost NIL opportunities. This decision resolves three antitrust cases challenging NCAA compensation rules dating back to 2016, addressing claims that these rules denied athletes the opportunity to earn money from their names, images, and likenesses.</p>

          <p>Iran has strongly criticized the US travel ban affecting Iranians and citizens of 11 other predominantly Middle Eastern and African nations, labeling it a manifestation of a "racist mentality." The executive order, signed by Donald Trump, revives restrictions reminiscent of his initial travel ban, citing national security concerns following a firebomb attack at a pro-Israel rally. An Iranian foreign ministry official asserted that the policy violates international law and deprives millions of their right to travel based on nationality or religion. The US ban targets nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, with partial bans on travelers from seven additional countries. This policy, perceived as discriminatory, is expected to strain relations between Iran and the US further, especially given the large Iranian community residing in the United States.</p>

          <p>Muhammed Asif Hafeez, outwardly a successful businessman and polo club ambassador, lived a double life as a major international drug trafficker. While cultivating an image of respectability and even providing information to authorities about rival gangs, Hafeez orchestrated a vast drug empire, distributing heroin, methamphetamine, and hashish worldwide. His operations, based in Pakistan and India, were managed from his UK residence until a joint British and American operation led to his extradition in 2023. Hafeez has been sentenced to 16 years in a New York prison for conspiring to import drugs into the US, marking the end of his reign as "the Sultan" of the underworld. The BBC investigation reveals how Hafeez managed to evade detection for so long and the circumstances that eventually led to his capture.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been returned to the United States to face smuggling charges. The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia was involved in smuggling undocumented migrants into the US between 2016 and earlier this year. His lawyer has denounced the charges as "fantastical" and politically motivated, arguing that the Trump administration is using the case to justify its strict immigration policies. Abrego Garcia's case has become a symbol of the tensions between the Trump administration and the judiciary, as he was initially deported despite a judge's order granting him protection from deportation.</p>

Galerie Kraemer is also accused of deception by gross negligence for selling some of the chairs.

          <p>Despite the Pentagon and NASA's reliance on Elon Musk's companies, President Trump has options to exert pressure on the tech entrepreneur, potentially tightening federal oversight of his businesses. This could involve increased scrutiny and regulatory measures, even if terminating federal contracts proves impractical. The move reflects ongoing tensions between the administration and Musk, despite their past collaborations.</p>

          <p>A man discovered that he had been swapped at birth in a hospital nearly 80 years ago, solving a long-standing family joke about his lack of resemblance to his parents. Matthew, the man's son, initiated a search into his family history during the pandemic, leading to a DNA test that revealed unexpected relatives. The discovery highlights the era before standardized identification practices in hospitals, when babies were often cared for in nurseries and identified only by cards on their cots. The BBC reports there are now five known cases of babies mistakenly switched in maternity wards from the late 1940s to the 1960s.</p>
