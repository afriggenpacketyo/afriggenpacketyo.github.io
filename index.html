          <p>The White House announced President Donald Trump has dismissed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez after her refusal to resign, with a replacement expected soon. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated Trump's authority to remove officials not aligned with his mission, a move that follows Monarez's lawyers asserting only the President could fire her. This action comes amidst a leadership upheaval at the CDC and reported disagreements between Monarez and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over vaccine policy. The agency is also grappling with the aftermath of an attack on its Atlanta headquarters.</p>

Two children, aged 8 and 10, died in the attack, and 17 others were injured, including Sophia and three parishioners in their 80s.

          <p>The UK Department for Transport has unveiled the initial electric vehicles qualifying for a £3,750 government discount, aiming to boost EV adoption. Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier are among the first, with 26 other models receiving a £1,500 discount, applicable to new cars up to £37,000. This grant scheme, funded by £650m over three years, seeks to make EVs more competitive with petrol and diesel cars, aligning with the 2030 ban on new fossil fuel car sales. Despite the incentives, upfront costs and insufficient charging infrastructure remain key concerns for many drivers.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawsuit against Donald Trump primarily contests his authority to remove her, focusing on the "for cause" requirement of the Federal Reserve Act. The complaint briefly dismisses mortgage fraud allegations as "unsubstantiated and unproven" and a pretext for Trump's desire to influence the Fed. Legal experts note that avoiding detailed refutation of the fraud claims is a common strategy to avoid legitimizing them. The case's outcome could redefine the legal standard for removing Fed officials and impact the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>Mexican senators engaged in a physical altercation following a heated debate concerning alleged opposition calls for U.S. military intervention against drug cartels. Opposition PRI party leader Alejandro Moreno confronted Senate president Gerardo Fernandez Norona, escalating into shoves and a slap. The brawl underscores intense political divisions, particularly regarding President Donald Trump's directive for the Pentagon to consider military force against cartels, a move Mexico has firmly rejected. Both senators involved are also facing separate corruption and ethics controversies.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, Chair Jerome Powell, and the Fed's Board of Governors, seeking to prevent her removal from the central bank. Trump cited mortgage fraud allegations as "cause" for termination, a move Cook's legal team argues is unlawful and a pretext for policy disagreements, given Fed board members can only be removed "for cause." The suit, filed in federal court, sets up a significant legal challenge that could reach the Supreme Court, highlighting critical questions about the Federal Reserve's independence from political influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For many Americans, Social Security is a crucial source of retirement income, with a significant portion of older beneficiaries relying on it for half or more of their income. To boost future checks, individuals can delay claiming benefits past their full retirement age, increasing their monthly payout by 8% for each year deferred up to age 70. Continuing to work longer helps by replacing lower-earning years in the 35-year calculation, and married couples can strategically coordinate spousal benefits to maximize lifetime income. Supplementing Social Security with annuities, reverse mortgages, or a diversified retirement portfolio can further enhance financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has requested the Naval Station Great Lakes near Chicago to assist with immigration operations, signaling a broader crackdown on Democratic-run "sanctuary cities" by the Trump administration. The Department of Homeland Security sought facilities and logistical support for its operations, similar to actions taken in Los Angeles. This follows President Trump's recent federal takeover of Washington D.C., deploying the National Guard and intensifying immigration raids. Illinois leaders, including Senator Tammy Duckworth and Governor JB Pritzker, have strongly opposed the potential deployment, calling it unwarranted, illegal, and an abuse of power.</p>

          <p>An Amish woman, Ruth R. Miller, 40, has been charged with two counts of aggravated murder after allegedly throwing her 4-year-old son, Vincen, into an Ohio lake to prove her "worthiness to God." Authorities stated Miller believed she was acting under divine direction. This tragedy followed the apparent drowning of her husband, Marcus J. Miller, hours earlier in a similar "test of faith." The couple's other three children were also directed to perform water-based trials but survived. Family and church members attribute these events to mental illness, and Miller is currently receiving treatment at a mental health facility.</p>

          <p>Mexico is reportedly preparing to increase tariffs on Chinese imports, including automobiles, textiles, and plastics, as part of its 2026 budget proposal. This potential trade shift comes at the urging of the U.S., aligning with President Donald Trump's "Fortress North America" initiative to reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains. Trump has previously criticized "loopholes" in the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement that allow Chinese goods to enter the U.S., specifically warning against Chinese carmakers building plants in Mexico for export to the U.S. The move could significantly impact Mexico's trade relations, as China accounts for nearly one-fifth of its total imports.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a faster-than-anticipated 3.3% annualized rate in the second quarter, revised up from an initial 3.0% estimate. This growth was driven by stronger consumer spending and business activity, despite the volatility introduced by President Donald Trump's tariffs. Net exports contributed significantly, adding nearly 5 percentage points to the GDP total, influenced by companies stockpiling ahead of tariff announcements. While the economy is expected to continue at a slower pace, the robust Q2 performance indicates resilience. Inflation estimates remained largely consistent with the Federal Reserve's goals.

The club has invested heavily in attacking players this summer, and the defeat marks the first time United has lost to fourth-tier opposition.

Border tsar Tom Homan confirmed the reduction, though he defended the facility's conditions and medical services. The center, opened in July to support mass deportations, faced legal challenges over poor conditions and environmental damage. While the judge's ruling is a setback for the Trump administration's deportation drive, other temporary facilities are being built in Republican-led states, and Homan emphasized the need for permanent infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Florida's South Florida Water Management District is deploying 120 robot rabbits in the Everglades as a novel strategy to lure and remove invasive Burmese pythons. These solar-powered robots mimic real rabbits by emitting heat, scent, and movement, monitored by cameras to alert contractors when a python is detected. Pythons, which have decimated native species and have no natural predators, are a severe environmental threat, with populations potentially reaching 300,000. This innovative, though costly, project aims to improve detection rates, a major challenge in controlling the species, and initial results are promising.</p>

          <p>New extreme floods across the U.S. highlight the critical need for advanced weather forecasting, yet the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts and staffing freezes threaten NOAA's ability to predict and prepare for such events. NOAA scientists have spent over a decade improving precipitation forecasting and developing flood-inundation maps, but reduced funding could dismantle research arms and shrink the National Weather Service. Experts warn that hobbling NOAA limits the nation's capacity to forecast increasingly severe precipitation events, especially as aging infrastructure is ill-equipped to handle them. This creates a "double whammy" of escalating natural disasters and diminished preparedness.</p>
