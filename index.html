        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a mainland Chinese military magazine, China's developing sixth-generation fighter, unofficially called the J-36, could potentially block airspace up to 1,000km from the Chinese coast, posing challenges to US forces in a conflict over Taiwan. The article suggests this fighter could intercept US warplanes and suppress air defenses of bases in Guam for one to two hours. This development is aimed at countering the US B-21 stealth bomber and could impact the US Navy and Air Force's air superiority in the Western Pacific. Both the US and China are developing sixth-generation fighters, with the B-21 Raider having already completed its maiden flight.</p>

          <p>Autism researchers and advocates are expressing strong opposition to a proposed national autism database, citing potential misuse and ethical concerns. While the HHS denies it's a registry, the agency confirmed a "real-world data platform" to link existing datasets for research into autism. Critics worry about privacy, security, and the potential for increased stigma and eugenics. Concerns include the lack of informed consent, potential for discrimination, and the aggressive timeline for research results. Most experts agree that research should be done with the consent of those on the research team and should find ways to support those with autism.</p>

          <p>The deadline for Americans to obtain a Real ID is approaching on May 7th, requiring individuals over 18 to possess one for domestic air travel and access to federal facilities. Dozens of states are behind on compliance, with New Jersey having the lowest rate. A Real ID is a state-issued license or ID card with a black or gold star, while five states offer Enhanced IDs as an alternative. Travelers without a Real ID should arrive three hours early at the airport, and passports are still accepted for travel. Enhanced IDs also allow land and sea travel to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean without a passport.</p>

          <h2>Trump Proposes 100% Tariffs on Foreign Movies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 05:34:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the US, citing concerns about the decline of the American film industry. He blamed incentives offered by other countries for attracting filmmakers and studios, describing it as a "National Security threat". The move could significantly impact the industry, particularly in destinations like the UK and Canada. The UK media union Bectu warned the tariffs could "deal a knock-out blow" to the industry. It is unclear whether the tariff would apply to American production companies producing films abroad. The governments of Australia and New Zealand have spoken out in support of their countries' film industries.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas in Gaza, potentially including capturing and holding territory. The Israeli military has called up tens of thousands of reservists, aiming to increase pressure on Hamas. Reportedly, the cabinet also approved a plan to resume humanitarian aid deliveries through private companies, ending a two-month blockade. The UN and other aid agencies have expressed concerns about the plan, stating that it would be a breach of basic humanitarian principles. Critics say this is a failed strategy, as none of the 59 remaining hostages has been freed since the offensive resumed six weeks ago.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing tensions in the US-China trade war, some strategists remain optimistic about the Chinese economy. While progress in striking a trade deal may be slow, China is seen as well-positioned to cushion the impact of external shocks due to its economic size and domestic policies. Investment opportunities are noted in sectors like banks, technology, and sportswear, citing higher dividends and lower valuations. Strategists see news on tariffs as mostly noise for the Chinese markets, unless a U-turn on Trump's policies is achieved. (not investment advice)</p>

Studies show that multilingualism improves memory and problem-solving skills, although it's unclear if this equates to higher intelligence. Young children find it easier to learn new languages due to greater neural plasticity. Learning a new language requires new ways for the participants' brains to encode, store, and retrieve new linguistic information. Regardless, learning languages opens up new cultural experiences.</p>
