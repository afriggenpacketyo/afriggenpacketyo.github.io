          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a religious liberty case concerning whether public funds can be allocated to religious charter schools without violating the First Amendment's separation of church and state. The case revolves around St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in Oklahoma City, which seeks to become the first religious charter school in the country. Justices debated the extent of government oversight and control over the school's curriculum and whether excluding the school based on its religious affiliation constitutes discrimination. The outcome could have significant implications for the role of religion in public education and the allocation of taxpayer funds.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are influenced by several factors, including the federal funds rate, the prime rate, loan-to-value ratio, and the borrower's credit score. The Federal Reserve's rate decisions significantly impact HELOC rates, as seen by the decline in HELOC rates aligning with recent Fed rate cuts. A lower loan-to-value ratio and a strong credit score can help borrowers secure lower HELOC rates, while rising inflation or unemployment could push rates upward. Potential borrowers should shop around and compare rate offers from multiple lenders to find the best terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to cancel $1 billion in school mental health grants, asserting that they prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives over merit and fairness. Grant recipients were informed that funding will cease after this year, with officials stating the programs conflicted with civil rights law and represented an inappropriate use of federal funds. Conservative strategists claimed the money was used to promote "left-wing racialism and discrimination," leading to the decision to cut the grants. The administration plans to re-envision the mental health program funds to more effectively support students' behavioral health needs.</p>

          <p>The 2025 World Happiness Report ranks Nordic countries as the happiest, reinforcing the idea that wealth is crucial for well-being; however, this article argues that happiness is more complex than just economic prosperity. The authors propose a broader view of flourishing, considering factors like relationships, community, health, purpose, and financial security. Their research, based on data from 200,000 people across 22 countries, reveals that higher GDP doesn't always correlate with higher composite flourishing scores. The study suggests that prioritizing economic growth above all else may have drawbacks for developed nations, urging a focus on fostering meaning, purpose, and relationships alongside economic development.</p>

          <p>A Royal Marine, John Carr, who raised concerns about diversity and inclusion policies in the Armed Forces, has denied claims that he is a neo-Nazi. Carr wrote an open letter alleging that standards were being lowered for female recruits and voiced fears that positive discrimination would weaken the elite corps. The Ministry of Defence discovered that Carr is a member of the Homeland Party, leading to him being stripped of security clearance and investigated for alleged neo-Nazi links. Carr maintains that his political affiliation is irrelevant to his concerns about diversity and that he is not a racist or extremist.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court seemed open to allowing Oklahoma to use government money to run the nation’s first religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which would teach a curriculum infused by Catholic doctrine. Justices appeared divided along ideological lines, debating whether excluding the school from the state’s charter-school system would constitute discrimination against religion. The decision could affect laws in 46 other states that authorize charter schools and further blur the line between government support for religious institutions and private schools. A ruling in favor of the school could significantly expand the role of religion in public education.</p>

          <p>President Trump's immigration policies, particularly those targeting alleged gang members, are facing legal challenges over due process violations and questionable deportations. The Trump administration has invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, leading to deportations to CECOT, an El Salvador prison, despite court orders. Civil rights attorneys argue these policies violate U.S. law, while supporters credit the deterrent effect for a reduction in border crossings. However, concerns are mounting over wrongful deportations and removals of individuals with no criminal records, with the policies' future remaining uncertain due to reliance on executive actions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's long-standing reluctance to confront Vladimir Putin is examined, raising questions about whether he might finally take a stand against the Russian leader. Despite Trump's image as a tough negotiator, he has often sided with Moscow over his own nation’s intelligence services and blamed Ukraine for Russia's invasion. While Trump has insisted he can easily end the war in Ukraine, he has shown a willingness to accede to Russian demands. A recent display of anger at Moscow after Russian strikes in Kyiv raises the possibility of new sanctions, but Trump's history suggests he will continue to defer to Russia.</p>

Al-Sheikh's appointment is seen as a step towards overcoming the political stalemate in the West Bank, which has been under Israeli occupation since 1967. However, Palestinians have long been critical of President Abbas, and it is doubtful that the new succession plan will provide any significant impetus to Palestinian society. Hamas has reacted coolly to al-Sheikh's appointment, and Israel is also opposed to the prospect of the PA one day ruling the Gaza Strip again.</p>

          <p>Starter homes now cost $1 million or more in 233 U.S. cities, nearly triple the number from five years ago, according to a Zillow analysis. This trend highlights the increasing unaffordability of the housing market, particularly for first-time buyers. Million-dollar starter homes are concentrated in states with large urban hubs and limited housing inventory, but the trend has spread beyond high-cost metro areas. Rising mortgage rates, insurance premiums, and homeowners association fees have further strained affordability, leading to a record-high median age for first-time buyers and a record-low share of home purchases.</p>

          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have two primary phases: the draw period and the repayment period, with the draw period typically lasting 10 years. During the draw period, borrowers can access funds up to their approved credit limit, making interest-only payments. After 10 years, the HELOC transitions to the repayment period, during which access to funds ends, and monthly payments increase to include both principal and interest. Borrowers can prepare for this transition by making principal payments early, calculating future payments, considering refinancing options, and building their emergency fund.
