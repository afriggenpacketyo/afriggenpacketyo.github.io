          <p>Authorities have confirmed the discovery of human remains at the site of a major explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The remains are believed to belong to seven people who were reported missing following the July 1 incident at the Devastating Pyrotechnics facility. The warehouse, located on property owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, was reportedly operating without the necessary local licenses. Federal and state agencies, including the ATF and Cal Fire, are now leading the investigation into the cause of the catastrophic blast and subsequent 80-acre grass fire.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is facing a severe crisis as the Trump administration reviews its membership and funding for all international organizations, with a decision expected next month. The US, the UN's largest contributor, has proposed an 83.7% cut to all international spending, which would gut key agencies like the WFP, Unicef, and the WHO. This article argues that such a move threatens the entire multilateral, rules-based global order that has helped prevent a third world war. The potential collapse of UN humanitarian and peacekeeping operations could lead to increased conflict, famine, and global anarchy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed how Britain's Security Service, MI5, repeatedly provided false evidence to courts to cover up its relationship with a violent neo-Nazi agent. The agent, known as X, abused multiple women, using his status as an informant for coercion. After MI5's deception was exposed, internal and external reviews were launched, but the High Court has now ruled these inquiries were "deficient" and ordered a new, more robust investigation. The case raises serious questions about the credibility of MI5 and its accountability when dealing with dangerous informants and its obligations to the justice system.</p>
