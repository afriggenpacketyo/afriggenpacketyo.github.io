        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors investigating James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress reportedly concluded their case was weak, according to sources familiar with their findings. A central witness, Daniel Richman, told investigators that the former FBI director never authorized him to leak information to the press anonymously. An internal memo recommended against charging Comey, citing "likely insurmountable problems" in proving the case to a jury. Despite these internal warnings, a politically appointed prosecutor proceeded with the indictment, raising concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 05:14:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The prosecution of two men accused of spying for China has collapsed because the UK government failed to provide evidence officially designating China as a "threat to national security" during the period of the alleged offenses. According to the Director of Public Prosecutions, a recent legal precedent from another espionage case raised the evidential threshold, requiring this specific designation. The failure to secure such a statement from the government, despite months of requests, led to the charges being dropped. This outcome has prompted criticism and questions about the government's handling of the sensitive case.</p>

The fleet was stopped in international waters, and its passengers are expected to be transferred to an Israeli port for deportation. This action comes amid a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where a UN-backed report has confirmed famine conditions. Israel maintains a legal naval blockade of the territory, which has been in place since Hamas took control in 2007.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of gold has surged to a record high, driven by investors seeking a safe-haven asset due to global economic and political instability. Factors contributing to the rally include the ongoing US government shutdown and significant purchases by central banks moving away from the US dollar. This reflects a broader trend of de-dollarization and market turbulence. Analysts note that while the rally is strong, gold prices remain sensitive to shifts in geopolitical tensions and central bank interest rate policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have allowed up to 10% of state homelessness funds to be used for abstinence-based recovery housing. Proponents of the bill argued it would provide a crucial pathway to sobriety and stability for homeless individuals with substance use disorders. In his veto message, Newsom called the measure "unnecessary," stating that current guidelines already permit such housing. The article is an opinion piece that strongly criticizes the decision, framing it as a failure to embrace effective alternatives to the state's established "Housing First" policy.</p>

          <p>James Comey, the former director of the FBI, is scheduled for his first court appearance in Virginia to be arraigned on federal charges of making a false statement and obstructing a congressional investigation. The charges stem from his 2020 testimony regarding whether he ever authorized FBI personnel to act as anonymous media sources. The indictment follows years of public pressure from former President Donald Trump to prosecute his political adversaries. Critics argue the case represents a significant step in the politicization of the Department of Justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the history of the pumpkin, tracing its linguistic roots from Greek and French to its botanical origins in the Americas. Initially a vital food source for Indigenous peoples and settlers, the word "pumpkin" later became a derogatory term before evolving into a modern symbol of agrarian nostalgia. This cultural attachment, from jack-o'-lanterns to pumpkin spice lattes, now helps support small family farms through seasonal tourism and events. The gourd's journey reflects shifting American cultural values and a romanticized connection to a rural past.</p>

          <p>A new technical analysis argues that Ernest Shackleton's polar exploration vessel, Endurance, was not as strong as its legend suggests. The research posits that the ship, originally built for Arctic tourism, had structural weaknesses that made it vulnerable to the compressive force of pack ice. This contradicts the long-held belief that it was an exceptionally well-built ship for its time. The author of the paper, who was part of the 2022 expedition that found the wreck, suggests the ship's design flaws, not just the loss of its rudder, led to its demise in 1915.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced plans to significantly increase tariffs on imported steel, a move that the UK's steel industry warns could provoke "perhaps the biggest crisis" it has ever faced. The EU, which is the UK's most important export market for steel, intends to cut import quotas in half, after which a 50% tariff will apply. This protectionist measure is seen as a response to pressure from member states and similar tariffs imposed by the US. The UK government is now seeking urgent clarification and potential exemptions to protect its already struggling steel sector.</p>

          <p>American golfer Collin Morikawa has acknowledged that some home fans at the recent Ryder Cup in New York "probably crossed the line" with their verbal abuse directed at the European team. European star Rory McIlroy was a frequent target of the heckling, which included an incident where his wife was hit by a thrown cup, leading him to label the behavior "unacceptable." The comments from Morikawa add to a growing discussion within the golf community about maintaining sportsmanship and drawing a line between passionate support and inappropriate conduct at the high-profile event.</p>

          <p>The ongoing US government shutdown is causing significant flight delays at major airports across the country due to staffing shortages, particularly among air traffic controllers. As these essential federal employees are required to work without pay, airports are experiencing an increase in sick leave, forcing the Federal Aviation Administration to slow down air traffic to ensure safety. The disruption highlights the tangible impact of the political impasse in Congress on the nation's infrastructure and the travel plans of thousands of Americans.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is facing two no-confidence votes in the European Parliament, a move initiated by parties on both the far-left and far-right.

          <p>Nearly 4,000 people have joined the UK's largest-ever environmental lawsuit, filing a claim against major poultry producers and a water company for the alleged pollution of the Wye, Lugg, and Usk rivers.

The chief constable condemned the behavior, describing the messages as a "grotesque carnival of discrimination and abuse" and stating there is no place for such conduct in policing.</p>
