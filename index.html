          <p>Veteran actress Dyan Cannon, 88, was recently denied entry to the White House after Secret Service discovered she had lied about her age on her passport years ago. The incident was documented in a lighthearted social media video by her friends, who were with her for a planned tour. Cannon, known for her roles in films like "Heaven Can Wait," laughed off the situation and later reposted the video, stating she would do it again because age is just a number. The actress was in Washington, D.C., with co-hosts of her new podcast, "God's Table."</p>

          <p>Latvian tennis player Jelena Ostapenko has issued an apology for comments made to her opponent, Taylor Townsend, during a tense US Open match. After her loss, Ostapenko confronted Townsend, accusing her of having "no education" for not apologizing for a net cord winner, a common but not mandatory courtesy in tennis. Ostapenko later clarified on Instagram that English is not her native language and she was referring to tennis etiquette, not Townsend's general education, but acknowledged her words could have been offensive. The incident drew criticism and sparked a wider discussion about sportsmanship.</p>

The suspect, Michael Paul Brown, who lived next door to the bar, allegedly killed a bartender and three patrons before evading a massive weeklong manhunt in the nearby mountains. He was eventually captured inside an unoccupied structure, and while authorities have not stated a motive, his niece indicated he had a history of mental illness. He is being held on $2 million bail.</p>

After his voice began to fail, he reinvented himself on Twitter, sharing his vast knowledge with a large public audience.

          <p>The Irish government has formally expressed its concern to German authorities after a video showed Berlin police striking a 25-year-old Irish woman during a protest. The demonstration was held against the killing of journalists in Gaza. The woman, identified as Kitty O'Brien, was seen being hit in the face and later required surgery for a broken arm, according to an activist group. Berlin police stated that officers were compelled to use force after protesters ignored orders to disperse and that O'Brien had resisted and insulted officers. The incident has prompted an internal police review and sparked protests in Dublin.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a largely symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents to the city. The "Protecting Chicago Initiative" seeks to bar federal agents from wearing masks, require them to display identifying information, and prohibit city police from participating in federal actions that could violate rights to peacefully assemble. Johnson stated the order makes it clear the president will not deputize the local police department, reflecting concerns over potential militarized activity similar to events seen in other cities. The White House dismissed the move as a "publicity stunt."</p>

          <p>New evidence from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation suggests that famed McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," may have murdered his wife, Pauline, in 1967. For decades, it was believed she was killed in an ambush meant for him, but a re-examination of the case using modern forensics has revealed major inconsistencies in his story. The district attorney stated that the crime scene appears to have been staged and that a gunshot wound to Pusser's own face was likely self-inflicted, bringing a new perspective to a cold case nearly 60 years old.</p>

Burnley manager Scott Parker criticized the system after his team lost to a late, VAR-awarded penalty against Manchester United, calling it a process of "re-reffing" the game from a remote location. The weekend also saw controversial calls in the Chelsea vs. Fulham match, leading to accusations that the technology is making the sport sterile and undermining on-field officials. Critics argue the forensic analysis of minor incidents is harming the flow and enjoyment of the game.</p>

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated the attack was carried out based on intelligence received just hours before. Rahawi was considered more of a figurehead than a key military decision-maker, and the movement's top leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, was not among the casualties.

          <p>A passenger train traveling to Cairo derailed in northern Egypt, resulting in the deaths of three people and injuring 103 others. The incident occurred on Saturday afternoon near Marsa Matruh when seven of the train's carriages came off the tracks, with two overturning completely. Egypt's health ministry confirmed the casualties and stated that all injured passengers were transported to local hospitals for treatment. The country's transport ministry and national railway authority have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the crash, a frequent occurrence on Egypt's poorly maintained and underfunded railway network.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump was seen in public for the first time since rumors of his death trended on social media, effectively dispelling the online hoax. The 79-year-old was photographed at the White House preparing for a family golf outing in Virginia. The speculation was fueled by recent comments from Vice President J.D. Vance about being prepared to step in should a "terrible tragedy" occur. Concerns about Trump's health have been a recurring topic, with recent attention drawn to bruising on his hand and a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency, though his physician maintains he is in "excellent health."</p>

In an interview, Trump stated, "A bi, I don't know about, but a tri will happen," suggesting a trilateral meeting involving the U.S. is more plausible. The comments come as French President Emmanuel Macron noted that a deadline set by Trump for a bilateral meeting to be arranged is approaching, warning that a failure to meet would show Putin is "playing President Trump."

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been identified in three weeks. The outbreak resulted in 114 confirmed cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. An investigation traced the source of the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at the city-run Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the city's detection and response capabilities, including more frequent testing of cooling tower systems.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that stethoscopes enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—within seconds. A UK-based research team found the device, which analyzes subtle heart sounds undetectable by the human ear and records an ECG, significantly improved detection rates in a trial involving over 12,000 patients at GP surgeries. Researchers believe the technology could be a "real game-changer," enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment for patients. Following the successful study, there are plans to roll out the AI stethoscopes to more practices across the UK.</p>
