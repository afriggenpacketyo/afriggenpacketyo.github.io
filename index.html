        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taylor Swift's representatives have refuted claims that she played a role in a legal dispute between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively, dismissing the allegations as a ploy for "tabloid clickbait." The summons to court stemmed from accusations that Swift encouraged Baldoni to accept script re-writes by Lively for the film 'It Ends With Us,' which is at the center of a sexual harassment case. Baldoni alleges that Lively, along with her husband Ryan Reynolds and Swift, acted as her "dragons" during script discussions. Swift's representatives maintain that she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions related to the film and never reviewed or provided notes on the project.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have commenced high-level discussions in Switzerland to de-escalate trade tensions, marking the first in-person contact between the two largest economies since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on imports earlier this year.

Trump has hinted at potentially lowering the tariff rate against China, suggesting a rate of 80%. The Chinese Commerce Ministry has urged the U.S. to demonstrate sincerity and lift the unilateral tariffs, emphasizing Beijing's commitment to international fairness.</p>

          <p>A newly introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other schedule I substances, potentially enabling more clinical research on medical cannabis. Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the bill to allow research to align with the increasing cannabis consumption in the U.S. The EBDPA would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that currently hinder federal funding for research on schedule I substances. While some experts believe the bill has bipartisan potential, others are less optimistic about its near-term prospects due to the current political climate.</p>

          <p>With President Trump signaling a pullback in U.S. support for Ukraine, European allies are struggling to provide the necessary weapons to sustain Ukraine's defense. Ukraine's Parliament approved a deal to give the U.S. a share of future revenue over natural resources in hopes of maintaining American arms shipments. European nations have collectively provided about half of the $130 billion in military support to Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. While European leaders are willing to invest in weapons production, it will take time to ramp up assembly lines, leaving Ukraine reliant on American weapons in the short term.</p>

The event serves as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the ambitious Soviet Venera program, which successfully landed several probes on Venus.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, in certain cases. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller stated that the Constitution allows for the suspension of this legal liberty during times of rebellion or invasion. This consideration comes as judges have challenged recent detentions made by the administration related to immigration and foreign students. Legal experts have questioned the administration's interpretation of US law, emphasizing that Congress, not the president, holds the authority to suspend habeas corpus.</p>

          <p>Every year, farmers in this fertile valley dubbed the “salad bowl of the world” rely on tens of thousands of workers to harvest leafy greens and juicy strawberries. But with local farmworkers aging — and the Trump administration’s determined crackdown on the illegal workers who have long been the backbone of California’s agricultural workforce — more growers have been looking to legal channels to import foreign workers. Under the federal H-2A visa program, agricultural employers can hire workers from other countries on a temporary basis, so long as they show that they were unable to hire sufficient numbers of domestic workers. Employers are required to provide the guest workers with housing, food and transportation.</p>
