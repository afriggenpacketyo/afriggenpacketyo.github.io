          <p>The Las Vegas Aces rallied in the fourth quarter to defeat the Phoenix Mercury 89-86 in a thrilling Game 1 of the WNBA finals, with A'ja Wilson and Dana Evans leading a decisive 17-6 run. The victory came against a backdrop of significant player unrest, as WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert addressed accusations of dismissing concerns over pay and officiating. Engelbert acknowledged the need to rebuild trust with players ahead of the collective bargaining agreement's expiration, emphasizing commitment to a transformative deal. The game highlighted both intense on-court competition and critical off-court labor tensions.</p>

          <p>Following Sean "Diddy" Combs' 50-month prison sentence for prostitution-related offenses, his legal team announced plans to appeal, alleging the judge acted as a "13th juror." Lead attorney Teny Geragos argued the sentence unfairly considered conduct for which Combs was acquitted, specifically sex trafficking and RICO counts. Defense lawyers emphasized the jury found him not guilty of coercion, asserting the sentence was driven by rejected conduct. While acknowledging Combs' domestic violence, they contended it was not the basis of his conviction and that further incarceration hinders rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>Retained firefighters in the UK, on-call emergency responders, are still awaiting pensions despite decades of service, with many having been denied entitlements until recent years. Legal battles, including a successful challenge at the European Court of Justice, established their right to claim pensions dating back to 2000 or even their entire careers. However, administrative delays and complexities in calculating benefits mean many retirees, some in their late 70s, and widows are still waiting. The Fire Brigades Union and pension administrators acknowledge the issue, citing resource constraints and ongoing court developments.</p>

          <p>During a terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur, authorities announced that one of the two fatalities may have been inadvertently caused by police gunfire. The 35-year-old Syrian-born British assailant drove into pedestrians and attacked with a knife before being shot dead by officers, and was not carrying a firearm. Greater Manchester Police called it a "tragic and unforeseen consequence" of the emergency response. Counter Terrorism Policing stated the attacker, who had a prior criminal history including a recent arrest for sexual assault, may have been influenced by Islamist ideology.</p>

        </div>

          <p>North Carolina Governor Josh Stein signed "Iryna's Law," which tightens bail restrictions for violent and repeat offenders, prompted by the murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska. The law increases judicial scrutiny for individuals posing unusual risks of violence before bail is determined. While Stein criticized elements like a proposed firing squad amendment and the bill's focus on bail over broader safety measures, he supported its intent to enhance public safety.

          <p>Hamas reportedly launched an attack on the al-Mujaida clan in southern Gaza, accusing family members of collaborating with Israel. The confrontation resulted in approximately 11 Hamas terrorists killed, whose bodies were then dragged through the streets, and at least five members of the prominent al-Mujaida family also died. Reports indicate Hamas raided homes with IEDs and RPGs during morning prayers. A clan leader claimed IDF assistance in striking Hamas operatives, while the IDF separately reported killing 20 Hamas terrorists attempting to use children as human shields in a humanitarian zone.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom publicly urged USC to reject a compact from the Trump administration that demands conservative policy shifts in exchange for federal funding. Newsom threatened to cut state funding, including billions in Cal Grants, to any California university that agrees to the proposal, which he views as undermining academic freedom. The compact seeks changes in admissions, diversity, free speech, and gender identity policies, with USC's interim president acknowledging the offer and initiating discussions with stakeholders.

U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach reposted a draft design showing Trump's face and an image from a near-assassination attempt. A 2020 law permits commemorative $1 coins for the semiquincentennial, but provisions typically prohibit living persons on currency. Congress could make an exception, as it did in 1926 for President Calvin Coolidge.

Justices Kagan and Sotomayor dissented, with Jackson criticizing the use of the emergency docket to disrupt lives. The Department of Homeland Security hailed the decision as a "win for the American people," asserting TPS was never meant to be permanent amnesty.</p>

          <p>Victoria Cruises Line (VCL), advertising an "affordable residential cruise," is under scrutiny for taking deposits for a three-year voyage that has yet to sail, with the company reportedly not owning or leasing the advertised ship. Dozens of would-be residents, who sold homes and made life-altering plans, are awaiting refunds, with some launching legal cases and filing complaints. VCL claims it needs more customers to charter a vessel and denies targeting anyone, citing administrative reasons for withheld refunds. Critics accuse VCL of running a scam, highlighting a web of shell businesses and unpaid taxes.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) sales in the UK reached a record high in September, with pure battery electric vehicles growing by almost a third and plug-in hybrids even faster. Electrified vehicles now account for over half of all new car registrations, driven by manufacturer discounts, a wider model choice, and government grants. While businesses and fleets purchased the majority, private buyer numbers are rising, with zero-emission vehicles making up over 22% of new cars registered in 2025. The government's £3,750 grant scheme is credited with boosting consumer demand and helping drivers transition from petrol and diesel.</p>

          <p>A white Kansas sheriff’s deputy, Richard Fatherly, has been charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Charles Adair, a cuffed Black man. Newly released records indicate Fatherly pressed his knee into Adair's back for 86 seconds after he was returned to his cell with a severely injured leg. Adair, arrested for misdemeanor traffic violations, was diagnosed with a bone infection and schizophrenia. The autopsy listed the cause of death as complications from "mechanical asphyxia" and the manner as homicide. Adair's family attorneys are demanding public release of body camera footage.</p>

          <p>PPE Medpro, a company linked to Baroness Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman, has been ordered by a judge to repay £122 million for supplying gowns that failed sterility standards. The company's spokesperson claims £83 million was passed to consortium partners and suggests administrators should pursue them for the funds. Doug Barrowman previously stated PPE Medpro was a consortium, and he himself received around £60 million, with a share going to a trust benefiting Baroness Mone. With PPE Medpro entering administration with only £666,000 in assets, the government aims to recover funds from all responsible parties.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to offer unaccompanied immigrant children aged 14 and older a one-time $2,500 resettlement stipend in exchange for voluntarily departing the U.S., excluding Mexican minors.

All 51 defendants were found guilty in December, but Husamettin Dogan is appealing his nine-year sentence. Pelicot, who waived anonymity to empower other victims, will attend the Nîmes proceedings despite the emotional toll, as her decision to seek justice has had profound societal impact, though it has also fractured her family.</p>

However, experts caution that a decline could still occur if the Chinese embassy were to issue an advisory against travel.
