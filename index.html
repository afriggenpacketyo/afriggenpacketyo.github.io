          <p>Hungary's political landscape is increasingly acrimonious, characterized by government-funded propaganda and personal attacks against opposition figures, exemplified by the tragic death of a police chief. Public protests, organized by groups like the Loupe Theater Troupe, are advocating for free public spaces and clean discourse, gathering significant support for a petition and referendum initiative. Despite new EU legislation aimed at protecting media freedom, the ruling Fidesz party maintains substantial control over traditional and digital media, raising concerns about democratic backsliding. This article suggests that political tensions are expected to intensify significantly in the run-up to the 2026 parliamentary election, with little improvement in sight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations is set to reimpose sweeping economic and military sanctions on Iran, a decade after their lifting under a landmark international nuclear deal. This action follows accusations from the UK, France, and Germany that Iran failed to fulfill its commitments, leading to the activation of a mechanism that offered a 30-day diplomatic solution which was not found. Iran's President condemned the re-imposition as "unfair, unjust, and illegal," insisting the country would never seek nuclear weapons, despite stepping up banned nuclear activity after the US quit the deal in 2016. This article highlights a fraught situation, with Russia signing a new nuclear reactor deal with Iran amidst the renewed sanctions.</p>

          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between top-ranked England and second-ranked Canada transcends a mere sporting contest, representing a clash between vastly different funding models. England boasts a fully professional setup with significant financial investment, leading to dominant performance since 2019. In contrast, Canada's team operates on a fraction of England's budget, relying on crowdfunding and players leveraging England's professional league for game time. This article explores how Canada's potential victory could challenge assumptions about the necessity of full professionalism, yet also underscores the immense sacrifices Canadian players make without comparable institutional support. The outcome carries significant implications for the future investment and structure of women's Test rugby globally.</p>

          <p>Nine months into his second term, Donald Trump's promise of retribution against perceived enemies is taking unprecedented shape, rapidly expanding presidential authority. He has publicly urged his Attorney General to prosecute political opponents, suggested revoking TV licenses for critical media, and signed an order targeting "professional anarchists" funding. The article notes that actions, such as the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, are reminiscent of past presidential abuses but are now becoming normalized. Critics warn that these moves, including investigations into former officials and media outlets, are pushing the US towards authoritarianism, despite the administration's claims of targeting law-breakers and "deep state" actors.</p>

Reeves also urges the Office for Budget Responsibility to factor the scheme's potential economic impact into its forecasts, hoping to reduce the need for spending cuts or tax rises.

          <p>Chinese tech giants Huawei and AI startup DeepSeek are leading China's efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in AI chips, challenging the dominance of US companies like Nvidia. DeepSeek's shift to supporting domestically produced chips and Huawei's unveiling of world-class computing hardware, despite US blacklisting, signal growing confidence in home-grown technology. This article highlights how US trade restrictions have inadvertently spurred a wave of innovation within China's domestic AI industry, allowing Beijing to gain ground in the tech rivalry with Washington.

          <p>A federal judge in Minnesota ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a prominent ally of President Trump, defamed election technology company Smartmatic with false statements about its role in rigging the 2020 presidential election.
