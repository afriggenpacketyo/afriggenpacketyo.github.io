          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, the city of Minneapolis is collaborating with StoryCorps to record and preserve the stories of those impacted by his death and the subsequent events. The initiative aims to give voice to community members who felt unheard, providing a platform for them to share their experiences and truths. These taped interviews will be shared with city leaders and archived in the Library of Congress, ensuring that future generations can access these narratives. Photographer John Noltner, who documented the initial memorial, emphasizes the importance of connection and authentic community grieving in the wake of such events, noting the project's potential to bridge divisions and foster understanding.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of the 1989 killings of their parents, have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades. The brothers claimed they acted in self-defense due to years of alleged abuse. The decision follows a resentencing petition arguing new evidence corroborated the abuse allegations. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings and potentially the governor's office. The resentencing has sparked debate, with the Los Angeles County District Attorney expressing opposition and relatives expressing relief.</p>

          <p>Broward County Circuit Court Judge Gary Farmer has been suspended following a determination by the Florida Judicial Qualifications Commission that he was unfit to serve due to telling inappropriate jokes, showing bias, and having poor attendance. The investigation was initiated after concerns were raised about Farmer's courtroom remarks, including mocking a defendant expecting children with different women and referencing a comedy sketch making fun of gay people. While Farmer's attorney admits he made the jokes, they argue they were meant to lighten tension and show humanity, though Farmer has since apologized for the remarks. The commission also cited Farmer's excessive judicial leave and alleged bias in his rulings as reasons for the suspension.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 19:33:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Missouri Republican lawmakers have approved a new referendum to repeal the abortion-rights amendment that voters narrowly passed last year. The proposed constitutional amendment would ban most abortions, allowing exceptions only for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, or cases of sexual assault or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. This move comes after Missouri's abortion policies swung dramatically, with a near-total ban triggered by the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, followed by voters' approval of an amendment guaranteeing abortion rights until fetal viability in November. The new measure also seeks to prohibit gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments, and puberty blockers for minors.</p>

          <p>A British maritime authority report found that the Bayesian superyacht, which capsized off Sicily last year killing seven people, was likely overturned by a strong gust of wind due to its towering mast and questionable stability.

The investigation also revealed the yacht's "angle of vanishing stability" was lower than many sailboats, making it more prone to capsizing.

          <p>Three wildfires in northern Minnesota have burned nearly 37,000 acres since Sunday, with none of the fires contained. The Jenkins Creek Fire is the largest, followed by the Camp House Fire, which has destroyed dozens of structures. Investigations are ongoing to determine the causes of the fires, with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources investigating suspects accused of starting the Camp House Fire. Weather conditions have improved slightly, and the Minnesota National Guard has been activated to assist in the firefighting efforts. Thousands of homes have been evacuated, and donations are being accepted to support relief efforts.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan has been indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly helping a man evade immigration authorities. Dugan is accused of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction after she allegedly misdirected federal agents away from a person in her court who is in the U.S. illegally. Dugan filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing she is entitled to judicial immunity. The case has drawn comparisons to a similar one from the first Trump administration and has led to Dugan's suspension from the bench by the state Supreme Court.</p>
