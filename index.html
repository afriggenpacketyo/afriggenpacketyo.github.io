          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness for shark conservation. Pugh aimed to change public perceptions of sharks, which he says have been unfairly maligned by the film "Jaws." He wants to encourage protections for these at-risk animals. Pugh described the swim as one of the most challenging of his career, citing cold water, wind, and concerns about sharks as significant hurdles.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent call for a wind-down of the war in Gaza signals a shift in tone, reflecting Israel's growing diplomatic isolation. This comes as key allies like Britain, France, and Germany express increasing impatience with Israel's actions. While these countries continue to support Israel in many ways, the changing rhetoric and some concrete limitations on Israeli interests indicate a growing concern over the conflict's impact and direction. Prime Minister Netanyahu remains defiant, accusing critics of emboldening Hamas.</p>

          <p>While the official unemployment rate remains low, a report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests a different picture of the labor market. LISEP's "true rate" of unemployment, which includes those seeking full-time work, part-time workers, and those in poverty-wage jobs, is significantly higher than the official rate. This disparity raises concerns about the accuracy of current economic indicators and the well-being of low-income Americans.
