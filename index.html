          <p>North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, will attend a major military parade in Beijing, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two. This visit, his first to China in six years, is seen as a significant diplomatic event, placing him alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The parade will showcase China's latest military technology and is interpreted as a strategic move by Xi to assert geopolitical influence, particularly in relation to ongoing discussions between the U.S., Russia, and North Korea.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its policy interest rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing the need to monitor rising housing prices in Seoul and growing household debt. Despite holding the rate, the central bank upgraded its GDP growth and inflation forecasts for 2025, anticipating a modest recovery in domestic demand. This decision comes after recent trade agreements with the U.S. are expected to ease some economic headwinds, though analysts still foresee potential rate cuts in the coming months.

          <p>A 12-year-old nonverbal boy with autism, who went missing from his New Orleans home, was found deceased in a canal, with the coroner confirming his death was due to drowning and trauma consistent with an alligator attack. The boy, Bryan Vasquez, had disappeared nearly two weeks prior, prompting a large-scale search effort. The case has raised questions about the police department's delayed response and has now been classified as an unclassified death investigation, with authorities also planning to remove "nuisance" alligators from the area.</p>

The confusion surrounding the visit has created diplomatic awkwardness, occurring at a sensitive time for the U.S.-Australia alliance amid a U.S. review of the AUKUS submarine deal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in turmoil after the Trump administration moved to oust Director Susan Monarez, who was confirmed less than a month ago. A legal standoff ensued as Monarez's lawyers stated she would not resign, alleging she was targeted for resisting unscientific directives from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The move triggered a wave of resignations from other top CDC officials, who cited the "ongoing weaponizing of public health" as their reason for leaving, raising alarm among public health experts.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated there is a "real possibility" of introducing the company's latest Blackwell AI processor to the Chinese market, contingent on U.S. government approval. This follows a deal where the U.S. government would receive a 15% share of sales from Nvidia's less advanced H20 chips licensed for China. Huang is advocating for U.S. tech companies to lead the global AI race by setting the standard, arguing it is preferable to forcing Chinese developers to rely solely on homegrown alternatives.

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has suspended over 20 employees who publicly signed an open letter to Congress warning that Trump-era changes were undermining the agency's effectiveness. The letter, known as the "Katrina Declaration," argued that reforms made after the 2005 hurricane were being reversed, jeopardizing disaster relief efforts. The suspended employees received notices placing them on paid administrative leave, a move that followed a statement from FEMA accusing the signatories of protecting a "broken" and inefficient bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's humiliating Carabao Cup defeat to fourth-tier Grimsby Town has cast a harsh spotlight on manager Ruben Amorim and the club's direction. The loss, which came via a penalty shootout, adds to a poor start to the season and follows a 15th-place league finish last year, despite a £200 million investment in new attacking players. Amorim's post-match comments and on-field demeanor have raised questions about his leadership, placing pressure on the club's new ownership to address the team's persistent underperformance.</p>

          <p>The UK government is rolling out the final phase of its expanded childcare plan, offering working parents in England 30 hours a week of subsidized care for children as young as nine months old. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged eligible parents to apply for the program, which aims to alleviate the high cost of childcare. However, concerns persist within the sector regarding whether there are enough staff and available places to meet the increased demand, and some providers still charge extra fees to cover funding shortfalls.</p>

The family claims OpenAI rushed the product to market without adequate protections, and the case represents the first wrongful death suit filed against the company.</p>

Her escape through territory controlled by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) was fraught with danger, including threats from armed drivers, constant extortion at checkpoints, and treacherous road conditions. Amira's account provides a powerful firsthand perspective on the brutalization of civilians and the collapse of essential services as the war shifts to a new front line.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The restaurant chain Cracker Barrel quickly reversed its decision to adopt a new, minimalist logo after facing a significant right-wing backlash accusing the company of going "woke." This article argues that the controversy misses the point, as Cracker Barrel has always been a corporate simulation of rural Americana, not an authentic representation of it. The author suggests the failed redesign was not about progressive politics but was another step in a corporate trend of sanitizing culture, similar to its original mission of capitalizing on nostalgia for a disappearing way of life.</p>

          <p>The declared value of small parcels shipped from China to the UK under a tax exemption rule more than doubled last year, reaching £3 billion. This surge is largely attributed to the growing popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu, which benefit from a rule that exempts imports valued under £135 from customs duties. UK retailers are calling for the government to close this loophole, arguing it creates unfair competition and exposes consumers to potentially unregulated products, while a Treasury review of the policy is ongoing.</p>
