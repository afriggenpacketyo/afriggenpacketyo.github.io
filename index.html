          <p>Nomura Holdings, a Japanese investment bank, announced its acquisition of Macquarie's North American and European public investments business for $1.8 billion in an all-cash deal expected to close by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. This strategic move aims to bolster Nomura's global asset management division, increasing its assets under management from $590 billion to $770 billion. Macquarie will retain its Australian public investments business and collaborate with Nomura on product distribution, including Nomura serving as a U.S. wealth distribution partner for Macquarie's alternative investment capabilities. Nomura anticipates minimal financial impact from the transaction, with both companies operating independently until the deal's completion.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has proposed a budget that addresses a nearly $1 billion financial gap by eliminating over 2,700 city positions, with about 1,650 layoffs across various departments, including over 400 civilian positions at the LAPD. While the fire department would see an increase of 227 employees, including firefighters, other agencies such as animal services, transportation, and sanitation face significant spending reductions. Union leaders have vowed to fight the layoffs, urging state financial assistance to mitigate the impact on city services, which are already facing delays. The mayor's plan also includes merging smaller agencies and eliminating citizen commissions focused on health, innovation, and climate change.</p>

Iamaleava reportedly sought a $4 million deal for the upcoming season, leading to a rift with Tennessee. Aguilar, who had previously joined UCLA from Appalachian State, now heads to Knoxville with one year of eligibility remaining, having thrown for 6,760 yards and 56 touchdowns in his last two seasons.

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging attempts to control academic decision-making by threatening to review $9 billion in federal funding after Harvard refused to comply with demands that included appointing an outside overseer to ensure viewpoint diversity. The lawsuit seeks to halt a freeze on $2.2 billion in grants, with Harvard President Alan Garber stating that no government should dictate what private universities can teach or who they can admit. The Trump administration claims that Harvard mishandled pro-Palestinian protests and allowed antisemitism to fester, leading to threats to the university's tax-exempt status and research funding.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the Palisades wildfire, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is proposing to add 227 positions to the Fire Department, even as other agencies face layoffs due to a budget gap. About half of the new hires would be firefighters, while the remaining positions include emergency medical technicians and mechanics. The proposed budget also includes the creation of a Homeless Fire Protection and Street Medicine Program to address the increasing number of fires connected to people experiencing homelessness. This comes after concerns were raised about budget cuts hampering the department's ability to fight the Palisades fire, which destroyed nearly 7,000 structures and killed 12 people.</p>

          <p>Scientists from China and France have created a detailed map of the crab-eating macaque's claustrum, a brain region thought to play a role in consciousness, which could help understand cognitive functions like memory integration and abstract thinking. The study revealed significant differences in the structure and cell types of macaque and rodent claustrums, offering clues to investigate the evolutionary mechanism behind consciousness. The claustrum is known to connect to the cerebral cortex and subcortical regions, influencing functions like sleep regulation, depression, and cognitive control, though the generation of consciousness remains scientifically debated.</p>

          <p>A European Space Agency (ESA) project has launched an experiment to assess the feasibility of growing lab-grown food in space, aiming to reduce the high costs of feeding astronauts, which can reach up to £20,000 per day. The project, a collaboration between Frontier Space and Imperial College London, involves growing protein, fat, and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats, with the goal of establishing a pilot food production plant on the International Space Station within two years. This initiative is driven by the need for sustainable food sources for long-term space missions, potentially using 3D printers to create customized meals in space.</p>

This downturn follows investor concerns about ongoing tariff uncertainty and the upcoming release of U.S. tech companies' earnings, with some analysts suggesting investors are losing confidence in U.S. assets due to assaults on the Fed's independence and concerns about shaking up the existing world order.</p>

While Trump has expressed confidence in Hegseth, some within the White House and Pentagon are speculating about his future and considering potential replacements.

          <p>The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its Uber One subscription service. The FTC accuses Uber of charging customers without consent and making it difficult to cancel subscriptions, requiring up to 32 actions. Uber denies the allegations, stating that cancellations can now be done in-app in under 20 seconds and that they do not sign up or charge consumers without their consent. The legal action marks the FTC's first lawsuit against a major US tech company since President Donald Trump took office for his second term in January.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging unlawful actions in freezing billions in federal funding. The lawsuit comes after Harvard rejected the administration's demands to change policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for "viewpoint diversity." The lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights by halting federal funding and claims the withholding of funds is part of a pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the government's control over its academic programs.</p>

          <p>With the threat posed by US President Donald Trump dominating Canada's federal election agenda, climate change has been largely overshadowed. The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US. Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy, while the Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax. This marks a significant shift from the 2021 election, where the environment topped voter concerns.</p>
