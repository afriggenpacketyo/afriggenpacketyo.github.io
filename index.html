        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has escalated its conflict with "sanctuary states" by threatening legal action against California, New York, and Illinois. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons issued letters demanding these states comply with immigration detainers, which are requests to hold individuals for federal custody. After the states reaffirmed their policies of non-compliance, citing legal precedents that detainers are voluntary requests, DHS vowed to involve the Department of Justice to sue them and potentially block federal funding. The administration argues these state laws release dangerous criminals into communities, while the states maintain their policies build trust with immigrant populations and prevent unconstitutional detentions.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandezsantana, has been arrested following a drive-by shooting that targeted the ABC10 television station building in Sacramento. Police reported that at least three rounds struck the building, but fortunately, no injuries occurred among the staff. The suspect was identified through his vehicle and has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon and shooting into an occupied building before being released on bail. The motive remains under investigation, and the incident has drawn condemnation from public officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who described any violence against journalists as an attack on democracy.</p>

          <p>Giulia Baccosi, an Italian woman, impulsively accepted a job as a cook on a cargo schooner in early 2020, expecting a three-month voyage to Central America. However, the sudden onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and global lockdowns left her and the crew stranded at sea for 188 days. The article recounts their journey, from rescuing migrants off the African coast to facing port closures, dwindling supplies, and rising tensions while isolated from the world. Despite the hardship, the crew found moments of wonder in nature and eventually made it back to Germany, a life-changing experience that did not deter Baccosi from continuing her career at sea.</p>

          <p>A significant increase in Chinese tourists is being observed in Japan, driven by the yen's weakness, which makes travel and luxury goods more affordable. Data from the Japan National Tourism Organisation shows over 6.7 million visits from Chinese travelers in the first eight months of 2025, a substantial rise from the previous year. This influx, particularly from middle-class and wealthy families, is boosting Japan's economy as visitors spend generously on high-quality merchandise, unique culinary experiences, and cultural activities.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' All-Star catcher Will Smith is facing a doubtful return before the end of the regular season due to a hairline fracture in his right hand. The injury, sustained from a foul ball, was initially missed by scans but confirmed in a subsequent MRI after symptoms persisted. Manager Dave Roberts stated that Smith's availability for the start of the postseason is "up in the air," creating uncertainty for the team's playoff lineup. In his absence, journeyman catcher Ben Rortvedt has performed capably, earning praise for his handling of the pitching staff, though the team still needs Smith's offensive power.</p>

          <p>A report from MSNBC alleges that Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, was recorded by undercover FBI agents accepting $50,000 in cash in September 2024. The agents, posing as contractors, reportedly captured Homan promising to help secure government contracts in a second Trump term. According to sources, the investigation was initiated under the Biden administration but was recently closed by Trump-appointed officials at the Department of Justice, who deemed it a "deep state" operation lacking credible evidence. The White House has denounced the probe as "blatantly political," while critics like Senator Adam Schiff have called it a corrupt attempt to conceal graft.</p>

It traces his rise from co-founding the student organization Turning Point USA at age 18 to becoming a prominent social media influencer and a key ally of President Donald Trump.

President Trump publicly confirmed he wanted Siebert out for not prosecuting James, a longtime political adversary. Cleary, a conservative lawyer who previously wrote about being wrongly targeted in a Jan. 6 investigation, takes over an office in turmoil, with the Justice Department's probe into James yet to yield charges.</p>

This vision moves beyond the concept of a basic safety net, proposing a more generous system funded by the immense wealth generated through automation.

The platform's parent company, Google, has not yet commented on the reason for the account's removal, which had over 200,000 followers. YouTube's policies allow for termination due to repeated violations, such as spreading misinformation or interfering with democratic processes. The action occurs amid heightened tensions between Venezuela and the United States, following the deployment of American warships to the Caribbean and a U.S. indictment against Maduro on drug trafficking charges.</p>

          <p>Dutch police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse a violent anti-immigration protest in The Hague, resulting in thirty arrests and injuries to two officers. The demonstration, organized by a right-wing activist demanding stricter migration policies, saw around 1,500 people block a major highway. Protesters threw rocks and bottles, set a police car on fire, and smashed the windows of the headquarters of the centre-left D66 party. Prime Minister Dick Schoof condemned the violence as "completely unacceptable," a sentiment echoed by right-wing leader Geert Wilders, who distanced himself from the "idiots" responsible for the clashes.</p>

The article highlights the sacrifices students make, such as missing out on networking opportunities and social events, and even wearing work uniforms to lectures to save time.

Gabbard's office claimed the revocations were directed by President Trump to target individuals involved in the "politicization of intelligence," specifically related to assessments of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

          <h2>China Rejects US Push for Trilateral Nuclear Arms Reduction Talks</h2>

          <p>China has firmly rejected President Trump's proposal for trilateral nuclear disarmament talks that would also include Russia, labeling the idea as neither "reasonable nor realistic." Beijing's refusal complicates efforts to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) and raises fears of a renewed global arms race. For decades, China has maintained that its nuclear arsenal is kept at the minimum level required for national security and that it does not engage in arms races. This stance underscores the significant diplomatic challenges in bringing China, a growing nuclear power, into existing arms control frameworks designed during the Cold War.</p>

          <p>New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the former archbishop of Milwaukee, has sparked controversy by comparing the recently assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk to "a modern-day St. Paul." In an appearance on Fox News, Dolan praised Kirk as a "missionary" and a "hero," suggesting his death could inspire faith in young people. The comments drew significant outrage on social media, with critics pointing to Kirk's divisive rhetoric and Dolan's own controversial history, including his handling of clergy sexual assault cases. The comparison highlights the deep political and cultural divisions surrounding Kirk's legacy following his death.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications, a move that threatens to disrupt the hiring of highly skilled foreign workers. The decision has caused major tech and finance companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and JPMorgan Chase to advise their employees on H-1B visas to avoid international travel. Foreign governments, particularly India, have also expressed concern about the "humanitarian consequences" for families. The White House defends the policy as a way to protect American jobs, but critics argue it will harm U.S. competitiveness and incentivize companies to move jobs overseas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to officially announce the United Kingdom's recognition of a Palestinian state, marking a significant shift in British foreign policy. The decision follows a deadline set in July, which required Israel to agree to a ceasefire and commit to a two-state solution, conditions that were not met. The move is driven by the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the expansion of Israeli settlements, but it has drawn sharp criticism from the Israeli government and some hostage families, who argue it rewards terrorism. The UK joins other Western nations like France and Canada in this diplomatic step.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill making California the first state to ban on-duty law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing masks that obscure their identity. Newsom framed the law as a necessary pushback against the "secret police" tactics of the Trump administration, referencing aggressive immigration raids in Los Angeles by masked agents in unmarked cars. The law includes exceptions for tactical gear and medical masks but is aimed at increasing transparency and accountability. The move will likely face a legal challenge from the federal government, with the Department of Homeland Security calling it "despicable" and a threat to officer safety.</p>

          <p>The UK's Royal Air Force (RAF) has conducted a NATO air defense mission over Poland in response to recent Russian drone incursions into the alliance's airspace. RAF Typhoon fighter jets were deployed on Friday night as part of "Operation Eastern Sentry," a mission designed to bolster NATO's eastern flank. The operation follows multiple violations of NATO airspace by Russia this month, including in Poland, Romania, and Estonia, which has significantly escalated tensions. UK Defence Secretary John Healey stated the flights send "a clear signal that NATO airspace will be defended" against what he termed "reckless Russian aggression."</p>
