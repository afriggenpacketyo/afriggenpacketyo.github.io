          <p>Positive regulatory news, new product launches, and its recent inclusion in the S&P 500 index have propelled Coinbase to become the benchmark's top-performing stock for June. Analysts suggest the crypto exchange's stock may have further growth potential, citing its strong revenue-sharing agreement with the recently listed and surging Circle Internet Group. Despite these positive indicators, some experts note a decline in trading volume on the platform since April, which could pose a risk in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With home equity levels at a record high, homeowners have significant borrowing power, but choosing between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) presents a challenge. Currently, both products feature nearly identical interest rates, making them more affordable than personal loans or credit cards. However, experts predict that HELOCs, which have variable rates, may become the cheaper option this summer if the Federal Reserve enacts anticipated interest rate cuts. This outcome is not guaranteed, as a fixed-rate home equity loan offers stability against potential market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new bill in Delaware, HB 111, aims to reduce waste by prohibiting food establishments from providing single-use items like utensils, napkins, and condiment packets unless specifically requested by a customer.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced an immediate termination of all trade discussions with Canada, citing Ottawa's decision to implement a digital services tax on U.S. technology firms. President Trump characterized the tax, which is estimated to cost companies like Alphabet and Amazon $3 billion, as a "direct and blatant attack." The move abruptly ends talks that were expected to continue for another month and signals a significant escalation in trade tensions between the two closely linked economies.

          <p>A federal judge in Tennessee has postponed the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia after his legal team expressed fears he would be immediately deported. Abrego Garcia, who faces human smuggling charges, was previously deported to El Salvador by mistake and was only returned to the U.S. after a prolonged legal battle. His attorneys requested the delay due to conflicting statements from the Department of Justice regarding whether he would be allowed to remain in the country for his trial. The case highlights the complex and sometimes contradictory nature of U.S. immigration and legal proceedings.</p>

Documents reportedly show her grandfather, Constantine Dobrowolski, was a Nazi informant in Ukraine known as "The Butcher" who participated in atrocities. The Foreign Office stated that Ms. Metreweli, who will be the first female head of MI6, never knew her grandfather and that her complex heritage has fueled her commitment to protecting Britain from modern threats.

The United States is a critical market for Lotus, and the high import taxes threaten the company's business model.

The decision, which arose from challenges to his order to end birthright citizenship, was hailed by Trump as a "monumental win" that stops "radical left judges" from blocking his agenda. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order itself, it limited a key judicial tool used to halt presidential actions.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News for at least $787 million, alleging the network and anchor Jesse Watters deliberately lied about a phone call between him and President Trump. The lawsuit claims Fox News falsely reported that Newsom had lied about the call's timing and content to curry favor with the president. Newsom's legal team offered to dismiss the suit in exchange for an on-air retraction and apology.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The suit alleges that the network, and specifically anchor Jesse Watters, knowingly lied by claiming the governor had been untruthful about a phone call with President Donald Trump. Newsom's legal team states the lawsuit will be dismissed if Fox News retracts the claim and issues a formal on-air apology.

          <p>Despite initial fears, recent tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have not led to a significant surge in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies pre-ordering inventory, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and utilizing loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. However, this stability may be temporary, as many experts, including the Federal Reserve Chair, anticipate that the cumulative impact of the tariffs will likely lead to higher consumer prices in the second half of the year.

A calculation shows that over one year, a money market account might earn only a couple of dollars more than a high-yield savings account on a $10,000 deposit.

This article outlines the types of debt that are most likely to be eligible for settlement, where a borrower pays a reduced lump sum to clear their obligation. Unsecured debts like credit card balances and personal loans are often the easiest to negotiate, as creditors risk receiving nothing if the borrower defaults completely. Medical bills are also commonly settled, while buy now, pay later plans and high-interest payday loans can be more challenging to resolve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review of Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," describes it as a purposeful return to the electronic, rhythm-driven sound of her earlier work, set against a New York City backdrop. The album explores themes of desire, heartbreak, and self-discovery in one's late twenties, but the critic argues its potential is diluted by self-obsession. While praising moments of sonic magic and clever production, the article suggests the album's focus is overly insular. It reflects a broader trend in pop music, heavily influenced by Lorde herself, where intense introspection can supplant a connection with the wider world.</p>

The author contends that the ruling makes it vastly more difficult to challenge unconstitutional actions by the executive branch, as it would now require separate lawsuits in all 94 federal districts. This could lead to the law being applied inconsistently across the country and allow unconstitutional policies to remain in effect for extended periods. The dissenters, quoted in the piece, warned that the decision is an "existential threat to the rule of law."</p>

Instead of consolidating this new coalition, the MAGA movement's response seems determined to alienate these groups.

          <h2>Stock Market Indexes Reach New Record Highs Amid Optimism on Trade and Interest Rates</h2>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes climbed to new all-time highs, driven by investor optimism regarding progress on international trade deals and the potential for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. This marks a significant turnaround from a market downturn earlier in the year, which was fueled by concerns over the Trump administration's tariff policies. Recent positive headlines about a U.S.-China trade framework and a potential delay in new tariffs have eased investor worries. Analysts note, however, that some complacency may be setting in regarding ongoing trade and geopolitical risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>DR Congo and Rwanda Sign Peace Agreement in Washington to End Conflict</h2>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a U.S.-brokered peace deal aimed at ending decades of conflict in the mineral-rich eastern DR Congo. The agreement, signed at the U.S. State Department, calls for the disarmament of armed groups, including the M23 rebels who recently seized significant territory. While hailed as a major diplomatic success, details remain scarce, and crucial questions about the withdrawal of Rwandan troops and the return of refugees are unanswered. Previous peace deals in the region have failed, leaving many observers cautiously optimistic about the new agreement's potential for lasting success.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented honor, Gilbert, the golden retriever of slain Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman, lay in state beside her and her husband's caskets at the state Capitol. The dog was also fatally shot during the June 14 attack on the family's home and was later euthanized due to the severity of his injuries. Hundreds of people gathered to pay their respects to the prominent Democratic lawmaker, her husband, and their beloved pet. According to state records, Gilbert is the first nonhuman to ever be granted the honor of lying in state in Minnesota.</p>
