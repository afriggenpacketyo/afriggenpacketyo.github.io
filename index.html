          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older adults, after he experienced mild leg swelling. A memo from his physician, Sean Barbabella, stated the condition is benign and that the president remains in "excellent" overall health following a comprehensive examination. The announcement addresses recent public speculation fueled by photos showing swollen ankles and bruised hands, which the physician attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. The memo confirmed no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a slowdown in the rapid increase of rice prices after the government released stockpiles, although they remain elevated. This data comes as the country faces economic growth concerns due to potential U.S. tariffs and a recent GDP decline. Despite inflation remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, some analysts do not expect an interest rate hike until 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, identified itself as a "small disadvantaged business" in a federal filing with the U.S. Small Business Administration. This designation, which can provide preferential access to federal contracts, was filed shortly before a financing round valued the company at $9 billion. The SBA defines such a business as being at least 51% owned by "socially and economically disadvantaged" individuals. The filing occurred while Musk, the world's wealthiest person, was leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, which aimed to cut federal spending.</p>

          <p>Five migrants deported from the U.S. to Eswatini under a Trump administration third-country program are being held in solitary confinement indefinitely, according to an Eswatini government spokesperson. The men, convicted of serious crimes in the U.S., are from countries that reportedly refused to accept them. This action is part of a controversial U.S. policy of sending deportees to countries with which they have no ties, raising alarm from human rights organizations. The U.S. State Department's own reports have cited credible accounts of torture and inhumane conditions in Eswatini's prisons.</p>

          <p>American consumers are facing record-high beef prices this summer, with a pound of ground beef averaging $6.12 in June, up nearly 12% from last year. Experts attribute the surge to a decades-long decline in the U.S. cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951. Factors contributing to the tight supply include prolonged drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices rather than breeding them. The situation is exacerbated by a ban on cattle imports from Mexico and the potential impact of widespread tariffs.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition at the Yuengling mansion in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, is showcasing the work of artist Tom Hartz, who paints scenes of coal mining life on pieces of slate. Growing up in Luzerne County, Hartz developed a deep respect for the miners and now memorializes their labor by using slate from old slag heaps as his canvas. His oil paintings, based on historical research and local recollections, depict miners toiling underground and the iconic coal breakers of the region. The 77-year-old self-taught artist rekindled his passion for art after a long career in commercial printing.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had been holding up the unanimous approval required from all 27 member states due to concerns over a separate EU plan to phase out Russian gas imports. Fico stated that it would be "counterproductive" to continue the blockade after receiving guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply. The new sanctions target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including further isolating Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy reversal, the Trump administration's Justice Department is recommending a token one-day prison sentence for Brett Hankison, a former police officer convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights. Hankison blindly fired ten shots into Taylor's apartment during the fatal 2020 raid. The sentencing memo, which also requests credit for time served, means Hankison would serve no additional jail time if the judge agrees. This move is seen as a stark departure from the previous administration's efforts toward police accountability following the widespread racial justice protests of 2020.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives is advancing a legislative package requested by President Trump to rescind approximately $9 billion in funding, primarily targeting foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. However, progress on the bill has been stalled by procedural maneuvering from Democrats, who are attempting to force votes on an amendment to release the Jeffrey Epstein files. The controversy over the Epstein case has divided Republicans and complicated the passage of the rescissions bill, which faces a tight deadline before the funds must be spent as originally allocated.</p>

Born in Switzerland, Niederhauser grew into his frame late after starting as a guard, and the Clippers are optimistic about his upside.

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking to block the termination of a key FEMA program that funds pre-disaster mitigation projects. The lawsuit argues that the administration acted unlawfully by shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a decision they claim rests with Congress. The states contend the cuts jeopardize crucial infrastructure projects designed to protect communities from natural disasters. A recent investigation found that the funding cuts disproportionately affect counties that supported President Trump in the 2024 election.</p>

In its ruling, the court's majority argued that the old district was an impermissible racial gerrymander.

          <p>Legal experts are expressing growing concern over the Supreme Court's increased use of its emergency "shadow docket" to issue major rulings with little to no explanation. This practice has been particularly notable in cases involving the Trump administration, where the Court has frequently granted emergency relief to allow controversial policies to take effect while legal challenges are still pending. An analysis points out that this approach bypasses the traditional, deliberative process of the Court. The lack of reasoning in these impactful decisions fuels concerns about politicization and undermines the Court's legitimacy.</p>
