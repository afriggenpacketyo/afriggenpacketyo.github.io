          <p>Former Emperor Akihito of Japan, aged 91, was discharged from a Tokyo hospital after undergoing tests for myocardial ischemia, a condition involving reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Although he displayed no symptoms, doctors will continue to monitor his condition carefully. Akihito was admitted to the hospital following an earlier checkup that indicated potential heart issues. He had previously received treatment for heart failure in 2022 and abdicated the throne in April 2019, marking the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in approximately 200 years.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for over five decades and is now making its way back to Earth. Experts predict that parts of the 1,050-pound spacecraft, originally designed with a heat shield to withstand Venus's atmosphere, could survive re-entry. While the exact location of impact is unknown, the spacecraft's orbit places it between 52 degrees north and south latitude. The article notes that if any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>A South Korean temple, Buseoksa Temple, returned a 14th-century Buddha statue to Kannonji, its rightful Japanese owner. The statue was stolen from Kannonji on Japan's Tsushima Island in 2012 by South Korean thieves. Buseoksa Temple had claimed ownership, alleging it was looted by Japanese pirates centuries ago. The statue was displayed to visitors for 100 days before its return. After conflicting court rulings, South Korea's Supreme Court ultimately upheld the decision to return the statue to Kannonji, resolving a historical dispute between the temples.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's trade policy is characterized by rapid reversals and unpredictability, leaving businesses worldwide struggling to adapt. The US president's stance on issues ranging from tariffs on strollers and movies to global trade deals shifts frequently, creating uncertainty. The article highlights examples such as potential tariff exemptions for childcare products and proposed tariffs on foreign-produced movies, which were later reconsidered. Despite initially dismissing trade deals, Trump unveiled a trade accord with the UK, only to concede that certain details had yet to be finalized. The article concludes that the administration's approach to trade policy remains inconsistent and difficult to predict.</p>

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, is demanding an apology from the Football Association (FA) after she was banned for questioning the gender of a transgender woman opponent during a friendly match.

The case was eventually dropped after the complainant withdrew. Vaughan claims the incident has significantly impacted her life, causing stress and disruption. The FA confirmed the case's closure, citing the complainant's withdrawal, and stated no further action would be taken.</p>

President Sheinbaum stated that the lawsuit was filed after previous warnings to Google. The dispute arose after President Trump signed an order to rename the northern part of the gulf to the Gulf of America. Mexico argues that the Gulf of America label should only apply to the part over the U.S. continental shelf, as Mexico controls about 49% of the gulf, while the U.S. controls about 46%.</p>

The proposed measures include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, likely targeting the IT and telecommunications sectors. Visa restrictions may be imposed on nationalities with a higher likelihood of overstaying, such as those from Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. Migrants may also face longer waiting periods before applying for permanent residency, potentially extending to 10 years.

          <p>President Trump ordered the Department of Homeland Security to increase the deportation force of the United States by 20,000 officers. The proclamation calls for deputizing state and local law enforcement officers, former federal officers, and other individuals. The Trump administration has been pushing for migrants to leave the country on their own accord, offering financial assistance for those who voluntarily depart. The proclamation warns that migrants could face fines, wage garnishment, and confiscation of property if they do not leave voluntarily.</p>

          <p>Changes to de minimis rules, which allowed low-value packages to avoid tariffs, are causing shoppers to rush online to take advantage of the remaining tax exemptions. President Trump's decision to end the carve-out has led to concerns about price hikes and shortages. The new tariffs are expected to disproportionately affect lower-income households. Some companies are adapting by shifting to locally based sellers and fulfilling orders from within the US. Experts predict that ending de minimis will lead to at least $10.9 billion in new costs.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are meeting in Geneva for high-stakes trade negotiations. The talks aim to address the trade war initiated by President Trump, who has imposed high tariffs on Chinese imports. Expectations for a breakthrough are low, with analysts anticipating discussions to focus on each side's demands and potential negotiation paths. The negotiations are closely watched by economists and investors, who fear that a U.S.-Chinese economic war will lead to slower growth and higher prices globally. On Friday, Trump signaled he was prepared to begin lowering tariffs.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping has been strategically positioning China to dominate global supply chains, aiming to make the world dependent on its exports and know-how. This strategy involves increasing exports, subsidizing factories, and introducing export controls. In response to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, China has imposed export restrictions on critical minerals, impacting industries worldwide. The article suggests that this approach challenges the supremacy of the United States and may divide the world into competing spheres of influence. However, it also notes potential costs to China, including strained relationships with trading partners and economic burdens on Chinese households.</p>
