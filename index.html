          <p>A Japanese Defense Ministry panel proposes that the government consider increasing defense spending beyond the current 2% of GDP target.  The proposal also suggests exploring the deployment of long-range missile-equipped submarines, including nuclear-powered ones, to enhance deterrence.  However, the feasibility and funding of such proposals remain uncertain, particularly concerning the potential conflict with Japan's peaceful atomic energy policy. The article further emphasizes the need for expedited achievement of the 2% GDP target and the integration of advanced AI technologies in unmanned defense equipment.</p>
