          <h2>Ketamine's Growing Popularity Presents Therapeutic and Recreational Paradox</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ketamine, initially synthesized in the 1960s as an anesthetic, is increasingly used for mental health treatment, especially for depression, with the FDA approving a ketamine-derived nasal spray in 2019. However, recreational use of ketamine is also on the rise, potentially leading to serious health consequences like kidney and liver damage. A study indicates an 82% increase in ketamine use between 2015 and 2019, followed by a 40% rise from 2021 to 2022, suggesting both clinical and recreational drivers behind the growth. While ketamine can be effective for depression under medical supervision, self-medication poses significant risks due to its addictive potential and potential for misuse.</p>

          <p>The UN human rights chief has called on the United States to withdraw sanctions imposed on judges of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in response to arrest warrants issued for Israeli officials, including Benjamin Netanyahu, and investigations into alleged US war crimes in Afghanistan. Volker Türk expressed profound concern over the sanctions, emphasizing that attacks against judges undermine the rule of law. The ICC has also condemned the sanctions, asserting they are a clear attempt to undermine its independence and target victims seeking accountability. The sanctions require the blocking of property and interests owned by the judges in the US, raising concerns about hindering the court's ability to address international crimes.</p>

          <p>Russia launched extensive drone and missile strikes on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, resulting in at least three deaths and numerous injuries, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The strikes targeted various civilian and military sites, prompting Zelenskyy to urge America, Europe, and the rest of the world to unite in pressuring Russia to end the war. Zelenskyy emphasized that a lack of pressure on Russia equates to complicity in the ongoing conflict and its resulting loss of lives. Russia's defense ministry stated that the strikes were a response to Ukrainian "terrorist acts."</p>

          <p>A legal battle has emerged over the $275 million estate of the late Jimmy Buffett, with his widow, Jane Buffett, seeking the removal of co-trustee Richard Mozenter. Jane alleges that Mozenter has been hostile and uncooperative, failing to provide essential information about the marital trust's assets and finances. Mozenter has reportedly filed his own petition in Florida to remove her as co-trustee and representative of the estate. Jane's filing claims that Mozenter estimated the marital trust would generate less than $2 million annually, which she believes is an insufficient return and indicates incompetence or ill intent.</p>

          <p>The United States' global leadership is diminishing as other nations, particularly China, step in to fill the void. Decisions affecting global aviation safety, pandemic response, and cybersecurity are being made without American leadership, potentially binding the U.S. to rules it had no hand in setting. The author emphasizes the need for the U.S. to prioritize diplomacy, strengthen alliances, and recommit to international bodies. While valuing diplomacy and prioritizing international institutions may not be popular political slogans, the author argues that it's crucial for Congress to provide ballast and ensure U.S. global leadership.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the challenges of defining success for the United States men’s national team (USMNT) during the upcoming Concacaf Gold Cup. While winning the tournament is the expected goal, the absence of key players and the tournament's perceived lack of prestige make it difficult to gauge progress. The author suggests that a successful summer could involve identifying new depth pieces, cultivating a stronger team identity, and showcasing improved intensity. With several key players absent, the tournament offers an opportunity for new faces to emerge and make their case for inclusion in the World Cup team.</p>

The film stars Nick Kroll and Andrew Rannells as characters loosely based on Crano and Craig, and it follows the couple's journey to become fathers, including a heartbreaking experience with adoption fraud.

The final third of the adaptation introduces a novel character, Detective Fortinbras, who investigates the tragedy's fatalities, revealing a clumsy use of voice-overs.

          <p>The California Department of Public Health is moving to suspend the licenses of seven Southern California nursing facilities with repeated violations contributing to patient deaths. These facilities received at least two "AA" violations within the last two years, indicating failures that substantially contributed to a resident's death. The state investigations found failures and oversights directly contributed to residents’ deaths, such as withholding insulin and neglecting to monitor blood sugar. Facilities in violation frequently resolve citations through appeals, settlements, or other routes that lower the severity level of their violation.</p>

          <p>Recreational salmon fishing has resumed in California after a two-year shutdown, but with strict limits to help the population recover. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is limiting ocean fishing under quotas in two windows during the summer and fall. The first period will allow for up to 7,000 salmon to be caught statewide, with additional stretches possible if the limit isn't reached. The fishing industry depends on fall-run Chinook, which have been impacted by factors including dams, habitat loss, and global warming.</p>

The scale of the agriculture is surprisingly vast for a region not considered a major population center, particularly given the challenging growing conditions and the availability of wild rice nearby.

Scientists analyzed ancient DNA from 60 individuals to confirm the existence of a Neolithic society that traced its descent through the female line.
