          <p>Air Canada plans to restart its flight schedule after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants. The work stoppage, which stranded over 100,000 travelers globally, was halted when the Jobs Minister referred the dispute to the Canada Industrial Relations Board, forcing both parties into arbitration. While initial flights will resume Sunday evening, the airline anticipates it will take seven to ten days to fully stabilize its schedule, with some cancellations expected. The core of the dispute remains unresolved issues over pay and unpaid work, with the union rejecting the airline's latest offer.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has formally complained to Japan after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering and several cabinet members visited the Yasukuni Shrine. The shrine honors convicted war criminals among others, and such visits are viewed by China as a provocation against historical justice. Beijing urged Japan to reflect on its history of aggression and sever ties with militarism. The visits, marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender, have also sparked anger online within China, particularly targeting specific ministers who attended in person.</p>

          <p>Recent events in the Middle East include an Israeli military strike on what it described as a Houthi energy infrastructure site deep inside Yemen, conducted in response to repeated attacks by the Iran-backed group. In Israel, widespread protests have erupted, with demonstrators blocking major roads and calling for a general strike to demand a hostage release deal and an end to the war in Gaza. This domestic pressure comes as Israel's security cabinet approves plans to seize Gaza City, continuing its long-running offensive against Hamas. The US has also suspended all visitor visas for people from Gaza pending a review.</p>

          <p>Thorne Island, a derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort off the Pembrokeshire coast, has been renovated into a luxury party space and is now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned property in 2017 and spent nearly five years and a significant investment to make it habitable, overcoming challenges like having no running water or electricity. The historic fort, originally built to defend against French naval attacks, is now equipped with 40 beds, modern amenities, and its own nightclub. The renovation has revived the island's former life as a unique venue for events and parties.</p>

The storm is currently churning over the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to the region, with a tropical storm warning in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center noted the storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," which can cause temporary weakening before potential re-intensification. Current projections show Erin is not expected to make landfall in the United States.</p>

          <p>Germany has suspended its humanitarian visa programs, potentially preventing around 300 Russian and Belarusian dissidents from obtaining entry, according to the Ark project (Kovcheg). This decision affects individuals fleeing persecution for opposing the Kremlin and the war in Ukraine, including some whose visas had already been approved by the German Foreign Office but are now blocked by the Interior Ministry. The suspension is part of a broader policy shift towards tougher migration rules under the new government coalition. This leaves many critics of the Russian regime in precarious situations in former Soviet countries where they risk extradition or abduction.</p>

          <p>Germany's governing coalition is at odds over how to expand the country's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, to meet NATO personnel targets. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius of the SPD has proposed a bill to make voluntary service more attractive, including higher pay and modernized training. However, members of the CDU/CSU coalition partners argue this is insufficient and advocate for a quicker path to reinstating compulsory service, which was suspended in 2011. The draft law includes mandatory elements like a questionnaire for all 18-year-olds and a future medical check-up for men, but stops short of full conscription for now.</p>

In exchange for free tuition, students may participate in mandatory work programs or commit to several years of military service after graduation.

What began as a tool for cheating has become a ubiquitous habit for students managing heavy workloads, summarizing readings, and polishing assignments, with surveys showing near-universal use. This shift is forcing a reckoning among faculty, many of whom are reverting to in-class, handwritten assignments to ensure academic integrity, while students desire more practical, project-based learning that AI cannot easily replicate. The article argues that universities must fundamentally redesign classroom practices to adapt to this new technological reality.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the Supreme Court's 2023 decision ending race-based affirmative action, the Trump administration is increasing its scrutiny of university admissions processes. The White House has mandated that all federally funded universities submit detailed admissions data to the Department of Education to ensure compliance and prevent the use of "racial proxies." Amid this pressure, some policy experts are advocating for class-based affirmative action as a legal alternative to promote both racial and economic diversity. However, there are concerns that the administration may also challenge these class-based programs if they result in increased racial diversity.</p>

The "Election Rigging Response Act" would temporarily set aside the map created by California's independent redistricting commission, potentially allowing Democrats to pick up five GOP-held seats. This high-stakes political gamble is seen as a way for Newsom to boost his national profile ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run, but it faces challenges from voters who have previously supported independent redistricting.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led states of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio are sending hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington D.C. to support the Trump administration's federal intervention in the city. The deployment is part of a broader federal crackdown on crime and homelessness, which was initiated through an executive order that also federalized local police forces. This move escalates the federal presence in the capital and has been met with protests from residents and local leaders who view it as a politically motivated overreach, particularly as city data shows violent crime is lower than during Trump's first term.</p>

          <p>After finishing as runner-up for three consecutive seasons, Arsenal is entering what is considered a crucial year for manager Mikel Arteta, with expectations heightened by £190 million in summer signings. The club has strengthened its squad with key additions like midfielder Martin Zubimendi and striker Viktor Gyokeres, aiming to add the depth and goal-scoring threat needed to win the Premier League. Arteta has focused on increasing the team's directness and tactical flexibility to break down defenses. With a squad now largely in its peak age range, there is significant pressure on the team to secure a major trophy this season.</p>

          <p>Phoenix cold case detectives successfully captured Bryan Patrick Miller, the notorious "canal killer" responsible for two murders in the early 1990s, through an elaborate undercover sting. In 2015, a detective met Miller, a local "Zombie Hunter" character, at a Chili's restaurant under the pretense of an interview. The goal was to covertly obtain his DNA from a water glass. The DNA was a match to evidence found on victims Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas, who were both killed while biking along city canals. After an eight-year legal process, Miller was convicted and sentenced to death in 2023.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has brokered a deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to China, on the condition that they share 15% of the revenue with the U.S. government. This move reverses a previous block on these exports and has been criticized by trade experts as setting a "dangerous precedent" that suggests national security-based export controls are for sale. Critics argue the deal, which the White House calls a "revenue-sharing" agreement, could be considered an export tax, raising legal and constitutional questions. The arrangement highlights a transactional approach to trade policy that could destabilize international trading relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is hosting a major exhibition of works by 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, with a stated emphasis on the artist's "Russianness." The exhibition, organized with Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, showcases Repin's connection to key periods of Russian art history. This framing comes in a politically charged context, as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has also claimed Repin, who was born in present-day Ukraine, as part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition highlights the use of cultural diplomacy to reinforce political narratives and alliances between China and Russia.</p>

          <p>New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim is tasked with reviving the club after a self-described "disaster season," promising that "the good days are coming." Amorim is implementing a new tactical system based on a three-defender formation and has made significant summer signings to fit this style, costing around £200 million. He has also established a new six-player leadership group to manage the dressing room and has reduced his media commitments to focus more on coaching. With a challenging opening set of fixtures, there is immense pressure on Amorim to deliver immediate improvement and achieve European qualification.</p>
