          <p>Jackie Norris, Des Moines Public School Board Chair and former Michelle Obama chief of staff, ended her U.S. Senate campaign following public criticism. The backlash stemmed from her advocating "radical empathy" for former superintendent Ian Andre Roberts, an illegal immigrant with an extensive criminal record. Roberts resigned after his ICE arrest, which revealed fake degrees and drug convictions, prompting Norris to focus on board accountability and ongoing investigations. This article highlights the significant political fallout from the controversy, with Norris stating the crisis demanded her full attention and put her in the crosshairs of "vicious and coordinated attacks."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly confirmed authorizing the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, a rare admission for such sensitive activities. This comes amidst increased U.S. military presence in the Caribbean, including B-52 bomber flights and recent strikes on suspected drug boats that have killed 27 people. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has appealed for peace, while Trump justifies the actions by citing drug trafficking and the emptying of Venezuelan prisons into the U.S. The article also notes the sudden retirement of US Southern Command Admiral Alvin Holsey, adding to the regional instability.</p>

          <p>Indiana University has ordered its student newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student (IDS), to cease printing news editions and fired its director of student media, Jim Rodenbush, who served as the paper's adviser. Students and Rodenbush allege these actions constitute censorship, stemming from disagreements over print content. University officials state the move is a shift to a digital-first model to address financial deficits, while free expression groups condemn the university's actions as a violation of press freedom. The IDS published a digital front page declaring "CENSORED" in large red letters in response.</p>
