          <p>Competitive eater Joey Chestnut has won the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, consuming 70.5 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes to reclaim his title. Chestnut returned to the event after being banned in 2024 over a sponsorship dispute with a rival brand. While he fell short of his 2021 world record of 76 hot dogs, his victory was enthusiastically received by the crowd. In the women's competition, Miki Sudo secured her 11th win by eating 33 hot dogs and buns.</p>

          <p>Five Manchester United players, including Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, have reportedly informed the club of their desire to leave. The group, which also includes Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Tyrell Malacia, has been given an extended break to explore their options before the pre-season begins. This development follows a period of tension, with Rashford having been loaned to Aston Villa last season and Garnacho being left out of the squad for the final Premier League game. The club has stated it will support the players with training facilities if their futures are not resolved.</p>

          <h2>Health Experts Detail Physical Toll of Competitive Hot Dog Eating</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 13:11:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, health experts are detailing the significant physical strains of competitive eating. The practice can lead to a permanently stretched stomach, impacting gastric emptying, and poses risks from ingesting massive amounts of calories, sodium, and fat in a short period. A 2007 University of Pennsylvania study observed a competitive eater's stomach expanding into a "massively distended, food-filled sac." While the body can often regulate itself afterward, immediate dangers include choking, aspirating, or tearing the esophagus, highlighting the serious health concerns associated with the sport.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in California, named the Madre Fire, has rapidly expanded to over 52,500 acres, making it the largest blaze in the state for 2025. Originating in the Los Padres National Forest, the fire has prompted evacuation orders in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. With only 10% containment, the fire threatens 50 structures, though no injuries have been reported yet. State and federal agencies are coordinating a full response, including air tankers and ground crews, as smoke spreads across nearby counties.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that "discussions are ongoing" to form a new left-wing political party. The announcement follows ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana's decision to quit the party to co-found the new venture with him. Corbyn praised Sultana's move and stated that the "democratic foundations of a new kind of political party will soon take shape" to provide an alternative to the current government. The new party is expected to be built around the small group of independent pro-Gaza MPs that Corbyn currently coordinates in Parliament.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing condemnation from Jewish advocacy groups after using the antisemitic term "Shylocks" during a speech in Iowa. While discussing tax changes in his spending bill, Trump used the slur, which originates from a Shakespearean character and perpetuates stereotypes about Jewish people and greed. The Anti-Defamation League called the term "extremely offensive and dangerous," while Trump later claimed he was unaware of its antisemitic connotations. The incident has drawn parallels to a similar gaffe by then-Vice President Joe Biden in 2014, for which he later apologized.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a complaint alleging that scammers stole over $250,000 in cryptocurrency by impersonating the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee. The perpetrators used fraudulent email addresses, subtly misspelling the official domain, to deceive victims into sending donations. The emails, sent in December, purported to be from the committee's co-chair and successfully tricked at least one victim into transferring 250,300 in USDT stablecoin. The U.S. government is now seeking to seize nearly $40,400 of the stolen funds recovered from a Binance account linked to an individual in Nigeria.</p>

While arms manufacturers like Rheinmetall have seen their stock prices soar, economists are skeptical about the broader economic benefits.

Critics argue the spending may primarily boost corporate profits rather than providing a substantial, sustainable stimulus for the German economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, stated he feels "politically homeless" in a social media post, arguing the Democratic party no longer supports a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. He expressed his belief in "techno-capitalism," a system that encourages wealth creation while also ensuring its wide distribution. Altman criticized what he perceives as a shift in the party's focus, stating he would rather hear candidates discuss how to elevate everyone's standard of living than how to eliminate billionaires. His comments appeared to be a response to a New York City mayoral candidate who recently said billionaires should not exist.</p>

          <p>A 90-day freeze on sweeping U.S. tariffs, announced by the Trump administration in April, is set to expire on July 9, creating economic uncertainty. If new trade agreements are not finalized, substantial duties could be imposed on imports from numerous countries, potentially fueling inflation and harming businesses. While the administration has announced deals with nations like China and the U.K., the status of many others remains unresolved. Experts suggest the deadline may be extended for some countries engaged in good-faith negotiations, while others could face significant tariff hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton concluded his second-round Wimbledon match against Rinky Hijikata in just 70 seconds on Friday, a day after it was controversially suspended due to fading light. Shelton was about to serve for the match at 5-4 in the third set on Thursday when play was halted, prompting frustration from the player and jeers from the crowd. He returned to the court and fired three aces and an unreturnable serve to seal the victory. Shelton later explained the suspension was due to the impending shutdown of the Hawk-Eye line-calling system.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade pact with Vietnam that includes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on items transshipped through the country from elsewhere. This move directly targets the practice of Chinese manufacturers rerouting goods through Vietnam to evade higher U.S. tariffs. However, economists and trade experts have raised questions about the feasibility of enforcing such a rule, as it would require defining what constitutes a "made in Vietnam" product versus a transshipment. The deal signals a broader U.S. strategy to use bilateral trade negotiations to pressure China's supply chains.</p>

          <p>Despite Chinese state media calling for tighter regulations on "blind box" toys to prevent addiction among children, analysts believe Pop Mart, the maker of the popular Labubu dolls, will remain resilient. The company's primary demographic consists of young adults, not the young children targeted by the proposed regulations. Furthermore, Pop Mart's significant and growing overseas sales, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, provide a cushion against potential domestic headwinds. The company's revenue more than doubled last year, driven by the "dopamine economy" appeal of its collectible, mystery-packaged toys.</p>

The Taliban, which seized power in 2021, called the recognition a "historic step" and a positive message to the world. However, the move was condemned by former Afghan officials and activists, who noted it legitimizes a regime that severely restricts human rights, particularly for women and girls.</p>

Musk, who had previously labeled the legislation the "DEBT SLAVERY bill," backed Paul's statement that the budget "explodes the deficit." The bill, which passed the House and awaits Trump's signature, includes large tax cuts and significant new spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated it could add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over a decade, a figure the White House has disputed.

          <p>An opinion piece draws parallels between modern domestic military deployments and the historical events leading to the American Revolution. The article argues that while the Stamp Act ignited conflict, it was the imposition of martial law in Boston under the 1774 Coercive Acts that transformed resistance into a full-scale revolution. By dissolving local governance and deploying an occupying army, Britain escalated tensions, leading to events like the clash at Lexington Green. The Declaration of Independence itself cites the presence of standing armies without legislative consent as a primary grievance, offering a historical lesson on the dangers of military overreach.</p>

          <p>An international security affairs specialist has suggested that the U.S. could learn from China's model of industrial development to rejuvenate its rust-belt cities. Following a trip to China, Professor Robert Pape highlighted the "Wuhan model," where second-tier cities successfully integrate university research with private industry to foster advanced manufacturing clusters. He pointed to Wuhan's Optics Valley as an example of how this strategy has propelled a city's innovative and industrial strength. This approach could offer a new path for economic revitalization in struggling American industrial regions and potentially stabilize U.S.-China relations.</p>
