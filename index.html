          <p>US companies have announced a record £150 billion investment package in the UK during President Donald Trump's state visit, promising over 7,600 new jobs. The majority of this funding, £90 billion, comes from Blackstone, with additional significant contributions from Microsoft and Google. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the investments as a testament to Britain's economic strength and openness, despite some criticism that the job creation is small compared to recent losses. This article highlights a major boost to the UK economy, particularly in data centers, life sciences, advanced manufacturing, defense innovation, and AI.</p>

          <p>This article explores the pervasive anger and division gripping America in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, arguing it is the nation's most significant problem. It criticizes the online mobs and public figures, including Donald Trump and Elon Musk, who harness anger as a political tool, often for engagement and outrage. The author contrasts this with past Democratic presidents who promoted hope and conciliation. The piece concludes by expressing disgust at those who celebrated Kirk's death online, highlighting a deeply polarized society where reconciliation seems increasingly difficult.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk announced that its once-daily oral semaglutide pill demonstrated 'significant' weight reduction and good tolerability in late-stage trials, mirroring the efficacy of its injectable Wegovy. The Phase 3 Oasis 4 trial showed an average weight reduction of 16.6% after 64 weeks in patients with obesity or overweight. This article highlights the intensifying race for oral obesity treatments, offering a crucial alternative for patients who prefer pills over injections.

          <p>Following the US Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, analysts anticipate China's central bank will likely engage in moderate easing, which creates more room for looser monetary policy. The Fed reduced its benchmark borrowing rate by 0.25 percentage points. This article highlights that the offshore yuan strengthened overnight after the Fed's announcement, reaching a high of 7.086 per US dollar. Experts forecast a smaller rate cut pace from the People's Bank of China compared to the Fed, narrowing the interest rate gap and easing capital outflow pressures, thus supporting the yuan.
