The event, held at the National Memorial Arboretum, featured tributes, a two-minute silence, and a flypast, remembering the 71,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers who died. In a message, the King praised the veterans' courage and sacrifice, acknowledging the suffering of prisoners of war, civilians, and the victims of the atomic bombings in Japan, while emphasizing the importance of their victory for liberty.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum has walked back her controversial comments about Caitlin Clark and her All-Star team, stating she made a "bad joke" during a press conference. Plum had previously pointed out that no members of Team Clark attended a meeting about a player-led protest, which drew backlash as Clark was seen wearing the protest t-shirt. Speaking on a podcast, Plum explained she was trying to lighten the mood in a serious moment and acknowledged she should have been more aware of the context surrounding the CBA negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Buyback program is experiencing significant delays, with a backlog of 72,730 applications as of July. This initiative allows public service employees to retroactively make payments for periods of forbearance or deferment to qualify for loan cancellation sooner. However, the processing bottleneck, which has worsened under the current administration, leaves many borrowers waiting months for a response. Despite the delays, consumer advocates still recommend eligible borrowers apply while also exploring other repayment options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has been indicted by a federal grand jury on corruption charges, making her the first mayor in the city's history to be federally charged while in office. The indictment alleges she used her position to foster a romantic relationship with her bodyguard, using city funds for personal travel and a city-owned apartment for their meetings. Cantrell and the bodyguard are accused of wire fraud, obstruction of justice, and lying to federal agents, marking a significant escalation in the legal troubles that have defined her turbulent second term.</p>

The lawsuit centered on Stewartson's public accusations that Patel was a "Kremlin asset" and involved in planning the January 6th Capitol attack. The judge ruled that Stewartson acted with malice and failed to respond to the lawsuit, though noted that Patel's lawyers offered little evidence of specific damages.

          <p>Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasters predicting it could become a major hurricane early next week. As of Friday, the Category 1 storm was located east of the Leeward Islands and was moving west-northwest, prompting tropical storm watches for several Caribbean islands. While current forecast models show the hurricane curving northward and remaining offshore from the U.S. East Coast, officials urge those in the Caribbean to monitor its progress due to the potential for heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions.</p>

          <p>Carrie Wheeler is stepping down as CEO of the online real estate company Opendoor following a period of intense pressure from activist investors.

Investors like Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois had been publicly calling for a leadership change to steer the company back toward growth. Technology chief Shrisha Radhakrishna has been named interim leader while the company searches for a permanent replacement.</p>

          <p>As the world marks the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, this article revisits the dark history of Unit 731, the Japanese army's covert biological and chemical warfare research unit. This division conducted horrific human experiments on prisoners during the war, and its legacy continues to be a source of controversy and pain. The anniversary provides a moment to reflect on these atrocities, which often receive less attention than other events of the war. The report also notes a shift in the current U.S. administration's focus regarding human rights.</p>

          <p>Activist hedge fund Starboard Value has increased its stake in Salesforce by 47%, sparking a rally in the company's stock and speculation of renewed investor pressure. Starboard was instrumental in a successful activist campaign in 2022-2023 that pushed Salesforce toward greater profitability, and its renewed interest suggests it may advocate for further changes. Analysts believe this could pressure management to refocus on core business growth and margin expansion, particularly as the stock has struggled recently amid concerns about its AI strategy and a potential acquisition.

          <p>A DeKalb County judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester arrested in connection with demonstrations against the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, known as 'Cop City'. The judge ruled that the state violated Marsicano's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to issue an indictment more than two years after the arrest. This decision is seen as a significant victory for opponents of the training center, who have faced sweeping charges, including RICO indictments, for their activism. Marsicano's attorney argued the state was deliberately using the legal process as a form of punishment.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that children experiencing a mental health crisis are frequently left waiting in emergency departments for days before receiving appropriate inpatient care. The research, which analyzed Medicaid data, found that about one in ten such visits result in a child "boarding" in the ER for three days or longer, often for issues like depression and suicidal ideation. This problem is attributed to a severe nationwide shortage of pediatric psychiatric inpatient beds and outpatient services. Experts warn that these long waits in unsuitable environments can worsen a child's condition.</p>

The agency stated the panel's goal is to recommend vaccines with fewer adverse reactions. This is the latest in a series of actions by Kennedy to scrutinize U.S. vaccine policies, including replacing an expert advisory committee with members who are skeptical of vaccines.</p>

          <p>The common kitchen spice clove may offer several health benefits beyond its use in cooking, according to various research. Studies suggest that eugenol, a compound in cloves, has antimicrobial properties that can improve gum health and may help lower blood sugar levels. Cloves are also a source of essential minerals like magnesium and potassium, and they contain antioxidants that protect cells from damage. While generally safe in food quantities, concentrated clove oil and eugenol can be harmful if consumed in large amounts and should be used with caution.</p>

          <p>As the Social Security program celebrates its 90th anniversary, it faces significant long-term financial pressures and declining public confidence. The program, which provides benefits to nearly 70 million Americans, is projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034 due to outgoings exceeding income, which could lead to a 23% cut in benefits if no action is taken. The challenges are compounded by concerns over staffing cuts made by the Trump administration. Potential solutions, such as raising the payroll tax cap or increasing the retirement age, remain politically contentious. (not investment advice)</p>

The review highlights the film's powerful ending, where the villain is defeated, providing a moment of cinematic catharsis. However, it also notes that the film astutely reminds the audience that this victory does not erase the profound trauma and grief the characters have endured.</p>

In a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Hawley demanded the preservation of documents to determine if Meta's AI products enable child exploitation.

In contrast, a separate Congressional Budget Office report suggests that while top earners will benefit most, the lowest-income households could see their resources decrease due to cuts in social programs like Medicaid and SNAP.
