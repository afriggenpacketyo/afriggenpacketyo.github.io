            <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in an antitrust trial where the FTC is challenging Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing they stifled competition. The FTC alleges Meta bought these platforms to eliminate threats to its dominance in social media. Zuckerberg acknowledged Facebook struggled with mobile users before the acquisitions but defended the purchases as beneficial for the apps' growth. Meta contends it faces stiff competition from platforms like TikTok and YouTube, and breaking up the company would harm American innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Harvard University is refusing to comply with demands from the Trump administration to end DEI programs, adopt merit-based admissions, and cooperate with immigration authorities. Harvard President Alan Garber asserted the school will not surrender its independence or constitutional rights, even if it means losing $9 billion in federal funding. The Trump administration argues Harvard failed to meet intellectual and civil rights conditions justifying federal investment, but Harvard contends the demands violate its First Amendment rights. This confrontation follows similar actions against other universities like Columbia, Cornell and Northwestern.</p>

            <p>A group of small businesses is suing President Trump to block new tariffs, arguing he illegally claimed trade deficits constitute an emergency. The lawsuit alleges Trump usurped Congress' power to levy tariffs through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The businesses argue trade deficits, which have persisted for decades without economic harm, do not constitute an emergency or an unusual threat. The Liberty Justice Center, representing the companies, says the tariffs are devastating small businesses and violate the principle of no taxation without representation.</p>

Attorney General Pam Bondi falsely claimed Abrego Garcia was illegally in the country, and President Bukele of El Salvador insisted he could not smuggle him back into the US.

            <p>Los Angeles County faces $2 billion in fire recovery costs and a $4 billion sex abuse settlement, leading to budget cuts of $89 million. The county will leave hundreds of vacant positions unfilled, but no layoffs are expected. Fire recovery includes lost revenue and costs for soil testing, debris removal, and beach cleanup. The sex abuse settlement stems from claims in juvenile facilities and foster homes, requiring significant annual payments until 2030.</p>

James split time between the NBA and G League, showing improvement in the latter, and is now aiming to improve further.</p>

            <p>President Trump is considering a temporary pause on auto tariffs to allow carmakers more time to relocate production to the U.S. Trump acknowledged that automakers need time to shift production from Canada, Mexico, and elsewhere. The 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars are likely to increase car prices, and Trump's potential reversal comes after economists raised concerns about a possible recession. Experts believe that the price of a typical car could rise by between $5,000 to $10,000 due to the new tariffs.</p>

The mission has faced some criticism for being tourism rather than space science, but supporters argue it accelerates innovation and makes space more accessible.</p>

            <p>Ghana announced a ban on all foreigners trading in its local gold market, effective May 1, as part of reforms to boost foreign exchange reserves and stabilize the local currency. The Ghana Gold Board (GoldBod) will have exclusive authority to regulate artisanal and small-scale gold mining. This move is aimed at addressing illegal mining activities and promoting responsible practices in the sector. Industry experts believe the move could transform the country’s multibillion-dollar artisanal and small-scale (ASM) mining sector.</p>
