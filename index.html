        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing weakening buyer demand due to economic concerns, U.S. homebuilders are cutting prices at the highest rate in three years. According to a National Association of Home Builders survey, 38% of builders reduced prices in July, with an average reduction of 5%. Despite a slight rise in builder confidence, overall sentiment remains negative, driven by affordability issues and elevated mortgage rates. This trend signals ongoing challenges in the housing sector, with single-family starts projected to decline in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is accelerating its U.S. production timeline by several quarters due to strong demand from its leading American customers. The world's largest contract chip manufacturer is investing $165 billion in Arizona for six manufacturing facilities, two packaging plants, and an R&D center. The announcement came during an earnings call where TSMC reported a record-high quarterly profit, a nearly 61% year-over-year increase. The company acknowledged uncertainty regarding potential U.S. tariffs but stated it has not yet seen changes in customer behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Tomorrowland electronic dance music festival in Belgium have confirmed the event will go on, despite a major fire destroying its main stage just days before opening. The blaze occurred on Wednesday evening, but no injuries were reported, and the festival site has been declared safe. With 400,000 attendees expected over two weekends, organizers are working on contingency plans, as the main stage was one of 15 performance areas. Festival-goers have arrived at the campsite, expressing a subdued but determined attitude to enjoy the event regardless of the setback.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a potential 30% tariff on EU imports, this article examines President Trump's claims that Europe does not purchase American cars or agricultural products. Trade data from 2024 shows these claims are inaccurate, as the EU was the fourth-largest buyer of U.S. agricultural goods and imported approximately 165,000 American vehicles. While a significant trade imbalance exists in both sectors, the EU remains a key market for these U.S. exports. The analysis provides context on existing tariffs, regulations, and market factors influencing the trade relationship between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), a major producer of high fructose corn syrup, dropped after President Trump announced that Coca-Cola had agreed to use real cane sugar in its U.S. products. While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, the announcement caused ADM's stock to fall by as much as 6% in premarket trading. The Corn Refiners Association warned the switch could cost American jobs and increase foreign sugar imports.

          <p>A recent uptick in inflation is causing concern for homeowners with variable-rate loans like Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). With the Consumer Price Index rising, the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate, which will likely keep HELOC rates elevated. If inflation continues to climb, further rate hikes could occur, increasing borrowing costs for consumers. Despite the higher rate environment, HELOCs remain a more affordable borrowing option compared to credit cards and personal loans, though borrowers should carefully consider the risks of fluctuating payments.

          <p>A new study has found that first-generation migrants in Germany earn nearly 20% less than native-born workers, a gap that persists into the second generation at 7.7%. Researchers concluded the disparity is not due to unequal pay for the same job, but rather structural barriers that limit migrants' access to higher-paying industries and roles. The report compared Germany to eight other Western nations, finding that countries like Canada are more successful at closing the wage gap for second-generation migrants.

          <p>In a move illustrating the personal nature of the administration's actions against perceived critics, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was barred from a CIA graduation ceremony for a bomb-sniffing dog he sponsored. The dog, named Susan after Clapper's late wife, was trained to protect agency personnel. However, CIA officials cited a presidential executive order stripping Clapper of his security clearance as the reason for disinviting him from the unclassified event. The incident is framed as part of a broader, retribution-focused campaign against former officials deemed part of the 'deep state.'</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal heard that a nurse's confrontation with a transgender doctor in a hospital changing room was 'unacceptable.' Nurse Sandie Peggie is suing NHS Fife after being suspended for her actions on Christmas Eve 2023, when she told Dr. Beth Upton, a trans woman, that she should not be in the female changing room. A head of nursing testified that Peggie should have raised her concerns through official channels rather than confronting a colleague. The case highlights ongoing workplace tensions and legal questions surrounding gender identity and single-sex spaces.</p>

          <p>Germany's national railway, Deutsche Bahn (DB), is experiencing its biggest crisis in 30 years, with punctuality at historic lows and frequent cancellations. The issues stem from decades of underinvestment in the country's 33,500-kilometer rail network, much of which is outdated and prone to failure. A massive refurbishment program is underway, but it requires extensive line closures, such as the upcoming nine-month shutdown of the critical Berlin-Hamburg route. This overhaul is causing further disruptions and cost overruns, with little hope for improved service in the near future.</p>

          <p>The city of Minot, North Dakota, is engaged in a difficult battle against a burgeoning population of Richardson's ground squirrels. These native rodents, which can number in the tens of thousands, are causing extensive damage by burrowing under sidewalks, foundations, and lawns throughout the city. With few natural predators in urban areas, their numbers have soared, creating a nuisance and potential health hazard. Despite efforts led by pest control professionals, officials acknowledge that eradicating the squirrels is impossible and are focused on population control in a challenging, ongoing fight.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to lower the voting age to 16 for all elections across the United Kingdom, a move that will add approximately 1.5 million young people to the electorate.

These changes represent the most significant alteration to the UK electorate since 1969. The proposal, a key Labour manifesto promise, aims to give young people who can work and pay taxes a say in the country's governance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Euro 2025 takes place, a notable difference between men's and women's international soccer is the lack of ethnic diversity on many women's teams. While fan culture in women's soccer is often seen as more inclusive, the on-field representation does not always reflect the diversity of the nations competing. Teams like England and Germany have significantly fewer non-white players than their male counterparts, while France stands out with a more diverse squad. This disparity is attributed to barriers to access at the grassroots level, prompting football associations to launch initiatives to improve diversity.</p>
