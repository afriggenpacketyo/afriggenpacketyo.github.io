          <p>A violent incident in Kentucky began when a suspect shot and injured a state trooper during a traffic stop. The gunman then carjacked a vehicle and fled to Richmond Road Baptist Church in Lexington, where he opened fire, killing two women aged 72 and 32 and injuring two other parishioners. Law enforcement officers who pursued the suspect to the church ultimately shot and killed him at the scene. Investigators believe the shooter had a connection to individuals at the church, which the local coroner described as a small, tight-knit community.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's Cole Palmer delivered a stunning performance to secure the FIFA Club World Cup title against Paris Saint-Germain. The 23-year-old attacking midfielder single-handedly dismantled the European champions in the first half, scoring two nearly identical goals with composed, clinical finishes. Palmer then provided a brilliant assist for teammate João Pedro, effectively ending the contest before halftime with a 3-0 lead. This commanding display at the MetLife Stadium has been widely hailed as the moment Palmer launched himself into global superstardom, showcasing his exceptional talent on a major international stage.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge on the park's North Rim, forcing an early closure of the area for the season. The Bravo Dragon fire, which originated from a lightning strike, also consumed the visitor center, a gas station, and other park facilities. Officials reported no injuries, but the destruction of a water treatment plant released chlorine gas, prompting the evacuation of firefighters and hikers from the inner canyon. The original lodge, a beloved landmark known for its massive limestone facade and ponderosa beams, was rebuilt in 1937 after a previous fire.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's security agency, the SBU, announced it has tracked down and killed the Russian agents suspected of assassinating a senior Ukrainian officer in Kyiv. The officer, Colonel Ivan Voronych, was shot in a daylight attack on Thursday, and the SBU stated the suspected agents were killed after resisting arrest. Voronych was reportedly involved in covert operations in Russian-occupied territories and played a role in a surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region. This incident is the latest in a series of high-profile killings and attacks that both Moscow and Kyiv have attributed to each other since the 2022 invasion.</p>

          <p>A report from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has identified a "cascade of preventable failures" by the U.S. Secret Service leading up to the 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The investigation concluded that significant communication breakdowns, both within the agency and with other law enforcement, were a primary cause of the security lapse. The report highlights that information about the shooter's presence was not effectively relayed to Trump's security detail in time. It also found that the Secret Service had previously denied resource requests for Trump's campaign security, and it accuses former Director Kimberly Cheatle of providing false testimony to Congress.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom experienced its final day of a significant heatwave, with temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F) in parts of England, Scotland, and Wales. The hot weather led many people to flock to beaches and bodies of water, but also resulted in several water-related emergencies and deaths. Amber heat health alerts remain in effect for central and southern England, while millions in Yorkshire, Kent, and Sussex face hosepipe bans due to prolonged dry conditions. The Met Office forecasts a change in weather, with cooler temperatures and heavy rain expected to arrive on Monday, bringing an end to the heatwave for most areas.</p>

          <p>A child being treated at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool has died after contracting measles, a highly contagious virus. The hospital confirmed it has seen a surge in seriously unwell children with measles, treating 17 cases since June, but did not comment on the individual case to respect patient confidentiality. Health officials attribute the rise in cases to a decline in uptake of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The UK Health Security Agency warned that measles can be a particularly nasty disease for children and can lead to serious complications or, in rare cases, death.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, a former president and one-time military ruler of Nigeria, has died in a London hospital at the age of 82 after battling an undisclosed illness. A polarizing figure, Buhari first led Nigeria in 1983 after a military coup, implementing a repressive anti-corruption campaign before being ousted himself. He later returned to power as a democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023, winning on a platform of fighting corruption and insecurity. However, his presidency was marked by significant economic decline, widespread violence, and his own recurring health problems, leaving behind a complex and fraught legacy.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal, is advancing a sanctions bill designed to give President Trump a "sledgehammer" against Russia's economy. The legislation would allow the president to impose tariffs up to 500% on countries like China, India, and Brazil that support Russia's war effort by purchasing its goods. The senators described the measure as a turning point, coming after months of President Trump expressing growing frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to de-escalate the conflict in Ukraine. The bill aims to provide maximum flexibility to the president to pressure Moscow and its economic partners.</p>

Her mission is to provide a space for community connection and personal healing through art, a practice she found important in her own life.

According to a recent study, nearly half of Gen Z singles now use AI to improve their dating game, a significant increase from the previous year.

This comes as top administration officials have intensified their criticism of the Fed, particularly targeting a renovation project at its headquarters. The ongoing public pressure and investigation into the Fed's management appear to be part of a strategy to potentially justify Powell's removal. (not investment advice)</p>
