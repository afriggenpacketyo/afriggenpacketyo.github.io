        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ferrari shares experienced their worst trading day since the company's 2016 public listing following a disappointing financial forecast that analysts found to be overly conservative. The luxury automaker also scaled back its electric vehicle ambitions, now targeting only 20% of its lineup to be fully electric by 2030, down from a previous goal of 40%. This adjustment reflects a broader trend among global carmakers facing challenges and slowing demand in the EV market, leading to a significant drop in the company's stock value.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, an American-Israeli law professor explains the decision to nominate former President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination is tied to his efforts in securing the release of hostages from the Middle East, an act described as a personal victory against a backdrop of rising antisemitism. The author credits Trump's diplomatic impact, citing the Abraham Accords as a historic reshaping of the region's geopolitics. The article argues that his unique negotiating style and commitment to peace through strength make him a deserving candidate for the prestigious award.</p>

          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has initiated a probe into nearly 2.9 million Tesla vehicles equipped with the company's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. The investigation follows numerous reports of traffic safety violations, including instances of vehicles running red lights and making improper lane changes into oncoming traffic. According to the agency's filing, there have been 58 safety incidents linked to the system, resulting in over a dozen crashes and 23 injuries. The probe focuses on versions of the software that still require a fully attentive human driver.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has stated that Europe must confront the reality of Russian hybrid warfare, citing a pattern of disruptive activities across the Union. These tactics blend conventional military methods with subversive actions like cyberattacks, election interference, and sabotage of undersea cables to undermine adversaries without a formal declaration of war. Recent incidents include drone incursions and airspace violations in several EU member states, which von der Leyen described as a concerted campaign to sow division. The article notes that such attacks have significantly increased since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>

The airline reported third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.71 per share, beating estimates and signaling a recovery in consumer confidence and travel spending. Revenue from premium cabin segments saw a 9% increase, highlighting a trend where high-end travel continues to outperform the main cabin.

          <p>Approximately 500 National Guard soldiers from Texas and Illinois have been deployed to the Chicago area to protect federal agents and facilities, a move that has sparked a legal battle. The deployment, ordered by the Trump administration, is being challenged in court by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who argue there is no crisis warranting the military presence. A federal judge is set to hear arguments for a temporary restraining order to block the deployment, creating a tense standoff over federal authority and states' rights. The situation is unprecedented, as it involves federalizing one state's Guard to operate in another.</p>

          <p>Representative Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, has formally requested financial records related to Jeffrey Epstein from the CEOs of four major banks. The request to JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, and BNY Mellon follows a failed attempt to subpoena these records, which was blocked by Republicans. Raskin is investigating how Epstein's network conducted a reported $1.5 billion in suspicious transactions without being detected. The letters challenge the banks to cooperate and reveal the truth or risk being part of a cover-up for the international sex trafficking operation.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. airports, including those in Denver and Newark, are experiencing significant flight delays due to a shortage of air traffic controllers, a problem exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown. Federal data indicates that more air traffic control facilities are flagged for low staffing than at any point since the post-pandemic travel boom of 2022. Air traffic controllers are deemed essential workers and must work without pay during the shutdown, leading to an increase in sick calls. This staffing crunch forces the FAA to reduce the number of takeoffs and landings to maintain safety, causing system-wide disruptions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a short government shutdown may have minimal impact, a prolonged one could cause significant disruptions for travelers across the U.S. Essential employees like TSA officers and air traffic controllers are required to work without pay, but extended financial strain could lead to increased sick calls and staffing shortages, as seen in the 2018-2019 shutdown. This could result in longer security lines and flight delays. The U.S. Travel Association warns a shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion per week and halt the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, worsening an existing shortage.</p>

          <p>A Kazakh official emphasized the need for greater infrastructure investment to establish the country as a vital trade bridge between China and Europe. Vice-Minister of Trade and Integration, Asset Nussupov, highlighted that differences in customs and logistics procedures create bottlenecks for goods traveling along the route. He pointed to the Middle Corridor, a trade route crossing the Caspian Sea, as a key opportunity to realize Kazakhstan's transit potential. According to a World Bank report, trade volumes along this corridor are projected to triple by 2030, a goal that Nussupov stated is impossible without significant new investment.</p>

          <p>In a significant genetic discovery, scientists from BGI Research in China have identified the master sex-determining gene in the central bearded dragon. For these Australian lizards, sex is determined by both genetics and incubation temperature, a trait shared with reptiles like turtles and crocodiles. If eggs are incubated at 32°C or higher, some genetically male embryos will develop as females. By sequencing the lizard's genome with long-read technology, researchers were able to pinpoint the specific gene responsible for this unique biological process, advancing the understanding of temperature-dependent sex determination.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Tom Steyer has pledged $12 million to support Proposition 50, a California ballot measure aimed at redrawing the state's congressional districts. This initiative, proposed by Democrats, is a response to efforts in Republican-led states to redraw their own maps, which could impact control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Steyer's contribution makes him the largest funder of the pro-Proposition 50 campaign, which seeks to counter what he calls an "election-rigging power grab." The measure is part of a larger political battle over redistricting, a typically once-a-decade process that has become a key focus in national politics.</p>

          <p>China has expanded its licensing requirements for rare earth exports, a move that is deepening anxiety within the European Union. The new rules now cover the technology used to process these critical minerals and tighten restrictions on products containing even small amounts of Chinese-produced rare earths. The EU's ambassador to China, Jorge Toledo, stated that these retaliatory measures are causing collateral damage and hurting European companies. This action heightens concerns in the EU about its industrial supply chains and its ability to support Ukraine, as rare earths are vital for military and high-tech manufacturing.</p>

          <p>China has announced new export restrictions on rare earths and related technologies, a move analysts interpret as an effort to gain leverage in trade negotiations with the United States.

This action comes less than a month before an anticipated meeting between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. China, which processes about 90% of the world's rare earths, has previously used its market dominance as a strategic tool during trade disputes.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has appealed to North Korea to allow reunions for families separated since the Korean War, but analysts believe the plea is unlikely to be successful. Time is running out for the aging survivors, with the last reunion held in 2018. North Korea has grown more hostile, recently demolishing a traditional meeting place for the families. Experts suggest that Pyongyang has little incentive to cooperate, as its strengthened alliances with China and Russia reduce its need for goodwill gestures, and allowing contact could undermine its domestic propaganda about the South.</p>
