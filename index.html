          <p>The UK government successfully passed a vote on its contentious welfare bill, but only after making significant last-minute concessions to concerned Labour MPs. Fearing a defeat, ministers agreed to delay changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) rules until a review is completed, gutting the bill of its most substantial cost-saving measures. The chaotic process has been criticized by MPs from multiple parties and is seen as a blow to the authority of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall. The bill will now proceed to further scrutiny in the House of Commons.</p>

Mamdani, who recently won the Democratic primary, responded by calling the president's remarks an act of "intimidation" against those who speak up.

While a Santander spokesperson stated it is "business as usual for now," they did not rule out future branch closures or job cuts due to role duplication.

          <p>This opinion article argues that by passing a budget bill with over $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, the Republican party now politically "owns" the American healthcare system and its resulting problems. The legislation is projected to cause nearly 12 million people to lose health insurance, which will likely lead to increased uncompensated care costs for hospitals and higher premiums for everyone. The author posits that while Democrats were previously held responsible for healthcare issues post-ACA, this major policy shift transfers that burden to Republicans. The piece predicts a potential political backlash, as the cuts are unpopular and could create a flimsier safety net during a future recession. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill also introduces new tax breaks for seniors, tip income, and overtime pay, while simultaneously cutting spending for social programs like Medicaid and SNAP.

Despite the low player ranking, Clark will serve as an All-Star team captain due to the fan vote. The discrepancy has fueled an ongoing narrative that some WNBA players are jealous of the attention Clark receives. Commentators like Dick Vitale and Robert Griffin III criticized the player vote results, suggesting jealousy is overshadowing her positive impact on the league's popularity, salaries, and viewership.</p>

          <p>The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" contains approximately $150 billion in funding to significantly expand the Trump administration's immigration and border enforcement capabilities. The legislation allocates billions for building a border wall, increasing immigrant detention capacity, and hiring thousands of new ICE and Border Patrol agents. It would also impose unprecedented fees on asylum seekers and make it easier for local law enforcement to partner with federal immigration authorities. Critics argue these provisions will create a more punitive system and violate existing legal settlements regarding the detention of migrant children. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eighteen years after her film "Under the Same Moon" humanized the migrant experience, director Patricia Riggen says the current U.S. immigration crackdown is far worse than she could have imagined. In a recent interview, Riggen stated that today's militarized enforcement, deportations without due process, and unidentified agents remind her of fascist regimes in Latin American history. She believes her film, which told a hopeful story of a boy crossing the border to find his mother, would be "dark as hell" if made today. Riggen is currently working on a potential TV series adaptation to explore where the characters would be in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>The new film "40 Acres" is a post-apocalyptic thriller starring Danielle Deadwyler as a military veteran protecting her family from cannibals on their isolated Canadian farmstead. The review praises Deadwyler's performance as the family's matriarch, who is rooted in generational trauma and a fierce, self-reliant determination to survive. While the film's debut director, R.T. Thorne, is noted for a sometimes heavy-handed approach and blurry symbolism, the movie is described as a resolute and tense portrait of survival. The story's heart is found in the relationship between the mother and her eldest son, who yearns for a connection to the outside world.</p>

          <h2>Senate Passes Trump's Sweeping Tax and Spending Bill After All-Night Session</h2>

          <p>After a marathon all-night session, Senate Republicans narrowly passed President Trump's signature tax and spending package, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. The comprehensive bill extends the 2017 tax cuts, funds hard-line immigration policies, and imposes significant cuts and new work requirements on social safety net programs like Medicaid. The legislation, which the CBO projects will add over $3 trillion to the deficit, now returns to the House, where its passage is uncertain due to a slim Republican majority and divisions among moderates and hard-liners.</p>

          <h2>Fed Chair Powell Suggests Interest Rates Would Have Been Cut Already Without Trump's Tariff Plan</h2>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank would likely have already lowered interest rates if not for the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariff policies. Speaking at a forum in Portugal, Powell stated that when the tariffs were announced, "essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially," forcing the Fed to remain on hold. This admission provides clear context for the Fed's recent wait-and-see approach on monetary policy, despite pressure from the White House to cut rates. Powell reiterated that future decisions will be data-dependent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A severe heat wave is intensifying across Europe, with record-breaking temperatures prompting red alerts in parts of Italy and France and causing deadly conditions. The UN's weather agency warned that such extreme heat events are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. In response, tourist attractions like the Eiffel Tower and Brussels' Atomium have closed or reduced hours, while schools have shut down. Spain and Portugal have already reported their hottest June on record, and German officials are calling for new regulations to protect citizens as temperatures are expected to reach 40Â°C (104Â°F).</p>
