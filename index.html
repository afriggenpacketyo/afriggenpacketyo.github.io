          <h2>Scottish Fishing Industry Condemns EU Deal as a Betrayal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) has strongly criticized the recent 12-year deal between the UK government and the EU regarding fishing rights, labeling it a "disastrous outcome" and a "total capitulation." The agreement extends existing access for EU boats to UK waters in exchange for reduced checks on food exports. While some parts of Scotland's fishing and food production industries welcomed the deal, citing benefits such as easier access to the EU market and reduced red tape, the SFF worries that the agreement undermines the UK's negotiating leverage in future talks and continues to prioritize other interests over the fishing industry. The Scottish government also criticized the lack of consultation on the deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As economic uncertainty increases, many Americans are considering annuities to bolster their retirement savings, but experts advise careful consideration of both the advantages and disadvantages. Annuities offer guaranteed lifetime income and market volatility protection through fixed and indexed options, with tax-deferred growth and no contribution limits like 401(k)s or IRAs. However, annuities also come with fees, limited access to funds, potential early withdrawal penalties, and complex terms, while fixed annuities may face inflation risks. Before investing, it is crucial to balance investments, research the issuing company's financial strength, create a financial plan, and review current economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's diagnosis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, Dr. Ben Davies, a professor of urology, offered insights into potential treatment options. While Biden's Gleason score of 9 indicates a high-risk cancer, Davies noted that hormonal treatments, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy could extend his life. Davies emphasized that age is not necessarily a limiting factor in treatment decisions, but rather the patient's overall physiology and ability to tolerate therapies. Biden's diagnosis serves as a reminder of the impact of prostate cancer, with the American Cancer Society estimating numerous new cases and deaths in the coming year.</p>

          <p>Sleep specialists suggest that dietary habits can significantly impact sleep quality, recommending specific foods and practices to promote better rest. Incorporating foods rich in tryptophan, such as almonds, turkey, and oats, can aid in the production of serotonin and melatonin, crucial for sleep regulation. Swapping sugary and processed foods for fruits and vegetables provides essential nutrients and fiber, while avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon and alcohol right before bed can prevent sleep disruption. Additionally, it is advisable to avoid heavy meals close to bedtime to facilitate better digestion and sleep.</p>

This shift aligns Portugal with other Western European nations where hard-right parties are gaining influence. The ruling Democratic Alliance has refused to ally with Chega, but the party's rise is likely to exert pressure on the government to adopt more conservative stances on issues like immigration.</p>

These capuchins, known for their intelligence and tool use, have been observed carrying the howler infants, who often suffer from dehydration and malnutrition. While the motives remain unclear, scientists speculate that the capuchins may be engaging in this behavior out of boredom or a misplaced parental instinct. The spread of this behavior among the capuchins highlights their drive to learn from each other, even when the behavior lacks an obvious benefit.</p>

          <p>Israel has declared an expansion of its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip, aiming to seize more territory in an effort to force Hamas's surrender after over 19 months of conflict. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israeli troops could potentially take control of all of Gaza, though the specifics and feasibility of this plan remain unclear. The announcement coincides with a renewed round of cease-fire negotiations, as the Trump administration pushes for a truce. The past few days have been particularly deadly for Palestinians, with over 400 reported deaths due to Israeli strikes.</p>

          <p>Wendy McMahon has resigned from her position as president of CBS News and Stations, reportedly due to a disagreement with parent company Paramount Global over its handling of President Trump's lawsuit against "60 Minutes." McMahon was reportedly firm in her stance that Paramount Global should not settle the $20 billion lawsuit, which alleges that an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris was deceptively edited. Her departure suggests that a settlement may be imminent, as the lawsuit poses an obstacle to Paramount Global's proposed sale to Skydance Media.</p>

The Trump administration has also deregulated the Environmental Protection Agency, reversing policies that have broad public support, such as funding the replacement of lead pipes and reducing mercury pollution.
