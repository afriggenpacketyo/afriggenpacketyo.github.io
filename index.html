          <p>A former U.S. State Department employee, Michael Schena, has been sentenced to four years in prison for conspiring to transmit national defense secrets. He admitted to selling sensitive government documents for at least $10,000 to individuals he believed were agents of the Chinese government. While prosecutors could not definitively prove the documents reached Chinese agents, the case was built on Schena's belief and intent to do so. The conviction highlights the serious consequences of betraying national trust and abusing a top-secret security clearance.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order initiating the process to rename the Department of Defense back to its pre-1940s name, the Department of War. The order will initially allow the use of "Department of War" as a secondary title, with the White House arguing it conveys a stronger message of readiness and resolve. This move follows the president's long-stated belief that the "Defense" moniker is "too defensive" and politically correct. The department was originally renamed as part of a post-World War II reorganization to consolidate military agencies and move away from warlike terminology.</p>

          <p>Pro Football Hall of Famer Brett Favre discussed his decision to publicly support Donald Trump, citing what he calls a "common sense" perspective on several key issues. He stated his opposition to transgender athletes competing in girls' sports and expressed concerns over illegal immigration and crime at the border. Favre explained that he felt compelled to speak out because he believes conservatives often "sit on their hands" while the political left is more vocal. He clarified that while he doesn't agree with everything the president does, he felt it was important to take a stand.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has abandoned a proposed rule that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations within the carrier's control. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, faced strong opposition from airlines who argued it would increase ticket prices. A DOT spokesperson stated the department will reconsider extra-statutory requirements while still implementing consumer protections mandated by Congress, such as ticket refunds. Airline industry groups praised the decision, viewing it as a move away from overly burdensome regulations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aston Villa and England defender Ezri Konsa has expressed frustration over financial regulations that he says "killed" the club during the recent summer transfer window. Due to UEFA financial rules and the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR), Villa had to carefully manage their spending, resulting in a net surplus. The club's limited activity included selling academy product Jacob Ramsey and acquiring players on loan or as free agents. Konsa's comments highlight the growing impact of financial fair play regulations on clubs' ability to strengthen their squads, even after successful seasons.</p>

          <p>The lawyer for Bella Culley, a 19-year-old British woman detained in Georgia for alleged drug smuggling, has criticized the British embassy for its lack of support. Culley, who is pregnant, faces a potential life sentence after being arrested with a large quantity of marijuana and hashish, which she claims she was forced to carry. Her lawyer states the embassy has not visited since his appointment or provided necessary references. The Foreign Office maintains it is supporting the woman and is in contact with her family, though it confirmed only one in-person visit has occurred.</p>

          <p>Joseph McNeil, one of the four Black college students who initiated the landmark 1960 Greensboro lunch counter sit-ins, has passed away at the age of 83. McNeil, along with his three classmates from North Carolina A&T State University, sparked a wave of nonviolent civil rights protests across the South by refusing to leave a "whites only" Woolworth's counter. Their courageous act led to the desegregation of the Greensboro counter within six months and inspired the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. McNeil later served in the Air Force, retiring as a two-star major general.</p>

Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the administration would act if the city won't protect its citizens from "illegal alien crime."

          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, has suggested that enterprises are unlikely to adopt agentic AI browsers without robust security controls. In an interview, Arora explained that while these autonomous AI agents—which can perform tasks like booking flights—are appealing to consumers, they pose a significant security risk to businesses. He argued that because these agents require user credentials to operate, their autonomy is "at odds with the enterprise," which must protect its most sensitive data. Arora predicted that without built-in security oriented around credentials, such browsers would not be permitted in corporate environments.</p>

The memoir is not a hagiography but a deeply personal account of a turbulent, often brutal, yet ultimately life-affirming relationship.

          <p>In President Trump's second term, First Lady Melania Trump has adopted a more focused and influential public role, concentrating on issues of technology and child safety. While maintaining a relatively private profile, she has been instrumental in initiatives like the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, and a new task force on AI in education. This approach builds on her first-term "Be Best" campaign but takes a more business- and legislative-oriented tack. Analysts note she is carving out a distinct role, engaging selectively on topics where she feels she can make a substantive impact.</p>

          <p>With home equity at record highs and an anticipated interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, this article advises homeowners to ask critical questions before borrowing. Homeowners should first determine exactly how much equity they can access and assess if their financial needs are truly urgent enough to warrant a loan at current rates. It also suggests weighing the benefits of borrowing now versus waiting for potentially lower rates later in the year, while acknowledging that loans can be refinanced. The article stresses the importance of careful, strategic decision-making to avoid the risk of foreclosure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The global surge in stablecoins, digital assets pegged to fiat currencies, presents a complex challenge for Beijing. Over 99% of these stablecoins are backed by the U.S. dollar, which far exceeds the greenback's share of traditional global payments and reserves. This dominance effectively extends U.S. financial influence into the digital currency space, a trend that could undermine China's efforts to promote the yuan and reduce its reliance on the dollar. The article examines why these tokens are significant and how Beijing might navigate the risks and opportunities presented by this rapidly growing sector of the digital economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to permit the temporary removal of Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission. The request follows lower court rulings that blocked President Trump's attempt to fire her, citing federal laws that provide tenure protections to members of certain independent regulatory agencies. The administration argues that the modern FTC wields more power than its 1935 counterpart, which was the subject of a key Supreme Court precedent on this issue, and thus its commissioners should serve at the president's will. The case represents a significant challenge to the independence of federal agencies.</p>

          <p>During a contentious Senate hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended his changes to U.S. vaccine policy and repeated false claims about the risks of mRNA vaccines. He told senators he agreed with a statement that the shots cause "serious harm, including death," a claim not supported by scientific evidence. Kennedy clashed sharply with Democrats who accused him of restricting access to COVID-19 shots, arguing that anyone can still get one. The hearing followed a major leadership shake-up at the CDC and accusations from the former director that he was deliberately weakening the nation's public health system.</p>

          <p>The NBA has launched an investigation into allegations that Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard received millions in undisclosed payments from a startup partially funded by team owner Steve Ballmer. Bankruptcy documents reportedly show that Aspiration Partners, a now-bankrupt startup, had a $28 million endorsement deal with Leonard, which some allege was a way to circumvent the NBA's salary cap. The salary cap is a crucial league rule designed to ensure competitive parity by limiting team payrolls. The Clippers have denied any wrongdoing, but if a violation is found, the team could face significant penalties.</p>

O'Neill said he "had to get into them" during the interval, and the team responded immediately, with Shea Charles scoring just 25 seconds into the second half. A late goal from Justin Devenny, following a red card for a Luxembourg player, sealed the crucial victory for the team.</p>

          <p>Residents of Gloucester, Massachusetts, are dealing with a powerful "rotten egg" smell that city officials have traced to an invasive seaweed called Heterosiphonia japonica. Large quantities of the seaweed were washed ashore and into a local estuary by the recent Hurricane Erin. As the seaweed decomposes without being washed back out to sea by strong tides, it releases a foul-smelling gas. While the odor is unpleasant and has drawn complaints from residents, officials have assured the public that it is a natural, albeit smelly, process resulting from the storm's impact.</p>

Recommendations include shopping directly with online banks, which typically offer higher returns, and carefully considering the deposit amount and term length to maximize earnings.

          <p>Daniel Levy, the Premier League's longest-serving chairman, has ended his nearly 25-year tenure at Tottenham Hotspur. While the official announcement stated he "stepped down," reports suggest the club's ownership made the decision, believing a change in leadership would lead to greater on-field success. During his time, Levy oversaw the construction of a new billion-pound stadium and transformed the club into a financially profitable entity, but he also faced consistent criticism from fans over a lack of trophies. The departure marks the end of an era for the club, which is now looking toward a new leadership structure.</p>

However, the appellate panel ruled 2-1 that the Trump administration and the state of Florida were likely to prevail in their appeal, allowing the remote facility to continue operating.

In a combative performance, he aggressively defended anti-vaccine talking points and clashed with senators from both parties, leading some Republicans to express concern that he was not being truthful. This new, defiant approach, seemingly enabled by President Trump, signals that Kennedy feels emboldened to challenge the scientific consensus on vaccines and dismantle public health infrastructure without fear of political repercussions from Congress.</p>
