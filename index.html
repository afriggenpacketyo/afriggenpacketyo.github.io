          <p>New York City Democrats recently headed to the polls to select their nominee for mayor, in a race seen as a bellwether for the national party's direction. The primary pits former governor Andrew Cuomo, viewed as a moderate, against millennial state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist backed by progressive figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. Mamdani's platform focuses on affordability, including free public transit and universal childcare, while Cuomo emphasizes experience and public safety. The outcome of the election could signal the future trajectory of the Democratic Party as it seeks to counter Trump's influence. </p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that the spin of stars nearing the end of their lives influences the birth of new stars. The study, using data from the Gaia space telescope, found that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The research provides direct evidence that the Milky Way's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time. </p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, rather than completely obliterating it. The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, found that entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, but the underground infrastructure remained largely intact. While resumption of the enrichment program depends on repair efforts, some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes. The White House has disputed the assessment, while lawmakers are scheduled to receive briefings on the administration's actions. </p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs has decided not to testify in his sex trafficking trial, which is expected to conclude this week. Prosecutors have rested their case after calling 34 witnesses over 28 days, alleging that Combs used his wealth and influence to coerce women into sex. Combs' lawyers presented a brief case, arguing that the alleged victims consented to the sexual activities. The defense rested its case after asking the judge to issue an immediate acquittal, and closing statements are scheduled for Thursday. </p>

          <p>Some senators viewed the initial classified assessment of the U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, but did not share details. Democratic senators expressed frustration over the postponement of a scheduled briefing by the Trump administration, citing a lack of transparency. The delay came as an early intelligence assessment indicated the strike did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program. Lawmakers are seeking answers on the rationale for the strikes and the administration's long-term strategy. </p>
