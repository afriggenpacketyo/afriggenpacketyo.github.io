          <p>During his sentencing hearing, Sean 'Diddy' Combs' defense team made an emotional plea for leniency, presenting a video of his achievements and charitable work which caused him to sob in court. His lawyers argued that Combs has been severely punished by his time in prison, financial losses, and reputational damage, claiming he is a "completely broken" man. Combs' six adult children also delivered tearful statements to the judge, asking for their father's presence in their lives and a chance for their family to rebuild.</p>

The PGA of America's CEO and its president both issued statements condemning the conduct and personally apologized to McIlroy and his wife. Comedian Heather McMahan, who served as an emcee, also publicly apologized for participating in a profane chant directed at the European team member. McIlroy had previously stated that the treatment he and his teammates received was unacceptable and that golf should be held to a higher standard.</p>

          <p>A Minnesota high school softball player, Kendall Kotzmacher, shared her experience of losing a state tournament semifinal game to a team with a transgender pitcher, whose performance she described as overpowering. Her story comes as the Trump administration vows to enforce Title IX to prevent biological males from competing in girls' sports, threatening to refer non-compliant states to the Department of Justice. The administration has cited the pitcher's dominant statistics as a reason for its crackdown, while Minnesota's Democratic leadership has resisted the federal directive, defending the rights of all students to participate in sports.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago transit projects, blaming the ongoing government shutdown on Democratic leaders. The Department of Transportation claimed the shutdown hinders its ability to review the projects for compliance with new rules barring race- or sex-based contracting requirements. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson condemned the move as a political tactic that hurts the local economy and residents who rely on public transit, continuing a pattern of the administration targeting Democrat-led cities.</p>

          <p>With the federal government shutdown preventing the release of the official September jobs report, economists are turning to alternative data sources to assess the state of the labor market. High-frequency data from job posting sites like Indeed and private payroll processors suggest that while employment growth has slowed, the market remains relatively stable and is not collapsing. Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee noted that available indicators point to stability, though some private data, like ADP's report, showed a small decline in private payrolls, highlighting an uneven economic picture.</p>

          <p>For most retirees, supplemental insurance, known as Medigap, is a critical tool for managing healthcare costs not covered by Original Medicare. While Medicare Parts A and B cover about 80% of medical expenses, there is no annual cap on out-of-pocket costs, leaving beneficiaries vulnerable to substantial bills from deductibles, copays, and extended hospital stays. Medigap policies help fill these financial gaps, providing predictable costs and greater flexibility in choosing doctors compared to Medicare Advantage plans, which often have network restrictions. This stability becomes increasingly important as healthcare needs typically grow with age.</p>

In recent years, social media has amplified these challenges, allowing activists and politicians to rapidly mobilize against titles like Maia Kobabe's "Gender Queer," making it one of the nation's most-banned books and fueling a deliberate effort to restrict access to certain viewpoints.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Refutes Republican Claim Linking Government Shutdown to Undocumented Immigrant Healthcare</h2>

          <p>Independent experts have debunked claims by the White House and congressional Republicans that the government shutdown was caused by Democrats seeking to extend healthcare benefits to undocumented immigrants. The political standoff is actually centered on Democratic efforts to continue Affordable Care Act subsidies and reverse Medicaid cuts included in a recent Republican-led bill. Health policy experts confirm that undocumented individuals are already barred from receiving federal benefits like Medicaid or ACA marketplace subsidies, making the Republican assertion a false premise for the funding dispute.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Debunks AI-Generated Video of Donald Trump Promoting Fictional "MedBeds"</h2>

          <p>An analysis has determined that a widely circulated video showing former President Donald Trump announcing a "new era in American healthcare" with so-called "MedBeds" is a fake created using artificial intelligence. The video, which promotes a conspiracy theory about magical beds that can cure any disease, contains several visual inconsistencies typical of AI generation, such as mismatched mouth movements and distorted hands. This incident is part of a recurring pattern where AI-generated content featuring Trump has been used to spread misinformation and cause confusion online.</p>

          <p>A Texas man, Raunaq Alam, was sentenced to six months in jail for spray-painting anti-Israel graffiti on a church, after a judge overruled a jury's recommendation for community supervision. Although the jury found Alam guilty of criminal mischief, they rejected a hate-crime enhancement, which argued that targeting the state of Israel was not a protected characteristic. Alam's defense contended his actions were protected free speech, similar to protesting against the U.S. government. The judge, however, called the graffiti "disgusting" and imposed the jail term, highlighting ongoing tensions surrounding protests and free speech in the U.S.</p>

          <p>In response to a recent wave of drone incursions, European leaders are pushing for a unified defense strategy, including the creation of a continental "drone wall." The proposal aims to establish a network of anti-drone measures to protect critical infrastructure and neutralize external threats, with a target completion date of 2030. The discussion, held at a summit in Copenhagen, was driven by recent incidents in Denmark and Poland, which Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen described as part of a "hybrid war" being waged by Russia, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced European defensive capabilities.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy was booed and met with shouts of "shame on you" while speaking at a vigil for the victims of the Manchester synagogue attack. Some members of the crowd accused him and the government of allowing antisemitism to rise and criticized the UK's recent recognition of a Palestinian state. Despite the interruptions, Lammy expressed solidarity with the Jewish community, stating that they are strong and resilient and would not be cowed by terrorism.

Under the deal, Paramount will acquire The Free Press for approximately $150 million. Weiss, a prominent voice critical of left-wing intolerance, is being brought in to appeal to what Ellison calls the political center, but her appointment has raised questions about how an opinion journalist with no television experience will lead an established broadcast institution with a deeply rooted culture.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has entered its third day of a shutdown after lawmakers failed to pass a spending bill, leading to the furlough of approximately 750,000 federal workers. The impasse stems from a dispute over Democratic demands to extend healthcare subsidies and reverse Medicaid cuts, which Republicans oppose. While essential services like border protection and air traffic control continue, many agencies and programs face closures or reductions, and the Trump administration has suggested it may use the shutdown to make permanent cuts to the federal workforce.</p>
