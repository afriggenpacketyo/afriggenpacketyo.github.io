          <p>Shohei Ohtani propelled the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 7-4 win against the Miami Marlins with a powerful two-run home run, marking his ninth of the season. Ohtani's homer, clocked at 117.9 miles per hour, was the hardest-hit in Major League Baseball this season. Ohtani reflected on his confidence boost after homering off a great pitcher in a clutch situation. Freddie Freeman also contributed with a two-run homer, and South Korean rookie Kim Hye Seong notched his first two major league hits, driving in a run for the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay nearly $511 million after pleading guilty to conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to conceal over $4 billion in offshore accounts, according to the Department of Justice. The UBS subsidiary also entered a non-prosecution agreement related to U.S. accounts booked at Credit Suisse AG Singapore, which held over $2 billion in undeclared assets for U.S. persons. This plea comes after Credit Suisse's 2014 guilty plea for similar offenses, marking a breach of their previous agreement. The DOJ emphasized that these agreements offer no protection for individuals involved and require full cooperation with ongoing investigations.</p>

          <p>K-pop star Lisa from Blackpink sparked discussion at the Met Gala with her black lace ensemble, specifically the pattern of tiny, intricate faces composing the lace. Louis Vuitton revealed that the lace replicated elements of artwork by American artist Henry Taylor, known for portraits of figures in his life. Taylor recently painted a portrait of Pharrell Williams, Louis Vuitton's men's wear creative director, and collaborated with Williams for his debut show in Paris, embroidering miniature portraits by the artist on suits and accessories.

          <p>Taiwan's first domestically built submarine, the Hai Kun, is facing uncertainty regarding its delivery to the island's navy due to testing delays and reported piping system failures.

A former navy captain and construction advisor on the project indicated that repeated piping system failures have led to compartment flooding, causing foreign testing teams to suspend their work.

          <p>President Trump has closed a tariff loophole that allowed inexpensive goods from China to enter the United States without tariffs, potentially impacting companies like UPS, FedEx, and DHL. This loophole, known as the de minimis exemption, allowed goods worth $800 or less to be imported without tariffs or detailed paperwork. With the exemption now gone, American shoppers will face tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods, and logistics companies may see a significant decline in shipments from China. UPS has already announced expected revenue declines and job cuts, signaling the potential economic fallout from this policy change.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's call for tariffs on movies filmed overseas, California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to support the entertainment industry. The proposal aims to counter the loss of film and television production to states and nations offering incentives and cheaper labor. While the White House has not yet responded, the move reflects a broader effort to address the challenges facing Hollywood and retain jobs in the industry. Industry workers and state officials have sought to increase the amount of funding for filming made available by the state of California, and some have also begun pushing for a federal tax credit that can be layered on top of state incentives.</p>
