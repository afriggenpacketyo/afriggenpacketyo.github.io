          <p>England winger Jack Grealish has completed a season-long loan move from Manchester City to Everton, becoming the club's sixth summer signing. The 29-year-old cited conversations with manager David Moyes and support from Everton fans as key factors in his decision to move to Hill Dickinson Stadium. Grealish, who fell out of favor at City, hopes the move will help him rejuvenate his career and regain his spot in the England national squad. He will wear the number 18 shirt, inspired by former Everton players Wayne Rooney and Paul Gascoigne.</p>

While CD rates are lower than their recent peaks, they remain elevated, providing a secure, fixed-rate investment vehicle.

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity AI has reportedly made an unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome browser, a figure higher than its own valuation. The company claims to have backing from several investors for the potential deal. This move comes after a U.S. court ruled Google holds an illegal monopoly in internet search, with the Department of Justice proposing the divestment of Chrome as a remedy. Acquiring Chrome would give Perplexity a massive user base and a critical entry point to the internet, intensifying competition in the AI and search market.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has reportedly instructed its companies to avoid using Nvidia's H20 and certain Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) AI chips, particularly for government and national security applications. This directive follows recent U.S. government actions, including an agreement where Nvidia and AMD will give 15% of their China revenues to the U.S. The H20 chip was specifically designed by Nvidia to comply with earlier U.S. export restrictions aimed at curbing China's technological advancement. This development signals escalating tech tensions and could impact the chipmakers' significant revenue from the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Police in New Delhi have detained dozens of animal rights activists protesting a Supreme Court order to remove thousands of stray dogs from the city's streets. The court's decision, which mandates capturing, sterilizing, and relocating 5,000 dogs to shelters, was prompted by reports of nearly 2,000 daily dog bites in the capital. Protesters argue that the shelters are inhumane and that the focus should be on enforcing existing animal birth control rules, which involve sterilization and vaccination before releasing dogs back into their communities. The number of stray dogs in Delhi is estimated to be in the tens of thousands.</p>

A judge recently dropped the charges under an agreement requiring a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation, but severe winter weather has left him unable to depart the military base where he is staying.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, increased by 2.7% in July compared to the previous year, a rate slightly cooler than the 2.8% forecasted by economists. On a monthly basis, the index rose 0.2%. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 3.1% annually, its highest level in five months. Food prices continued to be a source of pressure for consumers, rising 2.9% over the past year. Despite inflation remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, analysts believe a September interest rate cut is still possible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the UK's tax agency, has confirmed it is using artificial intelligence to monitor the social media accounts of individuals suspected of tax evasion. The technology is being used to support criminal investigations, not to monitor average taxpayers, and the agency stated that human decision-making remains central to the process. While HMRC believes AI will help staff better target fraud and bring in more public funds, experts have raised concerns about potential risks, such as cases of mistaken identity from fake or hacked accounts, highlighting the need for careful human oversight.</p>

          <p>The Philippine military has blamed China for a collision between Chinese navy and coast guard ships near the disputed Scarborough Shoal. The incident occurred as the Chinese vessels were attempting to block a Philippine coast guard ship and fishermen from the area. The Philippines released video footage allegedly showing a Chinese navy ship maneuvering aggressively, causing it to crash into a Chinese coast guard vessel. The confrontation, which resulted in significant damage to the Chinese ships, represents a serious escalation in the long-running territorial dispute, with the Philippines noting China's new use of military force against civilians.</p>

          <p>A group of 24 foreign ministers, including those from the UK, Canada, France, and Japan, has issued a joint statement condemning the "unimaginable" level of humanitarian suffering in the Gaza Strip. The statement highlights that famine is unfolding and calls for urgent action to allow unhindered aid to enter the besieged enclave. The ministers criticized restrictive registration requirements imposed by Israel that are preventing international NGOs from operating effectively and called for a ceasefire. In a related development, Germany has partially halted offensive arms exports to Israel, straining diplomatic relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A commentary in The Guardian argues that President Trump's military takeover of Washington D.C. is not a response to a real crisis but a sheer demonstration of political power. The author contends that the pretext of rising crime is false, as data shows a significant drop, and that the move is intended to punish a politically opposed city. This action, which follows the deployment of troops in other cities, erodes the taboo against using the military for domestic law enforcement. The piece suggests this is a feature of authoritarianism, where the ability to make lies have the force of fact is a terrifying power.</p>

          <p>This article advocates for a management approach centered on employee well-being as a durable strategy for improving business performance, contrasting it with fleeting management fads. Citing research from firms like Irrational Capital, it shows that companies scoring high on employee happiness metrics consistently outperform their peers in stock price. The piece identifies six key drivers of satisfaction, including valuing innovation, clear communication, and fostering friendships among colleagues. It argues that leaders should focus on these human-centric factors rather than treating employees like machines, a practice that ultimately alienates workers and hinders productivity.</p>

          <p>Glendora Continental, a 45-year-old family-run restaurant and a cornerstone of the local Basque community in Southern California, is being sold by its second- and third-generation owners. The establishment is one of the last remaining links to the Basque diaspora in the region, a culture historically centered around sheepherding. The sale reflects a broader trend of dwindling Basque restaurants as the immigrant generation ages and younger generations pursue different paths. For its loyal employees and multigenerational customers, the potential closure marks the end of an era for a beloved community hub.</p>

          <p>With the interest rate environment potentially shifting, savers are evaluating the best place for their money between money market accounts (MMAs) and high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs). Both offer higher-than-average, variable interest rates, but MMAs often include check-writing and debit card access. Experts note that while rates can be comparable, MMAs may require higher minimum balances to earn the top APY. HYSAs are often recommended for building emergency funds due to their simplicity and potentially lower entry barriers, while MMAs can be useful for managing large cash reserves with some transactional flexibility.

          <p>Retirees who are required to take minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but do not need the cash for living expenses have several strategic options. Financial experts suggest that instead of just letting the money sit, it can be put to work to meet other goals. One option is to reinvest the funds in a tax-efficient manner using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a brokerage account. Another popular strategy is to make a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which satisfies the RMD requirement while avoiding an income tax bill on the withdrawal. (not investment advice)</p>

The verdict is widely seen by critics and human rights groups as a politically motivated move by President Mahamat Idriss Deby to eliminate a powerful rival and silence dissent. The conviction follows a contested election and strikes a blow to hopes for a democratic transition in the country.

While Liverpool had indicated they might walk away, Isak's continued ambition to join the Premier League champions keeps the possibility of a deal alive.
