        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain, France, and Canada issued a rare joint statement criticizing Israel's renewed military offensive in Gaza, citing disproportionate actions and restrictions on humanitarian aid. The allies condemned the expanded campaign against Hamas and the ongoing blockade, warning of further concrete actions if Israel doesn't cease its operations and ease restrictions. Britain went further by suspending free-trade agreement talks and imposing sanctions on extremist Israeli settlers. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the criticism, claiming it emboldens Hamas, while European officials expressed increasing frustration with Israel's actions in Gaza.

          <p>The Justice Department has charged New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a clash outside a Newark immigration detention center. The charges stem from an incident on May 9 when McIver and other Democratic lawmakers visited the facility. The interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, stated that McIver assaulted, impeded, and interfered with law enforcement. McIver claims federal law enforcement instigated the clash, and Democratic leaders have denounced the charges as politically motivated. The Justice Department has dropped a trespass charge against Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka, who was arrested during the same incident.</p>

          <p>The Northern Jaguar Project in Sonora, Mexico, uses motion-sensing cameras to protect jaguars and change local perceptions of the animals. The project pays ranchers for photos of jaguars and other wild cats taken on their land, incentivizing them to protect the animals rather than kill them. This initiative, called Viviendo con Felinos, has expanded the protected area for jaguars and fostered a cultural shift among ranchers, leading to greater tolerance and conservation efforts. The project also highlights the importance of maintaining openings in the border wall to allow jaguars to return to the United States.</p>

The items, recovered in a covert operation, include documents, recordings, photos, and letters collected by Syrian intelligence after his capture in 1965. Cohen, who infiltrated the Syrian political echelon in the 1960s, provided crucial intelligence to Israel before his capture and execution. The recovery operation was conducted by the Mossad, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shared some of the items with Cohen's widow, Nadia Cohen.</p>

More than half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to raise prices to offset higher tariff costs. The company's pricing decision is occurring as a sluggish housing market impacts sales, and Home Depot is waiting for stronger spending and bigger purchases to occur. (not investment advice)</p>

The film, based in part on reporting by The Guardian and WWL Louisiana, recounts the experiences of clergy abuse survivors and their advocates. It explores the story of Michael Brandner Sr., who discovered letters from a priest to his younger brother, a victim of sexual assault who later died by suicide.

Before taking office in January, Trump vowed to bring the war to a swift end by engaging directly with Putin, a goal which has proven elusive as the Russian leader has rejected previous proposals for a 30-day ceasefire.</p>
