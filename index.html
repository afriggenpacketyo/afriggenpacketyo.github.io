          <h2>Psychologists Offer Advice for Managing Stress During Major Sporting Events</h2>

          <p>As England's women's football team advances to the Euro 2025 final, many fans report experiencing intense physical and emotional stress. Experts in psychology explain that these reactions are driven by hormonal surges, including adrenaline and cortisol, which are a natural response to high-stakes situations. To cope with the anxiety, specialists recommend getting adequate rest, planning match-day activities, and engaging in physical movement to manage the adrenaline. They also emphasize reframing the nervous energy as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for healthy emotional expression, regardless of the final outcome.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport following a "possible landing gear incident" during takeoff. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely deplaned from the Boeing 737 MAX 8, with only one person transported for a minor injury. The airline stated the aircraft experienced a maintenance issue with a tire and has been removed from service for inspection. The incident caused a temporary ground stop and dozens of flight delays at the airport, but operations have since returned to normal, and an FAA investigation is underway.</p>

Sanders, who surprisingly fell to the fifth round of the NFL Draft, stated that the situation is not in his control and does not diminish his confidence in his abilities. He emphasized his journey from an HBCU to a Power 5 conference and now to the NFL as proof of his resilience. The Browns' coaching staff has been giving starting reps to other quarterbacks while Deshaun Watson continues his rehabilitation.</p>

Although he was present to observe practice, head coach Sean McVay confirmed the 37-year-old star will not participate in drills, including the team's first padded practices. McVay stated that while there is no reason for major concern based on medical information, the team believes it is best to be cautious with Stafford's recovery.

Yaari noted the correspondence did not provide new intelligence but offered insight into the Hamas leader's mindset before he was killed.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing regulations to better protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing new properties, and the process for businesses to get licenses for outdoor areas would be streamlined. The government hopes these measures will help revitalize struggling town centers and support the hospitality industry by making it easier to open new establishments and host events. The opposition, however, argues the policy is hypocritical given other tax policies they claim have harmed the sector.</p>

          <p>Opposition lawmakers in Taiwan have successfully survived a large-scale recall vote, allowing them to retain their controlling majority in the legislature. The recall campaign, initiated by civic groups, had accused 24 opposition legislators of being "pro-China" and undermining national security, but it failed to gain enough votes to oust them. This result ensures that the political gridlock, which has seen the opposition block the agenda of President William Lai's administration, will likely continue. The opposition KMT party maintains it is not pro-Beijing but is providing necessary checks and balances on the government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig expressed astonishment at President Donald Trump's answer when asked if he would consider pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell. Trump responded that he "hadn't thought about" a pardon for the convicted sex trafficker, who is serving a 20-year sentence for helping Jeffrey Epstein abuse underage girls. Honig called the question the "easiest question in human history," stating the only correct answer is an emphatic "no." The exchange occurred amid increasing pressure on Trump to release files related to the Epstein case and questions about his past association with the disgraced financier.</p>

          <p>More than two decades after its original release, the acclaimed film "Bend It Like Beckham" is set to get a sequel, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. Chadha announced the news while in Basel for the Euro 2025 women's final, stating that the success of teams like England's Lionesses made it a good time to revisit the characters. The original 2002 film, starring Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, is credited with inspiring a generation of female football players. Chadha is aiming for a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and hopes to reunite the original cast.</p>

          <p>In a unique public relations move, actress Gwyneth Paltrow has been hired as a "very temporary" spokesperson for the tech company Astronomer. The company's CEO recently resigned after he was featured on a KissCam at a Coldplay concert embracing a female executive who was not his wife. Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, appeared in a short video deftly avoiding the scandal while promoting the company's data workflow automation services. The original KissCam incident went viral online, leading to the resignation of both executives involved and a surge in online streams of Coldplay's music.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A USAID analysis of over 150 reported incidents of aid loss in Gaza found no evidence of widespread, systematic diversion of assistance by Hamas. This finding, based on data from October 2023 to May 2024, appears to challenge claims by the Trump administration and Israel, which have been used to justify restricting aid through traditional channels. The State Department and the Israeli military have forcefully pushed back against the report, insisting that significant looting and diversion by Hamas does occur. The analysis was compiled before USAID ceased its independent operations in the region on July 1.</p>

          <p>A special "women only" aid distribution event organized by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in Rafah turned tragic, resulting in the deaths of at least two women. Witnesses described a chaotic scene where crowds were met with pepper spray and stun grenades, followed by gunfire. One victim, Mary Sheikh al-Eid, was reportedly shot in the head while trying to get food for her seven children. The incident adds to the over 1,000 Palestinians the UN says have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking aid since a new, controversial distribution system was implemented in May.</p>
