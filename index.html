          <p>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor Organization (ITER) is participating in the World Exposition in Osaka, showcasing its experimental nuclear fusion reactor and explaining the fusion energy process. ITER, a France-based organization, is building the reactor with the collaboration of China, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia, the United States, and the European Union. Fusion energy, often called "the Sun on Earth," is generated when light atomic nuclei merge, creating byproduct-free energy. The project aims to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy, with Japan playing a leading role.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey indicates that 58% of Japanese citizens believe that the spread of unverified information on social media during elections should be regulated by law. This comes amid growing criticism of partisan online posts influencing elections. The survey also reveals divided opinions on revising Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war. Additionally, 71% support allowing married couples to keep separate surnames, and 64% agree that same-sex marriage should be recognized in Japan.

          <p>The Trump administration intends to cut staffing at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by 1,200 positions, with additional reductions planned for other intelligence agencies like the National Security Agency (NSA), according to a report by the Washington Post. The CIA stated that these changes are part of a strategy to align the agency with President Trump's national security priorities, aiming to infuse the agency with renewed energy and provide opportunities for rising leaders. The cuts will be implemented over several years, partly through reduced hiring, and follow the CIA's participation in a voluntary redundancy program initiated by Trump.</p>

Despite Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani's statement about building a long-term strategic partnership with China, China faces a "reputational crisis" due to its support for ousted Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad. China's need to deal with a government dominated by UN-identified "terrorists" presents an uncomfortable dilemma.</p>

          <p>China has passed a law to bolster its private economy, set to take effect on May 20, which aims to provide legal recourse for businesses. The Private Economy Promotion Law is designed to protect the private sector from arbitrary fines and asset seizures. Observers are closely monitoring how the law will impact firms' ability to take local-level governments to court. The law forbids the use of administrative measures to intervene in economic disputes, and it is hoped that courts will be more willing to accept and fairly adjudicate cases against local governments.</p>

Some worry that media portrayals of autism are distorting public perceptions, while others argue that increased diagnoses reflect a positive trend of identifying and supporting individuals who were previously undiagnosed. As the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.</p>
