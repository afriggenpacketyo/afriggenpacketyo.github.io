          <p>The Fukuoka city government completed repairs on a 4-meter-long sinkhole that had appeared the previous day near the busy Tenjin shopping district. The sinkhole, which measured about 2 meters in width and depth, had forced the closure of four lanes in the area. Mayor Soichiro Takashima expressed relief that the work was completed before the morning rush hour, emphasizing the swift recovery efforts and the prioritization of public safety during the repair process. No injuries were reported as a result of the incident, which allowed for a quick and efficient resolution. The authorities were able to confirm safety before carrying out landfill work, minimizing disruption to the city's infrastructure and daily life.</p>

          <p>Zara owner Inditex reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales, signaling a slower start to the summer season compared to the previous year. The Spanish retailer's revenues for the fiscal first quarter reached 8.27 billion euros, slightly below analysts' forecasts, while net income amounted to 1.3 billion euros. The company attributed the slowdown in demand to broader economic uncertainty and reported a 6% increase in summer sales at constant currencies, compared to 12% growth in the same period last year. Shares of Inditex have declined approximately 12% from their peak in December following these announcements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to PwC's 2025 AI Jobs Barometer report, the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence is diminishing the importance of formal degrees in certain fields. The report suggests that employers are placing greater emphasis on current skills rather than past education, particularly in AI-exposed occupations. Skills are evolving 66% faster in fields like financial analysis compared to those less affected by AI, which is a significant increase from the 25% recorded last year. PwC Global Chief AI Officer Joe Atkinson suggests that individuals can adapt to this changing landscape by upskilling in AI using available tools and large language models.</p>

          <p>Two adaptations of Johann Sebastian Bach's St. John Passion offer new interpretations of the story of Christ, reflecting contemporary issues. "QueerPassion," by Thomas HÃ¶ft, draws inspiration from the Orlando nightclub shooting and tells the stories of discriminated and murdered LGBTQ+ individuals. Vladimir Ivanoff's "Arabian Passion" incorporates instruments from the Arabian Mediterranean region and features Lebanese singer Fadia El-Hage singing Bach's arias in Arabic, focusing on the suffering of people in the Middle East. Both versions are touring and will be performed at the Bachfest in Leipzig, aligning with the festival's theme of "Transformation."</p>

While attorney David Seltzer stated that Jane's testimony portrays Combs as a "sexual deviant," he argues that it may not directly support the prosecution's case on the specific charges. Former federal prosecutor Neahma Rahmani noted that the case hinges on the distinction between coercion and consent. The trial is expected to conclude by July 4, with Combs facing a potential sentence of 15 years to life if convicted.</p>

Prior to the curfew, Bass and faith leaders advocated for peaceful resistance during a gathering in Grand Park, near the federal building.

          <p>Approximately 15,000 protesters gathered in Budapest to demonstrate against the government of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n, marking the beginning of what organizers call a resistance movement. Speakers at the rally criticized OrbÃ¡n's increasingly anti-democratic actions and alleged corruption within his Fidesz party. The protests were sparked by recent laws and constitutional amendments seen as limiting LGBTQ+ rights and independent journalism, leading to concerns about Hungary's shift towards authoritarianism. Demonstrators expressed hope that OrbÃ¡n's support is waning ahead of the 2026 elections.</p>

          <p>The United States defense sector relies heavily on critical minerals, particularly rare earth elements, for its advanced weapon systems, with China dominating the global supply. Beijing's control over these minerals and its tightening export restrictions pose a growing risk to the Pentagon's military readiness and supply chain security. Many of these materials have no substitutes, making the US defense industry vulnerable to Chinese export policies. This dependency limits material supply and blocks access to essential separation and refining technology needed to build independent US capacity.</p>
