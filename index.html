          <p>Sheena Gough, an 89-year-old ballet teacher, has retired after a 72-year career, leaving her students feeling it is the "end of an era."

She decided to retire after worrying she might not be able to remain at her peak, but she plans to spend more time in her garden and tidy up her house. Her students and colleagues have expressed sadness at her departure, praising her inspirational teaching style and the legacy she leaves behind.</p>

          <p>Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones, costing the Pentagon over $200 million. The U.S. has increased its attacks on the Houthis since mid-March, leading to the destruction of Houthi facilities and the deaths of fighters. U.S. senators are raising concerns about civilian casualties from these strikes, particularly at the Ras Isa fuel terminal. The Houthis have also been firing missiles at U.S. military ships, and the U.S. has bolstered its naval presence in the Middle East in response.</p>

          <p>China has reportedly waived its retaliatory 125% tariffs on certain semiconductor imports from the US, signaling a potential thaw in the trade war. At least eight integrated circuit-related tariff codes were exempted, although tariffs on memory chips remain.

          <p>A Japanese government survey found that 35% of local government officials have experienced overbearing or abusive behavior from residents, significantly higher than the rate for private-sector workers. This suggests that public officials regularly face unreasonable requests from the taxpayers they serve, likely due to the obligation to provide services to everyone. The government has submitted a bill to parliament requiring companies and municipalities to take steps to protect workers from such abuse, reflecting a shift in attitudes towards customer service in Japan.</p>

          <p>The Post Office has spent over £600 million to continue using the faulty Horizon IT system, despite deciding to replace it over a decade ago. The original 1999 deal with Fujitsu left the Post Office unable to build a replacement or inspect the software's code. This dependence on Fujitsu's assurances led to the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of sub-postmasters for theft and fraud. The Post Office finally obtained rights related to the Horizon software in 2023, but experts believe the contract with Fujitsu will need to be extended beyond 2026 while a replacement is built.</p>

          <p>China is sharing rare Moon rocks collected by its Chang'e-5 mission with US researchers, despite ongoing trade tensions. Two Nasa-funded US institutions have been granted access to the lunar samples, which are considered "a shared treasure for all humanity." Chinese researchers have been unable to access Nasa's moon samples due to US lawmakers' restrictions on collaboration with China. The Chang'e-5 samples are unique because they are younger than those collected from Apollo missions, suggesting more recent volcanic activity on the moon.</p>

          <p>Bill Maher criticized Larry David's satirical essay comparing Maher's positive account of dining with Donald Trump to dining with Adolf Hitler. Maher found the comparison "insulting to 6 million dead Jews." He defended his report as honest and stated that he doesn't need to be lectured on who Donald Trump is. Maher emphasized the need for dialogue and said that he is open to talking to people with differing opinions.</p>

          <p>Reed Bank, a contested area in the South China Sea rich in gas and oil, could become a future hotspot for stand-offs between China and the Philippines. Analysts suggest that Manila's unilateral resource exploration plans may increase tensions. However, limited development capacity, the upcoming midterm election in the Philippines, and other geopolitical distractions could delay the situation. Both countries claim the area, and joint development efforts have stalled due to ongoing tensions.</p>
