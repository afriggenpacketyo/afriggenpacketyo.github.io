          <p>Lando Norris of McLaren won the Monaco Grand Prix, converting his pole position into a race lead and managing pit stops effectively. Charles Leclerc of Ferrari and Oscar Piastri of McLaren followed, completing the podium. Max Verstappen of Red Bull, disadvantaged by limited tire sets, finished fourth after a late pit stop, having initially led by delaying his final stop in hopes of a safety car intervention. The race saw an early virtual safety car due to a crash, but otherwise remained relatively straightforward for the front-runners, who largely adhered to a similar strategy.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the recently passed budget bill, claiming it represents the largest spending cut in decades, despite concerns it could increase the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill's tax provisions could increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade, a figure Johnson disputes. He asserts the bill will stimulate the economy by raising wages and incentivizing business expansion and U.S. manufacturing. Republican senators have expressed reservations about the bill's impact on the deficit, signaling potential changes in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny for allegedly monetizing the presidency to an unprecedented degree, normalizing activities that would have previously sparked outrage and investigations. The Trump family has reportedly collected millions through cryptocurrency ventures, overseas real estate deals, and exclusive club memberships. A luxury jet was also donated for the president's use. Critics argue that ethical boundaries have been eroded, and traditional mechanisms of accountability have been dismantled, leading to a normalization of moneymaking schemes that would have been unthinkable in previous administrations.</p>

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends men aged 55 to 69 discuss PSA screening with their doctor, but advises against it for those over 70 due to potential over-treatment risks. Some experts argue that men over 45 should have routine screening, regardless of age, citing advancements in treatment options.

The focus will instead be on improving services and infrastructure. Passengers have expressed disappointment that nationalization may not result in reduced prices.

          <p>The Trump administration is releasing people charged with being in the country illegally to non-governmental shelters along the US-Mexico border, despite raising concerns that providing aid to immigrants may violate smuggling laws. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) sent letters to shelters expressing concerns about potentially illegal activity and demanding detailed information. Despite this, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) continues to ask shelters to house people, creating a contradiction. Fema has suspended payments to shelters during its investigation, requiring sworn statements that they have no knowledge of anyone violating smuggling laws.</p>

          <p>China's anti-corruption campaign is intensifying its focus on key tech sectors, including big data, semiconductors, and tech giants, amid its growing rivalry with the United States.

The campaign highlights the tension between state-led innovation and accountability, with authorities scrutinizing industries deemed strategically important for China's self-reliance.

They suggest keeping between $50 and $100 on hand, enough to handle common expenses like gas, food, or a taxi ride home. Having cash can provide a sense of security when technology fails.</p>

          <p>Conservationists are advocating for a shift in focus from protecting individual species to protecting entire ecosystems, arguing it's a more efficient and effective approach. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has a weakness as it focuses on individual species rather than the broader ecosystems they inhabit. Protecting ecosystems would recognize their dynamic nature and allow for species movement and evolution. An ecosystem-protection act could ensure that each type of ecosystem has sufficient area protected, supporting biodiversity without the need for individual plans for each species.</p>

Critics argue that the court is enabling the president to declare himself above the law and undermining the rule of law.
