            <p>Lawyers for Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil are contesting the government's evidence supporting his deportation, arguing it lacks proof that his presence poses a foreign policy risk. The government's case relies on a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, asserting Khalil's involvement in antisemitic protests creates a hostile environment for Jewish students, compromising U.S. foreign policy interests. Khalil's attorneys criticize the memo as targeting First Amendment activity and plan to request to depose Rubio to understand the basis of his determination. The immigration judge will decide on Khalil's removability, but further litigation is expected regardless of the initial ruling.</p>

Greene, a vocal supporter of Trump's trade policies, invested in companies like Lululemon, Dell, and Amazon, which had experienced significant losses. Some of her investments have seen gains following Trump's decision to temporarily pause reciprocal tariffs.

The RSPB encourages individuals to take small actions to support starlings and other garden wildlife, such as avoiding pesticides and providing nest boxes, while also urging governments and businesses to address the broader issue of restoring the natural world.</p>

While instructing a lower court to clarify its order, the Supreme Court upheld the authority to direct the government to assist in Abrego Garcia's return. The decision is a rebuke to the administration's deportation policies, which prioritize the removal of alleged gang members. Abrego Garcia, married with three children, was deported despite a withholding order forbidding his removal to El Salvador.</p>

            <p>A contributor argues that President Trump's trade war with China is a necessary step to reset the U.S.-China economic relationship. The author contends that Trump has long held concerns about China's trade practices and that welcoming China into the global economy has not worked out as planned. The piece criticizes elites for leading America to disaster in trade with China and argues that the Chinese Communist Party must be crushed.</p>

            <p>A chaotic incident occurred in Eagle Rock after a homeowner, Jillian Shriner, shot at a group of people fleeing a hit-and-run and then allegedly pointed a handgun at police. Officers responded to a crash on the 134 Freeway and were directed to Shriner's home, where one suspect was reportedly seen running. Shriner, an author, was shot in the shoulder after refusing to drop her weapon and pointing it at officers. She was absentee-booked on suspicion of attempted murder, while one hit-and-run suspect was arrested and two remain at large.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, an immigrant wrongly deported to El Salvador. While the Court lifted a temporary block on a lower court's order, it sent the case back for clarification on the term "effectuate." The decision suggests that the government must take steps to make the return happen, but the Court acknowledges potential limitations if the Salvadorian government refuses. The justices expect a judge to supervise the administration's behavior and intervene if it is not doing enough to secure Abrego Garcia's release.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has upheld a judge’s order requiring Donald Trump’s administration to facilitate the return to the United States of a Salvadoran man who the government has acknowledged was deported in error to El Salvador. However, the court said that the additional requirement to “effectuate” his return was unclear and may exceed the judge’s authority. The justices directed Xinis to clarify the directive “with due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs”.</p>

Loose drives led to a par-bogey finish but it did not diminish a wonderful round which saw him post his joint lowest score at the Masters. Rose looked totally relaxed as he headed off the course, smiling broadly as he slapped high-fives with the patrons congratulating him on a fantastic day's work.</p>

            <p>Chinese publicly listed companies have unveiled at least 20 billion yuan (US$2.73 billion) in buy-backs this week, as they set aside resources to prop up their own stock during a global meltdown in equity markets triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff war. More than 100 companies have announced buy-backs, including China’s state oil company PetroChina , the world’s largest appliance maker and Midea Group . These buy-backs “can be effective in containing the spread of panic and reducing the stampede in the market,” said Xu Chi, an analyst at Zhongtai Securities in Shanghai. (not investment advice)</p>
