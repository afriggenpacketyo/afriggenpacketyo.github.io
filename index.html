          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has been thrust into a high-stakes confrontation with the Trump administration over the deployment of federal troops to Los Angeles to quell protests.  Newsom initially dismissed threats of arrest but has since recognized the gravity of the situation, including the violent handling of Senator Padilla by federal agents.  He's framed the conflict as a battle to preserve democracy against authoritarianism, and the experience has seemingly led him to adopt a more forceful approach.</p>
