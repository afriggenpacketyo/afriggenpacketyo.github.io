          <p>The Trump administration has restarted collecting defaulted student loans, potentially impacting 5.3 million borrowers through wage garnishments and federal benefit offsets. The Education Department plans to notify borrowers of these actions, which marks a significant shift from the Biden administration's pandemic relief measures. Experts express concern, especially for retirees who risk losing Social Security benefits, potentially leading to financial hardship regarding basic necessities. The aggressive collection timeline and lack of due diligence raise questions about fairness and the impact on vulnerable populations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Utah has become the first state in the U.S. to ban fluoride in public drinking water, a decision that dentists fear will increase tooth decay, especially among children and low-income residents.

The bill's sponsor argued that individuals should have the choice to consume fluoride. Dentists in Salt Lake City anticipate longer waitlists for children's dental procedures and are working to make fluoride supplements more accessible.</p>

These include researching the debt, providing proof of financial hardship, working with a debt relief expert, and remaining patient and persistent throughout the negotiation process.

This pattern of broad designs followed by frustration when diplomacy fails has incentivized other nations to wait out the Trump administration.

          <p>Arts organizations across the country are facing funding gaps after the Trump administration canceled National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) grants. Organizations like CAP UCLA and South Coast Repertory are scrambling to find alternative funding sources. The grant cancellations are part of Trump's broader effort to reshape American arts and culture, including cuts to federal funding for exhibits and the elimination of the NEA altogether. This comes at a time when arts organizations are still recovering from the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but the Fed is expected to hold steady at its May 7 meeting. The decision comes amid mixed economic signals, with GDP falling but job growth topping forecasts. The Fed has signaled a wait-and-see approach, citing uncertainty from Trump's tariffs. Economists expect the Fed to begin cutting rates later in the year, but consumers may have to wait for relief on borrowing costs.</p>
