          <h2>Bonobo Societies: Female Coalitions Maintain Dominance Over Males</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 14:43:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals how female bonobos maintain their matriarchal societies, challenging the notion of male domination as the natural order. Researchers tracked bonobo communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo for nearly 30 years, finding that females form coalitions to attack or intimidate males who step out of line. This collective action allows females to gain social rank, better access to food, and mating opportunities for their sons. This research provides an evidence-based explanation for female dominance in bonobo societies, a rarity among mammals.</p>

          <p>The United States is pressing Japan and South Korea to commit to the $44 billion Alaska L.N.G. project, a key component of President Trump's energy strategy. The project aims to export liquefied natural gas from northern Alaska to Asian nations, contingent on securing regional support. The National Energy Dominance Council is planning a summit in Alaska on June 2, seeking signed letters of intent from Japan and South Korea to invest in or purchase gas from the project, following Taiwan's similar commitment last month. This initiative highlights the administration's focus on energy dominance and strengthening ties with key Asian partners through resource development and trade.</p>

          <p>The status of trade talks between the US and China is in dispute, with President Trump claiming active discussions while China denies any negotiations on tariffs. This disagreement comes after Trump increased tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting retaliatory measures from China. Experts describe the situation as a 'game of chicken,' with both sides seemingly unwilling to unilaterally de-escalate, causing market volatility and recession warnings. The IMF is urging a truce in the escalating trade conflict to limit damage to the global economy.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is under scrutiny as Hope Not Hate reveals offensive social media posts by local election candidates, despite the party's claims of improved vetting. The posts include anti-Islam sentiments, promotion of far-right conspiracy theories, and praise for extremists. These revelations undermine Nigel Farage's assertions about the party's vetting process and raise questions about the party's commitment to inclusivity. Reform UK has not yet responded to requests for comment regarding the posts, and some posts have since been deleted or hidden.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man, Joseph Kling, faces arson charges for allegedly starting the wildfire in Ocean County, N.J., that has consumed over 15,000 acres. Authorities say Kling lit wooden pallets on fire and left the area before the fire was fully extinguished, leading to the blaze's spread. The wildfire, which is about 50% contained, destroyed a commercial building and prompted air quality alerts in New York City and surrounding areas. While the fire is mostly burning in wilderness, officials expect it to continue for days.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire federal judge has restricted the Trump administration's ability to withhold federal funding from public schools participating in certain diversity and equity initiatives. The judge found that the administration's actions violated executive branch power and would cripple educational institutions. The ruling, limited to schools working with the National Education Association and the Center for Black Educator Development, challenges the administration's assertion that DEI programs violate civil rights laws. The decision underscores the ongoing debate over the role of DEI in education and the extent of federal oversight.</p>

They claim that the nonprofit's governance of OpenAI is priceless and that selling it would violate fiduciary duty. The letter urges the attorneys general of California and Delaware to intervene, arguing that OpenAI's mission cannot be pursued by a fully commercial company.

However, Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected any role for the PA in Gaza. Experts are skeptical about Hamas voluntarily surrendering power, particularly demilitarization, but suggest they might pass political power to a technocratic government.
