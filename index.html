          <p>India's foreign ministry has responded to threats of increased U.S. tariffs by highlighting that both the U.S. and EU engage in significant trade with Russia. The ministry stated that India only began importing Russian oil out of necessity after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe following the 2022 conflict, a move it claims was encouraged by the U.S. to stabilize global energy markets. Citing trade data, India argues its actions are a matter of national compulsion, unlike the continued commerce between Russia and Western nations. The statement comes after former President Trump accused India of profiting from discounted Russian oil and threatened steeper tariffs.</p>

          <p>In response to falling prices and strong competition from imports, Beijing has announced a new plan to strengthen its domestic cattle industry. The policy, introduced by the nation's top economic planner, aims to increase local beef production and promote consumption by implementing a quality-grading system for Chinese beef. Officials noted that the current diet of Chinese residents is lacking in high-quality proteins, indicating significant potential for growth in consumption. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to enhance the appeal of domestic agricultural products and bolster key farming sectors.</p>

Utility company SSEN is working to restore electricity, describing the storm as the most damaging in recent memory, while Network Rail addresses numerous incidents on train lines caused by winds up to 90mph. The Scottish government has urged caution, and emergency services continue to clear debris and conduct safety checks.

          <p>New York City police arrested more than 40 protesters outside the Trump International hotel during a demonstration against the war in Gaza. Organized by the Jewish-American group IfNotNow, hundreds gathered to demand an end to the conflict and call for the U.S. government to pressure Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into the region. Speakers, including NYC Comptroller Brad Lander and Rabbi Jill Jacobs, condemned the blockade and the resulting humanitarian crisis, framing their opposition as a moral imperative rooted in Jewish values. The protest culminated in a sit-in on the street, leading to the arrests for blocking traffic.</p>

As of Monday evening, the fire was only 5% contained, with officials warning that hot, dry weather and erratic winds could fuel rapid growth. Over 1,000 firefighters are battling the blaze in challenging terrain, and at least three injuries have been reported, including a motorist and two contract workers. The fire, which started from several smaller blazes, is under investigation as a forecast heatwave threatens to worsen conditions later in the week.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban. The court ruled that while the government can pause access to the asylum system, it cannot ignore laws that protect migrants from being sent to places where they face torture or persecution. This decision effectively reopens pathways for humanitarian claims, although migrants will likely remain detained during processing. The move reverses a key policy credited by the administration for a significant drop in illegal border crossings, and the Justice Department may appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has instructed a federal prosecutor to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. This action follows a referral from the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who released a report alleging the probe was a politically motivated effort to undermine Donald Trump. The move could lead to potential indictments, though the specific charges and targets remain unclear. This development re-ignites the long-standing political battle over the "Russiagate" controversy, with Democrats maintaining the original intelligence assessments were valid while Trump and his allies allege a conspiracy.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic state lawmakers who left Texas to prevent a vote on a Republican-led congressional redistricting plan. By leaving the state, the Democrats broke the legislative quorum, halting proceedings on a bill that would create five new GOP-leaning districts. House Speaker Dustin Burrows initiated a motion for their arrest to compel their return, which passed with a vote of 85 to 6. While Texas law enforcement lacks jurisdiction outside the state, the order escalates a major political standoff over redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

While their appearance can be alarming, scientists emphasize that native tarantulas are shy, reluctant to bite, and not dangerous to humans unless provoked.

Volunteers constitute nearly 70% of the nation's fire crews, saving an estimated $46.9 billion annually, but their numbers have declined by over 20% since 1985 while emergency calls have tripled. This burnout is forcing some communities to switch to paid departments, a costly alternative.

          <h2>Increased Screenings Lead to More Early-Stage Colon Cancer Diagnoses in Ages 45-49</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that a rise in colorectal cancer screenings among people aged 45 to 49 is linked to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screening rates in this group grew 62% from 2019 to 2023, while early-stage cancer incidence jumped 12% annually from 2019 to 2022. Researchers called the findings promising news, as earlier detection improves treatment outcomes. However, they also warned that screening rates in this younger demographic remain suboptimal and inequitable across education and insurance levels.</p>

          <p>In interviews, several of the Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a Republican redistricting plan stated they are prepared to stay away for the remainder of the special session and face any consequences. By denying Republicans a quorum, they have temporarily halted a vote on new U.S. House maps that would heavily favor the GOP. The lawmakers defended their actions as a constitutional tool to fight against what they call an egregious gerrymander that prioritizes Donald Trump's political goals over pressing state issues like flood relief. They acknowledged that Governor Greg Abbott could simply call another session but see their walkout as a necessary stand for democracy.</p>

          <p>A group of more than a dozen progressive Democrats in the U.S. House, led by Congressman Ro Khanna, are urging the Trump administration to formally recognize a Palestinian state. A draft letter to the president argues that the current tragic moment highlights the overdue need for Palestinian self-determination and rights. The letter, which will be sent in September, aligns with recent pledges from allies like France and Canada to support statehood at the UN. The move signals a growing willingness among some Democrats to push for a two-state solution, even as the Trump administration has stated it views such recognition as "rewarding Hamas."</p>

          <p>Maui firefighters have been battling a brush fire that broke out on Monday in the hills above Ka'anapali, near the location of the historic Sugar Cane Train warehouse. The blaze prompted the closure of both lanes of the Honoapiʻilani Highway between Puʻukoliʻi Road and Lower Honoapiʻilani Highway to facilitate firefighting efforts. In an update, the Maui County Fire Department stated that the fire was slowly being contained, although smoke continued to impact the area. The fire occurred just a few miles north of Lahaina, the site of the devastating and deadly wildfires that occurred nearly two years ago.</p>

Combs was convicted on two prostitution-related charges, though he was cleared of racketeering and sex trafficking, and faces up to 10 years in prison for each count.

He argued that despite weak labor data, the market's resilience stems from the fundamental strength of firms like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet, which he described as cash-rich "nation states." Cramer highlighted flawless performance in cloud computing, massive user engagement at Meta, and strong growth across Google's divisions. He suggested that even with some mixed results, the overall power and diverse revenue streams of these tech titans make them a dominant and unbeatable force in the current market.

The new rules, effective August 5, require two character references for shotgun applications and mandate that police investigate an applicant's domestic situation for signs of abuse or dishonesty.
