          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed performance on Wednesday, as investors keenly awaited the outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting, where an interest rate cut is widely anticipated. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi indices saw declines, reflecting broader market caution, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index notably climbed. Government data revealed that Japan's exports contracted less than expected in August, though Singapore experienced a significant plunge in non-oil domestic exports. The strong surge in Baidu's Hong Kong-listed shares, following a major offshore bond offering, also influenced the varied regional market activity.</p>

          <p>Christian Brückner, the primary suspect in the high-profile disappearance of Madeleine McCann, has been released from a German prison after completing a sentence for an unrelated offense. Brückner, who was convicted of sexually assaulting an elderly woman in Portugal in 2005 and had prior convictions for sexually assaulting children, maintains his innocence regarding Madeleine. German prosecutors, despite believing him responsible and citing mobile phone data placing him near the scene, have yet to find sufficient evidence to bring charges. Madeleine's 2007 disappearance from Praia da Luz remains one of the world's most enduring unsolved missing person cases.</p>

          <p>The "green hydrogen dream" is facing significant challenges, with major projects like the German-Australian deal between Fortescue and E.On being abandoned. High production costs, heavy reliance on government subsidies, and competition from cheaper fossil fuels are hindering large-scale development. The EU is projected to realize only 17% of its planned hydrogen projects by 2030, highlighting a widening gap between ambition and reality. While some companies like Fortescue continue to focus on niche applications like green iron and ammonia, experts suggest green hydrogen may only occupy a limited role in the clean energy mix.</p>

          <p>Hopes for a 0% tariff on UK steel exports to the US have been indefinitely put on hold, leaving the 25% tariff in place. Despite President Trump's earlier hints of relief, the UK steel industry expressed disappointment, though some sources noted a comparative advantage over countries facing 50% tariffs. The decision complicates efforts to support the financially distressed UK steel sector, which has seen plant closures and government interventions. US officials reportedly raised questions about Tata Steel's exports as a factor in the stalled negotiations.</p>

          <p>As the sun's 11-year cycle peaks in 2025, increasing the intensity of solar storms, concerns are rising about potential disruptions to global power grids and internet communication. A 2021 study highlighted the vulnerability of internet infrastructure, particularly unprotected satellites and undersea cable repeaters, to severe electromagnetic interference. Historical events, such as the 1859 Carrington Event and the 1989 Quebec power outage, demonstrate the potential for widespread blackouts and communication failures. Experts suggest mitigation strategies like shifting infrastructure to southern latitudes and implementing shorter, more resilient internet connections.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces are continuing a new ground offensive in Gaza City, with overnight strikes killing at least 13 people, including women and children, as hundreds of thousands remain in the war-torn city facing famine. This escalation pushes a ceasefire further out of reach, with the military aiming to destroy Hamas' infrastructure without a clear timeline. Qatar has condemned the operation as an "extension of the war of genocide," following a strike that killed Hamas members. Aid groups are urging stronger international measures to halt the offensive, citing a UN experts' commission report accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.</p>

Trump's past successful suits against other networks for specific misstatements contrast with this broad claim against the Times' campaign coverage.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to reduce its key interest rate by a quarter-point, marking the first cut in nine months. Economists anticipate a "recalibration" approach, with potentially five reductions by mid-next year, aiming to keep the economy growing without overstimulating it. This decision follows a sharp slowdown in hiring and significant downward revisions to job gains, strengthening the economic case for lower rates. However, persistently elevated inflation, partly due to tariffs, could temper the pace of future cuts, suggesting a cautious path forward.</p>

          <p>Great Britain's tennis team, led by Katie Boulter and Sonay Kartal, is set to compete in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals, aiming for their first-ever title. The team, featuring experienced players and rising stars, will face Japan in their quarter-final match. Despite Emma Raducanu's absence, the squad looks to improve on last year's semi-final run. Boulter brings crucial experience and a strong record for her country, while Kartal's rapid ascent and 100% BJK Cup record make her a valuable asset. The team hopes to make a significant score in this prestigious tournament.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani was controversially removed after five no-hit innings and just 68 pitches due to workload management, a decision his manager Dave Roberts defended as prioritizing the two-way star's health. Following Ohtani's exit, the Dodgers' bullpen spectacularly collapsed, surrendering nine runs over the next four innings in a 9-6 defeat to the Philadelphia Phillies. Despite Ohtani's dominant pitching and a later 50th home run from his bat, the relief corps' failure squandered a potential no-hitter and a significant lead. This marks another instance of the Dodgers' bullpen struggling in crucial moments.</p>

The judge stated this evidence did not significantly add to the abuse allegations already considered by the jury.

While listener contributions have surged short-term, the long-term financial stability remains volatile. NPR is offering $8 million in relief to hard-hit stations, but many argue more assistance is needed as they face significant revenue losses.</p>
