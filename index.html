          <p>The trial for the 2016 armed robbery of Kim Kardashian in Paris has begun, with ten individuals facing charges of robbery and kidnapping. Kardashian was in Paris for Fashion Week when the incident occurred, with the robbers making off with $10 million in jewelry, including a $4 million diamond ring. Kardashian is expected to testify in person, describing her fear during the event, thinking she would be sexually assaulted and killed. The defendants, dubbed "The Granddad Robbers," include one who has admitted to being a lookout and another whose DNA was found on the tape used to gag Kardashian.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are urging the White House to disclose financial transactions made before President Trump's recent tariff pause, expressing concerns about potential insider trading. Senators Schiff and Levin, along with 23 other Democrats, sent a letter requesting a full disclosure of financial transactions from senior White House and executive branch employees. The letter highlights the absence of periodic transaction reports on the Office of Government Ethics database since Trump took office, raising doubts about compliance with ethics regulations.

          <p>A divergence in consumer spending is emerging in America, with wealthy individuals increasing their spending while lower-income earners are reducing theirs. Data from credit card lenders reveals that spending among affluent consumers rose significantly, particularly in dining and luxury travel. In contrast, spending at retailers catering to lower-income consumers has declined, reflecting increased financial strain due to inflation and trade policy anxieties. This trend highlights the uneven economic impact of recent policies and the growing divide in consumer behavior.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump proposed that Canada should become the 51st state of the United States, suggesting Canadians should elect him to achieve this. He claimed this would benefit Canada by cutting taxes, increasing military power, and quadrupling business size with zero tariffs. Canadian political leaders, including Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and Prime Minister Mark Carney, strongly rejected the suggestion, emphasizing Canada's sovereignty and independence. The proposal came on the day of Canada's election, where polls show the Liberals ahead of the Conservatives.</p>

          <p>Recent news of paused data center projects by tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon has raised concerns about a potential bust in the AI data center market. However, industry experts and companies like Amazon and Nvidia maintain that the market remains strong, citing continued high demand for AI infrastructure. The pauses are attributed to strategic reallocations of resources amid evolving market dynamics, including new AI breakthroughs and trade policy concerns.

He anticipated adjustments in consumer behavior and potential de-escalation efforts from China.

Palestinian representatives accused Israel of a "genocidal campaign," while Israel has dismissed the proceedings as a "circus." The court's opinion, requested by the UN General Assembly, will address whether Israel acted unlawfully in overriding the immunities of a UN body.</p>
