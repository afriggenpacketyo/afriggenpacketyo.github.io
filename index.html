          <p>China's strategic export controls on rare earth elements, essential for manufacturing military equipment such as jet engines and radar systems, are raising concerns in the US defense industry. As the world's largest producer of these elements, China's restrictions are a calculated move in its trade war with the US, implemented in response to increased tariffs on Chinese goods. The article highlights the potential vulnerability of the US military supply chain and the broader implications for national security. The controls affect seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths, exacerbating trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

The dismissal comes after a federal judge expressed suspicion that the deportation occurred without due process. The Department of Justice argued that it was in the child's best interest to remain with her mother, countering claims of deporting American children.</p>

The meeting, involving Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, aims to de-escalate trade tensions. While initial discussions likely focus on de-escalation rather than a comprehensive trade deal, the hope is to scale back tariffs, which currently stand at 145% on Chinese goods and 125% on American imports.
