          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have filed a motion requesting a federal judge in Tennessee to order the Trump administration to cease making what they describe as inflammatory and false public statements about their client. They argue that comments from high-level officials, including President Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who have labeled Abrego Garcia an "animal" and a gang member, are tainting the potential jury pool and jeopardizing his right to a fair trial. Abrego Garcia, who was deported to El Salvador and then returned to the U.S. to face human trafficking charges to which he has pleaded not guilty, is at the center of a contentious legal and political battle over immigration and justice.</p>

          <p>The White House has appointed Jim O’Neill, a biotech investor and former speechwriter with no medical or infectious disease background, as the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This move follows the controversial firing of Dr. Susan Monarez and is seen as a way to advance Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s agenda to reform federal vaccine policy. The appointment has caused significant turmoil within the public health agency, leading to multiple resignations from top officials and sparking criticism from healthcare professionals and politicians who fear the agency's scientific integrity is being compromised amid ongoing challenges.</p>

Gross merchandise volume also saw a substantial 43% rise to $10.4 billion, reflecting strong consumer use of its services despite a competitive market that includes partners like Amazon and a recent shift by Walmart to a rival service.

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones defended the decision to trade star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, stating it gives the team a "chance to be better" both now and in the future. Jones emphasized the acquisition of Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark in the deal, which he believes will address the team's long-standing weakness in stopping the run. In addition to Clark, the Cowboys received two future first-round draft picks, which Jones views as valuable assets for acquiring multiple outstanding players. He maintained that the trade was a consensus decision and not a result of animosity over failed contract negotiations.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, is still in a protracted battle with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) over funding to complete critical infrastructure repairs. Mayor Andrew "FoFo" Gilich reports that the city is owed $34 million for a sewage and stormwater system upgrade, a project now estimated to cost $111 million due to rising costs over time.

          <p>California fire investigators are examining whether the prestigious Hundred Acre winery in Napa Valley may have played a role in starting the nearly 7,000-acre Pickett fire. A spokesperson for the winery confirmed they are cooperating with the investigation, which reportedly is looking into the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard sparked the blaze. The fire, which ignited on August 21 at an address associated with the Hundred Acre property, has threatened hundreds of buildings and wineries in the Calistoga area. While the fire's growth has stalled and no structures have been destroyed, the investigation into its cause continues amid significant firefighting efforts.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is changing its long-standing "customer of size" policy, which previously guaranteed a refund for an extra seat purchased by plus-size travelers. Under the new rules effective January 27, a refund will only be issued if the flight has at least one open seat upon departure, creating financial uncertainty for passengers needing more space. Advocates for the plus-size community have called the change "heartbreaking," arguing it creates financial and logistical barriers and reverses the airline's reputation for accessibility. The policy shift comes as Southwest prepares to introduce assigned seating, further complicating the travel experience for those who require additional room for safety and comfort.</p>

This detailed analysis raises further questions about the incident, which killed at least 20 people, including journalists.

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged former Department of Justice employee Sean Charles Dunn with misdemeanor assault after a grand jury refused to indict him on a more serious felony charge for allegedly throwing a sandwich at a federal officer. The incident occurred in Washington, D.C., during a period when federal authorities had been deployed by President Trump to address supposed crime issues in the capital. This marks the second recent case where the U.S. Attorney's office in D.C. has failed to secure a desired grand jury indictment against individuals accused of assaulting federal law enforcement, an unusually rare occurrence for DOJ prosecutors.</p>

In an interview, he emphasized that the city's success hinges on the speed at which its regulators adapt and embrace the Web3 industry. Zhao suggested that Hong Kong's government has shown a clear willingness to support the sector but must act quickly to realize its potential. One immediate recommendation he offered was for regulators to expand the limited range of cryptocurrencies currently permitted for trading on licensed exchanges to foster a more dynamic market.</p>

The refugees, who had fled persecution in Myanmar years ago, were told they had reached Indonesia but were found by local fishermen in war-torn Myanmar. Testimonies gathered by the BBC describe the refugees having their hands bound and faces covered before being cast into the sea with life jackets. A UN special rapporteur states there is "significant evidence" supporting these claims, which represent a terrifying escalation in the precarious situation of Rohingya in India.</p>

          <p>During the deadly mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, heroic middle school students are being credited with protecting younger children from gunfire. According to officials and parents, as the attack began, older students immediately pushed their younger "buddies"—part of a school mentorship program—under the pews and shielded them with their own bodies. One student reportedly took a shotgun blast to the back while covering another child. These selfless actions, along with those of teachers, are believed to have saved lives and prevented an even greater tragedy during the horrific event that killed two children and injured many others.</p>

          <p>An angler in Lake Huron discovered an unusually large grass carp, an invasive species known for its destructive impact on aquatic ecosystems, prompting a warning from Canadian officials. The sterile female fish measured over 1.2 meters long and weighed 26 kilograms, one of the largest specimens ever processed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Grass carp pose a significant threat because they can consume up to 40% of their body weight in vegetation daily, destroying habitats for native fish and birds. While this fish cannot reproduce, its presence highlights the ongoing risk of invasion in the Great Lakes, where the species has already begun breeding in U.S. tributaries.</p>

The film also features Adam Sandler in a well-received dramatic performance as the star's manager. Early reviews are varied but highlight the subtlety of Clooney's performance, which could position him as a contender in the upcoming awards season in a year crowded with A-list actors.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of 8,000 Americans indicates that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology is a net negative for the brand's appeal, with more consumers saying it would make them less likely to buy a Tesla than more likely. Only 14% of respondents found FSD to be an attractive feature, while 35% viewed it as a deterrent; nearly half believe the technology should be illegal. The findings present a challenge for Tesla, which has staked its future on autonomous driving, especially as the company faces a sales slump and reputational issues. The report suggests that a lack of clarity in marketing and a desire for stricter regulations are contributing to consumer skepticism.</p>

Since President Trump has not appointed replacements for the dismissed panel members, the necessary bipartisan majority for such an action does not exist. The ruling is a significant development in the ongoing legal battles over Lake's efforts to drastically reduce the operations and journalistic independence of VOA.</p>
