          <p>The Trump administration has announced new 30% tariffs on goods from Mexico and the European Union, set to take effect on August 1. In letters, President Trump cited Mexico's insufficient efforts to curb drug trafficking and persistent trade deficits with the EU as justifications for the move. Both Mexico and the EU have expressed disapproval, with the EU stating it will take necessary steps to safeguard its interests, including potential countermeasures. This action represents a significant escalation in the administration's trade policy, impacting major global supply chains and economic relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump stated on social media that he is giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of comedian Rosie O'Donnell, a long-time critic who recently moved to Ireland. He referred to her as a "threat to humanity," escalating a long-running public feud between the two figures. Legal experts note there is no legal basis or precedent for a president to revoke the citizenship of a U.S.-born citizen. O'Donnell responded on her own social media, calling the president a "criminal con man" and stating his actions are why she left the country.</p>

          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have made tennis history by becoming the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 89 years. They secured a 6-2 7-6 (7-3) victory over Rinky Hijikata and David Pel in the final. The win marks the first time two Britons have been crowned men's doubles champions at any Grand Slam since 1936. This achievement was a stated goal for the pair, who only teamed up less than a year ago after their previous partners won the same title in 2024.</p>

          <p>The family of Saifullah Kamel Musallet, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen from Tampa, Florida, reports he was beaten to death by Israeli settlers while visiting family in the occupied West Bank. The incident occurred in the town of Sinjil, where Musallet was allegedly protecting his family's land. According to his family, settlers blocked paramedics from reaching him for hours, and they are now demanding a U.S.-led investigation. The U.S. State Department has confirmed the death and is providing consular assistance, but has referred questions about the investigation to Israeli authorities amid ongoing tensions.</p>

          <p>The final day of the BST Hyde Park music festival has been canceled after headliners Jeff Lynne's ELO withdrew at the last minute due to health concerns.

The frontman was said to be "heartbroken" by the decision, which came after he had previously hinted this could be ELO's final performance.

Investigators are puzzled by this, as the switches have safety features to prevent accidental activation.

          <p>A trading card shop in New Bedford, Massachusetts, was robbed of more than $113,000 worth of rare Pokémon cards. The thief broke into 1st Edition Collectibles early Tuesday morning and stole a small number of high-value items, including a BGS 8.5 Skyridge Crystal Charizard and vintage boxes. The owners stated the perpetrator seemed to know exactly which valuable items to target, as prices are not displayed in the store. The stolen cards are serialized by grading companies, which the owners hope will help in tracking and recovering the items.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a massive overnight attack on Ukraine, firing hundreds of drones and cruise missiles that killed at least six people and wounded dozens more. Ukrainian officials reported deaths and injuries in the Chernivtsi, Dnipropetrovsk, and Sumy regions from missile strikes and falling drone debris. The western Lviv region, a key hub for foreign military aid, was also targeted. Ukraine's air force stated it shot down a majority of the incoming drones and missiles. The intensified long-range attacks coincide with a Russian effort to break through Ukrainian lines on the ground.</p>

          <p>Hartford Bakery, Inc. has voluntarily recalled hundreds of loaves of its "Lewis Bake Shop Artisan Style 1/2 Loaf" because the product may contain undeclared hazelnuts.

While no major injuries have been reported, the company is acting after receiving consumer complaints and one report of digestive discomfort after consumption.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated widespread layoffs, cutting more than 1,300 civil and foreign service employees as part of a major reorganization plan by the Trump administration. The move, which aims to reduce the domestic workforce by 15%, has eliminated or merged numerous offices, particularly those focused on human rights, refugee admissions, and foreign assistance. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the cuts will weaken America's diplomatic capabilities and national security. The administration contends the restructuring is necessary to eliminate redundancy and streamline the department's focus.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly fired at least 20 prosecutors and support staff who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into President Trump. According to sources, this move follows the earlier ousting of most senior prosecutors associated with the probes. The firings, which have included litigation assistants and U.S. marshals identified by a "weaponization working group," have reportedly sent a chill through the Department of Justice's career workforce. This action is seen as part of a broader purge of officials perceived as disloyal to the administration.</p>

          <p>A new analysis has ranked the U.S. state economies on their preparedness for a potential recession, considering factors like GDP growth, fiscal health, and exposure to trade wars and federal budget cuts. Florida was ranked as the strongest economy for the third consecutive year, praised for its solid growth and relative insulation from tariffs. It was followed by Texas, North Carolina, Delaware, and New York, all noted for having large, diverse economies or sound foundations that could help them navigate economic turmoil. The report highlights how states are positioning themselves as stable hubs for business amid national uncertainty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising trade war uncertainty, U.S. companies are increasingly using government-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce tariff payments. These zones allow businesses to import components and assemble products in a duty-free bubble, with taxes only collected when the final goods enter U.S. commerce. This strategy helps preserve cash flow, a critical concern for companies impacted by tariffs. However, a recent executive order has eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, which allowed companies to pay a lower duty on the finished product, creating new challenges for manufacturers.</p>

          <p>An investigation found that federal regulators repeatedly approved requests from Camp Mystic, a Texas girls' summer camp, to remove dozens of its buildings from a 100-year flood map in the years before a catastrophic flood killed 27 people. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) granted exemptions that loosened building regulations and insurance requirements for the camp, which is located in a region known as "flash flood alley." Experts find it disturbing that a camp responsible for children would seek exemptions from basic flood regulations, especially as it expanded its operations within the dangerous flood plain.</p>
