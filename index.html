          <p>Cassie Ventura faced a rigorous cross-examination in the Sean 'Diddy' Combs' sex trafficking trial, with defense attorneys presenting archived text messages to challenge her claims of coercion. The defense sought to portray Ventura as a willing participant in Combs' lifestyle, highlighting messages expressing love and enthusiasm for their sexual activities, including 'freak-offs.' Ventura maintained that while the messages appeared positive, she grew to fear Combs' violence and jealousy, and that she participated to please him initially, before realizing she did not enjoy the drug-fueled orgies. The trial continues, with concerns about Ventura's pregnancy potentially affecting the schedule.</p>

The move comes as the FDA prepares to implement a stricter approval process for vaccines, and reflects Kennedy's long-standing criticism of mRNA vaccines and mass vaccination campaigns.

          <p>Denver air traffic control experienced a communications failure for about two minutes, prompting concerns about the aging infrastructure of the FAA. The FAA said controllers maintained contact through an emergency frequency and there was no loss of separation between airplanes. The incident follows a series of telecom outages at the facility overseeing Newark air traffic, raising questions about the reliability of the air traffic control system. The FAA is investigating the incident, and the transportation secretary has proposed spending billions of dollars to fix the infrastructure.</p>
