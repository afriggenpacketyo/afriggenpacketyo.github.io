          <p>A trade loophole that allowed low-value packages, especially from retailers like Shein and Temu, to enter the U.S. duty-free expired on May 2nd, potentially raising prices for American consumers. This de minimis exemption, initially designed to ease trade, has seen a surge in e-commerce exports from China, now facing new tariffs of up to 145%. Experts predict that the end of this exemption will not only increase costs but also cause delays due to increased inspections, potentially diminishing the market and affecting smaller retailers disproportionately. Some believe domestic companies may benefit from the new landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Early results from recent elections in the UK indicate that the Reform party is posing a significant challenge to the Conservative and Labour parties. The Reform party has gained seats primarily at the expense of the Conservatives, who have suffered a substantial decline in their vote share. While Labour has also experienced a decrease in support, they managed to hold onto key mayoral positions. The Liberal Democrats and the Greens are expected to maintain a similar level of support as in previous elections, but narrow wins and losses suggest a fragmented political landscape.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has enlisted a team of prominent conservative lawyers, including former clerks to Supreme Court justices and advisors to the Trump Organization, to defend itself against a lawsuit from the Trump administration. This strategic move is seen as a departure from Harvard's previous legal approaches, aiming to appeal to the conservative-leaning Supreme Court. The university argues that the administration's demands, including the elimination of certain professors and the banning of international students with dissenting views, violate the First Amendment. The case could have significant financial implications for Harvard, with billions of dollars in federal funds at stake.</p>

The book explores how Malcolm X's influence has continued to grow after his death, and how his piercing questions about Black identity and racial injustice still resonate in the fractious politics of today.</p>

          <p>Senator Roger Wicker, a leading Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, has criticized President Trump's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for proposing cuts to military capabilities in the 2026 fiscal year budget. Wicker argues that the proposed budget, despite increasing defense spending to $1.01 trillion, effectively cuts the military's base budget by keeping discretionary spending at the same level as the previous year. He stated that this budget would decrease President Trump's military options and his negotiating leverage, and that reconciliation defense spending does not replace the need for real growth in the military's base budget.</p>

          <p>American Airlines' new suites with sliding doors are set to start flying on some of its planes in June, after facing delays from suppliers. The suites are a key part of the airline's strategy to compete against more profitable rivals for high-spending customers. The new seats will debut on the Boeing 787-9 for regularly scheduled service between Chicago and London, followed by other routes.</p>
