          <p>With global equities at all-time highs, financial strategists are advising investors to consider defensive options to protect their portfolio gains. The market is facing uncertainty due to a weakening labor market and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could signal broader economic trouble. Experts suggest re-evaluating over-concentration in mega-cap tech stocks and shifting some capital towards value and defensive sectors that have been overlooked in the recent market rally.

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has laid off almost 100 employees in recent months, a direct result of significant cuts in federal funding. The workforce reduction follows a congressional vote in July that eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, forcing PBS to slash its budget by 21%. While no stations have shut down, many are now appealing for public donations to remain operational amidst the financial strain.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C.'s Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has seen a sharp drop in ticket sales and a 50% decline in subscription revenue since Donald Trump became its chairman. Performances that were once popular are now facing houses less than 20% full, with audiences reportedly "voting with their feet" in protest of the new leadership. The downturn is exacerbated by recent staff changes, including the firing of the dance programming team, fueling concerns about the venue's artistic and financial future.</p>

          <p>The once-booming U.S. industrial warehouse sector has experienced its first quarterly drop in demand since 2010, signaling a significant cooldown. After a surge driven by the pandemic's e-commerce boom, economic uncertainty from tariff policies and high inflation has taken a toll, with net absorption falling by 11.3 million square feet in the second quarter. While property sales remain steady, price appreciation has slowed, and experts predict demand will remain nearly flat for the rest of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has sanctioned three prominent Palestinian human rights groups for requesting an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into alleged Israeli war crimes and genocide in Gaza. The organizations—the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and Al-Haq—were designated for engaging with the ICC's efforts to prosecute Israeli nationals. This move complicates their ability to document alleged abuses and collaborate with international partners, and has been condemned by the groups as an "immoral, illegal and undemocratic act."</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown looming at the end of September, House Republican appropriators are clashing with the Trump administration over the duration of a necessary stopgap spending bill. While lawmakers on the Appropriations Committee prefer a short-term continuing resolution (CR) to allow their work to proceed, some in the administration and conservative circles are pushing for a year-long CR. This internal friction has created frustration and uncertainty, as lawmakers race to find a solution and avoid a shutdown.</p>

Linehan is accused of posting abusive online comments about Brooks and throwing her phone after a confrontation in London last October; he has pleaded not guilty to harassment and criminal damage. In his defense, Linehan stated that his actions and online comments were a response to what he describes as years of demonization and harassment due to his views on gender identity.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's proposal to use the National Guard in high-crime cities like Chicago and Baltimore is a politically astute move that capitalizes on public concern for law and order. The author contends that by taking a strong stance, Trump forces his opponents to defend unpopular positions while addressing a real crisis that has persisted under Democratic leadership in these cities. The piece suggests this tactic is part of a larger strategy where Trump frames key issues in a way that aligns with the sentiments of a majority of voters.</p>

          <p>The release of a weak August jobs report, which showed the U.S. economy adding only 22,000 jobs, has almost certainly secured an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve at its next meeting. The data prompted renewed criticism from the Trump administration, with officials urging Fed Chair Jerome Powell to act immediately to lower rates. With investors now pricing in a 99% probability of a cut, the focus shifts to whether this will be a single adjustment or the start of a longer easing cycle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy showed a continued hiring slowdown in August, adding only 22,000 jobs, in the first jobs report released since President Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner.
