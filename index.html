The timeline highlights key events, including wars in 1949, 1965, and 1999, and India's 2019 decision to revoke Kashmir's special status, all contributing to the ongoing instability in the region.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 100 percent tariff on movies "produced" outside the United States, citing national security concerns. The Motion Picture Association declined to comment on the proposal. The potential scope of the tariff remains unclear, including whether it would apply to independent films, streaming content, or movies with scenes shot overseas. The move could significantly impact Hollywood's practice of filming in foreign locales to take advantage of tax incentives and lower labor costs.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) is likely to rank fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place. The decline in Japan's aid is attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years. The United States remains the top ODA donor. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members fell, marking the first decline after five years of growth, due to reduced contributions to international organizations and decreased aid for Ukraine.</p>
