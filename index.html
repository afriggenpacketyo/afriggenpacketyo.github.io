          <p>A significant heatwave is impacting large areas of the U.S. Midwest and Southeast, with heat advisories and extreme heat warnings affecting over 163 million people. Temperatures are forecasted to be 10 to 15 degrees above average, with heat indexes reaching up to 115 degrees Fahrenheit in some regions due to a persistent heat dome. Officials are urging residents to take precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as staying hydrated, limiting outdoor activities, and checking on vulnerable neighbors. The extreme conditions are expected to persist through the coming week with minimal overnight relief.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece by Jonathan Turley asserts that recently declassified documents challenge the foundation of the Russia collusion investigation, suggesting it was a politically motivated effort. The article identifies former officials like John Brennan and James Clapper as key figures who allegedly promoted the narrative despite internal doubts and contradictory intelligence. Turley claims these officials are now facing scrutiny and that the media, which amplified the original claims, is downplaying these new revelations. He frames the situation as the "real Russian conspiracy" being uncovered.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's extensive use of tariffs is facing a critical legal test, with a federal appeals court set to hear arguments challenging his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A lower court previously ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, though that decision was paused pending appeal. The outcome of this case and several others could invalidate numerous trade deals and tariffs implemented by the administration, which argues it is using congressionally granted powers to protect national security. The case is widely expected to reach the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi completed a visit to the Maldives aimed at reinforcing diplomatic and economic relations as the island nation has recently tilted towards China. Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, who previously ran on an anti-India platform, has moderated his rhetoric amid economic challenges. During the visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several Indian-funded infrastructure projects. The trip underscores the geopolitical significance of the Maldives, located on key Indian Ocean shipping lanes, and India's efforts to counteract growing Chinese influence in the region.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team faces uncertainty over the fitness of captain Ben Stokes ahead of the final day of the fourth Test against India. After taking five wickets in the first innings and scoring a century, Stokes did not bowl on the fourth day due to being "a bit stiff and sore," according to assistant coach Marcus Trescothick. Stokes has a history of injuries, and his absence from the bowling attack could be critical as England pushes for a victory. His condition will be assessed overnight, with his participation crucial to England's chances of winning the match.</p>

          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. The 2002 movie, which starred Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, is credited with inspiring a generation of female football players. Chadha stated that the recent success of England's Lionesses and the upcoming Women's World Cup make it an ideal time to revisit the characters. She hopes to reunite the original cast and potentially include cameos from current England players, with a target release around the film's 25th anniversary in 2027.</p>

          <p>A USAID analysis of over 150 reported incidents found no evidence of widespread, systematic diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in Gaza, according to a presentation reviewed by ABC News. This finding appears to contradict repeated claims by the Trump administration and Israel, which have been used to justify limiting aid through traditional channels. The report, compiled before USAID ceased independent operations, noted that in most cases of lost aid, the perpetrator could not be identified.

          <p>BBC analyst Jeremy Bowen describes the plan to airdrop aid into Gaza as a crude and desperate measure that will not solve the territory's hunger crisis. Drawing on his experience from past conflicts in Iraq and Bosnia, he argues that airdrops are inefficient, dangerous, and deliver far less aid than truck convoys. He points out the risks of pallets landing in hazardous areas or on shelters in the densely packed territory, leading to injuries and deaths. Bowen contends that only a ceasefire and an unrestricted, long-term ground-based humanitarian operation can truly address the widespread starvation.</p>

          <p>The UK, Jordan, and the UAE are preparing to airdrop humanitarian aid into Gaza, following Israel's approval for such measures to alleviate a severe hunger crisis. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office announced collaboration with Jordan on airdrops and plans to evacuate children needing medical care. However, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees warned that airdrops are an inefficient and potentially dangerous distraction. Meanwhile, ceasefire talks remain stalled, with Hamas expressing surprise at U.S. suggestions that the group did not genuinely want a deal.</p>

The FDA recommends a limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, equivalent to about two to three cups for many people. However, some individuals are more sensitive and may experience anxiety or jitters with less. Experts advise listening to one's body and being mindful of how caffeine affects sleep and appetite.

According to internal documents, the "Doge AI Deregulation Decision Tool" is analyzing 200,000 regulations with the goal of cutting half of them by the first anniversary of a potential second term. The initiative aligns with President Trump's campaign promise for an aggressive regulatory reduction. A White House spokesperson confirmed that "all options are being explored" to enhance government efficiency, but stated that no single plan has been finalized.</p>

          <p>Media executive Tom Rogers, once a self-proclaimed "raging bull" on Netflix, has tempered his optimism, citing new concerns about the streaming giant's long-term growth. He points to the increasing competition from free content on platforms like YouTube, noting that while Netflix has more hit shows, its viewing time per subscriber has declined. Rogers believes the rise of AI will be a "double-edged sword," helping Netflix with ad targeting but also empowering amateur creators on YouTube to produce professional-level content. While still dominant, he suggests this engagement lag is a worrisome sign for the company.</p>

The lawmakers argue the book is relevant to congressional oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation.

By appearing to defend powerful interests in this case, Trump is seen as contradicting his populist message. The lingering questions and conspiracy theories surrounding the case have created a spiraling controversy that has become difficult for the White House to manage or contain.</p>

Kennedy was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) after a pre-surgery X-ray revealed scarring on his lungs, despite him having no prior symptoms. As his condition rapidly deteriorated, he was placed on the national transplant list and received the life-saving operation at the Cleveland Clinic. Now recovering, he has regained 98% of his lung capacity and plans to train a new hospital therapy dog named "Encore" to celebrate his second chance at life.</p>
