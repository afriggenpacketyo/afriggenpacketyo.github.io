          <p>U.S. stocks experienced volatile trading, concluding a three-day rally fueled by hopes of easing trade tensions. Market reactions were influenced by conflicting signals from the White House regarding potential trade deals with China. Several companies, including Intel, Eastman Chemical, and Skechers U.S.A., cautioned that the trade war's uncertainty is hindering their ability to provide financial forecasts. While Treasury yields eased and the U.S. dollar rebounded, analysts remain cautious about the economic impact of ongoing tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
