          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after a nodule was found on his prostate, leading to further evaluation. While the cancer is aggressive, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians, as he faces this health challenge after previously battling skin cancer and losing his son Beau to brain cancer.

          <p>A scam known as "brushing" involves third-party sellers sending unsolicited, low-value items to random people to manipulate online product reviews. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service warns against scanning QR codes included in these packages, as they can lead to malicious websites that steal personal data. If you receive a package you didn’t order, do not scan QR codes, do not return the item, check your financial accounts, and report the package to authorities.</p>
