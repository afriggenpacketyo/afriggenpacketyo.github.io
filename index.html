The luxury sector is facing headwinds from U.S. trade policy, with investors closely monitoring the potential impact of tariffs on consumer demand.

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom launched a tourism campaign to attract Canadian visitors, emphasizing the state's welcoming atmosphere and distancing it from President Trump's policies. The campaign aims to counter a recent decline in Canadian tourism, attributed to concerns about U.S. policies. Newsom highlighted California's iconic attractions and inclusive values, assuring Canadians of a warm reception. The state's tourism industry anticipates a $6 billion decline in revenue this year, largely due to reduced international visits.</p>

            <p>Amid economic uncertainty caused by tariffs, financial experts suggest keeping a small amount of cash at home for emergencies like power outages or natural disasters. While not all planners deem it essential, having $500 to $1,000 on hand is considered prudent. Experts caution against hoarding large amounts of cash due to lack of FDIC insurance and potential for loss or theft.

            <p>A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that the U.S. is vulnerable due to China's control over rare earth elements, essential for defense technologies. China's export controls on these elements could threaten Washington's military capabilities. The U.S. lacks the capacity to fill a potential shortfall in medium and heavy rare earth elements processing. While efforts are underway to develop domestic supply chains, the U.S. remains far from achieving independence in rare earth element supply.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has cut funding for a study for dementia patients. The decision will eliminate jobs, wipe out years of expertise, collaboration and critical momentum in brain disease research. The funding for dementia studies is disappearing, and the idea of being further from a treatment, a cure, and identifying biomarkers for Steve’s disease and others is a major concern.</p>

In November, Riggs, a Democrat, appeared to win reelection to the court by a paper-thin 734-vote margin, but her opponent, Republican Jefferson Griffin, has challenged more than 60,000 votes—effectively trying to get courts to change the rules of the election, despite the votes already having been cast and counted. The battle has now dragged into its fifth month, and could stretch on for months to come.</p>

The federal government’s National Travel and Tourism Office released preliminary figures last week showing visits to the US from overseas fell 11.6% in March compared with the same month last year.
