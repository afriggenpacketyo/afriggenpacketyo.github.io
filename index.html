          <p>Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska provided a crucial vote to pass President Trump's major tax-and-spending bill in the Senate.

          <p>This opinion column analyzes the escalating feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump, framing it as a lesson in the treacherous nature of political alliances with authoritarian figures. The author argues that Trump's threat to potentially deport Musk, a naturalized citizen, sets a chilling precedent for using denaturalization as a political weapon against any opponent. The piece connects this threat to similar rhetoric used against NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, warning that such actions undermine democratic principles. It concludes that the potential for silencing dissent through citizenship-stripping threats affects millions of naturalized Americans.</p>

          <p>The families of the four murdered University of Idaho students are divided over a potential plea deal for the accused killer, Bryan Kohberger. The father of victim Madison Mogen expressed relief that a deal would bring closure and spare them from a lengthy trial and appeals process. In contrast, the family of Kaylee Goncalves stated they are "beyond furious" and do not approve of the deal, demanding a full confession and accountability. The proposed agreement would see Kohberger plead guilty to all counts in exchange for four consecutive life sentences without parole, avoiding the death penalty.</p>

          <p>The British rap-punk duo Bob Vylan has defended their on-stage comments at the Glastonbury Festival, stating they are being unfairly targeted for speaking about the war in Gaza.

In a statement, the band clarified they are not calling for the death of any group of people but for the "dismantling of a violent military machine."

The acquisition would create the third-largest bank in Britain by share of personal current accounts. While the companies state it is "business as usual for now," the deal is expected to lead to job cuts and branch closures due to overlapping operations.</p>

The bill also introduces a new "bonus" deduction for seniors, creates tax-advantaged "Trump accounts" for children, and establishes new tax breaks for car loan interest and tip income.

          <p>The Republican "big, beautiful bill" passed by the Senate proposes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which could cause nearly 12 million people to lose their health insurance over the next decade, according to the CBO. The legislation introduces a national work requirement for many beneficiaries and restricts how states can fund their share of the program. Healthcare advocates and hospital associations warn that these deep funding cuts will be devastating, particularly for rural hospitals that heavily rely on Medicaid reimbursement to stay operational. The bill includes a fund to aid these hospitals, but critics argue it is insufficient. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare will now block AI crawlers from scraping website data by default, a significant move to protect content creators. New domains on Cloudflare will be prompted to opt-in to allow AI bots, giving publishers control over their data and the ability to charge for access. The company argues that AI models have been taking content without limit, depriving original creators of traffic and revenue. This change could impact how AI companies like OpenAI and Google train their large language models, shifting the power dynamic back towards website owners.</p>

          <p>Quinta Brunson, the creator and star of "Abbott Elementary," has spoken about her discomfort with the public disclosure of her divorce from Kevin Anik. In a recent interview, she stated that she "hated" that the news became public through media reports based on court filings before she was ready to address it herself. Brunson emphasized that people in the public eye do not want every detail of their private lives exposed. She and Anik were married for three years, and she cited "irreconcilable differences" in the divorce petition filed in March.</p>

          <p>The public feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has intensified, with the president threatening to investigate deporting the billionaire and cutting his companies' subsidies. The conflict reignited over Musk's vocal opposition to Trump's signature tax and spending bill, which Musk called "insane" and a threat to the nation's finances. In response, Trump suggested he could unleash the "Department of Government Efficiency" (Doge) on its former leader. The escalating war of words between the two powerful figures marks a sharp downturn in their once-close political alliance.</p>
