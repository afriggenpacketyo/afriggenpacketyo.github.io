        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to cut reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, signaling a temporary de-escalation in their ongoing trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that both sides will reduce their tariffs to 10%, with China removing its countermeasures. This agreement comes after successful talks in Geneva aimed at establishing a basis for broader trade negotiations, which had been disrupted by President Trump's tariff measures in April. The effective tariff on Chinese goods entering the U.S. will be 30% during this period, while China's effective tariffs will be at 10%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labor Party has revealed its plans to reduce immigration into the UK, focusing on a "controlled, selective, and fair" system. Key measures include tightening skilled worker visa requirements, expanding eligibility for high-potential individual visas, and doubling the time immigrants must reside in the UK before applying for permanent residency to 10 years. The dedicated visa for social care providers will be abolished, and overseas graduates will only be able to stay for 18 months post-studies. While aiming to significantly reduce net migration, the prime minister is not setting an overall cap.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Stars secured a critical 5-2 win over the Winnipeg Jets in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, taking a 2-1 series lead. A controversial goal by Alexander Petrovic, initially reviewed for a potential kicking motion, was ultimately allowed after officials ruled that Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck propelled the puck into his own net. Jets coach Scott Arniel contested the interpretation of the rule, while Stars coach Peter DeBoer expressed relief that officials took the time to review the play thoroughly. Mikko Rantanen also scored for the Stars shortly after play resumed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The spring art auctions are approaching cautiously, with auction houses recalibrating for an art market facing economic uncertainty and new challenges like tariffs. Estimates for high-end artworks have been adjusted, and the absence of headline-grabbing estates has led to a focus on conventional offerings. Despite these challenges, auction houses are still betting on a successful week of sales, with a combined estimate of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. Key artworks to watch include a Giacometti bust and a Mondrian painting, which will serve as indicators of the art market's health.</p>

          <p>Analysts and strategists believe that the recent US-China tariff agreement could reignite risk-on sentiment, benefiting stocks and US assets. JPMorgan Asset Management's Tai Hui notes that the magnitude of the tariff reduction is larger than expected, though uncertainty remains regarding a more concrete trade arrangement. Mizuho Bank's Jordan Rochester suggests that the deal will squeeze the "Sell America" narrative. Wall Street strategists predict that stocks could rally further, with Barclays noting that there is still much dispersion between domestic and exporters and that overall positioning is light/defensive.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. rule mandates that hotel and short-term lodging companies disclose "junk fees," such as resort or destination fees, upfront. The rule, announced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), aims to curtail practices that allow businesses to charge more without appearing to raise prices. While the rule is designed to increase transparency, concerns have been raised about enforcement due to the Trump administration's efforts to reduce staff at the FTC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Some companies, like Airbnb, have already begun displaying these fees upfront.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman's Tools for Humanity has introduced eye-scanning orbs to verify human identity in the age of AI, sparking both curiosity and controversy. The orbs offer a way to prove humanness without personal information, but critics raise concerns about the risks of handing over biometric data. While the company claims that the orb captures photos of a personâ€™s face and eyes, but doesnâ€™t store any of that data, privacy advocates remain skeptical. The project has faced scrutiny from regulators in various countries due to data privacy concerns.</p>

          <p>The launch of a BBC Maestro digital class featuring an AI-resurrected Agatha Christie teaching writing has sparked controversy, given Christie's well-documented aversion to public speaking and discussing her writing process. Despite efforts to create an authentic experience through a carefully crafted script, costume, and set, the class is limited by its format as a two-and-a-half-hour lecture. Some argue that Christie deserves a more comprehensive tribute, such as a play or miniseries, that explores her extraordinary life and artistic contributions beyond the use of AI technology.</p>

          <p>As President Trump expresses his determination to deploy U.S. military force against Mexican drug cartels, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum faces a significant challenge with limited options. While Sheinbaum has rejected Trump's offer to send troops, analysts suggest Mexico could enhance cooperation through training, technology, and armaments. Experts believe a complete rupture in U.S.-Mexico relations is unlikely due to Mexico's dependence on U.S. capital and markets. Possible responses include formal protests, recalling the ambassador, and reducing cooperation on immigration and security.</p>

          <p>Contributors argue that Congress should modify the tax code to aid victims of the Palisades and Eaton fires, preventing burned lots from remaining empty for decades. The current tax law incentivizes fire victims to hold onto their properties until death to avoid income taxes on insurance proceeds and lot sales. They propose exempting fire victims from income taxes on insurance proceeds and lot sales and allowing income tax deferral for buyers who use sale proceeds to purchase or build new residences in the fire areas. These reforms aim to incentivize rebuilding and restore the tax base in affected communities.</p>

          <p>Research on wild chimpanzees has revealed two key building blocks of human speech: rhythmic structures and call combinations. Studies have found that chimps use drumming patterns with regional variations and combine calls to create new meanings, suggesting these abilities were present early in human evolution. These findings support research on communication in other primates and highlight the importance of rhythm and complex vocalizations in social behavior. However, wild chimpanzee populations are threatened by hunting, the pet trade, and habitat destruction, making such studies increasingly difficult.</p>
