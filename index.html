          <p>British number one Jack Draper has withdrawn from the US Open ahead of his second-round match against Zizou Bergs, citing an arm injury. The fifth seed, who reached the semi-finals last year, had been dealing with the issue since Wimbledon. Draper stated that the discomfort became too severe, necessitating his withdrawal to prioritize his health. This unfortunate development impacts his campaign at Flushing Meadows, where he was considered a strong contender for the title.</p>

          <p>A tragic shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, with 17 others injured, including 14 children. The incident occurred during a mass marking the start of the school year, as the 23-year-old shooter, Robin Westman, fired a rifle through church windows before dying by suicide. Law enforcement and government officials, including President Trump and Governor Walz, expressed condolences and called for action against such violence. The community is grappling with the horrific event that targeted innocent children in a place of worship.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the latest COVID-19 vaccines but has significantly limited their authorization, clearing them only for individuals at higher risk of severe illness, such as those aged 65 and older or younger adults with underlying conditions. This marks a departure from previous broad recommendations for all ages and could complicate access for healthy adults, potentially affecting insurance coverage. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic, lauded the new framework, emphasizing science and safety, while some experts express concern over the rescinded emergency use authorizations for healthy young children.</p>

          <p>A new Lending Tree study reveals that nearly six million full-time workers without a bachelor's degree earned at least $100,000 in 2023, challenging the traditional view of college as the sole path to financial success. The report highlights diverse fields, including software development, sales engineering, and elevator repair, where a significant percentage of non-degree holders achieve six-figure salaries. This trend aligns with growing skepticism among young people about the value of a college degree amid rising tuition costs and student debt. Many companies are also relaxing degree requirements, opening more opportunities for skilled workers.</p>

          <p>Google has cut more than 35% of its managers overseeing small teams in the past year as part of an ongoing effort to reduce bureaucracy and enhance efficiency. This move follows several rounds of layoffs, buyouts, and reorganizations across the company, aiming for managers to constitute a smaller percentage of the overall workforce. CEO Sundar Pichai reiterated the need for Google to scale efficiently without solely relying on headcount increases. The company has also offered voluntary buyouts, which executives report have been successful, with many employees opting for career breaks.</p>

          <p>Following Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's engagement announcement, numerous brands quickly capitalized on the news, offering well-wishes and promotional deals across social media. Companies from food chains to airlines integrated the couple's news into their marketing strategies, often with Swift-themed captions and product placements. Experts note this trend reflects brands' efforts to connect with audiences through pop culture, though some caution against opportunistic and inauthentic engagement. While some brands like Ralph Lauren and Starbucks garnered praise for their relevant and witty responses, others risk audience fatigue by jumping on every cultural moment without genuine connection.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has accused Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud, alleging she claimed primary residency in two states, a charge her attorney denies and plans to challenge. This accusation highlights owner-occupancy mortgage fraud, where borrowers claim a primary residence for lower interest rates and tax benefits. Experts, including former Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, note such fraud is difficult to prove in court, requiring specific intent to deceive rather than just a mistake. The Department of Justice has also pursued similar allegations against other public figures, bringing attention to this complex issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite market speculation about a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September, credit card interest rates are unlikely to fall anytime soon. The average APR on credit cards is currently near 22%, and historical trends show that while card issuers quickly raise rates after Fed hikes, they are much slower and less generous in lowering them. Issuers also factor in high risk due to climbing credit card delinquencies and inflation remaining above the Fed's target, leading them to maintain higher APRs. Consumers are advised to proactively seek lower rates through negotiation, balance transfers, debt management plans, or personal loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent overhauls to the federal student loan system have created significant challenges for borrowers seeking accurate information and assistance from the Department of Education or loan servicers. Many borrowers report receiving conflicting information and facing long wait times, impacting their ability to access programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Experts advise contacting the Federal Student Aid Information Center or their specific loan servicer, ideally early on weekday mornings, or utilizing online chat options. The issues stem from dramatic changes following court actions and new legislation, making it crucial for borrowers to proactively monitor official websites and seek help from non-profits.

          <p>Ryanair is set to increase the bonus for staff who identify passengers with oversized cabin bags from €1.50 to €2.50 per bag, effective this November. CEO Michael O'Leary stated the change aims to deter the minority of passengers who flout bag size limits, not to 'catch people out.' The airline also plans to remove the €80 monthly cap on staff earnings from this bonus. O'Leary defended the policy as necessary for faster boarding and fewer delays, while also dismissing sustainable aviation fuel targets as 'nonsense' due to supply issues.</p>

          <p>In the Negev desert, archaeologists are unearthing remnants of the ancient Nabataean civilization, including a 1,500-year-old Christian church at the long-abandoned oasis city of Mamshit. Known for their city of Petra and extensive trade routes, the Nabataeans built caravanserais and churches to support their voyages, transitioning to Christianity in the 4th century A.D. The discovery of intact baptismal pools, including a cross-shaped one for adults, offers a tangible link to their past. This site serves as a powerful reminder of societal change and the impermanence of human endeavors across millennia.</p>

          <p>Democrat Catelin Drey secured a significant victory in Iowa's state senate district 1, defeating Republican Christopher Prosch in a special election and breaking the Republican supermajority. Drey, a marketing executive, won with 55% of the vote, representing a substantial swing from Donald Trump's previous performance in the district. Her win is seen as a rejection of the 'Maga agenda' and a sign that voters are frustrated with current policies. This marks the second state senate seat flipped by Democrats in Iowa this year, potentially signaling trouble for Republicans in upcoming midterm elections.</p>

Goldman Sachs analysts also share a bullish outlook, forecasting an upside to iPhone revenues and reiterating a buy rating on Apple shares.

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs receiver Rashee Rice has reportedly accepted a six-game NFL ban following his involvement in a high-speed crash that injured multiple people. Rice pleaded guilty in July to felony charges of collision involving serious bodily injury and racing, receiving a 30-day jail sentence and a requirement to pay $115,000 in medical costs. The incident occurred in March 2024 when Rice was driving 119mph and made aggressive maneuvers. The NFL's suspension comes a week before the Chiefs' season opener, meaning Rice will miss several key games before being eligible to return in October.</p>
