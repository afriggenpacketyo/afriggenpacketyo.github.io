          <p>Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration are in a legal battle over the decision to cut more than $2 billion in federal research grants to the university. The administration claims the cuts are a necessary response to antisemitism on campus, a justification the presiding judge described as "mind-boggling." Harvard argues the move is an attempt to control the institution and will harm critical research in medicine and other fields. The case highlights ongoing tensions between the administration and the university, with a ruling expected soon.</p>

While some of Dr. King's relatives supported the move for transparency, his living children urged the public to view the files with caution, noting the FBI's history of illegal surveillance against their father and the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 28 countries, including the UK, France, and Japan, has issued a joint statement calling for an immediate end to the war in Gaza. The statement strongly condemns the "inhumane killing of civilians" and what it calls Israel's "dangerous" aid delivery model, which it says deprives Gazans of dignity and has led to hundreds of deaths. The nations are urging for a permanent ceasefire and have warned they are prepared to take further action to support a political path to peace.

          <p>The Pentagon has announced that the 700 active-duty Marines deployed to Los Angeles earlier this summer will be sent home. The troops were sent to the city in response to protests against federal immigration policies, a rare move that drew criticism from California's governor. A Pentagon spokesperson stated that the redeployment was ordered as "stability" has returned to the area. The deployment was intended to protect federal property and personnel, though about 2,000 National Guard members will remain in the Los Angeles area for that purpose.</p>

          <p>An article revisits advice from the late Charlie Munger, who once bluntly stated his belief that homeownership is primarily for married couples, not single people. At a 1998 Berkshire Hathaway meeting, Munger remarked, "The single people, I don't care if they ever get a house," suggesting a home should be bought out of necessity, which he defined as "when your wife wants one." His perspective contrasted with Warren Buffett's view of home buying as a low-return capital investment. The advice is presented as particularly relevant today amid soaring home prices.

          <p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), under Trump-appointed Director Tulsi Gabbard, has released documents claiming the Obama administration "manufactured and politicized intelligence" regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Critics, including Democratic lawmakers, have dismissed the report as "utter nonsense" and a politically motivated effort to amplify conspiracy theories, arguing the newly released documents do not contradict the core findings of the 2017 intelligence assessment.</p>

          <p>A reverse mortgage can be a particularly sensible financial tool for senior homeowners in the current economic landscape. This financial product allows homeowners aged 62 and older to receive payments from their home equity without the burden of immediate monthly repayments. This can supplement income from sources like Social Security, which may be insufficient due to inflation. Unlike other loans, repayments are typically deferred until the home is sold or the owner passes away, making it a stable option in a high-interest-rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>
