          <p>A tragic mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of two children, aged eight and ten, and injuries to 17 others during morning mass. Police identified the suspect, Robin Westman, 23, who died by self-inflicted gunshot, as harboring a "deranged fascination" with mass shooters and expressing widespread hate in their writings. Investigators believe Westman had intended to enter the church, but locked doors forced them to fire through windows, a factor that authorities say significantly reduced the potential casualty count. The incident, now being investigated as a possible act of domestic terrorism and hate crime, has prompted renewed calls for gun control and community healing.</p>

          <p>Gap's fiscal second-quarter revenue fell short of analyst expectations, leading to a more than 5% drop in shares, despite earnings per share beating estimates. The company's overall comparable sales rose 1%, but this was primarily driven by strong performance at Banana Republic, Gap, and Old Navy, while Athleta's comparable sales declined by 9%. CEO Richard Dickson acknowledged Athleta's struggles, attributing them to a shift away from its performance roots and a focus on new customers over its core base. Gap also increased its fiscal 2025 tariff cost outlook, though it reaffirmed its net sales growth projections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite previous denials, the Dallas Cowboys are reportedly now open to trade offers for All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons, who has not participated in full practice since last season. Parsons, entering his fifth-year option, requested a trade amid a contract dispute with owner Jerry Jones, arguing for a higher salary as a linebacker rather than a defensive end. His social media activity has also indicated a desire to leave Dallas. With Parsons under team control for the next three years via contract options and franchise tags, any trade asking price is expected to be astronomical for the highly coveted player.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is experiencing significant turmoil following President Trump's firing of Director Susan Monarez and the resignations of four other top health officials. This upheaval stems from profound concerns over the Trump administration's approach to vaccines and public health, particularly Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s prominent influence and vaccine-skeptic views. Critics argue these drastic actions, including gutting a key government vaccine panel and challenging established scientific data, are fundamentally undermining the CDC's long-standing independence and eroding public trust. The high-profile departures are widely seen as a protest against the perceived "weaponizing of public health" and a blatant disregard for evidence-based science.</p>

          <p>Defending champion and world number one Jannik Sinner secured his spot in the US Open third round by defeating Alexei Popyrin in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. Sinner, 24, continued his dominant hard-court Grand Slam form, extending his winning streak to 23 matches across the US Open and Australian Open, and having won Wimbledon in July. Despite a lower first-serve percentage, the Italian's strong returning and crucial break point saves demonstrated his ruthlessness. He is now set to face Canada's Denis Shapovalov in the next round, aiming to further his impressive year.</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies' shares declined over 5% after the company provided a third-quarter earnings per share forecast that fell below Wall Street expectations, despite beating on both revenue and adjusted earnings for the second quarter. The company reported a 19% annual revenue increase, largely driven by a 69% surge in its Servers and Networking revenue, including AI servers, shipping $10 billion in the last two quarters. Dell now projects $20 billion in AI server shipments for fiscal 2026. However, a 3% decline in storage revenue and the cautious profit outlook for Q3 tempered investor enthusiasm, despite raising its full-year revenue and EPS guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

His dismissal comes as the STB considers a major $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroad companies, a decision Primus has previously approached with independence.

          <p>Seniors are increasingly seeking ways to cover healthcare costs not fully met by Medicare, as persistent inflation and concerns over Social Security's future strain their finances. Even minor coverage gaps can lead to significant debt, prompting older adults to explore options like Medicare supplemental insurance (Medigap), reverse mortgages, and annuities. Medigap plans help cover out-of-pocket expenses, while reverse mortgages allow homeowners aged 62+ to access home equity without monthly repayments. Annuities offer a guaranteed future income stream.

          <p>A 36-year-old woman sustained serious injuries after being attacked by a brown bear near her home in Kenai, southern Alaska, while jogging. The bear reportedly attacked her near her driveway and dragged her approximately 100 yards before a neighbor discovered her. Emergency services transported the woman to an Anchorage hospital. Authorities searched for the bear using ground patrols and a drone but were unsuccessful. Residents in the "bear country" region are advised to remain vigilant and secure attractants, as bear attacks, though relatively rare, can be severe.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's recent financial filing revealed that two undisclosed "direct customers" accounted for 39% of its second-quarter revenue, raising concerns about client concentration. "Customer A" made up 23% and "Customer B" 16%, a significant increase from the previous year. While Nvidia's finance chief noted large cloud service providers comprise about 50% of data center revenue, the identities of these top direct customers remain a mystery. Analysts are scrutinizing these figures to project future growth, especially given the chipmaker's reliance on a few major buyers. This concentration highlights both the immense demand for Nvidia's AI chips and potential risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Americans are increasingly staying in their current jobs as the U.S. labor market experiences a significant cooling trend, according to a Bank of America Institute analysis. The job change rate has declined from its 2022 peak, now only slightly above pre-pandemic levels, indicating workers are less inclined to switch employers amid business uncertainty and slower hiring. Consequently, the median pay raise for job changers has also fallen, from 20% in 2022 to 7% in July, with wage growth for job hoppers now equaling that of job stayers. This shift in power dynamics back towards employers suggests a more stagnant labor market.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, challenging his authority to remove her from office and arguing that mortgage fraud allegations against her are "pretextual." The suit primarily focuses on the Federal Reserve Act's requirement for "cause" for removal, asserting that any alleged "clerical error" on her mortgage applications does not meet this legal standard. Cook's legal team suggests the allegations are a subterfuge for Trump's desire to manipulate the Fed Board for interest rate cuts. This legal battle highlights a significant conflict between the executive branch and the independent central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed outrage, while UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer accused Vladimir Putin of "sabotaging hopes of peace."

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to scrap the "de minimis" rule, which allowed duty-free imports of goods under $800, is projected to significantly raise prices for consumers buying inexpensive items online. This change, effective Friday for all countries after already applying to China, will subject all international shipments to tariffs, duties, and fees. Economists and trade experts anticipate "quite a big price increase" for consumers, disproportionately affecting lower-income households, and potential near-term shortages as the trade system adjusts. While the administration argues it will combat illicit trafficking and boost tax revenue, critics warn of increased administrative burdens. (not investment advice)</p>
