          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, on Capitol Hill to advocate for the passage of his "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which had recently passed a House committee. Trump urged lawmakers not to let SALT deductions impede the bill's progress, emphasizing the importance of unity within the party. The meeting was described as positive, with Trump expressing satisfaction with the discussions. Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee, while Trump made an announcement with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth at the White House.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch its Tianwen-2 mission at the end of May 2025, marking the country's first attempt to survey and retrieve samples from an asteroid. The mission will target Kamoâ€™oalewa, a Near-Earth Asteroid, and potentially the comet 311P/PANSTARRS, using techniques previously employed by NASA and JAXA. The entire mission could last a decade, and if successful, it would place China among the leading nations in interplanetary exploration. Tianwen-2 will employ both a "touch-and-go" technique and an "anchor and attach" method to collect samples from the asteroid's surface, which will then be returned to Earth for analysis.</p>

          <p>British retailer Marks & Spencer (M&S) announced that a recent cyberattack would significantly impact its annual profits. The company estimates a Â£300 million reduction in operating profit for the fiscal year, approximately 30.5% of its annual operating profit. The cyberattack, which occurred over the Easter holiday, disrupted online sales and left food shelves empty, leading to a decline in the company's stock market value by over Â£1 billion. M&S anticipates that disruptions to online retail could persist into July, and views the incident as an opportunity to accelerate its technology transformation program.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official data indicates that UK inflation has risen to 3.5% in April, the highest rate in over a year, up from 2.6% in March. The increase is primarily attributed to rising household bills, including water, gas, and electricity prices, along with transport and recreation costs. The Bank of England had previously forecasted a spike to 3.7% before a decline to the 2% target, and the new data casts doubt on predictions of additional interest rate cuts this year. Core inflation and services inflation also rose more than expected, raising concerns among analysts and policymakers about the persistence of inflationary pressures.</p>

School officials were alerted to the situation in May 2025 and contacted the police, leading to his arrest during a traffic stop. The investigation revealed that Labrador Sierra had been a visa overstay since 2019 and had participated in school sports teams.</p>

A judge has ordered the U.S. to maintain custody of migrants following claims they were being sent to South Sudan, and Governor Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus. Trump unveiled plans for a 'Golden Dome' missile defense system, and Elon Musk announced plans to reduce spending as he steps back from politics. The USDA reversed decades of policy by approving a soda ban for food stamps, and Google introduced a new AI chatbot.

          <p>An investigation reveals that UnitedHealth Group secretly incentivized nursing homes to reduce hospital transfers for residents, part of a cost-cutting strategy that saved the company millions but at times jeopardized patient well-being. UnitedHealth stationed its medical teams in nursing homes, pushing them to cut expenses for residents covered by the insurer. In some cases, residents needing immediate hospital care were denied it, leading to permanent brain damage in at least one instance. Whistleblowers have filed congressional complaints, alleging that incidents are hidden and downplayed, with the company prioritizing cost reduction over patient care.</p>

          <p>Following the bombing of an IVF clinic in Palm Springs, experts are examining how online ecosystems are fostering violent extremism. The suspect, who died in the explosion, left behind writings indicating adherence to antinatalism and nihilism. Experts suggest that online spaces allow individuals to find niche ideologies that can amplify psychological distress and antisocial behaviors, turning them into anger and violence. The accessibility of online communities provides validation and skill acquisition, potentially exacerbating violent tendencies in unstable individuals, making it difficult for law enforcement to identify and stop potential attackers.</p>

          <p>Robert Reich argues that the recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Moody's is a direct consequence of rising debt levels exacerbated by the Trump tax cuts. Reich contends that the solution is not to cut social programs but to reverse the tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy and big corporations. He highlights the historical precedent of higher tax rates on the wealthy, citing Dwight Eisenhower's era, and criticizes the current system where the super-rich finance the government by lending it money. Reich warns that the proposed Republican tax package will lead to increased interest payments, higher borrowing costs for average Americans, and further cuts to essential safety nets.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is altering the focus of a Justice Department grant program that allocates millions to local police departments, according to public documents. The new guidelines prioritize "immigration and border security," "violent crime prevention," and "uplifting the image of the law enforcement profession," while eliminating language that encouraged initiatives for "underserved populations" and community violence intervention. This shift marks a significant departure from the Biden administration's emphasis on community trust and addressing racism and poverty. Some worry the changes will deprive law enforcement of community cooperation, while others say it's a common shift when administrations change.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the historical precedent of presidents concealing health issues, prompted by President Biden's announcement of advanced prostate cancer and concerns about his physical and mental capacity. It cites examples like Grover Cleveland's secret surgery, Woodrow Wilson's debilitating stroke, and Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy's chronic ailments. The article emphasizes that while Biden's actions are wrong, they are not unusual, highlighting the White House's capacity to conceal a president's condition. The author notes that the media and public are often reliant on the White House for information, and public perception is highly politicized.</p>

          <p>A shareholder lawsuit alleges that Edison International officers and directors misled investors about wildfire risk reduction efforts before the deadly Eaton fire. The lawsuit claims the utility overstated its progress in reducing wildfire risks by more than 85% since 2018. The suit also questions Edison's early statements about the Eaton fire, suggesting they were misleading. The lawsuit, filed as a derivative action, seeks financial damages from executives and board members, directing Edison to reform its corporate governance to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>Southern California home prices experienced minimal growth in April, with the average home price across the six-county region rising only 0.4% from March to $884,981. This represents a sharp slowdown compared to the previous year, when prices increased by 9%. High mortgage rates, rising inventory levels, and economic uncertainty are contributing factors. Zillow forecasts a slight decline in home prices by April 2026, attributed to an increasing number of homes for sale as existing homeowners move rather than hold onto low pandemic mortgage rates, while first-time buyers face challenges due to limited equity.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the collapse of the Skid Row Housing Trust, one of Los Angeles' largest homeless housing providers, serves as a warning about the viability of supportive housing. The report concludes that inconsistent rental subsidies and systemic issues contributed to the trust's demise in 2023. Without significant changes, other supportive housing providers remain at risk, potentially endangering housing for thousands of vulnerable residents. The report suggests reevaluating the use of single-room occupancy hotels for those with severe health problems and calls for an overhaul of the region's funding system for supportive housing.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the future of American soft power, which is the ability to influence others through attraction rather than coercion or payment. The author argues that while hard power is often prioritized, soft power is crucial for long-term influence. The Trump administration's rejection of soft power, through actions like withdrawing from international agreements, has weakened trust in the U.S. and created opportunities for China to fill the gap. The author suggests that while American democracy and civil society are resilient, restoring lost trust will be costly and require a shift away from policies that undermine American values.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles has been struggling to reduce homelessness, but a committed group of leaders has been collaborating to develop a road map with ambitious and achievable goals. The L.A. County Board of Supervisors endorsed three monitorable top-line goals, including specific targets for 2030. These goals include a 20% reduction in the number of people becoming newly homeless each year, placing 30,000 people into permanent housing, and reducing the number of people living on the streets by nearly a third. These goals provide a platform for institutions to be held accountable by the public and may lead to sustained gains in addressing the homelessness crisis.</p>

An electronic evacuation order was not issued for west Altadena until hours after the fire broke out and threatened the area. The chief executive of Genasys, the emergency alert software provider, stated the delays were not due to technological errors, but officials have declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation.</p>
