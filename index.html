          <p>Charles Rangel, the former U.S. congressman from Harlem and the last surviving member of the "Gang of Four," has died at the age of 94. Rangel, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives for 46 years, was a Korean War veteran and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. He was known as the first Black chair of the House's influential Ways and Means Committee and was influential in the creation of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation that helped change the economic face of Harlem.

          <p>President Trump has delayed the imposition of 50 percent tariffs on the European Union until July 9, prompting renewed discussions between U.S. and E.U. officials aimed at reaching a trade agreement. While both sides express optimism, significant obstacles remain, including differing priorities and demands. European negotiators are hesitant to agree to many of Mr. Trump’s frequent demands including changing their consumption tax system and rolling back key digital regulations. The E.U. is hoping to reduce tariffs implemented in April, but the Trump administration has indicated that the current 10 percent tariff is likely the new minimum.</p>

          <p>President Trump has voiced criticism of President Putin's attacks in Ukraine, describing them as "absolutely CRAZY," following a weekend of intense bombardment of Ukrainian cities. Despite expressing shock at the targeting of civilian areas, Trump has not agreed to join European allies in imposing new financial sanctions on Russia or offering additional aid to Ukraine. This stance has created a strategic gap, as Trump decries the ongoing violence but remains unwilling to make Putin pay a significant price. Trump has signaled a desire for a summit with Putin and suggests it's up to Ukraine and Russia to negotiate an end to the war, while also stating Putin believes he is winning and won't be pressured.</p>

          <p>Over a century ago, electric vehicles were a common sight before losing ground to cheaper, gasoline-powered cars, a history that may be repeating itself. The Trump administration and Republicans are working to undermine electric vehicle growth through policy and tax incentives favoring oil and gasoline. Charging infrastructure limitations, gender stereotypes, and political opposition are key factors impacting the adoption of electric vehicles. Despite global sales growth, U.S. electric car sales are modest, with Republican leaders pushing to eliminate tax credits and impose fees on electric vehicle owners. </p>

          <p>Analysts are urging investors to prepare for continued market volatility despite President Trump's decision to delay imposing 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9. The delay follows a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, with both parties expressing a commitment to advancing trade talks. While this announcement has provided some relief, market watchers caution that significant uncertainty remains. Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmieding suggests the six-week window may be insufficient to resolve all detailed questions, and Guntram Wolff from Bruegel notes that the EU is unsure of what exactly the U.S. President wants. </p>

Pugh, a United Nations Patron of the Oceans, emphasized the need for drastic measures to protect sharks, noting that around 100 million are killed each year, disrupting the ocean's ecosystem.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that Germany, along with France, the UK, and the US, has lifted restrictions on the range of weapons supplied to Ukraine. This decision allows Ukraine to target military positions in Russia, which had been previously limited. The Kremlin has responded to the announcement, calling the move "dangerous." Germany has previously refrained from sending long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine, but Merz did not specify if this decision would change. </p>

Meanwhile, Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, stated that Ukraine's allies had removed all range limits on supplied arms. The remarks come after a record number of Russian drones killed at least 13 people across Ukraine, despite ongoing negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has proposed redirecting $3 billion in research grant money from Harvard University to fund vocational schools, citing concerns about antisemitism and liberal ideology. Trump accused Harvard of being slow to provide information on "foreign student lists," seeking to identify potential "radicalized lunatics." This plan involves redistributing funds that the administration has already frozen or withdrawn from Harvard.

The author argues that this event is part of a broader trend of violence aimed at Jews and those seen as aligned with them. The author asserts that the denial of Jewish legitimacy is no longer a fringe opinion but is treated as respectable in too many quarters. It is a call to action, urging the enforcement of laws, defense of civic order, and refusal to normalize an ideology that leads to violence.</p>
