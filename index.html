        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily paused a lower-court ruling that had struck down most of President Trump's tariffs, granting the administration's request. The Trump administration had threatened to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court if the pause was not quickly enacted. The appeals court's order provides the administration with time to argue that the law empowers the president to unilaterally launch a global tariff regime. The White House criticized the trade-court judges, accusing them of bias and undermining the credibility of the United States on the world stage.</p>

Starbase was officially formed earlier this month and is run by officials who are SpaceX employees and former employees.

          <p>This CBS News article reports that the resumption of student loan payments is negatively impacting many borrowers' credit scores. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates that millions of borrowers experienced significant credit score drops after student loan repayments resumed. The end of the "on ramp" period, during which loan servicers did not report missed payments, has led to a reversal of positive credit score trends seen during the pandemic. Experts warn that these drops in credit scores could have long-lasting consequences, such as reduced access to credit and higher interest rates on future loans.</p>
