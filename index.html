          <p>In a recent interview, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed significant skepticism about the accuracy of recent U.S. jobs numbers, citing large discrepancies between the payroll and household surveys. He suggested that outdated data collection methods are causing massive revisions and unreliable figures, while other indicators like GDP growth and industrial production remain strong. Hassett also commented on a recent Russian attack on Ukraine, indicating that further sanctions will be discussed, and he firmly endorsed the principle of the Federal Reserve's complete independence from political influence.

According to the NYPD, the man entered through an employee entrance and slashed a female officer in the face before fleeing the scene. After a taser proved ineffective during the subsequent chase, the man reportedly lunged at another officer with the knife and was fatally shot by several officers.

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who passed away from leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, has been officially declared a saint by the Catholic Church, making him the first millennial to be canonized. Known affectionately as "God's influencer," Acutis used his computer programming skills to spread his faith online by creating a website to document Eucharistic miracles. His canonization, which required the Vatican to verify two miracles attributed to his intercession, has drawn significant attention from young Catholics around the world.</p>

          <p>Dr. Vonda Wright, a 58-year-old surgeon and prominent longevity researcher, advocates for a diet centered on clean, whole foods to promote healthy aging and vitality. She personally consumes around 130 grams of protein daily, prioritizing green leafy vegetables, dairy, eggs, and lean meat, and frequently starts her day with a salad for breakfast. Wright strictly avoids sugar and most simple carbohydrates, stating that she can physically feel their inflammatory effects and a resulting mental "dullness," thereby focusing on anti-inflammatory nutrition for long-term health.</p>

The driver, who was taken into custody while still wearing his racing suit and helmet, now faces a fine and potential license suspension for operating a non-street-legal vehicle.</p>

          <p>A new study by River reveals that businesses have been purchasing an average of 1,755 Bitcoin per day over the past 20 months, significantly increasing corporate holdings to over 6% of the total circulating supply. This trend of institutional adoption, which has added an estimated $1.3 trillion to Bitcoin's market capitalization, is seen by market analysts as a key driver for future price increases. The research indicates that many companies are treating Bitcoin as a permanent investment and a long-term treasury reserve asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that while the end of the "de minimis" trade exemption will raise prices on small imported goods, the resulting panic may be misdirected. It posits that the majority of the 33 million U.S. small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected by the policy change. The article suggests that as long as consumer income and wealth remain strong, the broader economy can likely absorb the impact, and advises businesses to diversify suppliers and adapt pricing strategies rather than panic.
