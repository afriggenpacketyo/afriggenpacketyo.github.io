          <p>An early angel investor in the AI voice startup ElevenLabs, now valued at over $6 billion, revealed his decision to invest was made within 30 minutes of meeting co-founder Mati Staniszewski. The investor, Carles Reina, focused on Staniszewski's deep technical knowledge and vision for solving the problem of robotic-sounding AI voices, a market overlooked by other VCs at the time. This investment strategy highlights a focus on founder quality and identifying undervalued industries before they become mainstream, which proved highly successful as ElevenLabs plans a global expansion and potential IPO.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has begun a five-day tour of Asia, with planned stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea for high-stakes diplomatic and trade meetings. A key focus will be his expected summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, aimed at de-escalating their ongoing trade war. While en route, Trump told reporters he would be open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for the first time since 2019, adding a significant potential development to his diplomatic agenda. U.S. officials have stated no such meeting is currently planned, but the statement introduces new possibilities for regional diplomacy.</p>

Tarling secured the top position in the men's points race, becoming the first British man to win the title since 2016. Shortly after, Charlton dominated the individual pursuit, earning Great Britain's first world title in that event since Bradley Wiggins in 2008. These wins, along with a bronze for Joe Truman, brought Britain's total medal count to seven after three days of competition, highlighting a strong performance from the national team.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Los Angeles Dodgers' 11-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 of the World Series, questions have arisen about whether a week-long layoff negatively impacted their performance. The extended break, a result of sweeping their previous series, may have disrupted the team's rhythm, a pattern seen in past World Series where rested teams have struggled. Pitchers Blake Snell and Emmet Sheehan, who had not competed in over a week, had particularly difficult outings. While the team officially dismisses the layoff as an excuse, historical precedent suggests that being "too fresh" can be a disadvantage in high-stakes games.</p>

          <p>A large-scale manhunt is underway for Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian asylum seeker who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu had been sentenced to 12 months in prison for sexually assaulting a schoolgirl and was scheduled for deportation upon completion of his sentence. Instead of being transferred to an immigration detention center, he was erroneously set free and is now believed to be in London. The incident has drawn sharp criticism from political leaders, with Justice Secretary David Lammy expressing his outrage and the Prison Service launching an urgent investigation into the procedural failure.</p>

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei is facing significant political headwinds as the country approaches key parliamentary elections. While his radical austerity measures have successfully curbed hyperinflation and achieved a budget surplus, they have come at a high social cost, including a sharp decline in purchasing power and the closure of thousands of small businesses. Defections from his party and recent corruption scandals have further eroded his support, with polls showing a tight race between his party and the resurgent Peronists. The election is seen as a crucial test of public approval for his shock therapy economic policies. (not investment advice)</p>

Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced the ad would be paused on Monday to allow talks to resume but confirmed it would air during the weekend's baseball games, which feature the Toronto Blue Jays.

Recent data shows births have fallen to near-record lows, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and an exodus of young men. In response, the government is promoting "traditional family values" through restrictive laws, including bans on promoting abortion and "child-free ideology," and outlawing LGBTQ+ activism. Critics argue these measures fail to address the core issues of economic uncertainty and will not solve the demographic decline, potentially driving practices like abortion underground instead.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Pew Research Center reveals that the Latino population in the United States has grown to 68 million, nearly doubling since the year 2000. This demographic now constitutes one in five Americans and accounted for over half of the nation's total population growth in that period. Key findings show that U.S. births have been the primary driver of this increase, the median age of Latinos is 31, making them the youngest major ethnic group, and 79% are U.S. citizens. California and Texas are home to the largest Latino populations, with people of Mexican origin forming the largest subgroup.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement officers opened fire on a U-Haul truck that was reversing toward them outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, California. The incident occurred during a day-long protest against a planned, but later canceled, immigration enforcement surge in the Bay Area. The driver of the truck was wounded and taken into custody for a mental health evaluation. The protest had been tense throughout the day, with demonstrators blocking the base entrance, leading to the use of flash bangs and smoke grenades by Coast Guard personnel earlier. The FBI is now leading the investigation into the shooting.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and its strike group to deploy to the waters off South America, a significant escalation of U.S. military presence in the region. This move is intended to bolster capabilities for what the Trump administration describes as counter-narcotics operations, which have recently included a series of rapid air strikes on suspected drug-running boats. The deployment has heightened speculation about the administration's broader intentions, including potential actions against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism by the U.S. and has accused Washington of fabricating a pretext for war.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Proposes Auctioning New Offshore Oil Leases in Previously Protected U.S. Waters</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 21:20:43 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing to auction new offshore oil and gas drilling leases in areas off the coasts of California, New England, and the Carolinas that have been off-limits for decades. According to internal documents, lease sales could begin as early as 2026, reversing previous policies that protected these waters. The proposal comes shortly after the administration announced plans to reopen drilling leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This move is facing strong bipartisan opposition from coastal states, whose leaders have voiced concerns about the economic and environmental risks associated with offshore drilling.</p>
