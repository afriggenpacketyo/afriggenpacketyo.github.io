          <p>Microsoft is laying off 3% of its global workforce, affecting approximately 6,000 employees across all levels, teams, and geographies, the company announced on Tuesday. The move is part of an organizational restructuring aimed at positioning the company for success in a dynamic marketplace. Despite reporting better-than-expected financial results in April, Microsoft aims to enhance efficiency by reducing management layers and streamlining processes. This is the largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023 and the company's home state of Washington said the company was reducing headcount in the state by 1,985 people, including 1,510 in office.</p>

          <p>Key House committees are meeting to discuss President Trump's budget package, facing significant Republican divisions over Medicaid and tax deductions. The Energy and Commerce Committee proposes changes to Medicaid, including work requirements and eligibility checks, while the Ways and Means Committee aims to extend Trump's tax cuts and increase the Child Tax Credit. The Agriculture Committee seeks to increase the age requirement for SNAP benefits. The package faces challenges as some Republicans demand steeper cuts to Medicaid and others disagree on the state and local tax deduction cap, with House leaders aiming to send the package to the Senate by Memorial Day.</p>

          <p>During a speech at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh, President Trump lauded Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) for his leadership and the kingdom's economic development. Trump credited MBS for transforming Riyadh into a major business and high-tech capital, announcing the end of sanctions against Syria, seemingly at Saudi Arabia's request. This marks a shift from previous U.S. stances, particularly considering the criticism former President Biden faced for his interactions with MBS. Trump also emphasized his own economic agenda and immigration policies during the address, noting the strong economic growth in both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the removal of all U.S. sanctions on Syria during an address at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh. Trump stated the decision aims to give Syria a chance at greatness under its new government, hoping for stability and peace in the region. He noted that his administration has already taken steps to restore normal relations between the United States and Syria for the first time in over a decade. This decision follows Syria's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011.</p>

The judge stated the scheme was sophisticated, illegal, and caused harm to investors, including Duke and Vanderbilt universities. In addition to jail time, Coker Sr. was ordered to serve six months of home confinement, pay a $500,000 fine, and up to $644,000 in restitution.</p>

          <p>A lawyer representing a group of small businesses argued in federal court that President Trump's tariffs are an 'unprecedented and unlawful expansion' of executive power. The lawyer contended that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant Trump the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs. The lawsuit was filed by small businesses that rely on imports and claim they will be irreparably harmed by the tariffs. Department of Justice lawyers defended the tariffs, arguing that Congress permits the president to impose tariffs and that Trump's declaration of a national emergency broadens his power.</p>

          <p>Robyn Denholm, the chair of Tesla's board, has sold $198 million in Tesla stock over the past six months, bringing her total profit to over $530 million since becoming chair in 2018, according to a New York Times analysis. These sales raise questions about her confidence in Tesla's prospects, especially as CEO Elon Musk takes on a time-consuming role in the Trump administration and Tesla's car sales decline. Despite Musk's advice to employees to hold onto their stock, Denholm's sales have far outstripped those of other Tesla directors, with the exception of Musk himself.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April rose 2.3% on an annual basis, slightly less than economists expected but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. This reading reflects the lowest level since February 2021. Housing costs were a major driver of inflation, while grocery prices dropped slightly. Economists are monitoring the impact of Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, but the effects may not be evident in economic data for several months due to temporary trade agreements and front-loading of purchases.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary reduction in tariffs between the United States and China, uncertainty persists in the financial markets regarding the long-term economic outlook. While the tariff pause has boosted stock prices and eased volatility in the bond market, investors remain cautious due to the unpredictable nature of trade policy under President Trump. The Federal Reserve is also taking a wait-and-see approach, unwilling to lower interest rates until the inflationary effects of the tariffs are better understood. This prolonged uncertainty could dampen business investment and consumer spending, slowing economic growth.</p>
