          <p>Mohamed Salah's selfie celebration after scoring a goal for Liverpool against Tottenham has become an iconic moment, but has also sparked debate over its authenticity. After scoring, Salah borrowed a phone from a staff member and took a photo with cheering fans. While Salah claims it was a spontaneous gesture, some question whether it was a marketing ploy for Google Pixel, a Liverpool sponsor, given Salah's history of posting selfies and Google's involvement in Liverpool's social media presence. Despite the debate, the photo has garnered millions of likes and views across social media platforms.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order mandating English literacy tests for truck drivers, citing mounting communication problems between truckers and officials as a public safety risk. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that this policy would ensure truckers can communicate effectively. The order follows reports of an influx of foreign-born truckers and concerns that previous administrations relaxed English requirements. This is the second executive order focused on the English language signed by Trump since returning to office, reflecting his emphasis on a unified society with a shared language.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers, led by Sen. Adam Schiff and Rep. Mike Levin, are pressing the White House to disclose financial transactions leading up to President Trump's recent pause on tariffs, suspecting potential insider trading. They are requesting that senior White House and executive branch employees submit securities transaction reports to the Office of Government Ethics and make them public. The request follows a surge in the stock market after Trump announced the tariff rollback, raising concerns that individuals close to the President may have profited from non-public information.

          <p>U.S. agriculture exporters are reporting a 'full-blown crisis' due to the global backlash against President Trump's tariffs, particularly the decline in Chinese buying of U.S. farm products.

China's recent cancellation of pork orders is the largest since 2020. The Port of Oakland warns that decreased cargo volume due to tariffs could jeopardize job stability and regional economic health, as China is a major trading partner for the port.</p>

          <p>Judge Hannah Dugan, a county circuit court judge in Milwaukee, was arrested by the FBI for allegedly helping an undocumented man avoid ICE agents outside her courtroom. The arrest is seen by some as an escalation of the Trump administration's assault on the courts and an attempt to silence dissent against its immigration policies. The FBI claims Dugan directed the man towards a side door to evade ICE, but critics argue the charges are disproportionate to the alleged misconduct. Dugan's arrest has sparked debate about the role of local officials in enforcing federal immigration law.</p>

          <p>Temu has added significant 'import charges' after President Trump imposed a 145% tariff on many imports from China, more than doubling the price of many items. These charges, which began appearing after recent price hikes, can exceed the cost of the products themselves, eroding the value proposition that made Temu popular. Rival Shein has also raised prices but is absorbing the tariff costs, while Temu has sharply reduced its online ad spending. The move threatens Temu's competitive edge and could align its prices with U.S. competitors, impacting its appeal to budget-conscious consumers.</p>

          <p>Apollo Global Management predicts that the trade war initiated by President Trump's tariffs will lead to empty shelves, trucking layoffs, and a recession this summer. Economist Torsten Slok outlined a timeline indicating that U.S. consumers could see shortages in stores as early as next month due to slowing containership departures from China. The tariffs, now at 145% on Chinese goods, are expected to disrupt supply chains and trigger layoffs in the trucking and retail sectors. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledges the tariff standoff is 'unsustainable'.</p>
