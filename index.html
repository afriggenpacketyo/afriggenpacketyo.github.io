          <p>Large-scale protests erupted across Los Angeles in response to recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, prompting a strong reaction from President Trump, who threatened federal intervention if local authorities couldn't manage the situation. California Governor Newsom criticized the federal government's actions as inflammatory and deployed additional California Highway Patrol units to maintain order. The protests, which included blocking streets and setting fires, led to clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement in Paramount, with reports of non-lethal munitions being used. ICE conducted raids in multiple locations, resulting in numerous arrests for immigration violations and obstruction, sparking criticism from local leaders and prompting responses from federal officials who vowed to continue enforcement efforts. The situation remains tense as authorities work to manage the ongoing demonstrations and address concerns over immigration enforcement tactics. Optimism regarding the resolution of tensions is low given the conflicting viewpoints. </p>

          <p>AI scientist De Kai proposes a new approach to artificial intelligence, suggesting it should be treated as a child that needs 'parenting' to avoid potential dangers. De Kai argues that AI learns by absorbing online content, making it crucial to be mindful of the influences it is exposed to. His book, "Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future," emphasizes the need for humans to act as conscientious role models for AI systems. This perspective shifts the focus from a US-China technological race to a more ethical and nurturing development of AI. This framework encourages a more responsible and thoughtful approach to AI development, emphasizing ethical considerations. </p>

          <p>Israel has recovered the body of Nattapong Pinta, a Thai citizen who was kidnapped and taken into Gaza on October 7, 2023, during a special military operation.

The recovery comes as Israel continues its military campaign in Gaza, which has resulted in numerous Palestinian casualties.

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to launch a registration system to encourage people to maintain connections with rural areas affected by depopulation, with the goal of attracting over 10 million users in the next decade. This initiative, spearheaded by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, seeks to revitalize regional areas and reverse the trend of over-concentration in major cities like Tokyo. Registered nonresidents would receive information on local events and services, with the hope of broadening the program's appeal through tangible benefits. The government also aims to promote living and working in multiple areas to facilitate the movement of city dwellers to rural regions.

          <p>UK doctors are trialing "poo pills," containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors, to combat dangerous superbug infections. These pills aim to replace harmful gut bacteria with a healthy mix, addressing antibiotic resistance, which causes numerous deaths annually. The stool samples undergo rigorous testing before being freeze-dried into a powder and encapsulated. Early data suggests this approach could help eliminate superbugs from the gut. The study indicates a shift in understanding the importance of beneficial bacteria for overall health. </p>
