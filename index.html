          <h2>Los Angeles Confronts Immigration Tensions with Protests and Troop Deployments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 21:19:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing heightened tensions as immigration sweeps led to violent protests, prompting President Trump to deploy National Guard troops and Marines. California Governor Newsom criticized the troop deployment as a dictatorial move and initiated a lawsuit against the administration, citing concerns over states' rights. The unrest included looting and clashes between protesters and authorities, with some community members alleging that families have been torn apart by the raids. While the administration aims to increase deportations, critics express concern over the tactics used and the impact on non-violent immigrants. Optimism is tempered by the potential for further escalation and the ongoing legal challenges.</p>

          <p>As protests continue in Los Angeles, officials have clarified the rules of force for the deployed National Guard and Marines, stating their primary task is to protect federal buildings and personnel. Troops are carrying weapons, but the weapons are not loaded with ammunition, and they will not engage crowds unless necessary or patrol city streets, and they will not use rubber bullets or pepper spray. Police Chief Jim McDonnell expressed concerns about logistical challenges and emphasized the need for clear communication between agencies. The rules could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, but the current focus is on de-escalation and coordination.</p>

          <p>President Trump has authorized the deployment of an additional 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, escalating tensions with California Governor Newsom, who is suing the administration over the initial deployment. Newsom criticized the move as unnecessary and disrespectful to the troops, while the ACLU condemned the mobilization of Marines. Trump also suggested he would support arresting Newsom for obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions. The lawsuit challenges the federalization of California's National Guard, arguing it violates the U.S. Constitution and exceeds presidential authority.</p>

          <p>The girlfriend of Derrick Groves, one of the inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail last month, has been arrested for allegedly assisting in his escape. Darriana Burton, a former correctional employee, is accused of relaying escape-related information and coordinating communications between Groves and people outside the jail. Authorities believe Burton had an active involvement in the planning phase of the escape, including a FaceTime call two days before the escape where she appeared to be holding a secondary device displaying an unknown man. Groves remains on the run, and the reward for his arrest has increased to $50,000 as authorities continue to pursue anyone who aided the escape.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has released a report criticizing the UK's statutory parental leave system, calling it one of the worst in the developed world and highlighting its fundamental flaws and outdated gender stereotypes. The report recommends increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and extending paternity leave to six weeks, emphasizing the need for significant investment to improve support for working families. Many families find shared parental leave unnecessarily complex and burdensome, with low usage rates and lack of awareness among fathers. The report is released on the eve of the world's first dad strike, with fathers picketing for an overhaul of parental leave policies.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England suggests that teachers can use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate routine tasks like marking and writing letters to parents. The Department for Education (DfE) emphasizes that AI should be used for low-stakes marking, such as quizzes and homework, and that teachers must always check the results. AI can also be used to generate routine letters to parents, such as those regarding head lice outbreaks. While AI offers opportunities to save time and focus on face-to-face teaching, risks such as data breaches and marking errors must be carefully managed.</p>
