          <p>A California family is suing Harrison-Ross Mortuary after discovering the wrong man in their uncle's casket, dressed in his clothes. Amentha Hunt noticed the error while preparing her uncle, Otis Adkinson, for burial, but was initially dismissed by a mortuary worker. The family waited three hours for the mix-up to be resolved, and the funeral home denies the allegations. Hunt says she remains traumatized by the incident, while her attorney emphasizes the need for improved standards of care at the mortuary. </p>

Nature Conservation Cymru hopes that by feeding the voles glitter-covered apples, they can track the animals' movements through their feces. The glitter is biodegradable and vet-approved, ensuring it is harmless to the voles. This innovative approach will help conservationists understand the voles' territory and habitat use, informing measures to protect and support their dispersal. </p>

Researchers believe the dinosaurs were part of a migrating herd that perished in a catastrophic flash flood.

          <p>An opinion piece in The New York Times argues that President Trump's policies are undermining American power and innovation, allowing China to surpass the United States. The author claims that tariffs are endangering U.S. companies' access to global markets, while China is making long-term investments in cutting-edge technologies. China is already leading global production in multiple industries and is projected to account for nearly half of global manufacturing by 2030. The author warns that Trump's short-sighted focus on tariffs will only hasten the onset of a Chinese-dominated world. </p>

The United States’ loss of its last triple-A credit rating and mounting concerns about government debt are threatening to disrupt the relative calm in financial markets that has prevailed since President Trump began pausing tariffs early last month. The move by Moody’s means that all three major rating agencies no longer consider the United States qualified for their top credit ratings.

The vote signaled a temporary resolution to a remarkable revolt from a group of hard-liners on the panel, who on Friday joined Democrats in opposing the bill in committee, tanking it over concerns that it did not do enough to rein in the nation’s ballooning debt. The vote was 17 to 16, with all four Republicans who initially voted to defeat the legislation — Representatives Chip Roy of Texas, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Andrew Clyde of Georgia — voting “present.” </p>

          <p>The UK and EU are engaged in last-minute negotiations to secure a landmark reset of relations post-Brexit, with a summit planned in London. Discussions involve defense, trade, fishing rights, and a potential youth mobility scheme. Despite progress, some Conservative and Reform UK leaders criticize the deal as a "surrender" before details are known. The government aims to cut red tape on food exports/imports, while fishing rights and access to a €150bn EU defense fund are also under consideration. </p>

          <p>The global market for diabetes drugs used for treating obesity is expected to expand in Asia, with new players competing with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. China provides a significant opportunity for growth, with several drug candidates likely to be approved for commercial sales in the next five years. Increased competition will lead to more choices for patients and physicians, as well as lower prices. Morgan Stanley raised its forecast for obesity-control drugs worldwide to US$150 billion by 2035.  (not investment advice)</p>

Four conservative holdouts voted present instead of against the legislation, allowing it to advance.
