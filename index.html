          <h2>Trump to Visit Federal Reserve Amid Public Pressure on Chairman Powell</h2>

          <p>President Trump plans a visit to the Federal Reserve, a rare move for a sitting president that escalates his public campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates. The visit challenges the central bank's traditional independence from political influence, a cornerstone of U.S. economic policy. This action follows Trump's repeated criticisms of Powell, where he has openly questioned his performance and even floated the legally dubious and unprecedented idea of firing him.

          <p>This article summarizes key stories from UK newspapers, including controversy over asylum seekers' use of government funds and a "luxury" hotel being used for housing. It also covers warnings from cancer charities about "crushing" treatment delays due to impending strikes by resident doctors. Additionally, the press features a plea from Sir Bob Geldof to address severe food shortages in Gaza, urging Israel to allow more aid into the territory forty years after the original Live Aid concert.</p>

          <p>An armed clash occurred between Thai and Cambodian soldiers near the Prasat Ta Muen Thom temple in a contested border area, with both nations blaming the other for initiating hostilities. The incident follows a rapid deterioration in diplomatic relations, which included the expulsion of ambassadors from both countries. This escalation is part of a long-standing series of border disputes, further inflamed by recent land mine incidents that injured Thai soldiers and heightened nationalist sentiments on both sides.</p>

          <p>This article explores the growing trend of state governments, like Utah's, enacting laws to override local zoning restrictions and compel cities to build more affordable housing. It highlights the struggles of middle-class families being priced out of their hometowns, with the median age for first-time homebuyers reaching an all-time high of 38. While proponents argue state intervention is necessary to combat a massive housing shortage, many local officials and residents are pushing back against the loss of local control and raising concerns about inadequate infrastructure.</p>

          <p>China and Russia have launched their first joint oceanographic expedition in five years, signaling renewed scientific and strategic cooperation. The 45-day mission will survey the Bering Sea and northwestern Pacific to study the effects of climate change on deep-sea environments and the forces behind it. This collaboration, focused on a region of growing geopolitical importance, is seen as a new chapter in their bilateral marine research and aligns with their shared ambitions in the increasingly accessible Arctic.</p>

MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the game's business value but admitted the league needs to rethink its format to maintain player interest and grow its audience in an increasingly crowded soccer calendar.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Business Leaders Propose Ballot Measure to Repeal City's Gross Receipts Tax</h2>

          <p>A coalition of Los Angeles business leaders has filed a ballot initiative to completely repeal the city's gross receipts tax, which generates over $800 million annually for essential services. Proponents argue that eliminating the tax, which is levied on revenue rather than profit, is necessary to combat an "anti-job climate" and provide relief to struggling businesses. However, city officials warn that passing the measure would create a massive budget hole and could force drastic cuts to public safety, including police and fire services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy expanded by 0.6% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The growth, which beat economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly for semiconductors and chemical products. However, analysts remain cautious, noting that domestic demand is still sluggish and the global trade outlook is uncertain due to potential U.S. tariffs, which could pressure the economy moving forward.

          <p>President Trump has signed three executive orders aimed at accelerating U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence, including measures to expedite data center construction and promote AI exports. One controversial order targets what the White House calls "woke Marxist lunacy," requiring federal funding recipients to ensure their AI models are politically neutral and free from "ideological dogmas" like DEI. The move is part of a broader administration plan to remove regulatory hurdles, while critics argue it prioritizes corporate interests and ideology over public safety.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade deals with Indonesia and the Philippines, which will see a 19% U.S. tariff on imports from the two nations while American exports will face no duties. Analysts suggest this move is an indirect strategy to counter China's influence by reshaping regional supply chains and securing access to resources like rare earth minerals. However, some experts note that Chinese firms are already ahead, having increasingly localized their production within Southeast Asia over the past several years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study from Common Sense Media reveals a growing number of teenagers are using AI chatbots not just for schoolwork, but for companionship, emotional support, and personal advice. Over 70% of teens have used an "AI companion," with many finding the interactions as or more satisfying than talking to human friends. Researchers express concern that this trend could hinder the development of crucial real-world social skills and redefine human relationships, as teens rely on platforms that are unregulated and potentially harmful.</p>

          <p>In the first six months of President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations in a decade. Internal figures show nearly 150,000 removals, projecting an annual total over 300,000, but this still falls far short of the administration's stated goal of one million per year. The increased pace reflects a sweeping mandate to crack down on illegal immigration, though it highlights the operational and legal constraints that limit even the most aggressive enforcement efforts.</p>
