        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazilian authorities arrested two suspects, identified as fans of Lady Gaga, who were allegedly planning an attack on her free concert at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro. The suspects, part of an online group promoting hate speech and violence, were reportedly planning to use improvised explosives, though no explosives were found during the operation. The arrests were part of Operation Fake Monsters, a joint investigation aimed at preempting any threat ahead of the singer's performance, which drew over two million fans. Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of the operation until after the concert, which proceeded without incident, and that they had worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert, feeling confident about the safety measures in place.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a strong response after a missile fired by the Houthi group in Yemen struck near Ben Gurion Airport, Israel's main international airport. The missile strike resulted in injuries to several people and a temporary suspension of flights, prompting Netanyahu to convene an emergency security cabinet meeting. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, stating it was in response to Israeli military plans in Gaza and threatening a comprehensive aerial blockade of Israel. Israel's defense minister also responded by saying that any attacks would be met with a sevenfold response, and Netanyahu stated that the attacks were emanating from Iran, promising a response at a time and place of Israel's choosing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Israeli military has begun calling up tens of thousands of reservists in preparation for an expanded operation in Gaza, aiming to increase pressure on Hamas and secure the release of hostages. The move comes after international negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release failed, with Israel resuming its offensive in March. Critics question the effectiveness of the military action in securing the hostages' release and raise concerns about the humanitarian impact of the ongoing blockade, which has led to severe shortages of food, water, and medicine. The expanded offensive is expected to put additional strain on reservists and heighten anxieties among families of hostages, who urge the government to prioritize a deal with Hamas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain's National Crime Agency reports a significant drop in Facebook's reporting of child sexual abuse incidents, attributing the decline to the introduction of end-to-end encryption. Facebook reported 6.9 million fewer incidents in 2024 compared to 2023, a 40% decrease. Officials express concern that encryption hinders the ability to detect and report abuse, potentially endangering children. Other social media firms also show a decrease in reports, marking the first reverse in overall numbers after years of increases, leading to accusations that companies prioritize profit over children's safety.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The legislation allows most students attending accredited private schools to receive $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities can receive up to $30,000, and home-schooled students get $2,000 annually. Supporters argue the bill provides parents with the freedom to choose the best educational option for their children, while Democrats contend it will harm public schools by diverting funds to private institutions and primarily benefiting wealthier families already in private schools.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX is nearing the creation of an official city called Starbase at its South Texas rocket facility, following a vote approved by local residents, primarily SpaceX employees. The move aims to support the company's growth and operations, including increased launch activity, but has drawn criticism over potential expansion of Musk's control over the area, including beach closures. Companion bills in the state Legislature propose shifting authority over beach closures from the county to the new town's mayor and city council, sparking concerns about public access and environmental impact. SpaceX officials state the city authority is needed to manage infrastructure and streamline launch operations, while critics argue for maintaining county oversight to represent broader community interests.</p>

          <p>The 80th anniversary of the liberation of Dachau concentration camp was commemorated in Germany, marking a pivotal moment as the last survivors and liberators pass away, while far-right extremism gains traction. The anniversary occurs amid rising antisemitic hate crimes and concerns about the normalization of populism, with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party gaining popularity despite its leaders downplaying the Holocaust. The event also highlights a shift in U.S.-German relations, as the Trump administration has shown support for the AfD, contrasting with past U.S. efforts to promote accountability and remembrance. Memorial sites have noted an increase in thefts and petty crimes, underscoring the challenges in preserving the memory of the Holocaust.</p>

          <p>The expiration of a de minimis tariff exemption is expected to raise prices on cheaper goods from China for U.S. consumers, impacting ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu. The loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, allowed these retailers to undercut U.S.-based sellers. The end of the exemption means that many goods will no longer be as low-priced, and importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection face the challenge of inspecting millions of additional packages daily, potentially causing shipment delays. The change, initiated by President Trump, aims to address concerns about fentanyl flow and level the playing field for U.S. businesses.</p>

          <p>California's high-speed rail project, initially approved by voters in 2008 with promises of connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco, faces mounting criticism as costs triple and no track has been laid. The project, now reduced to a 171-mile stretch between Bakersfield and Merced by 2033, has been plagued by eminent domain issues, environmental concerns, and funding challenges. Eminent domain lawyer Mark Wasser argues that blaming eminent domain for the delays is inaccurate, as design and construction move ahead regardless. Farmers and landowners have been forced to give up valuable farmland, often resulting in fragmented parcels and disrupted operations, leading to questions about the project's feasibility and impact on the Central Valley.</p>

The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power. Since leaving office, Pence has been largely shunned by Trump and the Republican Party.</p>
