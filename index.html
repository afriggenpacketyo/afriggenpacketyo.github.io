          <p>An attack at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, injured eight people during a march in support of Israeli hostages. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly used a "makeshift flamethrower" and Molotov cocktails while yelling "free Palestine." The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted act of terrorism, and Soliman, an Egyptian national whose visa expired in 2023, is in custody. The victims, ranging from 52 to 88 years old, were taken to area hospitals, with one in critical condition. The incident is being condemned as a hate crime and an act of terror by government officials. The event took place during a peaceful walk organized by Run For Their Lives to raise awareness for hostages in Gaza. The victims include a Holocaust refugee and a professor at CU Boulder. The overall situation is one of heightened alert and concern for the safety of the Jewish community. The situation has caused fear among the Jewish community in Boulder. The optimism score is relatively low given the nature of the events.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Tulsa has unveiled a $105 million reparations package aimed at addressing the lasting impact of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. This plan represents the first large-scale effort to provide reparations for the atrocity, which decimated the Greenwood District, also known as "Black Wall Street." The funds will be raised privately and allocated to housing assistance, scholarships, and economic development initiatives for the descendants of the victims and the Greenwood community. The initiative seeks to acknowledge the historical injustices and promote healing and economic empowerment within the affected community. The proposed reparations package is a significant step toward reconciliation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing historian, has won the Polish presidential election with 50.9% of the vote, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski. The election result is a turnaround from initial exit polls that showed Trzaskowski winning. As president, Nawrocki is expected to use his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda. Nawrocki supports traditional Catholic and family values and advocates for Polish sovereignty within the EU. Both candidates support continued assistance for Ukraine, but differ on their approach to the EU, with Nawrocki opposing further cession of powers to Brussels. The election result is likely to re-energize the national conservative Law and Justice opposition party.</p>

          <p>Shares of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks surged after announcing a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. The merged entity, listed in Sydney, will acquire all outstanding shares of both companies, holding A$13.1 billion in assets across real estate, private equity, and credit. The deal simplifies the structure, adds scale, and creates a more investable company, according to Soul Patts CEO Todd Barlow. The merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers, though critics argued it suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. Brickworks shareholders will receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price.</p>

          <p>The United States' reliance on China for rare earth magnets is leading to shortages, posing a threat to various industries. Over the years, the US allowed its rare earth metals industry to move to China, creating a dependency that could result in severe economic disruption. As China limits the supply of these crucial materials, American companies are struggling to secure the necessary components for manufacturing. The situation highlights the need for the US to revitalize its domestic rare earth metals industry to reduce its vulnerability to supply chain disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

China criticized the U.S. for imposing export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals, and for announcing visa revocations for Chinese students. China also emphasized its firm grip on rare earths exports, contrary to Washington's expectations.

          <p>Six people were injured in Boulder, Colorado, after a man shouting "free Palestine" threw Molotov cocktails at a gathering supporting Israeli hostages. The attack occurred at the Pearl Street Mall and left victims, ranging in age from 67 to 88, with burns. The FBI is investigating the incident as a suspected terror attack, noting the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and other incendiary devices. The attack took place during a weekly demonstration by Run for Their Lives, a pro-Israeli group. Footage showed a chaotic scene with smoke, running people, and injuries. The suspect has been identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45.</p>

          <p>Mexico held its first judicial elections, becoming the first nation to select judges and magistrates by popular vote. Supporters claim this is necessary to overhaul a judicial system known for corruption, while critics argue it will politicize the judiciary. Voters elected around 880 federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, as well as hundreds of local judges and magistrates. Turnout appeared low, with many voters struggling to choose from largely unknown candidates. President Claudia Sheinbaum defended the decision, while opponents marched in Mexico City, protesting against electoral fraud.</p>

          <p>Mexico held its first-ever judiciary election, allowing voters to choose the members of the Supreme Court along with other judges and magistrates. The election is seen as a controversial move to overhaul the judicial system, with supporters claiming it will address corruption and inefficiency. However, critics argue that it will politicize the judiciary and undermine its independence. The outcome of the election could have significant implications for the rule of law and the balance of power in Mexico.</p>
