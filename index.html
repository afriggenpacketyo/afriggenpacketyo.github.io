          <p>Sources report that former President Donald Trump will attend a New York Yankees game in the Bronx on September 11, marking the 24th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This would be his first baseball game during his second presidency, though he has attended numerous sporting events over the years. Vice President JD Vance will reportedly attend a commemoration ceremony at Ground Zero in Lower Manhattan. Trump is also scheduled to attend a memorial event at the Pentagon earlier in the day, as well as the Ryder Cup in New York on September 26. The Yankees and Mets will play a game on Sept. 11 at Yankee Stadium to commemorate the 25th anniversary of 9/11. Optimism is tempered by the solemnity of the anniversary. </p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that the world faces a choice between peace and war during a military parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. U.S. President Donald Trump responded on Truth Social, urging Xi to acknowledge U.S. contributions to China's freedom during WWII and accusing Beijing of conspiring against the U.S. The parade showcased China's military capabilities, with leaders from over 20 countries in attendance, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Xi emphasized the role of the Chinese military in defending the country's sovereignty, especially concerning Taiwan. The event highlighted China's growing military power and shifting global influence, with many Western leaders absent. </p>

          <p>Fire crews responded to a brush fire in the Hollywood Hills that ignited near West Sunset Boulevard, threatening nearby homes. The fire burned approximately a quarter of an acre of vegetation as it moved uphill. Water drops from LAFD helicopters helped slow the fire's progress, and about 80 firefighting personnel were assigned to the scene. All active flames were extinguished within an hour, and forward progress was stopped, with no structures affected. Nearby residents were instructed to shelter in place during the firefighting efforts. </p>

          <p>Australia's economy expanded more than anticipated in the second quarter, with GDP growing 1.8% year-over-year, surpassing economists' expectations. The growth was driven by domestic spending, including household and government consumption. The Reserve Bank of Australia previously cut rates by 25 basis points and expressed optimism about the economy. While the central bank reduced its economic growth forecast for the year to 1.7%, consumer and business confidence is improving. Inflation in Australia is at 2.1%, near the lower end of the RBA's target range. (not investment advice)</p>

The legislation, authored by Senator Sasha Renée Pérez, awaits Governor Newsom's signature. The bill is a response to immigration agents arresting people near schools and in public areas. </p>

The Ministry of Defence estimates the cost of the data breach and the new scheme to relocate those at risk to be £850m. The National Audit Office says the MoD has not provided enough evidence to support that figure. The data breach involved the details of almost 19,000 people who applied to move to the UK. </p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered that waxworms can digest plastic and turn it into body fat. Around 2,000 waxworms can break down an entire polyethylene bag in as little as 24 hours. The way waxworms process plastic is similar to humans storing excess fat. Scientists are optimistic that these waxworms could be used for fish food. While waxworms can eat plastic, they cannot survive on it long-term without additional nutrients. </p>

          <p>An American filmmaker has launched a High Court battle against an English council to gain control of the ancestral stately home he spent seven years trying to save from ruin. Hopwood DePree has led an operation to safeguard historic Hopwood Hall in Middleton, Greater Manchester, since 2017, and says he complied with an agreement with Rochdale Borough Council that gave him the option to buy the building. However, the council say he did not fulfil the conditions of the deal, and locked him out in November 2024. DePree has now taken action in an attempt to be declared its legal owner. </p>

All the lava from this eruption has been contained within the summit crater inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Lava emerged from the north vent in Halemaʻumaʻu crater after midnight. The vent began shooting fountains of lava at 6.35am, the US Geological Survey said. </p>

          <p>A scheme helped prevent sex offenders committing more crimes - then it closed. The Safer Living Foundation works with people convicted and imprisoned for sexual offences after they have been released back into the community. Just 2% of the men who spent time at the foundation reoffended, according to its own figures. In May 2025, the government announced it was considering the roll-out of voluntary chemical castration for sex offenders and also looking at whether this could be made mandatory. The center was forced to close in May 2025 due to financial difficulties. </p>

Representative Gregory Meeks expressed support for the bill while saying that the US “cannot sanction our way out of the fentanyl crisis”. </p>

          <p>Apple shares rose in extended trading after a federal judge ruled that Alphabet may continue making payments to preload Google Search onto the iPhone. The judge said that Google will be barred from entering or maintaining "any exclusive contract" related to preloading its search engine or key apps on devices. The decision said that Apple's deal with Google to be the default search engine was "exclusive" because it established Google as the default out-of-the-box search engine. Analysts previously said that it may take years before Apple is forced to make changes in response to a Google suit ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Protests against tourists have increased in frequency and size as residents have seen tourism return to, or even exceed, pre-pandemic levels. Residents typically choose protests, instead of other forms of lobbying, because they generate public awareness, which leads to media coverage and societal pressure for governments to act. Residents' reactions tend to evolve as overtourism intensifies. The message from the crowd was clear: "Tourists go home." Travelers may be the visible factor to blame, but policy gaps are the root of the problem. </p>
