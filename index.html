          <p>Erin Patterson, accused of murdering three relatives and attempting to murder another with a beef Wellington laced with death cap mushrooms, is facing new allegations in court. Prosecutors presented evidence suggesting that Patterson used kitchen scales to weigh the toxic mushrooms, potentially calculating a lethal dose. Patterson maintains her innocence, claiming the deaths were a tragic accident and denying she intentionally included the poisonous fungi in the meal. The trial continues with Patterson facing cross-examination regarding deleted data and conflicting statements made to police about foraging mushrooms and owning a food dehydrator, with prosecutors suggesting she disposed of the dehydrator to eliminate evidence.</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued a warning to women using weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, about potential impacts on contraception. The MHRA advises women to use effective contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a specific period afterward, noting concerns that these medications may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, particularly in overweight or obese individuals. The agency has received reports of unintended pregnancies and emphasizes the importance of consulting with prescribers about the risks and benefits of these drugs. The MHRA also advises that those using Mounjaro and taking an oral contraceptive should also use a condom for four weeks after starting the drug, or switch to another method such as the coil or implant.</p>

The Thunder's path to victory lies in their formidable defense and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's scoring prowess, while the Pacers need to maintain their fast pace and protect the ball. The writers are divided on the series outcome, with some favoring the Thunder's depth and defense, while others believe the Pacers' offensive firepower and coaching experience could lead to an upset.

          <p>Russia is attempting to revive a strategic triangle with China and India to counter the Western-led international order, but faces challenges due to the distrust between the two Asian powers. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov criticized NATO's efforts to involve India in "anti-China" initiatives and reiterated Moscow's desire for India and China to restore the Russia-India-China framework. The border dispute between China and India in 2020 largely froze bilateral ties until a disengagement agreement was reached in October of the previous year. Despite the challenges, some analysts believe that President Trump's policies could serve as a catalyst to bring the three countries together.</p>

          <p>Automotive industry groups are expressing increasing concern about a potential rare earth shortage due to China's recent export restrictions. Several European auto supplier plants and production lines have already been shut down as a result, according to Europe's auto supplier association CLEPA. Germany's car industry and auto executives have also warned of the sector's vulnerability to supply chain disruptions, as China's Ministry of Commerce imposed export restrictions on rare earth elements and magnets in response to U.S. tariffs. CLEPA reports that only about 25% of export license applications have been approved since early April.</p>

The Mail focuses on the "battle lines" drawn over immigration policies, contrasting the approaches of Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch.

          <p>President Trump's deployment of military resources, including armored vehicles, to the US-Mexico border is raising concerns about the militarization of border control. The use of Stryker vehicles and thousands of soldiers has been described as an unprecedented display of American military might. Critics argue that Trump is circumventing the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the military's involvement in domestic law enforcement. The administration defends its actions as necessary for national security, citing the need to combat illegal immigration, criminal gangs, and drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Thin Blue Paw, a charity supporting serving and retired police dogs, is advocating for pensions to help cover the veterinary costs associated with caring for these animals after their service. Retired police dogs often face chronic health issues and injuries resulting from their work, which can lead to significant expenses for adopters. The charity estimates that adopting a retired police dog costs an average of Â£3,000 more per year compared to adopting a regular dog. The Home Office has stated that service animals are managed by individual police forces, and there are currently no plans to change the retirement process.</p>

Despite a historic start to the season, the Dodgers have struggled to maintain consistency, with a .500 record over the past month. Manager Dave Roberts attributes the team's recent struggles to the pitching staff's ERA, which has been among the worst in the National League. Tony Gonsolin, the starting pitcher, lasted only five innings, and the bullpen struggled to contain the Mets' offense, exemplified by Pete Alonso's two home runs.</p>

The DOJ agreed not to further criminally prosecute the company if the deal is approved by a federal judge.

This includes ignoring the rules of the World Trade Organization, hindering its work and threatening to abandon it. Denying low-income countries the opportunity to develop through trade could lead to a surge of migrants, while a retreat from free trade will hurt consumers worldwide through higher prices and more limited choices.</p>
