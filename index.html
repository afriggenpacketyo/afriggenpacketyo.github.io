          <p>The Trump administration's new "reciprocal" tariffs have taken effect, imposing higher duties on goods from numerous U.S. trading partners. Rates vary significantly, with countries like Syria facing 41% duties, while Brazil and India are set to face 50%. Major partners like the European Union, Japan, and the UK have negotiated lower rates, but Switzerland was unsuccessful in its last-minute talks to secure a deal. Analysts warn that despite some optimism from recent trade agreements, the full impact on economic growth and inflation remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent announcement by President Trump to impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports has generated significant confusion within the tech industry. The policy includes an exemption for companies "building in the United States," but lacks crucial details on what qualifies for this exemption. Experts are questioning whether the tariff applies only to raw chips or to finished consumer goods containing them, a distinction with massive economic implications. The ambiguity leaves the $600 billion industry uncertain about the full impact, especially concerning complex global supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has given the Chinese government two weeks to clarify why sections of its plans for a new large-scale embassy in London have been blacked out. The proposed location near the city's financial district has raised espionage and security concerns among officials and residents. The Home Office has requested a new "hard perimeter" around the site, and pro-democracy activists fear it could be used to harass political opponents. The final planning decision on the controversial 20,000-square-meter complex is expected by early September.</p>

Under the new treaty, those who cross the English Channel will be held in immigration removal centers until they can be returned to France. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the policy sends a clear message that attempting the crossing is a waste of money and a significant risk. The move is part of the government's latest effort to deter small boat crossings from organized crime gangs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Planned Parenthood has announced it will close its two remaining facilities in Louisiana, a development celebrated by pro-life groups as a "huge success." The closures are attributed to the state's ban on abortions, which pro-life advocates say removes the primary financial driver for the organization. Planned Parenthood officials countered that the closures are a "direct result of relentless political assaults" by lawmakers who have made it impossible to provide care. The organization has been shuttering facilities in several states following the overturning of Roe v. Wade and efforts to reduce its public funding.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor has lowered its annual operating profit forecast, citing the significant impact of U.S. auto tariffs. Although its June-quarter results exceeded estimates, operating profit still fell 11% year-on-year, with the company attributing 450 billion yen in losses directly to the new duties. The world's largest carmaker has been forced to absorb higher costs to maintain its market share in the United States. A recent U.S.-Japan trade deal is expected to lower tariffs, which could help stabilize earnings in the long term for Japanese automakers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As climate change intensifies wildfire seasons globally, experts are highlighting strategies to make forests more resilient to fire. The best natural defense is a healthy, diverse forest, such as native deciduous forests in Central Europe, which are less flammable than monoculture pine plantations. Short-term tactics include reducing fuel loads by clearing dry undergrowth, either mechanically or through controlled burns. Other methods involve creating wide, vegetation-free firebreaks to slow a fire's spread and planting less-flammable native species around communities to act as green barriers against encroaching flames.</p>

          <p>Britain's homelessness minister, Rushanara Ali, is facing criticism for allegedly increasing the rent on a property she owns by £700 a month shortly after the previous tenants' contract ended.

A spokesperson for the minister stated that all legal requirements were met, and a source claimed the tenants chose to leave while the house was for sale.

This shift would foster more creative, collaborative, and pluralistic thinking, which is better suited to tackling complex challenges like climate change and the loss of trust in politics.

          <p>Climate experts have confirmed that July 2025 was the third-hottest July worldwide since record-keeping began, with an average surface air temperature 0.45°C above the 1991-2020 average. Although the recent streak of consecutive record-breaking monthly temperatures has ended, scientists emphasize that climate change continues to drive extreme weather events. During the month, temperatures exceeded 50°C in the Gulf, Iraq, and Turkey, while catastrophic floods occurred in China and Pakistan. Experts warn that without rapidly stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations, more records and worsening impacts are to be expected.</p>

          <p>An in-depth report outlines Russia's escalating use of hybrid warfare to interfere in Moldova's upcoming election and maneuver the nation back into its sphere of influence. Russia is allegedly employing a range of sabotage tactics, including paid protests, massive vote-buying schemes, and flooding social media with disinformation and AI-generated content. These efforts aim to sow chaos and distrust in the democratic process ahead of a pivotal vote. Moldovan President Maia Sandu has described the interference as "unprecedented" as her pro-European government faces a challenge from a pro-Russian political alliance.</p>

          <p>British athletics great Jonathan Edwards has reflected on his triple jump world record of 18.29m, set 30 years ago, suggesting its longevity is not necessarily a good sign for the sport. He believes that with advancements in sports science and nutrition, the record should have been broken, and its persistence may indicate that track and field is not attracting top talent compared to more lucrative sports. Edwards, who remains Britain's only world record holder in a regularly contested track and field event, also discussed the technical changes that led to his historic performance in 1995.</p>

          <p>The UK's Environment Agency will introduce enhanced checks on tyre exports following a BBC investigation that found millions were being sent to illegal furnaces in India instead of being recycled. The agency acknowledged it is "highly likely" that a portion of the nearly 700,000 tonnes of waste tyres exported annually are diverted to makeshift plants for pyrolysis. This process, which extracts low-grade materials, can cause serious health problems and environmental damage. While campaigners welcomed the move, some argue the new self-certification measures do not go far enough to close criminal loopholes.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese researchers has identified 37 young "de novo" genes, which are unique to humans and their recent ancestors, that may be linked to both advanced cognitive abilities and cancer. Unlike most genes that evolve from existing ones, de novo genes emerge from previously non-functional DNA. The research, published in Cell Genomics, found that these specific genes were significantly more active in tumors. Furthermore, deleting some of these genes was shown to suppress the growth of tumor cells, suggesting they could be what the article calls "dormant bombs."</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut and decorated U.S. Navy captain Butch Wilmore has retired after a 25-year career that included 464 days in space. His final mission was a nine-month extended stay on the International Space Station (ISS) after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft he co-piloted experienced technical problems. Wilmore and crewmate Suni Williams, who were on what was meant to be an eight-day test flight, ultimately returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX capsule. NASA praised Wilmore's dedication and "lasting legacy of fortitude" in a statement celebrating his service to space exploration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is threatening secondary sanctions against countries, like India and China, that continue to purchase Russian oil, a critical revenue source for Moscow's war effort. India, which has already been hit with increased tariffs, has seen its Russian oil imports grow nineteen-fold since 2021, saving billions on energy costs. Analysts believe a sudden halt to these purchases could cause a global oil price spike and stoke inflation. While China may have more economic leverage to resist U.S. pressure, India faces significant risk to its financial system if Washington's threats are fully realized.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute has identified the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 as the most-stolen vehicle in the United States. The high-performance muscle car, which retails for around $75,400, had a theft rate 39 times higher than the average for 2022-2024 models. The report notes that powerful, expensive vehicles and pickup trucks are common targets for thieves. The Camaro's vulnerability is also linked to its on-board data port, which can be exploited by knowledgeable thieves to steal the vehicle relatively easily.</p>

          <p>This opinion article offers a sharp critique of fashion photographer Juergen Teller's new coffee-table book about the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. The author argues that the iPhone-shot photographs are bland, unremarkable, and contribute nothing to a deeper understanding of the Holocaust, likening them to a tourist's snapshots. The piece questions the decision to invite a celebrity artist for such a sensitive project, labeling one instance where Teller photographs his own surname among victim lists as narcissistic. The author concludes that the work is a detached and generalizing vanity project that fails its historical responsibility.</p>

          <p>United Airlines has resolved a technology issue that prompted a nationwide ground stop, causing extensive delays at major hubs like Chicago O'Hare and Denver. The airline held departures for several hours on Wednesday evening to manage gate availability at destination airports while it worked to fix the problem. While the ground stop has been lifted, the airline expects residual delays as it works to restore normal operations. The Secretary of Transportation confirmed the outage was an internal company issue and not related to the broader air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>A massive and intense wildfire is raging in the Corbieres hills of southern France, described by officials as the largest in nearly 80 years. The blaze has burned through 16,000 hectares, resulting in the death of one person, injuring 13 others, and forcing the evacuation of several villages and campsites. Over 2,100 firefighters, supported by aircraft, are struggling to contain the flames amid unfavorable weather conditions, including high temperatures and strong winds.
