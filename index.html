          <p>Peloton announced a surprise fiscal fourth-quarter profit of $21.6 million, a significant turnaround from a $30.5 million loss a year prior, leading to a 6% rise in shares. This positive financial shift is largely attributed to better-than-expected sales and aggressive operating expense reductions, including a new round of layoffs impacting 6% of its staff. CEO Peter Stern outlined plans to cut an additional $100 million in expenses for fiscal year 2026, alongside a strategic return to physical retail with smaller micro-stores. The company also aims to diversify beyond its core bike and treadmill offerings into broader wellness categories like mental well-being and sleep, planning to integrate advanced AI technologies for personalized coaching to drive future growth.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has implemented a more defined tariff strategy, leveraging steep duties to compel dozens of countries into bilateral trade agreements that include commitments to buy more US goods. While some nations like the European Union and Japan have made concessions to secure lower tariffs, others face significant penalties. Despite perceived short-term successes in these negotiations, the tariffs are embroiled in legal challenges, with a recent appellate court hearing reportedly unfavorable to the administration's stance. Furthermore, concerns are mounting that these protectionist measures are contributing to a slowdown in the US economy, potentially deepening a looming recession and making the long-term outlook uncertain.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global oil market is largely dismissing President Trump's threats to impose heavy "secondary tariffs" on countries that purchase Russian energy exports, viewing them primarily as a negotiation tactic rather than an imminent policy. Despite a 25% tariff already targeted at India, traders anticipate that a deal will eventually be reached, or that major importers like India would simply absorb the additional costs to maintain supply. Experts highlight the Trump administration's past inconsistencies in enforcing energy sanctions and suggest that steep tariffs on Russian oil buyers could paradoxically undermine Trump's stated goal of reducing domestic energy prices. The article implies that the president must navigate these pressures carefully to avoid counterproductive economic outcomes.</p>

          <p>President Trump is poised to sign an executive order that will direct the U.S. Secretary of Labor to review existing fiduciary guidance, effectively allowing alternative assets such as private equity, cryptocurrencies, and real estate into 401(k) plans. This move represents a significant win for the alternative asset industry, which has long lobbied for greater inclusion of these investments in defined contribution plans. Following the news, Bitcoin and private equity stocks saw an immediate uptick. While these assets have historically been excluded from 401(k)s due to higher fees, lack of transparency, and longer lockup periods, the order signals a major shift toward their broader adoption within the $8.7 trillion 401(k) market.

          <p>Eli Lilly announced promising Phase 3 trial results for its experimental GLP-1 pill, orforglipron, which helped obese adults achieve an average weight loss of 27.3 pounds over a 72-week period. The drugmaker plans to submit orforglipron for FDA approval later this year, potentially making the oral medication available to consumers by 2026. While some investors reacted with disappointment that led to a stock dip, experts hail the pill as a potential "game changer" for its enhanced accessibility, being cheaper to manufacture and more convenient to take than injectable forms. The trial did note common side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, leading some participants to discontinue the treatment.</p>

          <p>Maryland State Police have charged 19-year-old Jayden Ballard of Salisbury with impersonating a police officer and unlawfully taking a motor vehicle. Investigators believe Ballard gained access to a marked Maryland State Police vehicle and uniform, subsequently using them to conduct fake traffic stops across Wicomico County. Authorities are actively probing the circumstances under which Ballard obtained the police cruiser and attire. The Maryland State Police Criminal Enforcement Division is urging any individuals who may have interacted with Ballard while he was posing as an officer to come forward. Ballard’s trial is currently scheduled to commence on September 24.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet is meeting to deliberate a comprehensive military takeover of the Gaza Strip, a move Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly considers essential to dismantle Hamas and secure the release of remaining hostages. However, the plan faces significant opposition from within the military and some government ministers, who warn of potentially catastrophic consequences for both the hostages and the already displaced Palestinian civilian population. A top UN official also emphasized that such an occupation would violate international law, calling the prospect "deeply alarming." The proposed strategy reportedly involves a phased approach, starting with Gaza City, which would necessitate further mass displacement in the humanitarian crisis-stricken territory.</p>

          <p>President Trump's broad tariffs, widely opposed by economists and businesses, have surprisingly garnered support from some union leaders, including UAW President Shawn Fain, despite his past criticisms of Trump. This unexpected alignment stems from a long-standing union advocacy for protectionist policies, believing they can reverse manufacturing job losses attributed to free-trade agreements like NAFTA. However, many other union members and leaders remain skeptical, fearing Trump's inconsistent and sweeping tariffs will ultimately harm the economy and the working class they represent. It questions whether these policies can genuinely revive American manufacturing, suggesting the economic landscape has fundamentally shifted away from a factory-centric model.</p>

Sesko has been a prolific scorer for Leipzig, netting 39 goals in 87 appearances, and was also a target for Newcastle.

          <p>Despite widespread economic and political opposition, President Trump's tariffs could prove remarkably durable due to their substantial revenue generation for the U.S. government, accumulating over $152 billion this year alone. If upheld by the Supreme Court, these tariffs could fundamentally alter America's fiscal policy by establishing a significant revenue stream without requiring congressional approval. Future presidents, facing escalating deficits and a congressional reluctance to enact substantial tax increases, may find it politically expedient to retain a significant portion of these tariffs rather than repeal them. Additionally, the concentrated benefits to specific domestic industries, coupled with diffuse costs to consumers, could fortify this protectionist regime through special interest lobbying.

These individuals, likely unable to afford relocation, were joined by others seeking valuable items left in the rubble. Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the site's director, described it as an "informal settlement" or "favela" where people lived without the typical infrastructure of a Roman city. The discovery shows former ground floors were repurposed into cellars with ovens and mills, offering unprecedented insights into post-disaster human resilience and adaptation before the area was completely abandoned in the fifth century.</p>

While acknowledging that the decline of manufacturing contributed to wage stagnation and inequality, the article argues that tariffs cannot reverse the inevitable global shift from manufacturing to services, a trend seen in all rich countries.

          <p>President Trump's executive order, which directs local governments to remove unhoused individuals from public spaces and place them into "long-term institutional settings," is being criticized by experts as a terrifying move that could criminalize homelessness. The order's vague definitions of "mental health crisis" and "substance use disorder" raise concerns about broad interpretations that might lead to involuntary institutionalization without adequate legal safeguards. Critics argue this approach dismantles effective housing-first policies, proposes cuts to vital supportive services, and fundamentally fails to address the underlying causes of homelessness, such as poverty and the pervasive affordable housing crisis. They warn it will exacerbate health disparities and violate civil rights.</p>

This surge in bilateral trade occurs as President Trump indicates a potential 25% tariff on Russian oil imports, a measure that would directly impact major buyers like China. Despite a reported drop in Russian oil deliveries to China in July compared to June, China remains a crucial crude supplier for Russia, highlighting the enduring economic ties between the two nations amidst ongoing international geopolitical pressures.</p>

Trump stated that this revised census would be "based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024." This represents his latest effort to fundamentally alter the decennial survey, which serves as the foundational data for determining the number of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and distributing federal funds.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England recently cut interest rates despite inflation remaining above its 2% target, a decision that prompted a rare second vote among its Monetary Policy Committee members. Governor Andrew Bailey explained that the primary rationale was the expectation of reduced upward pressure on inflation from a weakening job market, evidenced by a fall in job vacancies and an increase in the jobless rate. The Bank also aims to stimulate the struggling UK economy, which is projected to have grown by only 0.1% in the second quarter. While acknowledging lingering inflation risks, the Bank anticipates gradual economic improvement, partly due to a new trade deal with the US boosting exports. (not investment advice)</p>
