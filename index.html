          <p>Police in London are investigating a series of alleged arson attacks at properties connected to Sir Keir Starmer, including a vehicle fire in Kentish Town, a fire at the prime minister's private home, and another at a previous residence. A 26-year-old man was arrested at London Luton Airport on suspicion of conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life. Authorities obtained a warrant to detain the man for an additional 36 hours, as the investigation continues into the incidents and potential motives behind them. The Metropolitan Police are working to determine if the suspect acted alone or was part of a larger network.</p>

          <p>Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, identified Guy Edward Bartkus, 25, as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, which the FBI is treating as an act of terrorism. Bartkus, who is believed to have died in the explosion, had nihilistic ideations and allegedly targeted the in vitro fertilization (IVF) facility, according to Davis. The suspect reportedly attempted to livestream the attack, and authorities are reviewing a manifesto believed to be linked to him. Four others were injured in the bombing, which caused damage within a 250-foot radius, but all embryos at the clinic were saved.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are working to finalize agreements on a sweeping bill, focusing on green energy tax credits, Medicaid work requirements, and the SALT deduction. Negotiations involve handshake pacts or "gentlemen’s agreements," particularly concerning green energy and Medicaid. The "SALT caucus" seeks a compromise that grants a higher deduction initially, which then decreases over the bill's 10-year budget window. The goal is to post the bill's text early this week, with a possible vote following a Rules Committee meeting. The Budget Committee will focus on ensuring the bill doesn't increase the deficit over ten years.</p>

Aster explains that the film reflects his feelings of panic and powerlessness in a world where people can't agree on basic facts. He considers the film a horror, reflecting the free-floating political anxiety that permeates modern life, and emphasizes the importance of re-engaging with each other and avoiding judgment of differing characters.

          <p>Federal and local agencies are investigating the collision of a Mexican navy training ship, the Cuauhtémoc, with the Brooklyn Bridge, which resulted in two deaths and multiple injuries. The ship reportedly lost power and drifted backward, causing its masts to snap upon impact with the bridge. Senator Schumer is questioning whether cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) played a role, specifically regarding the Coast Guard's vehicle traffic service (VTS). While the bridge's structure wasn't damaged, the monitoring system beneath it sustained damage, prompting concerns about the functionality of the VTS.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies closer José Alvarado has been suspended for 80 games after testing positive for external testosterone under Major League Baseball’s drug-testing program. Alvarado claims the positive test was caused by a weight loss drug he took during the offseason, which Phillies president Dave Dombrowski believes. The suspension means Alvarado will be ineligible for the postseason and will lose half of his $9 million salary this year. The Phillies will now rely on other pitchers, including Jordan Romano and Orion Kerkering, to fill the closing role.</p>

          <p>England Test captain Ben Stokes has revealed he stopped drinking alcohol at the start of the year to help his recovery from a hamstring injury. Stokes, who had surgery in December, said he reflected on his relationship with alcohol after his first major injury. He acknowledged that his drinking habits were previously "all or nothing" and that he is now able to manage having "a social drink." Stokes said he hopes the abstinence will aid his rehabilitation and return to cricket.</p>

          <p>A measles outbreak in Texas has emboldened "medical freedom" activists, who now have the support of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The Texas House passed bills making it easier to exempt children from vaccine requirements and barring vaccine makers from advertising in Texas. The Association of Immunization Managers reports a surge in vaccine-related bills nationwide, suggesting Kennedy's influence. Public health experts fear the erosion of vaccine mandates, citing the measles outbreak as evidence of the danger. Vaccine debates are intensifying in Republican-led states, with opponents emphasizing personal freedom.</p>

          <p>Todd S. Purdum reflects on Desi Arnaz's impact on Hollywood, highlighting his efforts to promote diversity and inclusion during a time of racial prejudice. Arnaz's success in casting himself as Lucille Ball's husband in "I Love Lucy" challenged stereotypes and broke new ground in television. His technical innovations, such as filming the show in front of a live audience, revolutionized the industry and created the syndication market. Arnaz's story serves as an example of the importance of diversity and creative risk-taking in entertainment, especially at a time when many institutions are retreating from diversity efforts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Middle East diplomacy is shifting away from Israel, as evidenced by his meeting with Syria’s new leader and promise to lift sanctions. This move disregards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's views, whose government considers the Syrian president a “jihadist.” Trump's focus on negotiating peace deals in Iran and Yemen and securing business deals with Gulf nations signals a change in priorities. While the U.S. maintains its ties with Israel, Trump's actions suggest a reduced emphasis on Netanyahu's influence in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump’s chief Iran negotiator, Steve Witkoff, outlined the administration’s position on negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, stating that Tehran must abandon all enrichment of nuclear fuel. Witkoff emphasized that “enrichment enables weaponization,” and the U.S. will not allow Iran to possess a nuclear weapon. While Witkoff did not insist on the destruction of Iran’s enrichment centers, he indicated that any enrichment capability, even at low levels, would be unacceptable. These statements come ahead of a planned fourth negotiating session in Europe.</p>
