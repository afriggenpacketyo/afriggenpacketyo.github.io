          <p>Liverpool is reportedly finalizing the acquisition of 18-year-old Italian defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma for a fee around £26 million. Leoni has become a primary target for the club under new manager Arne Slot. This potential signing is part of a broader defensive reinforcement strategy, as the team also continues negotiations with Crystal Palace for England's Marc Guehi. The club has been active in the transfer market, spending approximately £270 million this summer while offsetting costs with £170 million in player sales.</p>

          <p>Following a virtual conference with Ukrainian and European leaders, President Trump issued a stern warning to Russia, threatening "severe consequences" if Vladimir Putin does not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine. The statement came ahead of a planned meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska, which Trump described as a preliminary step to gauge Russia's position. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed skepticism, stating that Putin is "bluffing" and that sustained pressure is necessary for peace. European leaders confirmed Trump's goal for the summit is to secure an immediate ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is legally challenging an order from the entire federal bench in Maryland that automatically pauses deportation cases for two days upon filing. During a hearing, a Virginia judge, presiding due to the Maryland judges' recusal, expressed skepticism about the DOJ's position. The government argues the order infringes on the attorney general's discretion over immigration matters, while the court defends it as a necessary measure to preserve judicial review. This lawsuit highlights ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and the judiciary over immigration enforcement and executive authority.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave dropped 20% after the company reported a second-quarter adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, exceeding analyst expectations. The poor performance comes just before the expiration of its post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce more stock volatility. Despite the loss, CoreWeave's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, beating forecasts, and the company raised its full-year revenue guidance. Analysts noted that light capital expenditure guidance and a delay in some spending may have also concerned investors. (not investment advice)</p>

The list, which includes several electric vehicles like the Nissan Leaf and Porsche Taycan, suggests that initial popularity and advanced technology do not guarantee long-term value.

The unidentified patient is currently in intensive care, with the infection possibly contracted while water skiing at the Lake of the Ozarks. While the amoeba is common in warm freshwater, infections are extremely rare, occurring when contaminated water is forced up the nose. This case follows a recent fatality in South Carolina, highlighting the severe danger of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), which has had only 167 reported cases since 1962.</p>

Lower rates are expected to particularly benefit smaller companies, which often rely more heavily on borrowing for operations and expansion. Traders are now pricing in a near-100% probability of a rate cut, a sentiment bolstered by recent weaker-than-expected economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's public criticism of Goldman Sachs, a broad consensus is forming among Wall Street economists that U.S. consumers will soon face higher inflation due to tariffs. Experts from firms like JPMorgan Chase and UBS predict that as pre-tariff inventories are depleted, businesses will increasingly pass on the higher costs. While no one forecasts runaway inflation, they anticipate a steady rise that could push the core inflation rate into the low- to mid-3% range. This economic pressure is expected to impact consumer spending and GDP growth through the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Richard Kim, a former executive at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, has been indicted on fraud charges for allegedly misappropriating approximately $4 million from investors in his online casino startup. Prosecutors allege that Kim diverted most of the $4.3 million in seed funding and lost it within a week by gambling on another crypto casino site. He allegedly concealed the gambling losses from investors, which included his former employer Galaxy Digital, by claiming the money was lost in a "treasury management strategy." Kim's company, Zero Edge, never launched and is now in liquidation.</p>

          <p>Texas House Democrats, who left the state to break quorum and block a special session on redistricting, are now discussing when to return. They consider their departure a success, as it has effectively stalled the Republican-led effort to pass new congressional maps that would create five new GOP-majority seats. In response, Governor Greg Abbott has stated that a second special session will be called immediately if the current one fails due to a lack of quorum. The standoff highlights the intense partisan battle over redistricting and political power in the state.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will host this year's Kennedy Center Honors and was heavily involved in selecting the recipients, admitting he rejected potential nominees he considered "too woke" or liberal. This marks a significant break from tradition, where presidents typically attend but do not host or directly influence the bipartisan selection process. The first nominees announced under his chairmanship include Sylvester Stallone, Gloria Gaynor, and the band Kiss. The move is seen as part of Trump's broader effort to exert influence over U.S. cultural institutions since returning to the White House.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis article posits that President Trump's decision to federalize the D.C. police and deploy the National Guard is a calculated authoritarian move, not a genuine response to crime. The author argues the action serves primarily as a distraction from the Jeffrey Epstein case and a way to energize his base by targeting a multiracial, Democratic-run city. The move is framed as part of a larger pattern of attacking "Democrat-run cities" to create a perception of disorder that only his strongman approach can solve. It's presented as a dangerous escalation in personalizing state power.</p>

          <p>Police are investigating an armed robbery of a Brinks truck in Elkins Park, a suburb of Philadelphia, where two assailants stole between $700,000 and $800,000. The midday heist occurred outside an H Mart, with one robber reportedly armed with an AR-15-style pistol. No one was injured in the incident. This is the latest in a series of at least five similar armored vehicle robberies in the Philadelphia area this summer. The FBI and local authorities are investigating potential connections between the heists, and federal charges have already been filed against three individuals for a related robbery in June.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking volume of containers in July, a direct result of shippers front-loading cargo to get ahead of impending tariffs on Chinese goods. The port handled over one million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) for the first time in its 117-year history. While this created a surge, logistics experts note that the peak shipping season started and slowed earlier than usual, and overall volume may not be as strong as in typical years. This data provides a clear picture of how tariff threats are distorting normal supply chain operations and consumer-driven demand. (not investment advice)</p>

This call was a crucial effort by European nations to ensure their security interests and Ukraine's sovereignty remain central to the U.S.-Russia discussions. Despite Trump's reassurances, an underlying nervousness persists among the allies that a deal could be struck at Ukraine's expense.</p>

          <p>Florida's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has unanimously approved the state's first black bear hunt in a decade, a decision immediately condemned by wildlife advocates. The limited hunt, scheduled for December, will permit methods like baiting, archery, and eventually, the use of dog packs, which critics call "barbaric." Officials justified the hunt by citing a rising bear population and increased human encounters, but opponents argue the decision is based on flawed science and ignores the species' long recovery from being endangered. The state's last hunt in 2015 was controversially halted after quotas were quickly and chaotically exceeded.</p>

This marks a reversal from the past year, when these brands outperformed the wider restaurant industry.

The Social Security Administration determines the official COLA each October based on third-quarter inflation data to ensure benefits keep pace with rising prices.
