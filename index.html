          <p>Hamas has announced its conditional agreement to certain elements of President Trump's Gaza ceasefire proposal, notably the release of all hostages and handing over Gaza's administration to a technocratic Palestinian body. The U.S. views this response positively, despite details like weapons decommissioning and Hamas's future role still needing resolution. Following Hamas's statement, Trump urged Israel to halt bombing in Gaza to ensure safe and swift hostage extraction, believing the group is "ready for a lasting PEACE." This development represents a significant, yet complex, step towards a potential de-escalation in the ongoing conflict, with further discussions required to finalize a comprehensive agreement amidst Israeli skepticism regarding Hamas's true intentions.</p>

          <p>Amazon is shuttering four additional Fresh supermarkets in Southern California, continuing its strategic pivot towards Whole Foods and online grocery delivery. These closures follow similar actions in other U.S. states and the U.K., as the company re-evaluates its physical store portfolio after a turbulent rollout since 2020. Amazon spokesperson Griffin Buch confirmed the closures, stating the company is assisting affected employees in finding new roles wherever possible. Despite the Fresh store reductions, CEO Andy Jassy remains "bullish" on grocery, with Amazon still maintaining 500 Whole Foods locations and investing in new online and physical store initiatives like a "price-conscious" brand.</p>

          <p>Manchester United Women achieved a significant 1-1 draw against Chelsea, ending the reigning champions' perfect start to the Women's Super League season. Despite the "statement" performance, United's boss Marc Skinner expressed disappointment at not securing all three points, highlighting several missed chances throughout the match. The result marks only the second time United has taken points off Chelsea in 12 league encounters, showcasing their progress and growing competitiveness in the WSL. This draw signals that Chelsea's six-year dominance in the league may face a stronger challenge this season from improving teams like Manchester United, who displayed their most brave performance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a landmark deal allowing Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize and bargain collectively while retaining their independent contractor status. This legislation represents a rare compromise between labor groups and gig economy companies, ending years of legal and political disputes over driver classification. The new law, Assembly Bill 1340, outlines a process for drivers to form unions by collecting signatures from a percentage of active drivers, exempting them from state and federal antitrust laws. In return, Uber and Lyft will benefit from significantly reduced insurance requirements, a key concession that lowers costs for riders and helps address a major expense for the companies.</p>

Authorities had sought to impound the dogs, but Gibson's assistant initially refused, stating he needed more time to rehome them. Gibson expressed devastation and heartbreak for the victim's family, stating he had made the difficult decision to rehome his dogs, but officials insist the dogs must be surrendered due to past complaints and safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Antoine Semenyo, Bournemouth's Ghana international winger, delivered a "world-class" performance, scoring two goals and assisting another in a 3-1 comeback victory over Fulham. This inspired display propelled Bournemouth to an "unthinkable" second spot in the Premier League, just one point behind leaders Liverpool. Semenyo's impressive form, with six league goals and three assists this season, highlights his crucial role after the club lost several key players in the summer, proving their decision to retain him a masterstroke. Manager Andoni Iraola's astute tactical changes, including bold substitutions, also paid off, further cementing the team's surprising success and drawing praise for his ability to improve players and achieve high finishes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its second week after the Senate failed for a fourth time to pass spending proposals from both Democrats and Republicans, unable to reach the required 60-vote threshold. The impasse centers on healthcare, with Democrats pushing for extended health insurance subsidies and Republicans accusing them of seeking healthcare for undocumented immigrants. The White House, led by Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, has warned of potential mass layoffs of federal workers if the shutdown persists, targeting "Democrat agencies" and freezing infrastructure funding in some states. This prolonged deadlock continues to accrue significant economic consequences, with both parties blaming each other for the lack of progress and voters deeply split on responsibility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has reaffirmed that the Trump administration's attempt to significantly narrow birthright citizenship is likely unconstitutional. The First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, blocking the executive order that sought to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders. The court's chief justice cited historical efforts to restrict birthright citizenship, from Dred Scott to Wong Kim Ark, as having been rejected, once by constitutional amendment and once by the Supreme Court. This ruling aligns with previous judicial decisions, highlighting a consistent rejection of efforts to make citizenship depend on parents' actions rather than the simple fact of being born in the United States.</p>

          <p>Munich Airport has been repeatedly forced to suspend operations due to "unconfirmed drone sightings," marking the second closure in 24 hours and causing flight diversions and thousands of stranded passengers. These incidents follow a drone sighting over a nearby German military facility, raising broader security concerns. German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt called the events a "wake-up call," emphasizing the escalating challenge of drone threats and the need for increased funding and research in drone defense. The incidents occur as Germany celebrates Unity Day, with leaders like Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron highlighting that democracy and European security are under attack, urging Europeans to "relearn how to defend ourselves."</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled for a second time, granting the Trump administration's emergency appeal to cancel the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans. This decision overrides lower court rulings that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem exceeded her authority by reversing Biden-era extensions. Advocates warn that this move could lead to job losses, detention, and deportation for thousands of individuals to an unsafe country, creating a "totally bizarre situation" where some retain status while others lose it. Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson dissented, with Jackson criticizing the "grave misuse of our emergency docket" and the harmful interference with lower court cases while lives hang in the balance.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department is considering minting a $1 commemorative coin featuring President Donald Trump's likeness on both sides to mark the United States' 250th anniversary. A first draft depicts Trump's profile on one side and a defiant pose with the words "FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT" on the other, reflecting his reaction to an assassination attempt. U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach confirmed the drafts are real, while a Treasury spokesperson stated the design is not final but "reflects well the enduring spirit of our country." However, the legality of depicting a living president on a coin is questioned by federal law and historical tradition, which typically reserve such honors for deceased individuals.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's Justice Department is reportedly firing experienced counterterrorism prosecutors and experts for political reasons, raising alarms about national security and the integrity of legal proceedings. Michael Ben’Ary, head of national security at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, was pushed out over false accusations by a MAGA activist. This follows the sidelining of George Toscas, a veteran anti-terrorist attorney, who had encouraged the investigation into classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Critics argue these removals jeopardize the nation's ability to bring terrorists to justice, as the specialized judgment and expertise of these prosecutors are crucial and difficult to replace, making the U.S. and the world less safe.</p>

          <p>Russ Vought, Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has been cast by Donald Trump as the "Grim Reaper," tasked with implementing deep government cuts during the ongoing shutdown. Trump is using Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for governing, as leverage to achieve his budgetary demands, despite previously distancing himself from the plan. Vought, known for his budget expertise and desire to "crush the deep state," has already announced significant infrastructure projects in Chicago and New York, and nearly $8 billion in clean energy project cancellations in Democratic-run states. This strategy leverages the shutdown's legal limbo to make deeper and potentially more durable reductions to federal programs and staffing, raising concerns among some Republicans about public opinion.</p>

The club board is looking for a strong performance to show the team is responding to his coaching, as a heavy defeat could intensify internal scrutiny heading into the international break, especially given the club's history of instability and poor results this season.</p>

He insists he will not resign, viewing it as a board decision, and vows to fight to progress the club, despite personal frustration from losing.

Badenoch, who previously expressed reservations, now asserts the move is vital to "protect our borders, our veterans, and our citizens," marking a sharp policy shift. Labour criticized the move as being "forced on" Badenoch and not "thought through," while legal experts warn of serious political and legal consequences, including potential breaches of the Good Friday Agreement and the UK-EU trade deal.</p>

          <p>Shares of Detroit automakers, including General Motors, Ford Motor, and Stellantis, saw significant gains following reports that President Donald Trump is considering "significant tariff relief" for vehicles produced in the U.S. The potential changes, which could effectively eliminate much of the costs major car companies are currently paying, include extending a 3.75% tariff offset for five years and adding U.S. engine production to the relief. This news brought relief to an industry that has faced billions in tariff-related costs under Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, with Ford alone expecting $3 billion in costs this year. Automakers have actively lobbied the administration for such concessions, and the report signals a reward for companies with final assembly in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

Patel asserted the SPLC had become a "partisan smear machine" and criticized the ADL, contrasting his stance with former FBI Director James Comey's past support. The decision marks a dramatic shift in FBI partnerships, raising concerns about the agency's approach to combating hate crimes and domestic extremism, especially after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and renewed attention to SPLC's characterization of his group.</p>

The coin features a Punisher-like skull symbol, with "K$H" on the forehead, pistols, and a tommy gun, drawing comparisons to a Goth-horror gamer aesthetic. The article argues that the design lacks the gravitas expected of the nation's premier law enforcement agency, whose directors traditionally come from backgrounds of significant accomplishment. This controversial memento is seen as unserious and unlikely to inspire respect in colleagues or fellow law enforcers, further questioning the direction and professionalism of the FBI under Patel's command, especially given his recent controversial decisions.</p>

His family expressed "utter shock and disbelief" at not being able to say goodbye, highlighting his role as their "rock" and the devastating impact on their home.
