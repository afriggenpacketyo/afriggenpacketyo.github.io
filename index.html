          <p>Police in south Belfast have decided not to assist contractors in dismantling a large bonfire built for annual Twelfth of July celebrations. The decision was made despite significant safety concerns, including the bonfire's proximity to a hospital power substation and the discovery of asbestos at the site. Authorities stated that intervening posed a greater risk than allowing the event to proceed, a move that has drawn both criticism for failing to address public health hazards and praise for respecting cultural traditions. The situation highlights ongoing political and cultural tensions surrounding the annual unionist celebrations in Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the Karen Read case, from the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, to the conclusion of her second trial. It chronicles the investigation, her arrest, and the two high-profile trials, where the prosecution alleged she struck O'Keefe with her SUV, while the defense claimed she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement. The timeline covers key evidence, witness testimony, legal battles, and the public fallout, culminating in her acquittal on the most serious charges and a conviction for driving under the influence.</p>

          <p>Devastating flooding in the Texas Hill Country has resulted in at least 121 fatalities, with Kerr County being the most severely affected region, reporting 96 deaths, including 36 children. Search and rescue operations are still active as 166 people remain missing, and a federal disaster declaration has been signed for the area. Multiple states are sending response teams to assist with the ongoing crisis, which has also claimed the lives of leaders from local summer camps. The tragedy has prompted calls for a special legislative session to improve flood warning systems.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian refugee, is suing the U.S. government for $20 million, alleging false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. He was detained by immigration agents for over 100 days due to his involvement in pro-Palestinian campus protests, with the government arguing his activism was detrimental to foreign policy interests. A federal judge ordered his release, finding he was not a flight risk or threat. Khalil's legal claim seeks accountability for his detention, which caused him to miss the birth of his first child.</p>

          <p>As the only nation to have suffered nuclear attacks, Japan has long been a global advocate for disarmament, but this identity is now facing a potential shift. The article explores how the growing nuclear arsenals of China and North Korea, coupled with the possibility of South Korea developing its own weapons, are causing a dangerous proliferation risk. This changing security landscape is forcing a debate within Japan about its own defense posture. The long-standing taboo against possessing nuclear weapons is being challenged by the strategic realities of its increasingly armed neighbors.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump allocates a massive increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), enabling a significant expansion of the administration's immigration crackdown. The legislation provides ICE with an additional $75 billion, part of a larger $170 billion package for immigration and border enforcement. These funds will be used to nearly double detention capacity to over 100,000 beds, hire thousands of new deportation officers, and expand programs that deputize local law enforcement for immigration arrests. Critics warn the funding will lead to dire humanitarian and legal consequences.</p>

          <p>This NPR report follows Gazan journalist Anas Baba on his dangerous attempt to secure food for his family, illustrating the severe humanitarian crisis in the region. With Israel tightly restricting aid, many Gazans rely on new distribution sites where hundreds have reportedly been killed by Israeli troops while approaching. The article provides a firsthand account of the desperation and risk involved in obtaining basic necessities. Baba's personal story, including losing a third of his body weight, puts a human face on the dire warnings from the U.N. about the new aid system.</p>

          <p>An administrative error in Los Angeles County has led to the accidental repeal of Measure J, a landmark 2020 ballot initiative that redirects hundreds of millions of dollars toward alternatives to incarceration. The mistake occurred when the county failed to add Measure J's text to the official charter, so when voters approved a separate government overhaul, Measure G, in 2024, they unwittingly nullified the earlier reform. Officials are now scrambling to address the blunder, which has alarmed community advocates who fear the loss of crucial funding for social services and jail diversion programs.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has ended the two-decade-old requirement for air travelers to remove their shoes during security screening. The article argues this policy change is less about improved security and more a form of "populism theater," giving the public something it wants without a clear technological or intelligence-based justification. The shoe removal rule, a legacy of the post-9/11 era, had become a symbol of "security theater," and its removal now mirrors the upscaling of convenience that was once reserved for paying customers of services like TSA PreCheck.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country is prepared to impose retaliatory tariffs of up to 50% on U.S. goods. This comes after President Donald Trump threatened to levy a 50% tax on Brazilian imports, citing the prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro as a "witch hunt." Lula stated that Brazil is a sovereign nation and that its justice system must be respected, calling Trump's justification for the tariffs inaccurate and provocative. The escalating rhetoric has rattled Brazilian exporters and marks a significant diplomatic and trade dispute between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A San Francisco judge has ruled that former CNN anchor Don Lemon's lawsuit against Elon Musk and his social media company, X, can go to trial. Lemon sued the company in 2024, alleging breach of contract and fraud after X abruptly canceled a partnership for a new show just hours after Lemon conducted a tense interview with Musk. The judge found that Lemon's claims, including that an implied contract existed, were plausible. The case centers on the fallout from the interview where Lemon questioned Musk on contentious topics and content moderation on the platform.</p>
