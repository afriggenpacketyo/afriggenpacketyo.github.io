          <p>A significant explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port in Iran resulted in at least 28 fatalities and 800 injuries, causing widespread damage to nearby buildings and infrastructure. The blast, which occurred on Saturday morning, prompted the closure of schools and offices in the region due to high levels of air pollution from chemicals. Initial reports suggest the explosion may have been caused by a fire in a hazardous and chemical materials storage depot, though some sources indicate it may have involved solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles. Authorities are investigating the exact cause of the incident, which impacted Iran's largest commercial port and a critical hub for trade. </p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is partnering with JetZero to develop a blended wing body (BWB) aircraft, a revolutionary design that could reduce fuel consumption by up to 50% compared to traditional planes. This initiative is part of Delta's strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, leveraging existing engine technology for faster adoption. The BWB aircraft can carry over 250 passengers and offers potential for redesigned cabin layouts with more space and reduced noise. Backed by government and industry support, the first flight of a full-scale demonstrator aircraft is planned for 2027, marking a significant step towards sustainable air travel.</p>

          <p>The death toll from a major explosion at a port in southern Iran has risen to at least 25, with over 700 people injured, according to Iranian state news agency IRNA. The explosion, which occurred on Saturday, caused extensive damage and prompted the closure of schools and offices due to chemical air pollution. While the cause is still under investigation, initial reports suggest flammable chemicals stored at the port may have been involved, with some speculation of sodium perchlorate, a missile fuel component. Despite the damage, some port operations have resumed, but the incident underscores concerns about safety and storage practices.</p>
