          <p>California is facing a confluence of economic, political, social, and environmental challenges that are testing its resilience. The state is grappling with a $1 billion budget shortfall in Los Angeles, homelessness, and the aftermath of wildfires that destroyed thousands of homes. The state's population may decline, and young people are moving away due to housing shortages, leaving behind an aging population. The state is also facing an adversarial relationship with the Trump administration, which is unlikely to provide federal assistance, creating uncertainty for the state's future. Despite these challenges, some leaders remain optimistic, citing California's history of overcoming disasters and its abundant resources.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its intention to release Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American hostage, in an effort to advance ceasefire negotiations in Gaza.

The Israeli prime minister's office acknowledged being informed by the US of Hamas's intention, viewing it as a gesture that could lead to further hostage negotiations.

          <p>President Trump is urging Ukraine to accept a Russian proposal for direct talks rather than insist on a cease-fire first, which is a departure from the plan laid out by European leaders. Ukrainian President Zelensky responded cautiously, reiterating the need for a halt in fighting but also expressing willingness to personally attend negotiations in Turkey. This flurry of diplomatic activity follows Russia's rejection of a cease-fire deadline and its counteroffer for direct talks. While European leaders emphasize the need for a cease-fire before negotiations, Trump supports the Russian offer, aiming to determine the possibility of a deal and align with Russia on the conflict.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States has made “substantial progress” in trade talks with China after meetings in Geneva, with further details expected on Monday. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested that a "deal" had been reached to address national security concerns related to China's trade practices, though it remains unclear whether tariffs will be reduced. He Lifeng, China’s vice premier for economic policy, described the talks as “candid, in-depth and constructive.” The talks aimed to ease tensions after Mr. Trump initiated a trade war by increasing tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget, including the Special Education Simplified Funding Program, could significantly impact the education of students with disabilities by limiting federal oversight and providing states with greater flexibility. Parents of students with disabilities fear that this shift could lead to reduced enforcement of minimum standards and unequal access to educational opportunities. The story highlights the case of Adaline, an 8-year-old with Down syndrome, whose experience in a segregated classroom underscores the potential consequences of reduced federal oversight. The author contrasts Adaline's experience with her own daughter's, emphasizing the disparities that could become more common under Trump's proposed changes.</p>

Concerns include skyrocketing prices of strollers and car seats due to tariffs, cuts to safe infant sleep campaigns, and measles outbreaks linked to undermined vaccine trust.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that sleep is important for memory processing and helps us process not just past memories, but also future ones. The study highlights two parallel processes unfolding in post-learning slumber: engram cells that initially encoded a memory show predictable reactivation patterns, and "engram-to-be cells," which grow increasingly synchronized and later encode new memories. The researchers also developed a neural network model to simulate activity in the hippocampus, pointing to synaptic depression and scaling as likely important for organizing these engram-to-be cells. These findings add to the existing evidence that we should all take sleep seriously.</p>
