          <p>Hamas announced its agreement to crucial elements of President Trump's Gaza ceasefire proposal, including the release of all hostages, while suggesting other details require negotiation. A U.S. official viewed Hamas's response positively, despite remaining points to resolve, such as weapon decommissioning. This development follows Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's earlier acceptance and a presidential ultimatum, with Trump now urging Israel to halt Gaza bombings for safe hostage retrieval. The article highlights the complex path ahead for a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll reveals widespread American apprehension regarding political violence, with an overwhelming majority deeming it unacceptable across all political affiliations. Despite this consensus, a majority also anticipate an increase in political violence in the coming years. The poll highlights growing pessimism about political unity, contrasting with generally positive views on interpersonal relations, suggesting politics is a divisive force. Fewer than half of Americans feel comfortable expressing political views publicly, fearing negative repercussions like insults or employment issues.</p>

          <p>Sophie Roske, who pleaded guilty to attempting to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022, was sentenced to eight years and one month in jail. The U.S. District Judge acknowledged Roske's mental health issues and remorse, but emphasized the gravity of the "incredibly serious" conduct. The Justice Department, which had sought a 30-year sentence, plans to appeal, calling the term "woefully insufficient." Roske apologized to Kavanaugh and his family, admitting her actions were "selfish and misguided" and contributed to fear among judges.</p>

          <p>A new seven-figure ad in Virginia's gubernatorial race, produced by the American Principles Project, is drawing comparisons to the controversial 1988 "Willie Horton" spot. The ad attacks Democrat Abigail Spanberger over transgender policies, linking her stance to a sex offender who exposed himself in girls' locker rooms. Early voting in Virginia is at a record pace, making the ad's impact significant in framing Spanberger as prioritizing "radical ideology" over safety. Spanberger's campaign defends her record, emphasizing her commitment to child safety and focusing on economic issues.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers and officials are demanding an audit of Los Angeles County's $4 billion sexual assault settlement and a State Bar investigation into Downtown LA Law Group.

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled for a second time, allowing the Trump administration to cancel Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans previously granted under the Biden administration. This decision, granted via an emergency appeal, sets aside lower court rulings that had blocked the termination of protections. Advocates warn that this move could lead to job losses, detentions, and deportations to an unsafe country. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, criticizing the "grave misuse of our emergency docket" and the impact on lives.</p>

          <h2>Treasury Considers Minting $1 Coin Featuring President Trump for U.S. 250th Anniversary</h2>

          <p>The Treasury Department is considering minting a $1 coin featuring President Donald Trump's likeness on both sides to commemorate the United States' 250th anniversary. Initial drafts depict Trump's profile on one side and a defiant image with the words "FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT" on the other, referencing an assassination attempt. U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach confirmed the drafts, linking them to the nation's enduring spirit. However, federal law typically prohibits depicting living presidents on circulating collectible coins, raising questions about the legality and tradition of this proposed design.</p>

          <p>The Trump Justice Department is reportedly dismissing experienced counterterrorism prosecutors and experts, allegedly for political reasons, raising alarms about national security. Michael Ben’Ary, head of national security at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, was ousted based on a false accusation, while George Toscas, a seasoned anti-terrorist attorney, was sidelined. Critics argue these removals jeopardize national security by stripping the department of critical expertise. This article highlights concerns that political interference is undermining the integrity and effectiveness of the Justice Department's counterterrorism efforts.</p>

          <p>During the government shutdown, President Trump has elevated Russ Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget and a key figure behind Project 2025, as his enforcer for budget cuts. Trump, who previously distanced himself from the conservative blueprint, now uses the shutdown as an "unprecedented opportunity" to slash "Democrat agencies." Vought is tasked with implementing deep and potentially durable cuts, having already announced the suspension of major infrastructure and clean energy projects. This article highlights the administration's aggressive strategy to reduce government size and influence.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou maintains the immediate support of the club's hierarchy despite the team's six-match winless streak since his appointment. Owner Evangelos Marinakis has offered help, acknowledging the current difficulties. However, Sunday's match at Newcastle is seen as a crucial fixture for the under-pressure Australian coach, where the performance will be as important as the result. Postecoglou, who won the Europa League with Tottenham last season, remains confident in his ability to turn the club's fortunes around.</p>

          <p>Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim admits he cannot escape the consequences of his dire record and understands criticism from Old Trafford legends like Wayne Rooney. Amorim has won only 18 of 49 matches, with just nine Premier League victories, failing to secure consecutive wins. Despite senior sources indicating Sir Jim Ratcliffe's continued support, the upcoming match against Sunderland is crucial to quell speculation about his future. Amorim acknowledges the need for results to continue the "project" at the club, which has faced significant financial losses from missing European competitions.</p>
