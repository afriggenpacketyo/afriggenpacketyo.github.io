          <p>This article explores the multifaceted history of fountains, tracing their evolution from practical water sources in ancient Minoan and Roman civilizations to symbols of divine power and political prestige during the Renaissance and Baroque periods. It highlights how fountains, such as Rome's Trevi Fountain and the modern spectacles at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, have served as social hubs, religious icons, and artistic masterpieces. As climate change brings more intense heatwaves, cities are now adapting these historical features, using misting technologies to provide public cooling, demonstrating the fountain's enduring relevance and utility in contemporary urban life.</p>

          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart has opened its first physical store in Germany, located in Berlin, to sell its wildly popular Labubu toys. The plush monster figures, known for their toothy grins and pointed ears, have become a global phenomenon, partly due to a 'blind box' marketing strategy that adds an element of surprise for collectors. The toy's popularity has been amplified by social media trends and endorsements from celebrities like K-pop star Lisa of Blackpink. This expansion into the German market follows a massive surge in revenue for Pop Mart, driven significantly by the global demand for Labubu merchandise.</p>

          <p>An early morning shooting at a student housing complex on the University of New Mexico's Albuquerque campus has resulted in one fatality and one injury. Campus police confirmed the incident occurred at the Casas del Rio dormitory, prompting a shelter-in-place order and the closure of the central campus as a precautionary measure. The suspect remains at large, and authorities have not yet released the identities of the victims or confirmed if they were students. Multiple law enforcement agencies are involved in the ongoing investigation and search for the perpetrator responsible for the violence.</p>

          <p>At least seven children were killed and twenty others injured after a portion of a school's roof collapsed in Rajasthan, India. The tragic incident occurred during the morning assembly, trapping students aged eight to eleven under the debris. While local residents and authorities rushed to conduct rescue operations, the collapse has drawn attention to the state of the building's infrastructure, especially amid weeks of heavy monsoon rains. Although an official stated the building had not been flagged as unsafe, deadly structural failures are not uncommon in India during the monsoon season due to poor construction and lax safety code enforcement.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has acknowledged that the National Health Service (NHS) in England faces a challenging period as resident doctors commence a five-day strike over pay. The walkout began after negotiations between the government and the British Medical Association (BMA) failed to produce an agreement. While senior doctors are covering shifts to minimize disruption, the BMA has warned of staff being stretched too thin, though the NHS aims to keep non-urgent services running. The long-running dispute centers on the BMA's claim that resident doctor pay has fallen by a fifth since 2008 when accounting for inflation.</p>

          <p>A provision from the 2021 American Rescue Plan that made student loan forgiveness tax-free at the federal level is set to expire at the end of 2025. Without new legislation, borrowers who receive debt cancellation through income-driven repayment plans could face significant federal tax bills, as forgiven debt is typically treated as income by the IRS. For example, a borrower in the 22% tax bracket with an average forgiven balance of $57,000 could owe over $12,000 in taxes. Consumer advocates argue this policy unfairly replaces student debt with a burdensome tax debt for already struggling borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mental health experts highlight the challenges in diagnosing and treating depression in older adults, a condition often stigmatized or misattributed to the normal aging process. While symptoms like loneliness and lack of motivation are similar across age groups, older individuals may present with more physical, or somatic, symptoms that can be overlooked by both patients and doctors. Treatment is complicated by potential interactions between antidepressants and other medications for physical ailments. Researchers also note that older adults, especially those with suicidal thoughts or other health conditions, are frequently excluded from clinical trials, slowing progress in understanding and treating late-life depression.</p>

A financial advisor featured in the article comments on this, suggesting that modern freelancers and artists with unpredictable incomes should focus on building a system that absorbs volatility rather than relying on extreme rationing. The advisor recommends a 'bucketing strategy,' allocating percentages of income to essentials, savings, and other categories to manage financial fluctuations effectively.</p>

          <p>Ahead of President Trump's visit to his golf resort in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, local residents express a range of opinions about their famous neighbor. Some, like David Milne, whose property is now surrounded by the course, resent the development for altering the natural landscape and criticize how Trump treated homeowners who refused to sell. Other locals and activists plan protests, citing opposition to his political policies, which polls show are unpopular with a majority of Scots. However, the resort also has supporters who praise its positive economic impact and the world-class quality of the golf course, arguing that politics should be kept separate from the sport.</p>

          <p>British fashion chain River Island is facing a critical period as it awaits a court ruling on its restructuring plan, which includes closing 33 UK shops and seeking rent reductions for 71 others. The company attributes its financial difficulties to a shift toward online shopping and rising operational costs, leading to significant losses. Analysts note that intense competition from online giants like Shein and having an expensive portfolio of stores in less-trafficked areas have exacerbated its problems. The retailer's future now hinges on whether creditors and the High Court approve its proposed plan to stabilize the business. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has determined that a 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene 'Buzzy' Peltola Jr., the husband of then-Congresswoman Mary Peltola, was caused by overloading the aircraft. The report states the plane was nearly 120 pounds over its maximum gross weight due to a load of moose meat from a hunting trip. Additionally, an unapproved external load of moose antlers was strapped to the wing strut, which degraded the plane's performance and flight characteristics. These factors led to the pilot losing control of the aircraft shortly after takeoff, resulting in the fatal wreck.</p>

          <p>Doctors and humanitarian aid workers in Gaza are reporting a severe and worsening hunger crisis, with widespread malnutrition particularly affecting children. The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health stated that 113 people, including 81 children, have died from hunger since the war began. Aid organizations like Mercy Corps and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) are witnessing a surge in acute malnutrition cases, with some parents reportedly considering killing their children due to an inability to provide food. Despite having money, residents find markets empty or prices exorbitant, leading to a pervasive sense of hopelessness and dizziness from hunger across the population.</p>

          <p>The future of Gaza ceasefire and hostage-release talks is uncertain after both the U.S. and Israeli negotiating teams withdrew from discussions in Doha, Qatar. A U.S. envoy stated that Hamas's response to the latest proposal showed a 'lack of desire to reach a ceasefire,' while Israel's team left for further consultations. Hamas expressed surprise at the 'negative' remarks, claiming they were told negotiators would return. The stalled talks have centered on a U.S. proposal for a 60-day truce, with disagreements focused on aid distribution, Israeli troop withdrawal, and guarantees of a permanent end to the war.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has reduced its full-year financial forecast after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit.

In response to these challenges and robust competition, VW now expects its 2025 operating return on sales to be between 4% and 5%, down from a previous forecast of 5.5% to 6.5%, signaling significant headwinds for the European automotive giant.

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, to be the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, a move that enables her to serve in an acting capacity. The decision came after a federal court declined to extend her interim appointment and instead named her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the top post, sparking a leadership crisis. Attorney General Pam Bondi criticized the judges' move as 'rogue' and removed Grace from her deputy position. By pulling the formal nomination, the administration bypasses a federal law that would have restricted Habba from continuing to serve in an acting role.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision not to release additional files related to Jeffrey Epstein has created a significant rift among the president's online supporters, particularly in conspiratorial MAGA communities. For years, many of these supporters had demanded full transparency on the Epstein case, a call once echoed by Trump himself. Now, they are divided between defending the White House's reversal and expressing frustration and suspicion over the lack of disclosure. This internal conflict highlights a rare moment of discord within a typically unified base, as some prominent pro-Trump influencers continue to press for the files while others attempt to shift focus elsewhere.</p>
