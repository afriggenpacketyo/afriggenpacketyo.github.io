          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card business from Goldman Sachs. The move would solidify JPMorgan's position as the leading U.S. credit card issuer, while allowing Goldman Sachs to exit a challenging consumer finance venture. For Apple, partnering with JPMorgan would bring stability to the credit card program after a period of high growth and regulatory scrutiny under Goldman's management. Other initial contenders for the portfolio, including American Express and Barclays, are no longer in the running. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a deadly train derailment caused by a landslide after heavy rain, Germany is reassessing how to make its railway system more resilient to climate change. Deutsche Bahn is implementing plans to mitigate risks from flooding, fires, and extreme heat, which have increasingly disrupted service. Initiatives include building bridges without central pillars to better withstand floods, using AI to monitor trees at risk of falling, and testing new technologies to cool tracks and switches. These efforts aim to enhance safety and reliability as extreme weather becomes more frequent.</p>

          <p>The House Homeland Security Committee recently held a closed-door meeting to address the significant increase in antisemitic violence across the United States. Lawmakers, law enforcement, and community organizations discussed improving intelligence sharing and coordination between federal and local agencies to prevent attacks. The discussion highlighted concerns over extremist rhetoric on college campuses and social media, as well as the political rise of figures with anti-Israel viewpoints. According to the Anti-Defamation League, antisemitic incidents reached a record high in 2024, prompting calls for more robust legislative action.</p>

          <p>Spotify's stock fell significantly after the company reported a net loss for the second quarter and provided a weaker-than-expected forecast for the upcoming period. The music streaming service missed revenue expectations, citing higher personnel and marketing costs as contributing factors. CEO Daniel Ek expressed dissatisfaction with the performance of the company's advertising business, calling it an "execution challenge" but remaining confident in the long-term strategy. Despite the financial results, Spotify saw continued growth in its monthly active users and premium subscribers, reaching 696 million and 276 million respectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, now projecting 3.0% for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026.

The IMF noted a surge in U.S. imports as businesses engaged in "front-loading" to get ahead of anticipated higher taxes. However, the organization cautioned that the potential for new tariffs and increased global uncertainty could still lead to weaker economic activity in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>DNA Analysis Suggests Female-Centered Society in 9,000-Year-Old Turkish Settlement</h2>

          <p>New research from the ancient settlement of Catalhoyuk in Turkey provides strong evidence that its society was organized around women 9,000 years ago. An international team of geneticists analyzed DNA from skeletons buried under homes and found that inhabitants were often related through their mother's side. This suggests a matrilocal system, where men moved in with the woman's family. The findings, which also showed female graves contained significantly more goods than male ones, support long-held archaeological theories about the elevated status of women in one of the world's oldest cities.</p>

          <p>PayPal's stock declined over 8% despite reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates. The negative reaction was driven by slowing growth in "transaction margin dollars," a crucial indicator of the company's profitability from its core operations. While total payment volume and active accounts saw modest increases, investors were concerned by the sequential slowdown in margin growth, rising operating expenses, and a significant drop in free cash flow. The company did raise its full-year earnings forecast, but the immediate results overshadowed the positive outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is now home to over 3,600 wild tigers, accounting for about 75% of the global population, but conservationists warn that significant risks remain. The primary threat is habitat fragmentation caused by deforestation, agriculture, and infrastructure projects, which isolates tiger populations and affects their movement and breeding. In some reserves, this has led to an unhealthy male-to-female ratio, increasing conflict. While modern monitoring techniques have aided conservation, experts stress that protecting the quality of ecosystems, not just the number of animals, is crucial for the long-term survival of the species.</p>

          <p>A new United Nations report indicates that hunger is more prevalent in Africa today than it was two decades ago, with over 300 million people on the continent being chronically undernourished in 2024. The report projects that by 2030, Africa will account for nearly 60% of the world's hungry population. This escalating food insecurity is driven by a combination of conflict, climate change, high inflation, and population growth outpacing productivity gains. The UN warns that the high cost of a healthy diet is rising across Africa, exacerbating malnutrition and undermining stability.</p>

          <p>The leading international authority on food crises has issued a stark alert, stating that the "worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip." While short of a formal famine declaration, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) reports that thresholds for extreme food lack and acute malnutrition have already been met in parts of Gaza. The IPC warns of "widespread death" without an immediate halt to hostilities and the allowance of large-scale, unimpeded humanitarian aid. The alert follows months of war, blockades, and the collapse of essential services.</p>

He suggests that China needs to correct this mindset to avoid further weighing down its economy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A researcher who has studied hundreds of companies shifting to a four-day, 32-hour workweek has identified three key strategies for a successful transition. The first involves improving productivity by shortening or eliminating meetings and protecting focused work time. The second is re-engineering work processes to be more efficient, particularly in non-office environments like manufacturing. Finally, successful companies eliminate low-impact work by questioning the value of long-standing tasks and projects. These experiments have shown overwhelmingly positive results, including reduced employee burnout and increased company profits.</p>
