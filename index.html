          <h2>UK Report Reveals Widespread Failures in Addressing Antisemitism Across Public Sectors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 05:07:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report commissioned by the Board of Deputies of British Jews has found significant failures to address anti-Jewish discrimination within the UK's public institutions, including the NHS, education, and policing. Co-authored by Lord John Mann, the government's antisemitism adviser, the review highlights a surge in antisemitism since October 7, with Jewish people feeling ostracized at work and uneasy using public services. The report offers ten key recommendations focused on education and training, such as creating a formal qualification for antisemitism instructors and ensuring Judaism is recognized as both an ethnicity and a religion to combat discrimination more effectively.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive BBC interview, Donald Trump stated he is "disappointed in him, but I'm not done with him" when asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin. This comment came hours after Trump announced new weapons for Ukraine and threatened severe tariffs if a ceasefire is not reached. He expressed frustration that diplomatic conversations with Putin often precede new Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities, making the dialogue feel meaningless. The interview also touched on his support for NATO, his views on the UK's handling of Brexit, and his domestic agenda, framing his presidency as an effort to save America.</p>

          <p>Fauja Singh, celebrated as the world's oldest marathon runner, has died at the age of 114 after a hit-and-run incident in his birth village in Punjab, India. Singh gained international fame in 2011 when he became the first centenarian to complete a full marathon, though Guinness World Records did not officially recognize the feat due to a lack of a birth certificate from 1911. He began running in his late 80s to cope with grief and went on to set numerous age-category records, becoming an inspiration and a torchbearer for the 2012 London Olympics. Tributes have poured in, including from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Brentford has completed the signing of England midfielder Jordan Henderson on a two-year contract. The 35-year-old former Liverpool captain joins the team following his recent departure from Dutch club Ajax. Henderson's move marks his return to English football after brief stints abroad, first with Al-Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia and then with Ajax. With 84 caps for England, his extensive experience includes winning the Premier League and Champions League with Liverpool, and he was recently recalled to the national team under new manager Thomas Tuchel.</p>

          <p>An upcoming inflation report is set to test President Trump's economic policies, particularly his use of tariffs, as his administration and the Federal Reserve hold conflicting views on inflation risks. While the White House claims inflation is "dead," citing a recent cooling trend, the Fed forecasts a resurgence later this year, partly due to the tariff burden being passed to consumers. Economists anticipate the new data will show an annual inflation rate of 2.7% for June, an acceleration from the previous month but still below the rate when Trump took office. This disagreement highlights the ongoing tension between the administration's economic strategy and the central bank's more cautious outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump that eliminates federal tax incentives for wind and solar projects is expected to significantly drive up electricity costs across the United States. According to nonpartisan analysis, the policy shift will increase reliance on more expensive natural gas plants, with some Republican-led states like Oklahoma and Kentucky projected to see the sharpest rate hikes. The move has thrown the renewable energy industry into turmoil and is expected to slow the construction of new clean energy projects, which are crucial for meeting rising electricity demand from data centers and new factories.

          <p>In her new book, "The Dry Season," writer Melissa Febos recounts her decision to abstain from sex and dating for a year at age 35 to reset her relationship with intimacy. Following a devastating breakup, she found that withdrawing her energy from compulsive romantic pursuits allowed her to focus on herself, her friendships, and her creative work. Febos discovered that celibacy was not about lack but about redirecting her sensual capacity into other areas of life, such as nature and art. She credits this period of abstinence with enabling her to build the honest and profound connection she now shares with her wife.</p>

With eight children and another on the way, the Algers feel hospitals push unwanted interventions and cite Georgia's high maternal mortality rate as a reason for their skepticism. This trend is occurring as the Trump administration promotes pronatalist policies to encourage larger families, yet critics argue not enough is being done to ensure birth safety. Advocates point to a lack of licensed midwives in states like Georgia, which creates a gray market and limits safe, legal options for parents seeking alternatives to hospital births.</p>

EU officials complain about restricted market access and massive Chinese state subsidies that lead to the "dumping" of cheap goods like electric vehicles, threatening European industries. Another major point of contention is China's control over rare earth minerals, which are critical for the EU's tech and green sectors. With China having cut the summit from two days to one, prospects for a breakthrough appear slim, reflecting Beijing's perceived limited willingness to engage with European concerns.</p>

Officials are now taking steps to repatriate the family to Russia, as the children do not have passports and the situation has raised security concerns.</p>

          <p>Following her manslaughter conviction, it has been revealed that Constance Marten was a disciple at the controversial Synagogue Church of All Nations (Scoan) in Nigeria as a teenager. A fellow disciple told the BBC that the church, led by the late TB Joshua, was a "place of torture" and abuse, though there is no evidence Marten was personally subjected to it. The BBC's investigation into Joshua previously uncovered widespread allegations of sexual assault and violence. Messages from Marten years later show she was still processing her experience, which a friend believes contributed to her distrust of normal institutions and her subsequent tragic choices.</p>

          <p>The rescheduled Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) is now underway in Morocco, showcasing the continent's growing talent but also highlighting familiar problems that hinder its potential. While host nation Morocco is emerging as a powerhouse thanks to recent investment, the tournament faces issues like last-minute scheduling, smaller venues, and significant pay disparities. The prize money, while increased, is still far less than the men's equivalent and other women's continental tournaments. These challenges reflect a wider issue where many players lack full-time professional status and adequate financial compensation, despite the high level of competition.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition is facing instability after the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism party announced it was leaving the government. The departure is a protest against a contentious bill concerning military draft exemptions for their constituents, an issue that has long divided Israeli society and has intensified during the war in Gaza. While the exit does not immediately topple the government, it leaves Netanyahu with a slim majority, increasing his reliance on far-right partners who oppose any concessions in ceasefire negotiations with Hamas. This political shake-up comes at a pivotal moment in the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>The Port of Antwerp-Bruges has effectively become a massive parking lot for thousands of vehicles as European carmakers halt shipments to the United States to avoid President Trump's steep new tariffs. The port reported a nearly 16% drop in passenger car exports to the US in the first half of 2025, with a 31.5% fall for trucks and heavy equipment. This sudden disruption is an "instant shock" for the port, one of the world's largest car transport hubs. The buildup of vehicles highlights the immediate and tangible impact of the escalating trade tensions between the EU and the US.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report into the crash of Air India Flight 171, which killed 260 people, has fueled speculation while leaving key questions unanswered. The report notes that two fuel cut-off switches were moved shortly after takeoff, causing the engines to lose thrust, but does not provide a full cockpit voice transcript or context for the pilots' conversation. Aviation experts have criticized the report as "selective" and "disappointing," warning against premature conclusions like pilot suicide. The lack of complete information has intensified the mystery surrounding the tragedy, with a final report potentially taking more than a year to be published.</p>

          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will update the relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) curriculum to address contemporary issues. Students will be taught to recognize misogyny, the harms of AI-generated deepfakes, and unhealthy attitudes regarding consent, while also learning to identify positive male role models. The new guidance avoids strict age limits for topics, instead outlining what should be covered by the end of primary and secondary school. It also mandates that schools proactively engage with parents and allow them to view all curriculum materials, a move aimed at increasing transparency and parental involvement.</p>

          <p>The availability of Ireland winger Mack Hansen for the British and Irish Lions' first Test against Australia is in doubt due to a foot injury. Conflicting information has emerged from the Lions' coaching staff, creating confusion about his fitness. Assistant coach Richard Wigglesworth confirmed Hansen did not fully train on Tuesday, making him "a doubt" for Saturday's match. However, he also suggested that the 23-man squad has already been finalized, which seems to contradict the idea that Hansen could still prove his fitness.

With government debt nearing 100% of GDP, her upcoming Mansion House speech is being closely watched for signals on future fiscal policy, particularly potential tax changes. While the government has committed to the costly "triple lock" for pensions, it has limited its options by ruling out tax hikes on working people. This has left the Treasury hamstrung as it prepares for the Autumn Budget, with many in the financial sector fearing tax increases aimed at them. (not investment advice)</p>

The grants will apply to eligible cars costing up to £37,000 and are part of a £650 million, three-year plan to help phase out new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. While the government says this makes EVs cheaper to buy and run than ever, some critics and drivers argue that the primary barrier to adoption is not cost, but the lack of sufficient public charging infrastructure across the country.</p>
