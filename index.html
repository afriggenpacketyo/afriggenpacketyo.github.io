          <p>Yankees legend Derek Jeter gave the commencement speech at the University of Michigan, emphasizing the importance of persevering through failure. Jeter, who would have played baseball at Michigan had he not gone pro, shared his own experiences with failure in the minor leagues, where he made 56 errors in his first season. He highlighted that dealing with failure is essential for success and urged the graduates to view setbacks as speed bumps rather than roadblocks. Jeter's speech aimed to inspire the students as they prepare for their professional lives, reminding them that failure is a necessary part of the journey. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newly released audio reveals the moment air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport lost communications with planes under their control, causing tense moments and contributing to hundreds of delayed flights. A pilot arriving from New Orleans repeatedly asked, "Approach, are you there?" with no response for thirty seconds, highlighting the critical nature of uninterrupted communication. The incident, which occurred on April 28, has led to criticism of the airport's air traffic control operations and concerns about the aging technology used by the FAA.

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce a new law that would make climbing on Winston Churchill's statue in Parliament Square a criminal offense, punishable by up to three months in prison and a ¬£1,000 fine. The proposed law is part of the Crime and Policing Bill and aims to protect war memorials from desecration. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper emphasized the importance of treating Churchill's statue with respect, especially as the country celebrates VE Day. The statue has been a frequent target for demonstrators in recent years, prompting the need for increased protection.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's team lobbied officials in West Lake Hills, Texas, to keep details of his mansion and security operations private after neighbors complained about unpermitted construction. Emails revealed that Musk's employees requested a closed meeting, citing his work with the Trump administration as justification for exempting his property records from public records laws. The dispute involves a 16-foot fence and metal gate erected without proper permits, violating city ordinances. Despite the efforts, the city attorney ruled against a closed meeting, and Musk ultimately lost his appeal to keep the fence and gate on his property at a Zoning and Planning Commission meeting.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to eliminate the Energy Star program, a popular energy efficiency certification for home appliances, according to agency documents and an internal meeting recording. EPA managers announced that divisions overseeing climate change and energy efficiency, including the Energy Star program, would be eliminated as part of an agency reorganization. The Energy Star program, known for its recognizable blue label, has been credited with saving households and businesses billions of dollars in energy costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The decision is part of a broader restructuring that will also cut staffing to levels last seen during the Reagan administration.</p>

          <p>India launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir. The Indian defense ministry said the strikes were part of a "commitment" to hold those responsible for the April 22 attack which left 26 people dead "accountable". Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in last month's attack, has described the strikes as "unprovoked", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the "heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished".
