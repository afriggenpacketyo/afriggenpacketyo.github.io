          <p>The Supreme Court has sided with President Trump and congressional Republicans by reviving a lawsuit challenging California's emission standards, a move that favors the oil and gas industry. The court's decision allows fuel makers to sue over California's strict emissions standards, arguing that they exceed the state's authority under the Clean Air Act. This ruling follows actions by Trump and congressional Republicans to disapprove regulations that would have allowed California to enforce stricter "zero emissions" standards for vehicles.

The GOP-proposed "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP) could significantly increase monthly payments compared to the Biden administration's SAVE plan. Under the Republican proposals, there would be just two repayment plan choices for borrowers who take out loans after July 1, 2026, and the repayment timeline would stretch over three decades. This could push more borrowers into default and delay major life milestones.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has denied a request by the Justice Department and President Trump to delay oral arguments in Trump's appeal of the $83 million defamation case brought by E. Jean Carroll. Trump is appealing the 2024 verdict that ordered him to pay Carroll for defaming her in 2019, after she accused him of sexual assault. The court rejected Trump's attempt to have the government substitute for him as a party in the case, leading to his attorneys' request for a delay. Oral arguments will proceed as scheduled.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that Russians and Ukrainians are "one people" and that, in that sense, "all of Ukraine is ours," renewing concerns about Russia's territorial ambitions.

          <p>California is challenging the Trump administration's military deployment in Los Angeles after an appeals court handed Trump a procedural win. The appellate decision halted a temporary restraining order that had found Trump's deployment illegal. Despite the setback, California's attorneys are seeking a preliminary injunction to return control of the troops to Governor Newsom. The dispute centers on the legality of the deployment in response to protests over immigration raids, with Newsom arguing the troops inflame tensions and usurp local authority.</p>
