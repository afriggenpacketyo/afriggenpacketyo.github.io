Despite the victory and taking a 1-0 series lead, the Lions' performance in the latter part of the game left a sense of confusion rather than clear celebration.</p>

An earlier, more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the feared intense downpours. The threat comes after a recent heatwave left the ground dry and less able to absorb rainfall, increasing the risk of flooding.</p>

The article explores the legality of such an unprecedented action, the Fed's mandate for political independence, and the potential constitutional protections that might shield Powell from being fired.

          <p>Portuguese police are not treating the deaths of two British men from Ipswich as suspicious, believing they drowned accidentally in a hotel swimming pool in Albufeira. The men, King Edonmi, 29, and Mo Liasu, 27, died shortly after arriving for a holiday. Mr. Edonmi's sister stated that her brother, who she said did not drink, died while trying to save his best friend's life, dispelling speculative local reports.</p>

          <p>Two leading UK end-of-life charities, Marie Curie and Hospice UK, are calling for local councils to exempt people with a terminal diagnosis of less than 12 months to live from paying council tax. The campaign follows Manchester City Council's recent decision to become the first authority to implement such a scheme. Proponents argue the measure would provide crucial peace of mind and alleviate financial pressure for individuals facing a significant loss of income and increased costs during their final year.</p>

          <p>This opinion column uses recent proposals in Europe to eliminate national holidays for economic reasons as a jumping-off point to discuss the U.S. holiday calendar. The author argues against President Trump's suggestion of cutting Juneteenth, highlighting the holiday's economic and historical significance in marking the end of slavery. Instead, the author proposes that if a U.S. holiday were to be eliminated, a more suitable candidate would be Thanksgiving, due to its problematic historical origins.</p>

          <p>After years of effort to reintroduce the California red-legged frog to its native habitat, scientists have confirmed the species is successfully breeding for the first time in 25 years. The breakthrough came from using a custom AI model to analyze thousands of hours of audio recordings from relocation sites, which detected the frogs' distinct mating calls. This success story, involving cross-border cooperation with Mexico, highlights how new technology can aid conservationists in the fight against extinction.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that Democrats are failing to win back working-class voters by focusing too heavily on "defense of democracy" and other issues that appeal to their college-educated base. The author argues that non-college voters prioritize economic concerns like inflation and are alienated by the current Democratic messaging. To succeed, Democrats should pivot to kitchen-table issues, highlighting how Trump's policies hurt small businesses and benefit billionaires, and frame his foreign policy as weakening America.</p>

A coalition of Republican lawmakers and animal rights advocates argues the cull is inhumane, expensive, and unworkable.
