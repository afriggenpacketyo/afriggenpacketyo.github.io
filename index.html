          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has confirmed that team captain Marc Guehi will be leaving the club next year. The 25-year-old England defender has declined a new contract offer, signaling his intention to seek a new opportunity when his current deal expires at the end of the season. This development means Crystal Palace faces the decision of either selling Guehi during the January transfer window to receive a fee or allowing him to leave as a free agent next summer. Glasner acknowledged the player's decision as a normal part of professional football.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Ministry has announced that the country is no longer constrained by the restrictions imposed by the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the landmark nuclear deal has officially expired. This agreement had previously capped Iran's nuclear activities, including uranium enrichment and stockpiles, in exchange for relief from international sanctions. The United States withdrew from the deal in 2018 under President Trump, and subsequent efforts to revive it have stalled, leading to increased geopolitical tensions and the recent reinstatement of some UN sanctions.</p>

          <p>Players from Spanish football clubs Oviedo and Espanyol conducted a brief on-field protest by refusing to play for the first 15 seconds of their match. The demonstration was a coordinated action to express discontent with La Liga's decision to schedule a regular season game between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami. The Spanish Footballers' Association (AFE) organized the symbolic protest, citing a lack of transparency and dialogue from the league regarding the controversial move. This action highlights the growing tension between players and league officials over the international expansion of domestic competitions.</p>

          <p>Organizers from pro-Palestine movements have announced their participation in the nationwide 'No Kings' protests, which are being held to demonstrate against President Donald Trump's administration. This article details how groups like 'UAW Labor for Palestine' are integrating their message of opposing Israeli policies into the broader protest's theme of fighting authoritarianism. The report also explores the complex network of nonprofit organizations and political action committees involved in the protests, some of which are allegedly funded by prominent donors like George Soros, raising questions about the intersection of activism, funding, and partisan politics.</p>

          <p>The first T20 match between England and New Zealand in Christchurch was called off due to persistent rain, preventing New Zealand from starting their run chase. Before the weather intervened, England had posted a score of 153-6, largely thanks to a resilient performance from all-rounder Sam Curran. Curran scored an unbeaten 49 runs from 35 balls, rescuing the team after they had fallen to 81-5 on a challenging pitch. The match was one of only six T20s England has scheduled before the upcoming T20 World Cup, making the washout a frustrating start to their preparations.</p>

          <p>Millions of demonstrators are expected to participate in the 'No Kings' movement's second major wave of protests across the United States. The movement, a network of progressive organizations, accuses President Trump of autocratic behavior and is organizing marches to oppose his administration's policies on immigration, education, and the environment. In response, some Republican leaders have criticized the event as unpatriotic, and the governors of Virginia and Texas have mobilized their states' National Guard units as a precautionary measure.

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to send federal forces to San Francisco to address crime has been met with widespread skepticism and condemnation from local residents and political leaders.

State and local officials, including State Senator Scott Wiener, have labeled the proposal as unnecessary and politically motivated retaliation. This article captures the sentiment on the ground, where the idea of troops policing city streets is seen as a move toward authoritarianism rather than a solution.</p>

          <p>Following a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump publicly called for an immediate end to the war, suggesting both sides should "stop where they are." This position implies that Ukraine should concede territory currently occupied by Russia in exchange for a ceasefire, a significant shift from previous statements supporting a full Ukrainian victory. The comments came after Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and as he expressed hesitation to supply Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles. Zelenskyy acknowledged the need to halt the conflict but sidestepped questions about ceding land.</p>

          <p>Johnathan Walton, a podcaster whose work was instrumental in the conviction of con artist Marianne Smyth, has voiced his disappointment with her four-year prison sentence. Smyth was convicted in Northern Ireland of defrauding mortgage clients of over $155,000, but Walton, who was a victim himself and detailed her extensive history of scams in his podcast, believes the punishment is too lenient for a serial fraudster. He argues that the court was unable to consider her broader pattern of deceit, including impersonating celebrities, and fears she will continue to harm others upon her release.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), has firmly rejected any cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), labeling them the party's "main opponent" in upcoming elections. This declaration comes amid calls from some within his own party to reconsider the so-called "firewall" against the AfD, given its growing popularity, particularly in eastern Germany. Merz argued that the AfD's ultimate goal is to destroy the CDU and criticized past policies under former chancellors for contributing to the far-right's rise.

His extraordinary two-way effort secured a 5-1 victory and a series sweep for the Dodgers, earning him the NLCS MVP award. The Dodgers will now have the opportunity to become the first team in 25 years to win back-to-back World Series titles.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has described the high tariffs imposed on Chinese goods as "not sustainable," even while defending them as a necessary response to Beijing's trade practices. His comments come as U.S. and Chinese officials prepare for a new round of trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating the economic conflict between the two superpowers. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng next week to continue discussions. The ongoing tensions have been exacerbated by China's recent export controls on rare-earth elements, a critical component in technology manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals promising results for the Galleri blood test, which can screen for more than 50 different types of cancer by detecting fragments of cancerous DNA in the bloodstream. In a trial involving 25,000 adults in North America, the test successfully identified cancer in 62% of positive cases, with over half of those detected at an early, more treatable stage. Crucially, the test found cancers for which no routine screening programs currently exist, such as ovarian, liver, and pancreatic cancer. The NHS is currently conducting a larger trial, with results expected next year to determine its future use.</p>

After suffering what she thought was a broken rib during a playful game, she went to the hospital for a check-up. A CT scan revealed no rib damage but discovered a large, previously undetected cancerous tumor on her kidney. Doctors were able to diagnose her with a rare form of kidney cancer at an early stage, and she underwent surgery to remove the kidney. Now cancer-free, she credits the accidental injury with leading to the timely and life-saving diagnosis.</p>
