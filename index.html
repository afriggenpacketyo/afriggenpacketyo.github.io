          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted on two counts, including making false statements and obstruction of justice, stemming from his 2020 Senate testimony. The charges allege he lied about authorizing an anonymous source related to the FBI's 2016 election investigation. President Trump, who fired Comey in 2017, celebrated the indictment on Truth Social, calling him "one of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to." Comey asserted his innocence in an Instagram video, stating there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump and expressing confidence in the federal judicial system. The indictment, signed by a recently appointed interim U.S. Attorney with ties to Trump, has raised concerns about political motivations within the Justice Department.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making false statements and obstruction of justice is seen as an escalation of President Trump's promise of political retribution. Critics, including legal experts, express concerns that Attorney General Pam Bondi is weaponizing the Justice Department to target Trump's rivals, with one law professor stating the firewall between the department and the White House has "completely collapsed." The timing follows Trump's public demands for prosecution of critics, and the appointment of a former Trump lawyer with no prosecutorial experience to lead the U.S. Attorney's office that brought the charges. The case is poised to reopen old wounds from the Russia investigation, with the prosecution viewed by some as vindictive and politically motivated.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical products imported into the U.S., effective October 1. This measure includes an exemption for companies that build drug manufacturing plants domestically, covering projects already under construction. The announcement is part of Trump's broader tariff policy aimed at boosting U.S. manufacturing, following a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceutical imports. While the tariffs are lower than previously floated rates, the industry has warned they could increase costs, deter investment, and disrupt the drug supply chain, ultimately putting patients at risk. This policy is the latest development in the administration's efforts to reshape trade and healthcare. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks, effective October 1, as part of his administration's broader push to boost domestic manufacturing. This measure is intended to protect U.S. manufacturers from "unfair outside competition" and address national security concerns. The decision comes alongside other new tariffs, including 100% on pharmaceutical drugs and 50% on kitchen cabinets, all set to begin on the same date. These actions stem from Section 232 investigations, which allow for tariffs on national security grounds. The administration's expanding tariff policy continues to reshape international trade relations and domestic industry incentives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has suggested he is prepared to step down from office once Russia’s war on Ukraine concludes, reiterating that his main focus remains achieving peace rather than securing another term. During an interview, he confirmed that Ukraine would hold elections during a ceasefire if such an agreement were reached with President Putin. Under current martial law, imposed since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, elections cannot be conducted. Zelenskyy's original five-year term, having begun in 2019, would have ended in May 2024 if the war had not started, highlighting the extraordinary circumstances of his extended leadership.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto has formed in the central tropical Atlantic, with forecasts indicating significant strengthening as it moves northwest over the coming days. The National Hurricane Center expects Humberto to reach hurricane status on Friday and become a major hurricane by the weekend. Currently, the storm is located northeast of the northern Leeward Islands, moving at approximately 6 mph with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. This marks the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, and while there are no coastal watches or warnings yet, authorities are also closely monitoring a second developing system in the northeast Caribbean.</p>

          <p>Less than three months after devastating floods killed 27 people at Camp Mystic in Texas, the camp's announcement to partially reopen in 2026 has drawn strong criticism from affected families. The parents of 8-year-old Cile Steward, who remains missing, called the decision "unthinkable" while recovery teams are still searching for their daughter. They argue the camp is prioritizing business over grieving families and accountability for the tragedy. Camp officials stated the reopening is for a separate site unaffected by floods and includes plans for a memorial, but families demand a halt to reopening discussions until Cile is found and the camp fully accounts for its role in the disaster.</p>

Ahead of a speech, Starmer is expected to announce plans for a compulsory UK-wide digital ID scheme as part of Labour's strategy.

The administration aims to boost domestic jobs and manufacturing through these protectionist measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. country music megastar Luke Combs observes a distinct appreciation for country music among British fans, noting their deep engagement with entire albums rather than just singles. Country music is now the fastest-growing genre in the UK, with three billion streams last year, attracting artists like Combs who have invested in touring there. Combs is in London for a historic one-off performance of the Grand Ole Opry at the Royal Albert Hall, marking its first time leaving the U.S. This event, featuring other major artists, sold out quickly, underscoring the genre's expanding global appeal and the unique listening culture of its UK audience.</p>

          <p>Blaine Milam was executed in Texas for the 2008 murder of his girlfriend's 13-month-old daughter, Amora Carson, who died from a brutal beating described by the couple as an "exorcism." Milam, who maintained his innocence and blamed his girlfriend, was pronounced dead after a lethal injection. The forensic pathologist testified to multiple skull fractures, broken bones, and bite marks on the child, indicating prolonged torture. This execution, one of two carried out in the U.S. on Thursday, highlights the horrific nature of the crime and the finality of capital punishment, even as questions about evidence like bite mark analysis persist.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto, the eighth named storm this season, is swirling north of the Caribbean and might interact with another developing system in the western Atlantic, potentially leading to a rare Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon involves two storms merging or orbiting each other, with the outcome depending on their relative strengths. While current forecasts don't predict Humberto making landfall, a collision could slightly alter its path. Forecasters are also monitoring the second system, expected to become Tropical Storm Imelda, which could strengthen towards the Bahamas, increasing risks of storm surge, wind, and rainfall in the southeastern U.S.</p>

The White House Office of Management and Budget had advised agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices for employees in discretionary programs. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move, accusing the Trump administration of weaponizing the threat to scare federal workers.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer highlighted a stark economic divide, with a robust segment driven by the artificial intelligence boom contrasting sharply with a weaker consumer-oriented portion needing interest rate cuts.

In contrast, foundational sectors like autos, housing, and retail are struggling to meet estimates, as evidenced by recent disappointing earnings from CarMax and KB Home, and Starbucks' plans for store closures and layoffs. Cramer suggests that while GDP growth appears strong, it's disproportionately fueled by tech, leaving much of the workforce unaffected. (not investment advice)</p>
