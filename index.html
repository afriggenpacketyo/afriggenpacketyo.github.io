          <h2>IPO Market Shows Signs of Thawing, Boosting Goldman Sachs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 06:17:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IPO market is showing signs of recovery after a sluggish period, marked by recent filings from Chime and a successful debut by eToro. This renewed activity is creating optimism for Goldman Sachs' investment banking segment, a core component of the firm's revenue. Goldman Sachs served as a lead underwriter for both Chime and eToro, positioning it to benefit from the potential resurgence in IPOs. Experts suggest that market stabilization, rather than continuous record highs, is crucial for a sustained rebound in IPO activity, and that pent-up demand could lead to a robust year if conditions remain favorable.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Appealing your property taxes can lead to significant savings, as many properties are over-assessed due to inaccuracies in their evaluations. The article suggests that homeowners should review their assessment records for errors, such as incorrect square footage or outdated roof age, and gather evidence to support their appeal. Comparing your property's assessment to similar homes in your neighborhood can also reveal disparities. The article also recommends exploring available tax exemptions for older residents, veterans, or low-income households, and being aware of appeal deadlines.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met in Istanbul for the first direct peace talks since the war began, though expectations for significant progress are low. Despite calls for a battlefield cease-fire as a precondition for talks, Russia refused, making the meeting itself a small victory for President Putin. President Zelenskyy initially questioned Russia's seriousness but agreed to send a delegation out of respect for President Trump and President Erdogan. The Trump administration expressed skepticism, stating that a breakthrough would likely require a meeting between Trump and Putin.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers initiated a strike after failing to reach an agreement on pay raises, leading to a complete shutdown of rail service and Metro-North's west of Hudson service. The strike is expected to affect over 300,000 daily commuters, prompting NJ Transit to suggest remote work and Governor Murphy to consider a state of emergency. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan with additional bus service on select routes, but it can only accommodate a fraction of the displaced train riders. Alternative transportation options include Amtrak, PATH, SEPTA, light rail, and ferry service.</p>

          <p>A federal judge will review the Trump administration's assertions of privilege to withhold details about the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia's attorneys accuse the administration of "stonewalling" court-ordered fact-finding. The Justice Department is invoking attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege, and executive privileges to protect information. The case involves Abrego Garcia's deportation to a prison in El Salvador, which the administration has claimed is a matter for the Salvadoran government to resolve.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Original Sin," explores Joe Biden's cognitive decline, suggesting it may have begun before he took office. The book, written by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios's Alex Thompson, draws on hundreds of interviews and presents a detailed account of Biden's struggles. The authors suggest that Biden's enablers understood his limitations but continued to support him. The article raises questions about whether Biden was capable of fulfilling the duties of president and the implications for American democracy.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the growing religious gender gap among Gen Z, with men becoming more religious and women less so. Data suggests that young women are leaving religious congregations due to conservative beliefs, while young men's religious identification and practice are rising. This trend is linked to political polarization, with young Christian women holding more liberal views than young Christian men. The divergence in religious and political beliefs may complicate future family life and social belonging.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the history and evolution of teen movies, from the early days of Mickey Rooney's Andy Hardy to modern superhero films. It notes the decline in traditional teen movies but argues that the genre has evolved into superhero and horror films aimed at teenage audiences.

          <p>The Trump administration's 25% tariff on imported cars has raised concerns about GM's future in South Korea. Unlike Hyundai and Kia, GM primarily produces budget SUVs in South Korea for the U.S. market, making it uniquely vulnerable to the tariffs. Experts suggest that the tariffs could make GM's operations in South Korea unsustainable, potentially leading to the company's departure. The union is pushing for measures to ensure GM's long-term commitment, including manufacturing electric vehicles in South Korea.</p>

Researchers are now exploring how these flamingo-inspired techniques could be applied to improve water filtration systems for humans.</p>

The decline in billionaires is attributed to factors such as the abolition of non-dom status and Trump's global tariffs.
