          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shooting that killed a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband and wounded another lawmaker and his wife, is in federal custody and expected to face federal charges. Boelter, who was arrested near his farm, is also expected to face state charges of murder and attempted murder. The attack targeted state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, with authorities finding a target list of dozens of Minnesota Democrats in Boelter's car. The officers who confronted Boelter are credited with preventing further shootings, but a motive remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>French authorities closed the stalls of five Israeli defense firms at the Paris Air Show, citing a ban on displaying "offensive weapons" amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The decision, which Israel condemned as "outrageous," heightened tensions at the aerospace industry event, already overshadowed by the recent Air India crash. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou defended the decision, stating that only defensive weapons were acceptable given France's concerns about Gaza. Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed shock at the closure, while the Israeli defense ministry called it a politically motivated move to exclude Israeli weapons that compete with French industries. The event also saw Airbus announce significant orders, while Boeing focused on supporting customers after the Air India crash.</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris closed unexpectedly due to a strike by its staff, who protested unmanageable crowds, understaffing, and untenable working conditions. The strike erupted during an internal meeting as gallery attendants, ticket agents, and security personnel refused to work. The Louvre has become a symbol of global overtourism, with 8.7 million visitors last year, and the disruption comes months after President Macron unveiled a plan to address infrastructure and overcrowding issues. Staff are demanding immediate relief from the pressure, citing limited rest areas, bathrooms, and heat exacerbated by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin dairy farmer is suing the Trump administration, alleging that it is illegally denying financial assistance to white farmers through programs that favor minorities. The lawsuit claims the government continues to implement diversity, equity, and inclusion programs that disadvantage white male farmers. The plaintiff, Adam Faust, alleges that he is subject to discriminatory race-based policies at the USDA, and the lawsuit names three USDA programs that put white men at a disadvantage, violating the Constitution’s guarantee of equal treatment.</p>
