          <p>Chicago experienced a rare dust storm, causing the skyline to disappear as winds of 60 to 70 mph swept through dry farmlands. The National Weather Service issued only its second dust storm warning for the Chicago office, leading to visibility dropping to zero in some areas. The dust storm forced drivers on Interstate 55 to pull over, and a ground stop was briefly implemented at Midway International Airport. Skies cleared within 30 to 45 minutes after the storm passed, leaving residents to reflect on the unusual event.</p>

          <p>Audio snippets from former President Joe Biden's 2023 interview with special counsel Robert Hur have surfaced, highlighting instances of memory lapses and a halting tone of voice. The recordings, obtained by Axios, reveal Biden struggling to recall dates and details, including the year of his son Beau's death and when President Trump was first elected. Hur's report, released in February 2024, described Biden as an "elderly man with a poor memory," influencing the decision not to pursue charges related to classified documents. The emergence of the audio has reignited concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities, particularly after a rocky debate against Trump.</p>

Republicans have long sought to make public a recording of the 2023 interview, arguing that it might offer evidence of a decline in Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s mental acuity.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts are causing anxiety among Americans who rely on the program for healthcare coverage. A Congressional Budget Office analysis estimates that these cuts could leave at least 8.6 million more people without health insurance by 2034. Individuals like Rosa Andresen, a caregiver for her disabled daughter, worry about losing essential benefits such as diapers and medication. Jodie Montplaisir, who overcame opioid use disorder with the help of Medicaid-funded treatment, fears that work requirements could hinder recovery efforts for others. Some Republicans argue that the cuts are aimed at eliminating fraud, but vulnerable Americans are concerned about the potential impact on their access to care.</p>

          <p>A teenage girl escaped from her home in Blackwood, New Jersey, after being held captive for seven years by her mother and stepfather. The girl, now 18, reported being locked in a dog crate, chained in a bathroom, and sexually abused by her stepfather. Prosecutors have filed charges against the parents, including assault, kidnapping, and sexual assault. The case has drawn comparisons to a similar incident in Connecticut, raising concerns about the regulation of home-schooling and the ability to conceal abuse behind closed doors.</p>

A research team has developed a small rocket named Tianxing-1, featuring lift-enhancing wings and adjustable tail fins for extended range and maneuverability. The Tianxing-1 operates similarly to hypersonic glide missiles but travels at a slower pace. This guided munition is designed to be launched from ground-based platforms and transition into a glide phase to engage targets.</p>
