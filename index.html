          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region experienced a downturn as investors reacted to ongoing diplomatic discussions involving the United States and Ukraine. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a slight increase, but indices in South Korea and Australia declined. Investors are cautiously awaiting further clarity from the White House talks and are also anticipating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech. The uncertainty follows a relatively flat performance in U.S. markets, where major benchmarks showed minimal change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Many residents in Southern Nevada, including senior citizens and veterans, are facing increased food insecurity due to rising grocery prices and changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Local food banks like Three Square are reporting a significant strain from rising demand, with child hunger in the region also on the rise. Recent policy changes passed by the Trump administration shift more of the SNAP program's costs to states, creating an uncertain future for those who rely on it. Volunteers and recipients at food pantries describe a difficult situation where asking for help has become a necessity for survival.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's decision to break from a summit with European leaders to call Russian President Vladimir Putin represents a significant betrayal of U.S. interests and support for Ukraine. The author contends that by shifting the focus to "land swaps," Trump is rewarding Putin's aggression and offering him a strategic victory without demanding a withdrawal. The article suggests that instead of leveraging U.S. power to support Ukraine's territorial integrity, Trump appears to be accommodating a dictator he admires. This move undermines European allies and the principles of international law.</p>

          <p>Jasveen Sangha, a key figure in the investigation into Matthew Perry's death, has agreed to plead guilty to five federal charges, including distributing the ketamine that led to the actor's fatal overdose. Sangha is one of five individuals, including doctors and Perry's assistant, charged with supplying the actor with the drug. Her Los Angeles home was described by prosecutors as a "drug-selling emporium," where a raid uncovered numerous vials of ketamine and other illicit substances. Sangha faces a maximum sentence of 65 years in prison for her role in the drug network.</p>

This move places two Trump administration appointees without prior FBI career experience in the bureau's second-highest leadership position, under Director Kash Patel.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's new artificial intelligence coding model, Qwen 3 Coder, has rapidly gained popularity, capturing over 20% of the usage share on the AI marketplace OpenRouter. This positions it as a major competitor to Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, which is widely considered the industry leader. The Qwen team attributes the model's high performance to expanded coding-related training data and advanced reinforcement learning techniques. The launch comes as the AI-assisted coding sector becomes increasingly competitive, with other Chinese tech giants like ByteDance and Tencent also releasing their own tools.</p>

With limited options for growth, local governments and enterprises are forced into excessive competition in the same few sectors.

          <p>An American Orthodox archbishop's recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska has drawn sharp condemnation from Ukrainian Orthodox bishops in the U.S. Archbishop Alexei of the Orthodox Church in America met with Putin following his summit with President Trump, exchanging warm greetings and gifts. The Ukrainian bishops denounced the gesture as a "betrayal of Christian witness," arguing that it lends legitimacy to a leader responsible for the invasion of Ukraine and the deaths of hundreds of thousands. The incident highlights the deep divisions within the Orthodox Christian community created by the ongoing war.</p>

          <h2>Trump Announces Plan to Ban Mail-In Ballots and Voting Machines via Executive Order</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 18:23:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to "lead a movement" to eliminate mail-in voting and certain voting machines before the 2026 midterm elections. He stated that an executive order is being drafted to bar states from using these methods, which he claimed, without evidence, are corrupt and inaccurate. Legal experts, however, assert that the president lacks the constitutional authority to regulate state-run elections, as that power resides with Congress. The move is seen by critics as an attempt to undermine confidence in the electoral process and represents a potential overreach of executive power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from inside a women's mental health center in Kabul reveals that many patients are effectively trapped, unable to leave due to family abandonment and the Taliban's restrictive societal rules. Many women, some of whom are victims of domestic violence, are deemed ready for discharge but have nowhere to go, as they cannot live independently and their families will not take them back. The facility is overcrowded, with a growing waiting list, reflecting a broader mental health crisis among Afghan women exacerbated by the severe crackdown on their rights. This leaves them in a state of indefinite confinement within the system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis examines the escalating federal presence in Washington, D.C., one week after President Trump's takeover, questioning the mission's unclear objectives and potential endgame. The deployment of National Guard troops from multiple Republican-led states and the arming of soldiers has created an atmosphere of intimidation rather than safety for many residents. The article argues that the stated justification of fighting crime is a pretext for an improvisational power grab. It raises concerns that this action in D.C. could serve as a precedent for similar federal interventions in other Democrat-run cities across the country.</p>

          <p>The California state legislature has approved a bill requiring that homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive interest earned on insurance payouts for homes damaged in natural disasters. Previously, lenders could deposit insurance funds into an escrow account and keep the accrued interest while homeowners waited for rebuilding funds to be released. The new law guarantees homeowners at least 2% simple interest on these funds. This commonsense reform, which now heads to the governor's desk, aims to provide additional financial support to residents struggling to recover and rebuild their lives after catastrophic events.</p>

          <p>Leeds United's 1-0 victory against Everton was decided by a contentious late penalty, sparking debate over the current handball rule in the Premier League. Everton defender James Tarkowski was penalized after a shot struck his arm, which was positioned close to his body. The referee's decision stood, leading to criticism from Everton's manager and players, who argued the action was not unnatural. Pundits were split on the call, highlighting ongoing confusion and frustration with the interpretation of the rule, which was intended to be relaxed to penalize fewer "harsh" handballs.</p>

          <p>Professor Malik Peiris, a renowned virologist who discovered the SARS coronavirus, has issued a stark warning that the emergence of another pandemic is "absolutely certain."

          <p>A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent discharged their firearm at a moving vehicle in Southern California after the driver sped away from an immigration stop. The Department of Homeland Security stated the agent fired in self-defense after the driver allegedly struck two agents, though video taken by a passenger does not show this. The driver, an undocumented immigrant of 23 years, later reported to local police that masked men had shot at him. Local police did not detain him, citing California's sanctuary laws, a decision the DHS criticized as shielding criminals.</p>

By breaking the legislature's quorum for weeks, they successfully killed the special session and raised national awareness about the gerrymandering plan. Governor Greg Abbott has already called another session to push the maps through, which are aimed at increasing the Republican majority in the U.S. House.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has publicly condemned Democrats in states like California for pursuing mid-decade redistricting, calling it a partisan "power grab." However, his statement notably ignores the similar, and preceding, effort by President Trump and Texas Republicans to redraw their state's maps to gain a partisan advantage. Johnson has previously avoided taking a position on the Texas plan, stating it is a state issue. This selective criticism highlights the politically charged nature of the national redistricting battle, where both parties are now considering gerrymandering to control the U.S. House.</p>

The Kremlin's vague language made no direct mention of a one-on-one summit between the two presidents.

          <p>General David Allvin, the U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff, has unexpectedly announced his intention to retire, effective around November 1. This move is surprising as he will have served only two years of the typical four-year term for the position. General Allvin did not provide a specific reason for his early retirement in his statement. His departure comes amid a series of leadership changes within the military under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has dismissed several other senior officials since taking office, though it is unclear if Allvin's retirement was requested.</p>
