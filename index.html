          <p>Iran launched over 100 drones towards Israel in retaliation for an overnight missile strike that reportedly killed senior Iranian military leaders. The Israeli Defense Forces confirmed the drone launch and stated they are working to intercept them. Rocket sirens were activated in northern Jordan as the country intercepted Iranian drones in its airspace. The Israeli attack targeted alleged nuclear enrichment facilities and occurred shortly before planned nuclear deal talks, marking the largest attack since the Iran-Iraq war.

          <p>Israel's attack on Iran triggered immediate economic repercussions, including a surge in oil prices and a shift towards safe-haven assets. Crude oil futures jumped by as much as 13%, with the Brent global benchmark hitting a five-month high. Both Israel and Iran closed their airspace, leading to flight cancellations and rerouting, which is a costly exercise for airlines. A protracted conflict could disrupt energy markets and trade routes, potentially leading to a global recession, especially amidst existing trade uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill also proposes changes to the earned income tax credit and puts children's eligibility for school meal programs at risk. (not investment advice)</p>
