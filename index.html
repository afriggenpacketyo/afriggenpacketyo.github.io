          <p>Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, a close associate of President Vladimir Putin, has asserted that a yuan-based payment system is fundamental for China to realize its vision of a new multipolar world order. Speaking in Beijing, Deripaska highlighted Chinese banks' cautious reliance on dollar assets, which he noted has frustrated Moscow's efforts to diminish U.S. dollar dominance. He further urged China to accelerate the expansion of its yuan-based debt market to bolster the international use of its currency in financial settlements, emphasizing its necessity for global trade. This strategic shift is seen as crucial for China's ascent as a global power.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread public support for organ donation, a significant gap persists between intent and actual donations, leaving over 100,000 people awaiting transplants in the U.S. This article explains that only a tiny fraction of deaths occur under the specific medical circumstances suitable for organ donation, often requiring continuous blood flow until surgical removal. Additionally, families can sometimes override registered donor wishes, and living donation faces considerable psychological and practical hurdles, including uncompensated financial costs for donors. Proposed legislation like the End Kidney Deaths Act, which would offer substantial tax credits, aims to effectively address these systemic barriers and dramatically increase life-saving transplants.</p>

          <p>Offshore wind developer Orsted received shareholder approval for a crucial 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue, following a recent profit warning. This financial lifeline comes amidst sustained political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who recently ordered an abrupt halt to the Revolution Wind project off the U.S. coast, despite it being 80% complete. Orsted has since initiated a lawsuit against the Trump administration to resume construction, underscoring the significant regulatory and political challenges facing large-scale renewable energy projects. Investors responded positively to the news, with shares seeing a modest increase despite the ongoing turmoil.</p>

          <p>European stock markets experienced gains on Friday as investors anticipated a key U.S. jobs report, which is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rate cuts.

This market movement also reflects broader sentiment that brightened after U.S. payrolls data boosted bets on a September Fed rate cut, indicating a "Goldilocks" scenario for the labor market.

          <p>The Trump administration is drawing criticism for its practice of assigning multiple, high-level roles to numerous officials, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio simultaneously holding four positions. Critics, including public service advocates, argue this "heavy-hatting" approach undermines government efficiency and effectiveness, comparing it to asking a single person to play multiple key roles in a sports team. The White House defends the strategy as fostering greater communication and collaboration, attributing it to President Trump's unique management style honed in family business.</p>

          <p>Etsy sellers, especially those in Canada, are facing significant financial challenges due to the U.S. administration's abrupt end to the de minimis tariff exemption. This policy change, which previously waived duties on shipments under $800, now subjects all imports to tariffs, creating substantial paperwork and increased costs for small businesses. Vendors are scrambling to navigate complex USMCA certification requirements, with many fearing for their livelihoods. This shift is expected to reshape international online shopping and could lead to higher prices for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

It explains agents' powers regarding warrants, identification, locations of arrest, and use of force, noting that many observed actions, while alarming, are often legally permissible. However, the article also highlights instances where practices, such as relying on perceived race for suspicion or deceptive entry, have been challenged in court, indicating an evolving legal landscape for immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order directing the Department of Defense to be known as the Department of War, aiming to "project strength and resolve." The name change, which would initially serve as a secondary title and require congressional approval, is expected to cost billions. Critics, including Democratic Senator Andy Kim, have called the idea "childish," arguing Americans want to prevent wars, not tout them. This move reflects Trump's desire to refocus the department on "warfighting" and a "warrior ethos."</p>

Concerns are raised about England's approach to one-day cricket, especially with World Cup qualification at risk, suggesting a need for players to gain experience in the format rather than being rushed.</p>
