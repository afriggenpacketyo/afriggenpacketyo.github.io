        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia announced quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with sales growth remaining above 50 percent. This performance is largely attributed to the sustained high demand for its data center chips, which are crucial for artificial intelligence infrastructure. Despite the positive results, the company's data center revenue fell slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter, and the company noted it sold no advanced H20 chips to China during the period. The report signals continued confidence in the AI market's expansion, with Nvidia's board also approving an additional $60 billion in share repurchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple has issued a warning to the United Kingdom, arguing that proposed "EU-style" technology regulations could harm both users and developers. The company claims that similar laws in the European Union have already caused delays for new features and that the UK risks the same outcome if it proceeds. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering rules to address the market dominance of Apple and Google, which the regulator believes will foster innovation. Apple contends these changes would undermine user privacy and security while forcing it to give away its technology to competitors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising vehicle prices and high interest rates, a financial analysis from Edmunds highlights several costly errors consumers make when buying a car. The report advises against purchasing a vehicle beyond one's means, particularly with long-term financing that can exceed 60 months. Other key mistakes include relying solely on dealership financing without securing a pre-approved loan, and trading in a vehicle with negative equity, which rolls existing debt into a new loan. The article also recommends working with a dealership's internet sales team for better pricing and considering certified pre-owned vehicles to avoid rapid depreciation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A shooter opened fire at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school mass, killing an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old and injuring 17 others, including 14 children. The suspect, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, fired a rifle through the church windows before later dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside. Authorities reported that Westman, a former student at the attached school, had legally purchased three firearms recently and had scheduled a video manifesto to be posted online during the attack. The incident has prompted widespread grief and calls for action from local and national officials.</p>

          <p>Two leaders of an Inland Empire religious sect, "His Way Spirit Led Assemblies," have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of two former members. The investigation began after Emilio Ghanem vanished in 2023, shortly after leaving the group and starting a competing business; another man associated with the group disappeared in 2017. During searches related to the case, police seized multiple illegal firearms, including automatic weapons and "ghost guns."

          <p>Country music artist Carly Pearce has revealed that she knew her marriage to fellow singer Michael Ray was a mistake from the very night they wed. In a podcast appearance, Pearce described the relationship as being driven more by "hot and heavy lust" than genuine love, admitting they lacked deep conversations and a connection to reality. She filed for divorce in 2020 after just eight months, stating that the marriage was not what she had "signed up for." Despite the difficult experience, Pearce says she is now in the happiest season of her life and credits the divorce with teaching her about her own strength and self-worth.</p>

          <p>Southern California is preparing for potential rainfall, thunderstorms, and hazardous surf conditions this week due to the remnants of Tropical Storm Juliette. The storm, currently weakening off the coast of Mexico, is expected to move north and bring increasing moisture to the region starting Wednesday night. While no major alerts have been issued, forecasters predict scattered showers and a chance of thunderstorms, particularly in the mountains of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. This moisture arrives after a significant heat wave, and the system is also expected to create dangerous rip currents along the coast through Friday.</p>

          <p>Universities across the United States are experiencing a significant decline in the number of new international students as the fall semester begins. This trend is attributed to recent Trump administration policies that have tightened the student visa process, leading to long delays and forcing many prospective students to defer or enroll in other countries like the U.K. Institutions such as the University at Buffalo are reporting drops of around 15%, which could have substantial economic consequences, as international students contribute billions to the U.S. economy. The administration has sent mixed signals, recently suggesting a desire to double the number of Chinese students while also revoking thousands of visas this year.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, savers are advised to take strategic steps now to maximize returns on certificates of deposit (CDs). Financial experts recommend shopping at online banks, which typically offer higher rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions due to lower overhead costs. It is also crucial for savers to accurately determine the amount they can afford to deposit to avoid early withdrawal penalties that can negate interest earnings. Finally, securing the longest-term CD that fits one's budget can lock in current higher rates, protecting funds from the effects of future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

Citing investigative reporting, the lawsuit claims Aymond and other officials knew about widespread abuse for years and failed to disclose it, constituting securities fraud.

HELOCs currently offer lower average interest rates compared to home equity loans, personal loans, and credit cards, making them one of the most affordable financing options. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates, the variable interest rates on HELOCs could become even cheaper for borrowers. Additionally, rising home equity levels across the country mean that homeowners have a larger pool of funds to draw from for significant expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has created a debate among liberals over the principle of central bank independence. While many view Trump's action as part of a broader authoritarian assault on democratic institutions, some progressives argue that the Fed's insulation from political oversight is itself undemocratic. This article explores the tension, noting that while an independent Fed can prevent politically motivated economic decisions, its structure may favor business interests over labor. The author concludes that Trump's move to subvert established law is procedurally anti-democratic, regardless of one's views on the ideal structure of the central bank.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that nearly six million full-time workers in the U.S. earned six-figure salaries in 2023 without holding a bachelor's degree. The analysis by Lending Tree, based on Census Bureau data, highlights numerous pathways to high earnings outside of traditional higher education. Occupations with a significant share of high earners without degrees include software developers, architectural and engineering managers, elevator installers, and power plant operators. The findings come as many question the return on investment of a costly four-year degree, and as a growing number of employers are loosening their formal education requirements for applicants.

          <p>A "48 Hours" report details the case of Dino Guglielmelli, a millionaire entrepreneur who was convicted of attempting to hire a hitman to murder his wife, Monica Olsen, during their contentious divorce. Guglielmelli asked his business associate, Rick Fuhrmann, to arrange the killing, but Fuhrmann instead went to the authorities, ultimately wearing a wire to record Guglielmelli confirming the plot. The recordings captured Guglielmelli agreeing to pay $80,000 and expressing that his children would be "totally fine" without their mother. Guglielmelli eventually accepted a plea deal for second-degree attempted murder and was sentenced to nine years in prison.</p>

          <p>The controversial immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, known as "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to be empty of detainees within days. This development follows a federal judge's recent order for the facility to be shut down due to environmental concerns raised by the Miccosukee Tribe and other groups. The tented camp, championed by Donald Trump for holding undocumented immigrants, has faced numerous lawsuits over harsh conditions and alleged human rights violations. Despite an appeal from Governor Ron DeSantis's administration, a state official confirmed the imminent removal of all individuals, signaling compliance with the court's directive to dismantle the site.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, has announced he will boycott a state banquet honoring U.S. President Donald Trump during his upcoming visit. Davey stated his refusal is a protest to "send a message" to President Trump regarding the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. He argued that Trump holds significant influence over Israel and other regional powers and could act to end the starvation and secure the release of hostages. While calling an invitation from the King an "honour," Davey believes the boycott is necessary to highlight the urgency of the situation and pressure leaders to act.</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old man was arrested in Dallas after allegedly threatening to have a bomb outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office. The suspect, Bratton Dean Wilkinson, reportedly approached security officers claiming to have a detonator on his wrist and a bomb in his backpack, prompting a shelter-in-place order for the facility. A bomb squad was dispatched, and Wilkinson was arrested on charges of making terroristic threats. The incident is part of a rising trend of threats and assaults against ICE personnel, which officials say have increased dramatically amid heightened political rhetoric surrounding immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair participated in a White House meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss strategies for post-war Gaza. While details of the meeting are scarce, a U.S. Middle East envoy described the development of a "very comprehensive plan" for the region after the conflict ends. The high-level discussion occurred as the Israeli military continued its operations in Gaza City, warning residents that an evacuation is "inevitable." The involvement of international figures like Blair suggests a concerted effort to shape the future governance and humanitarian response in the territory, even as the war continues with devastating consequences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's allegations of mortgage fraud against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, legal experts suggest that proving such a case can be exceptionally difficult. The accusation centers on owner-occupancy fraud, where a borrower claims a property as a primary residence to secure better loan terms or tax benefits. Experts note that prosecutors would need to establish not only that information was entered incorrectly on an application, but also that there was a specific intent to deceive the lender, as opposed to a simple mistake. This high bar for proof raises questions about the legal foundation of the administration's move to oust the Fed governor.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recent move to take control of the Washington D.C. police department represents a dangerous step in normalizing exceptional executive powers. The author draws parallels to historical authoritarian regimes, suggesting that such actions, while sometimes having a "thin patina of legality," erode democratic norms over time. The piece contends that using federal troops for domestic policing is a tactic of intimidation disguised as crime-fighting, potentially creating the very emergencies it claims to solve. The author warns this could set a precedent for using military forces to interfere in future elections under the pretext of maintaining order.</p>

          <p>The NFL has relaxed some of the restrictions placed on Tom Brady as he enters his second season as a broadcaster for Fox while also being a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders. Last year, the league prohibited Brady from attending pre-game production meetings with teams to avoid conflicts of interest. The NFL has now lifted that rule, although he must still attend the meetings remotely and is barred from team facilities for practices. This adjustment allows Brady more access for his analyst role, reflecting a revised balance between his duties as a media personality and his position within an NFL franchise's ownership group.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., has chosen not to return a felony indictment against a former Justice Department employee who was arrested for throwing a sandwich at a federal officer. The man, Sean Dunn, was charged with assaulting federal law enforcement after he allegedly threw a "submarine-style sandwich" at a Customs and Border Patrol officer during a confrontation. Dunn, who was subsequently fired from his paralegal position, admitted to the act upon his arrest. It remains unclear if prosecutors will pursue lesser misdemeanor charges, which would not require a grand jury's approval.</p>
