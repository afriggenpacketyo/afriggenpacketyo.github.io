        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have arrived in Illinois, sparking intense condemnation from Governor J.B. Pritzker, who labeled the deployment an "authoritarian march" by the Trump administration. Illinois and Chicago officials have filed a lawsuit to block the federalization and deployment, arguing it is illegal and unconstitutional, especially given Chicago's declining crime statistics. Attorney General Pam Bondi, however, defended the action as essential for protecting federal facilities, despite local officials insisting there is no emergency to justify such a move. This controversial deployment underscores a significant federal-state dispute over the use of military forces in domestic affairs and raises questions about the administration's motives.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones is facing significant criticism for his perceived lack of effort during the Jacksonville Jaguars' game-winning touchdown. With 30 seconds left, Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence executed a remarkable scramble to score, while Jones inexplicably ceased his pursuit of the play. This moment became a focal point for fan and media scrutiny, highlighting a perceived lapse in commitment that contributed to the Chiefs' disappointing 2-3 record this season. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes also openly lamented the team's persistent struggles with penalties and costly mistakes, emphasizing that such individual errors are proving decisive in a highly competitive league and require immediate improvement.</p>

He expressed optimism for resolving ongoing trade and technology disputes, yet underscored the critical need for American companies to access the most advanced chip technology. Huang warned that a complete ban on chip exports to China would ultimately harm U.S. firms in the long run, even though Nvidia's financial guidance currently excludes sales to the country. His remarks highlight the immense strategic importance of AI and the complex geopolitical landscape shaping technological leadership and global economic influence.</p>

The arrests, made in Hertfordshire on suspicion of computer misuse and blackmail, represent a significant advancement in the ongoing investigation. Authorities acknowledge the considerable concern and anxiety this incident has caused parents and carers, reaffirming their commitment to collaborating with partners to ensure those responsible are brought to justice and to mitigate any further impact.</p>

          <p>Professional tennis players are facing severe physical challenges due to extreme heat and humidity at the Shanghai Masters and Wuhan Open tournaments. With temperatures reaching 34C and 80% humidity, several athletes, including Holger Rune, Emma Raducanu, and Jelena Ostapenko, have experienced illness, dizziness, and debilitating cramps, with Ostapenko notably suffering heat stroke. Concerns are mounting over the ATP's lack of a specific heat rule, prompting players to openly question why essential health and safety limits are not consistently implemented. The grueling conditions are raising serious questions about player welfare and the need for stronger protective measures in demanding tournament environments.</p>

          <p>Billionaire tech investor Orlando Bravo, co-founder of Thoma Bravo, asserts that valuations for artificial intelligence companies are currently "at a bubble," drawing direct comparisons to the dot-com era. He cautions that it is unrealistic to value a company with only $50 million in annual recurring revenue at $10 billion, highlighting the immense managerial challenge required for such a company to produce the necessary free cash flow. A key difference from the dot-com collapse, however, is that today, large companies with robust balance sheets are actively financing these AI businesses. Despite the inflated numbers, Bravo acknowledges the transformative potential of the underlying technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock experienced a 3% dip following a report that raised concerns about the profitability of its cloud business, which heavily relies on Nvidia chips. The Information detailed that Oracle's Nvidia cloud segment achieved only 14% gross margins on $900 million in sales, a figure significantly lower than the company's overall 70% gross margin. This revelation casts doubt on Oracle's ambitious forecast of $144 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue by 2030, much of which is linked to expensive Nvidia chips and aggressive pricing for AI chip rentals. The article suggests that Oracle's strategic transformation into a major artificial intelligence cloud company may encounter substantial profitability challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

Air traffic controllers, classified as essential workers, are required to continue working without pay, which has reportedly led to a slight increase in sick calls.

President Trump's comments that back pay would "depend on who we're talking about" have intensified concerns.

Companies are increasingly bypassing traditional middlemen, such as pharmacy benefit managers, by establishing their own online pharmacies and discount programs. This strategic shift, also adopted by Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer, aims to simplify drug access and potentially reduce costs for patients, particularly those who are uninsured or have high-deductible health plans.

          <p>Despite the ongoing government shutdown, the S&P 500 has demonstrated resilience, returning 0.80% in its first week and even achieving several new highs. Historically, markets tend to remain largely unaffected by government shutdowns, with the S&P 500 notably spiking 36% in the year following the last shutdown in early 2019. Financial experts advise investors to temper their reactions to political headlines, emphasizing that markets are inherently forward-looking and that maintaining broad exposure through diverse investments often outperforms reactive trading. While not every post-shutdown period guarantees gains, historical data suggests that patience and a diversified portfolio have consistently rewarded long-term investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Andrew McMahon is launching the second leg of Jack's Mannequin's MFEO tour in Los Angeles, celebrating the 20th anniversary of his intensely personal debut album, "Everything In Transit." McMahon reflects on the album's raw breakup narrative and his subsequent battle with acute lymphocytic leukemia in 2005, which he now addresses with greater self-forgiveness and introspection. The tour, which also supports his Dear Jack Foundation, marks a significant healing journey for McMahon as he revisits his entire musical catalog, from Something Corporate to Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness. He is also actively exploring reimagined orchestral arrangements for older material, sketching out a future of continued musical experimentation and reinvention.</p>

          <p>Six former U.S. Surgeons General, who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations, have issued a rare and unprecedented joint public warning, asserting that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policy changes are "endangering the health of the nation." Their collective concerns include accelerated vaccine policy changes, significant cuts to mRNA vaccine research, a perceived shift from science to ideology, and plummeting morale within critical health agencies. They accuse Kennedy of consistently advancing "dangerous and discredited claims about vaccines" and failing to ground public healthcare policy in sound scientific evidence, citing recent measles outbreaks as a consequence. Psychiatric organizations have also publicly called for Kennedy's removal from his position.</p>

The helicopter had just departed UC Davis Medical Center en route to Redding when it experienced an "in-air emergency" shortly after 7 p.m. Miraculously, no vehicles on the busy freeway were involved in the crash, which occurred directly in the center of the roadway. First responders, with the crucial assistance of bystanders, managed to lift the aircraft off one trapped crew member. All three critically injured individuals—a pilot, a nurse, and a paramedic—are currently receiving treatment at UC Davis Medical Center, while the cause of the crash remains under investigation by federal agencies.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown continues, Republicans are facing increasing pressure to address Democratic demands regarding an extension of enhanced Obamacare tax credits. Senator Susan Collins is reportedly circulating a "discussion draft" of a proposal that would include GOP pledges on the Affordable Care Act subsidies, but she insists that negotiations on the issue occur only after the government reopens. Democrats, however, are largely refusing to vote for any funding legislation unless it codifies an immediate extension of these subsidies. This gridlock highlights the deep partisan divide, with Democrats fearing a loss of leverage if they reopen the government first, underscoring the high stakes of healthcare policy in the ongoing budget standoff.</p>

          <p>Many homeowners, despite having accumulated significant equity, may unexpectedly find their home equity loan applications denied due to surprising factors in the current evolving economic environment. Lenders have notably tightened debt-to-income (DTI) requirements, and lower-than-expected home appraisals can significantly reduce loan-to-value ratios. Other less obvious reasons for denial include possessing too much unused credit elsewhere, recent changes in employment status, or the property itself failing to meet specific underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, having recently applied for other forms of credit can signal increased financial risk to lenders. Homeowners are strongly advised to carefully review their entire financial picture before applying to avoid potential surprises and enhance their approval chances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A deadly tornado that tore across Enderlin, North Dakota, this summer has been officially upgraded to an EF-5, the strongest classification possible, marking it as the first such tornado on U.S. soil in 12 years. The powerful storm, with estimated winds exceeding 210 miles per hour, caused significant damage across a 12-mile path and tragically resulted in the deaths of three people. Meteorologists from the National Weather Service faced unique challenges in assessing its strength due to the unusual and severe damage inflicted on fully-loaded rail cars.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a comprehensive compensation scheme for car finance mis-selling, potentially leading to significant payouts from 14 million agreements made between April 2007 and November 2024. The scandal originated from undisclosed discretionary commission arrangements that incentivized car dealers to charge customers higher-than-necessary interest rates. The FCA estimates average payouts of £700 per mis-sold agreement, with the total redress expected to be around £8.2 billion, to be covered entirely by the industry. While a Supreme Court ruling narrowed the scope of eligible claims, the scheme aims for quick payouts for those who have already complained, with others to be contacted by lenders within six months.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding between traditional pretax and Roth 401(k) contributions for retirement savings, financial planner Cody Garrett advises individuals to consider their effective tax rate, rather than solely focusing on their marginal rate. Traditional contributions provide an upfront tax break, while Roth contributions are made after taxes but allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Garrett emphasizes that an individual's effective tax rate, calculated as taxes paid as a percentage of total income, can be substantially lower than their marginal rate. Understanding this crucial distinction is vital, as a potentially lower effective tax rate in retirement could make pretax contributions more advantageous, opening up future planning opportunities like Roth IRA conversions.
