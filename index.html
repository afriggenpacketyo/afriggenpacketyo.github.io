          <p>Epic Games and Disney have introduced an AI-powered Darth Vader character in Fortnite, utilizing Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model and ElevenLabs' Flash v2.5 model to generate real-time voice responses based on James Earl Jones' iconic portrayal. Players can interact with AI Vader via microphone, receiving answers and strategies, however, users swiftly discovered ways to manipulate the AI into uttering profanities, raising concerns about moderation and ethical AI use. The game's site states that audio and transcriptions from players are not stored and are solely used to prompt Darth Vader's responses, and Epic also says it does not use the players' interactions to train AI models. Fortnite provides a reporting feature for such incidents and requires parental permission for players under 13 to engage with the AI character.</p>

          <p>Three men, Mostafa Sepahvand, Farhad Javadi Manesh, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, have been charged under the National Security Act with targeting journalists working for Iran International, a London-based independent media organization critical of the Iranian regime. The men, who had been granted temporary leave to remain in the UK after claiming asylum, are accused of engaging in conduct likely to assist Iran's intelligence service and carrying out surveillance with the intention of inflicting serious violence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper emphasized the need to hold Iran accountable and strengthen national security powers. The investigation is being led by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command, and the three defendants have been remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on June 6.</p>

          <p>A series of music festivals scheduled for Brockwell Park in south London are in jeopardy after a High Court challenge by a resident, Rebekah Shaman, who argued that Lambeth Council lacked proper planning permission for the events. The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has warned that cancelling the festivals would be a "devastating blow" to the local economy and London's cultural identity. The judge found that Lambeth Council granted use of the park for nine days more than it was able to without seeking additional planning consent. Ms. Shaman expressed hope for an agreement that allows events to continue at a lower level and more connected to the community.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years on a reciprocal basis. While details are scarce, the scheme aims to facilitate travel and work opportunities for young people without reinstating full freedom of movement. The UK already has similar agreements with countries like Australia, and the government is considering the proposal, provided its red lines are respected. London Mayor Sadiq Khan supports the scheme, citing potential benefits for businesses in sectors such as hospitality and creative industries.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed plasma excitation technology that significantly improves the aerodynamic performance of high-altitude drones. Wind tunnel tests showed that plasma generated by high-voltage currents could boost an aircraft wingâ€™s lift-to-drag ratio by nearly 88 per cent, enhancing flight efficiency. This technology has the potential to extend the endurance of high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drones, allowing them to fly much longer than before. The research was conducted by the State Key Laboratory of Aerodynamics under the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre (CARDC).</p>

These agreements, negotiated face-to-face with Gulf leaders, involve AI chips, cloud computing, and cybersecurity, potentially bypassing Biden administration restrictions due to links with China. Elon Musk's presence highlighted his influence, with Starlink securing a maritime and aviation agreement in Saudi Arabia.

          <p>Sierra Prindle, a military veteran and runner, endured years of unexplained calf pain before being diagnosed with popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES), a rare condition where the popliteal artery is compressed. After an initial bypass surgery failed, Prindle found Dr. Sean Lyden at the Cleveland Clinic, who specializes in PAES treatment. Lyden performed a surgery to remove portions of Prindle's gastrocnemius and popliteus muscles, relieving the compression. The surgeries corrected Prindle's legs and have allowed her to return to a semblance of a normal life, and she hopes to run again and inspires others to push for answers when they know something is wrong.</p>

Deirdre Mulligan, an AI governance expert, characterized the incident as an "algorithmic breakdown" exposing the lack of neutrality in large language models.

Shamans, defined as specialists who engage with unseen realities, use altered states to provide healing and divination. The archetype of the shaman's journey, marked by trials and transformation, resonates with conspiracy theories that propose a hidden order of reality. While some neo-shamans embrace art and individual therapy, others are drawn to paranoid interpretations of the otherworld, highlighting the need for skilled guidance to navigate these divergent realities.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's suggestion of imposing a 100% tariff on foreign-produced movies sparked a debate about the state of the American film industry, and he was reportedly prompted by Jon Voight. While Trump later walked back the statement, it highlighted concerns about the shift of film production overseas due to tax incentives and cheaper labor. Industry unions expressed support for efforts to increase domestic production, and California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal tax credit to incentivize local filmmaking. The lack of consensus on the best course of action leaves room for Trump's emissaries to propose solutions, including tax incentives and cultural tests for subsidized projects.</p>

The Israeli Defense Forces have mobilized troops to seize "strategic areas" of the strip, while Hamas-run civil defense reports that Israeli attacks have killed around 250 people since Thursday. The Times of Israel reports that the IDF will take and control territory, move civilians to the south of the strip, attack Hamas and prevent it from taking control of aid supplies. Thousands of Israeli troops are expected to enter Gaza, and residents in northern and central Gaza have been told to evacuate, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation exacerbated by an aid blockade.</p>

          <p>A tornado has struck St. Louis, Missouri, resulting in at least five deaths and damaging over 5,000 buildings. The tornado caused significant destruction, tearing roofs off houses, uprooting trees, and downing power lines. Approximately 100,000 properties were left without power, and emergency services conducted house-by-house searches in the worst-affected areas. A curfew was imposed to prevent injuries and looting. The US National Weather Service reported multiple tornadoes in Missouri and Illinois, with severe weather conditions extending eastward towards the Atlantic coast.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that his negative comments about Taylor Swift have diminished her popularity, though it's unclear what prompted this statement. This follows Swift's endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris. A White House official said President Trump is highly qualified to comment on the rise and fall of various celebrities. Trump's remarks come after a tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE. Swift has previously endorsed Trump's opponents, including Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024.</p>

          <p>Japanese automakers are focusing on strong sales of popular, fuel-efficient models to offset the impact of additional U.S. tariffs on cars. Toyota and Honda project significant profit declines due to the tariffs and are hesitant to raise prices immediately, fearing customer attrition. Moving production to the United States is a long-term strategy, but automakers are reluctant without knowing the tariffs' duration. Nissan plans to boost sales of U.S.-manufactured models to cushion the tariff's effect. Despite challenges, Japanese automakers remain committed to the U.S. market due to strong demand for high-end vehicles.</p>

Dowd contrasts this with the Republican's acceptance of Trump's egregious assaults on the Constitution.

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board advocates for supporting Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, to counter the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). The AfD's popularity stems from voter frustration with immigration and the economy, and Merz's coalition government faces the challenge of addressing these issues. The editorial emphasizes the need for stricter immigration policies and economic revitalization to prevent voters from turning to extremism. Success for Merz and his government is seen as crucial for Germany and for the preservation of liberal democracy.</p>
