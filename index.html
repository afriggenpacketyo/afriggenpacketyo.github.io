            <p>China has announced retaliatory tariffs of 84% on U.S. goods in response to President Trump's latest tariff hike, which brought levies on Chinese goods to over 100%. This escalation of the trade war threatens to bring trade between the two economic superpowers to a standstill. Global equity markets have reacted negatively, with major indices entering bear market territory. The Chinese government's move signals a hardening stance against the U.S.'s trade policies and a willingness to engage in a prolonged economic conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump is considering imposing tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, potentially ending decades of low-cost global trade in medicines. This move follows a blanket 10% tariff on other imports as part of an effort to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. The U.S. imports vast quantities of finished medicines, particularly generics from India, without tariffs, so this change could significantly impact healthcare costs. The announcement has rattled buyers, especially those relying on Indian imports, which supply nearly half of all U.S. generics. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's tariffs provide China with a chance to position itself as a responsible global power. By defending the international order and multilateralism, China can capitalize on the diplomatic opening created by the U.S.'s protectionist policies. This could lead to more investment opportunities for Chinese state-owned enterprises and expanded markets for Chinese goods. However, China's ability to effectively leverage this opportunity remains to be seen, given existing tensions with some countries.</p>

            <p>Some prominent Trump supporters are expressing remorse over their decision to support him due to the economic chaos caused by his tariff policies. These individuals, ranging from investors to influencers, believed Trump would be restrained by traditional conservative ideas but now feel he has gone too far. They placed faith in figures like Elon Musk to temper Trump's policies but are now concerned that their own priorities are at risk. The situation highlights a potential fracturing of the right-wing coalition.</p>

            <p>The Secretary of Commerce is personally reviewing all NOAA contracts above $100,000, leading to backups and uncertainty within the agency responsible for weather forecasts and marine fisheries management. Several contracts have been paused or impacted, including maintenance for NOAA headquarters and contracts for translating emergency alerts. This unusual level of scrutiny is disrupting the agency's operations and raising concerns about the technical merit of contract decisions. The agency has also shed hundreds of employees due to the Trump administration's efforts to slash the size of the federal government.</p>

            <p>The British government is considering nationalizing the last plant in the UK that makes steel from raw materials, amidst increasing pressure from the global trade war. The Scunthorpe steel works, operated by British Steel, faces potential raw material shortages due to canceled orders from its Chinese owner. Lawmakers emphasize the need for a domestic steel industry to preserve economic independence. All options are on the table to keep the plant open, including nationalization.</p>

The government has offered support to fund a switch to electric arc furnaces, but the move has been rejected by the company. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The BBC addresses public concerns about the potential impact of global tariffs and stock market volatility on personal finances. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, potentially increasing costs for consumers. While pensions are long-term investments, market falls can impact those currently living off invested pensions. The Bank of England may cut interest rates to encourage spending and borrowing, potentially leading to lower mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to move forward with firing 16,000 probationary federal employees.

            <p>This article explains what tariffs are and why President Trump is using them. Tariffs are taxes on goods bought from other countries, typically a percentage of the product's value. Trump believes tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, but economists warn they could harm the world economy and raise prices for consumers. Trump's "reciprocal tariffs" are based on eliminating the US's goods trade deficit with each country.</p>
