          <p>China's economy experienced a significant slowdown in August, with key indicators like retail sales and industrial output falling below expectations, alongside a rise in urban unemployment. Fixed-asset investment expanded minimally, while real estate investment worsened considerably, contracting by 12.9% in the first eight months. The National Bureau of Statistics acknowledged "unstable and uncertain factors" externally and multiple domestic risks, indicating persistent weak domestic demand. Policy-driven state investment supported some sectors, but overall economic growth faces challenges. Beijing is urged to implement macro policies, stabilize employment and markets, and deepen reforms to foster steady economic development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has sharply criticized Ruben Amorim's management, asserting the team has "got worse" since his appointment ten months ago. Following a dismal 3-0 derby defeat to Manchester City, Rooney expressed difficulty seeing any progression or signs of future results. He highlighted United's historically low league finishes and Amorim's 36% win rate across all competitions, which is the worst for any permanent manager since World War Two. Rooney also questioned Amorim's rigid 3-4-3 system, particularly the deployment of two central midfielders, which he believes leaves the team consistently overrun and overpowered.</p>

          <p>The UK and US governments have announced a landmark partnership to significantly expand modular nuclear power in Britain, coinciding with Donald Trump's visit. This agreement will fast-track safety checks, halving licensing times to about two years. Commercial deals include Centrica partnering with US firm X-energy to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool, potentially creating 2,500 jobs. Other ventures involve Holtec, EDF Energy, and Tritax for data centers, and Last Energy with DP World for micro modular plants. The initiative aims to boost energy security, drive economic growth, and eliminate reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028.</p>

          <p>Nesrine Malik argues that Donald Trump's unpredictable foreign policy is fostering global instability and prompting allies to seek new alliances. Recent events, such as Israel's strike in Doha violating Qatari sovereignty and Trump's tariffs on India, have pushed countries like Qatar and India towards new partnerships, exemplified by a summit with China and Russia. The article suggests that while Trump acts as a "price-setter," his capriciousness is forcing rational actors to adjust to an "imperfect market." This perceived unreliability is accelerating a slow but significant geopolitical realignment, as traditional allies reassess their dependence on the US.</p>

Carney also faces increased scrutiny from returning opposition leader Pierre Poilievre, who is targeting the government on cost-of-living and immigration issues. An upcoming "austerity and investment" budget will require careful balancing of spending cuts with significant commitments, such as increased defense spending for NATO.</p>

          <p>The Atlanta Falcons secured their first win of the season by defeating the Minnesota Vikings 22-6 in a "Sunday Night Football" matchup, spoiling the Vikings' home opener. Rookie quarterback J.J. McCarthy, in his second NFL start, struggled significantly, completing only 11-of-21 passes for 158 yards with two interceptions and enduring six sacks. The Falcons' offense was powered by star running back Bijan Robinson, who impressively rushed for 143 yards on 22 carries, and kicker Parker Romo, who successfully converted all five of his field goal attempts, including a 54-yarder. The Vikings' offense failed to click consistently, leading to visible frustration among players on the sideline.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that foreign workers are "welcome" to the United States for a temporary period to share expertise, days after a large-scale immigration raid led to the arrest of 475 South Korean nationals in Georgia. The workers, employed at a Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery factory, were alleged to have overstayed their visas or held inappropriate permits. South Korea subsequently repatriated its citizens, with its president calling the raid "bewildering" and warning of potential deterrence to future investment. Trump's statement appears to be an attempt to reassure investors while maintaining a strict stance on immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>The percentage of "underwater" car trade-ins, where drivers owe more on their auto loans than their vehicles are worth, has reached a four-year high of 26.6% in the second quarter of 2025. The average negative equity stands at $6,754, posing a significant challenge for consumers seeking to buy new cars. Factors contributing to this trend include vehicle depreciation, longer loan terms, and smaller down payments. The article advises consumers to retain their current vehicles if possible, thoroughly research credit scores, seek pre-approvals from multiple lenders, and consider purchasing guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance to mitigate financial risks.

          <p>Tens of thousands of people gathered in Ankara to protest against a judicial crackdown on Turkey's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), ahead of a court ruling that could remove its leader, Ozgur Ozel. Ozel denounced the impending hearing as a "judicial coup" by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government, accusing it of seeking to govern through oppression rather than democratic means. The case challenges the legitimacy of Ozel's election as leader, following a year-long legal campaign against CHP members. Protesters chanted for Erdogan's resignation, highlighting widespread concerns about the state of democracy and justice in Turkey.</p>

          <p>Following the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Donald Trump asserted that "a lot of people that you would traditionally say are on the left" are "already under investigation." He explicitly declined to issue a call for national unity, choosing instead to attribute the country's profound divisions to "vicious and horrible" radicals on the political left. This statement reflects a continued strategy of divisive rhetoric, particularly in the wake of politically charged events. The article highlights Trump's consistent focus on blaming political opponents rather than seeking reconciliation, a stance that further intensifies the already polarized political landscape in the United States.</p>

          <p>Australia has approved a groundbreaking single-dose vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia, a disease that is a leading cause of death, blindness, and infertility for the iconic marsupials. Developed over a decade by researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast, the vaccine does not require a booster and offers multiple levels of protection: reducing infection, preventing disease progression, and in some cases, reversing existing symptoms. This approval by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is hailed as a world-first in fighting the devastating spread of the disease. The initiative marks a significant advancement in koala conservation efforts, offering a more effective alternative to antibiotics.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are entering the final two weeks of the regular season with significant playoff implications, particularly in their pursuit of a crucial first-round bye. Currently trailing the Philadelphia Phillies by 4.5 games, Dodgers President Andrew Friedman emphasizes the strategic advantage of a bye, which allows for player recovery and optimal pitching rotation, despite the team's past division series exits after byes. The article also highlights the San Diego Padres' close proximity in the NL West race, noting that winning the division could secure home-field advantage in the wild-card round. The upcoming series against the Phillies is therefore critical for their postseason positioning.</p>

          <p>Christian Brückner, the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann, has refused an interview request from the Metropolitan Police, ahead of his imminent release from prison for a separate sexual assault conviction. Despite never being charged in the McCann case, the 49-year-old German national remains a suspect for British police, who continue to treat it as a missing persons investigation. German authorities, however, suspect Brückner of murder. The article underscores the ongoing challenges in the high-profile, unsolved case, with Brückner denying involvement and legal system differences complicating the investigation.</p>

          <h2>US Farmers Maintain Loyalty to Trump Despite Economic Squeeze from Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US farmers are facing significant economic hardship, including a five-year high in small business bankruptcies, primarily due to President Trump's tariffs, particularly those imposed on China. Despite this financial pressure, many rural Americans, a key voting bloc, maintain strong loyalty to Trump, believing his policies will ultimately benefit them. Experts attribute this enduring support to a long-standing alignment between rural communities and the Republican party, coupled with political polarization that makes voters less likely to blame their chosen leader for economic woes. This article highlights the complex interplay of economic reality and deeply entrenched political identity.</p>
