          <p>The US Senate voted to revoke California's ability to set its own stricter air pollution standards for vehicles, a power the state has held for nearly 60 years under the Clean Air Act. This decision undermines California's plan to ban the sale of gasoline-powered cars by 2035 and stricter emissions standards for new diesel trucks and mandating the adoption of zero-emission trucks. Environmental groups and legal experts criticized the move, highlighting the importance of California's standards in protecting public health and achieving national emissions reduction targets. The Senate's use of the Congressional Review Act to overturn the EPA's waiver to California is also controversial, with some experts warning of potential long-term consequences for federal oversight. Automakers, however, support the Senate's action, arguing that the EV sales mandates were not achievable. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tax and spending package passed by House Republicans does not include an extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year. This omission is expected to significantly increase monthly premiums for individuals and families who purchase health insurance through the ACA marketplace. Experts note that without the extension, almost all subsidized ACA enrollees will face higher costs, potentially making health insurance less affordable. For instance, a family of four earning $85,000 could see an additional $313 in premiums each month and a $900 increase in their out-of-pocket maximum in 2026.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students. The ban, prompted by Secretary Kristi Noem's claims of "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators" at Harvard, would have affected over 7,000 current visa holders, including Princess Elisabeth of Belgium. Harvard filed a lawsuit arguing the revocation was a violation of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause. The judge agreed that Harvard would sustain immediate and irreparable injury if the ban were to be implemented. The lawsuit also alleges the ban is retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights.</p>

The 30-year Treasury yield fell by 4 basis points to 5.027%, while the 10-year Treasury yield dropped by 6 basis points to 4.497%. These moves came after a volatile week for bonds, initially driven by fears that Trump's budget bill would worsen the U.S. deficit, which was further compounded by Moody's downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating.

Democrats view the House as their best chance to quickly regain power, criticizing the Republican agenda's impact on healthcare for millions. The GOP's targeting of Medicaid has been seized upon by the left as a major campaign issue.

Charlotte May Lee, 21, from south London, denies knowing there were drugs in her suitcase and says she believes they were planted there. She was arrested at Colombo's Bandaranaike Airport on May 12, 2025. Ms Lee told Mail Online that she had been in Thailand's capital, Bangkok, prior to the flight, and packed her suitcase in her hotel room before heading out for the night, implying that someone planted the drugs then. She is being held in a prison north of the south Asian country's capital, Colombo, and is contact with her family, her lawyer told the BBC. She could face up to 25 years in prison if found guilty.</p>

          <p>Steven Pinker, a Harvard professor, argues that the intense criticism aimed at Harvard has become excessive and unfair. He acknowledges that Harvard has serious ailments, including erosion of academic freedom and lack of viewpoint diversity, but contends that it is not the "woke madrasa" or "anti-Semitic" institution that some critics claim. Pinker points out that Harvard has made significant contributions to society and that a more nuanced approach is needed to address its flaws. He criticizes the Trump administration's punitive actions against Harvard, including defunding research and barring international students, arguing that these measures are counterproductive and harmful.</p>

          <p>Two teenagers have pleaded guilty to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, a 14-year-old boy who was attacked with machetes on a bus in Woolwich, south-east London. Kelyan was stabbed 27 times as he travelled home on a route 472 bus on 7 January. The two boys, both aged 16, admitted to carrying a bladed weapon. The defendants knew in advance that Kelyan was likely to be on the bus when they boarded, and walked directly towards him, the court was told. Judge Mark Lucraft KC ordered reports ahead of sentencing, which is set to take place on Friday 25 July. Keylan was the first teenager to be killed by knife crime in London in 2025.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on Apple unless the company shifts iPhone manufacturing to the United States, disapproving of the company's decision to move part of its supply chain to India. Analysts suggest that a U.S.-bound relocation of Apple's supply chain is highly unlikely due to the time, expense, and higher labor costs. While final assembly in the U.S. is theoretically possible, it would take years and result in higher prices for consumers. Apple CEO Tim Cook noted the company already manufactures some components stateside and sources from over 9,000 suppliers in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large study has found that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue as ultrasound. The study, published in The Lancet, showed that contrast-enhanced mammography can find tumors that are much smaller than those found by regular mammography. M.R.I.s are better at detecting more tumors than standard mammograms, the study found, but are considerably more expensive. The scans were given to women with dense breast tissue who had already undergone mammograms that hadn’t turned up any abnormalities. Contrast-enhanced mammography is more cost-effective than M.R.I. scans, and they could be made more widely available at existing mammography centers with staff training and sometimes technology upgrades.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union being imported to the United States, beginning June 1. He also threatened to impose a 25% import tax "at least" on iPhones not manufactured in America. The EU is one of the US's largest trading partners, but Trump's complaints about Europe have focused on the uneven trade relationship. Since re-entering the White House, Trump has imposed and threatened various tariffs on goods from countries around the world, which he sees as a way of boosting US manufacturing and protecting jobs from foreign competition.

          <p>Homeowners insurance costs are rising sharply in states within Tornado Alley, primarily due to the increasing frequency and severity of hailstorms. While tornadoes pose a greater threat to life, hail causes more insured damage due to its wider area of impact, damaging roofs, windows, and siding. In Kentucky, premiums have increased by 35% in recent years, with similar increases seen in Nebraska, Arkansas, Minnesota, Texas, Colorado, and Iowa. Insurers are scaling back coverage on roofs and increasing rates to match the rising risk. Climate change's impact on tornadoes and hailstorms is an area of active research.</p>
