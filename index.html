          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Merck is implementing a major restructuring program to cut $3 billion in costs by the end of 2027. This strategic shift aims to reinvest savings into new product development and offset future revenue loss from the 2028 patent expiration of its cancer drug, Keytruda. The announcement came as the company reported second-quarter revenue below Wall Street expectations, partly due to a significant 55% drop in sales for its Gardasil vaccine in China. Merck also narrowed its full-year financial outlook, factoring in the impact of new U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republicans are pursuing a mid-decade redistricting strategy, primarily in states like Texas, to create more favorable congressional maps and secure their House majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The plan, encouraged by former President Trump, could yield up to five new GOP-leaning seats in Texas alone. In response, Democrats, led by California Governor Gavin Newsom, are threatening to undertake similar measures in states they control, like California and New York. This potential for retaliatory gerrymandering raises concerns among some Democrats about hypocrisy and the long-term erosion of trust in the political system.</p>

          <h2>MLB Umpire Faces Criticism for Egregious Missed Strike Call</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 06:51:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>MLB home plate umpire Brian Walsh has drawn significant criticism following a conspicuously incorrect call during a game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Toronto Blue Jays. Walsh called a pitch that was clearly in the middle of the strike zone a ball, leading to disbelief from players, announcers, and fans. This incident added to recent scrutiny of Walsh, who also made a controversial game-ending strike-three call in a recent Diamondbacks-Astros game. While the missed call did not affect the outcome of the Orioles' 11-4 victory, it has intensified the ongoing debate about umpiring accuracy in professional baseball.</p>

          <p>The suspect in the Midtown Manhattan shooting that killed four people reportedly carried a note claiming he suffered from CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and requested his brain be studied. Law enforcement sources indicated the three-page, rambling note also contained vague references to the NFL. The suspect, who had a history of mental health issues and played high school football, carried out the attack in a building that houses the NFL's headquarters. An NFL employee was also among the injured in the incident, which has now introduced a new dimension to the investigation regarding the shooter's potential motives.</p>

Intensified conflict and displacement have crippled local food production and aid distribution, despite a partial easing of Israel's blockade.

          <p>Major technology companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google are engaged in an intense and costly talent war to recruit the world's top artificial intelligence experts. With a significant shortage of qualified AI engineers, these tech giants are offering massive pay packages, sometimes reaching up to $100 million, to lure talent from startups and competitors. This trend is causing salary inflation and threatening the ability of smaller AI startups, like OpenAI, to retain their key employees. The aggressive hiring reflects Big Tech's fear of being left behind in the race for next-generation AI, even as the ultimate applications and returns on these massive investments remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>A significant policy conflict is emerging within the Trump administration between Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) initiative and the EPA's deregulatory actions. While Kennedy's HHS has identified environmental toxins like pesticides and PFAS chemicals as health risks, the EPA under Lee Zeldin has moved to relax regulations on these same substances. This contradiction is causing frustration among MAHA supporters, who are pressuring Kennedy to challenge the EPA's agenda. The conflict highlights a fundamental ideological divide between public health goals and the administration's pro-industry, anti-regulation stance, threatening to undermine Kennedy's key objectives.</p>

A local official reported that the criminal gang, known as bandits, had demanded a ransom for each captive and released 18 women and a boy after receiving payment. However, they then proceeded to slaughter the remaining hostages. This tragedy highlights the escalating kidnapping crisis in the region, where criminal gangs frequently abduct people for money, and a 2022 law criminalizing ransom payments has failed to curb the violence.</p>

          <p>Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has announced he will personally cover the educational expenses for 22 children who were orphaned during the May military conflict between India and Pakistan. The children are from the Poonch district in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, an area heavily affected by the cross-border shelling and drone attacks. Gandhi's Congress party stated he made the decision after visiting the region and meeting with bereaved families. This philanthropic gesture comes as he begins his role as the official leader of the opposition in India's lower house of parliament following recent elections.</p>

          <p>Indian authorities have announced that security forces killed three militants suspected of carrying out the deadly April attack on tourists in Pahalgam, India-administered Kashmir. Home Minister Amit Shah stated that the three men, identified as Pakistani nationals and members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, were killed in a gunfight in the Dachigam area. The April attack, which killed 26 people, sparked a severe four-day military conflict between India and Pakistan in May. Forensic evidence reportedly linked the rifles found on the militants to the weapons used in the initial tourist attack, confirming their involvement.</p>

Rebellions, formed from a merger with another startup, Sapeon, is positioned as a major domestic rival to Nvidia, focusing on chips for AI inferencing. The startup is collaborating with Samsung's foundry business to produce its next-generation chip, named Rebel. This strategic partnership could provide a significant boost to Samsung's chip manufacturing division as it seeks to compete with market leader TSMC. (not investment advice)</p>

In contrast, Hong Kong International Airport's traffic, while growing, remains below its 2019 peak.

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve holding its key short-term interest rate steady throughout 2025, consumer borrowing costs have seen minimal changes. Average credit card rates have hovered just above 20%, while auto loan rates have also remained largely flat. Mortgage rates, which are more influenced by 10-year Treasury yields, have fluctuated within a narrow band, showing that the Fed's direct benchmark doesn't always translate into immediate changes for all consumer loans. Experts note that even if the Fed were to cut rates, there is no guarantee it would lead to lower borrowing costs for most Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

The extreme weather has damaged infrastructure, disrupted power, and prompted President Xi Jinping to call for "all-out" rescue efforts. This event is part of a broader pattern of extreme weather across China this summer, which has included record heatwaves and other deadly floods. Authorities have allocated significant funds for recovery as rescue teams work to reach those stranded in the hardest-hit suburban districts.</p>

          <p>Hezbollah is facing unprecedented financial and political pressure, raising questions about the viability of its extensive shadow economy. Following a devastating war with Israel and the loss of key leaders, the Iran-backed group is now contending with a new Lebanese government cracking down on its illicit activities. Lebanon's central bank has banned dealings with a key Hezbollah-linked financial entity, and increased security at ports of entry is disrupting smuggling operations. While the group's deep-rooted cash-based system makes it resilient, analysts believe a combination of U.S. pressure and domestic reforms presents a critical window of opportunity to weaken its financial power.</p>

          <p>UK utility firm Anglian Water will pay £62.8 million after an investigation by the regulator Ofwat found a "serious breach" in its management of sewage works, leading to excessive spills from storm overflows. Instead of a direct fine, the company has agreed to invest £57 million in wastewater flow improvements and contribute £5.8 million to a community environmental fund. The action comes as water companies face intense criticism for underinvestment and hiking customer bills while paying out large dividends to shareholders. Anglian Water acknowledged its failures and the need to rebuild customer trust.</p>
