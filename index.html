        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has announced it will not defend a federal grant program for colleges with high Hispanic enrollment against a legal challenge, deeming it unconstitutional. Citing the 2023 Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action, the department argues the program provides an unfair advantage based on ethnicity. This decision follows a lawsuit from Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action group aiming to halt the program, which allocates hundreds of millions of dollars annually. A national association of Hispanic-serving universities has moved to intervene, expressing concern that the government would not adequately defend their interests.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from withholding federal grant funding from 34 cities and counties with 'sanctuary' policies. These policies limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement authorities. The ruling protects hundreds of millions of dollars in Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants that the administration sought to revoke. This decision marks a significant setback for the administration's ongoing efforts to compel local jurisdictions to assist in federal immigration enforcement, which has included multiple legal challenges against states and cities across the country.</p>

          <p>In newly released interview transcripts, Ghislaine Maxwell, the incarcerated associate of Jeffrey Epstein, stated she never witnessed inappropriate conduct by Donald Trump or Bill Clinton. Speaking from prison, Maxwell also claimed that a widely discussed Epstein "client list" does not exist and called allegations against Prince Andrew "inconceivable." The interview was conducted as Maxwell seeks a presidential pardon, though the White House has stated no leniency is being considered. The transcripts reveal her perspective on her relationships with Epstein, Prince Andrew, and other high-profile figures, while denying key allegations and conspiracy theories surrounding the case.</p>

Prosecutors allege she was the matriarch of a family plot to kill Markel, allowing her daughter to win a bitter custody battle and relocate with her children. Her son, Charlie Adelson, and three hired accomplices have already been convicted and are serving lengthy prison sentences. Key evidence against Donna Adelson includes her attempt to flee to Vietnam, a country without a U.S. extradition treaty, which prosecutors argue demonstrates a consciousness of guilt.</p>

          <p>Despite not being the newest or most powerful missiles in its arsenal, China's DF-31 series of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) remains a vital component of its nuclear deterrent strategy. These mobile, solid-fuel missiles provide the People's Liberation Army with a credible second-strike capability, able to reach the mainland United States. A recent full-range test, the first of its kind since 1980, demonstrated this capability and sent a significant geopolitical signal.

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption on Hawaii's Big Island, shooting lava fountains up to 100 feet into the air. This marks the 31st eruption episode since December, with the activity contained within the Halemaumau summit crater and posing no threat to homes. The eruption is caused by magma building up in a lower chamber and being forced to the surface through established vents. Scientists are closely monitoring the volcano, as the current pattern of episodic fountaining could either cease or evolve into a more continuous lava flow, similar to past eruption cycles.</p>

The proposal, which aims to create five new GOP-leaning districts, follows a request from President Trump to secure more Republican seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The bill's passage comes after House Democrats fled the state for weeks in an unsuccessful attempt to block the vote by denying a quorum.

Commissioners highlighted institutional misconduct, including Erik's involvement in fights and a tax-fraud scam, and both brothers' repeated violations for possessing prohibited mobile phones. While the brothers expressed remorse for the killings, which they have long claimed were in self-defense after years of abuse, the boards concluded they still exhibit anti-social and rule-breaking traits.</p>

          <p>Some businesses are bringing back "recession specials," discounted deals on products and services, in response to growing economic anxiety among consumers. This marketing trend, previously popular during the Great Recession, is seen as a reaction to deteriorating consumer sentiment, which has been impacted by concerns over trade policy and inflation. While some businesses use the term humorously, the strategy reflects a broader expectation of an economic slowdown and a need to attract cautious spenders. This trend suggests businesses are anticipating a pullback in consumer spending due to a lack of confidence in the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of increasingly powerful and costly hurricanes like Ian, Florida is grappling with how to rebuild for a more resilient future. Some residents are relocating to inland communities like Babcock Ranch, a town engineered to withstand major storms with features like advanced stormwater systems and hurricane-proofed homes. In other areas, particularly lower-income neighborhoods, nonprofits and city programs are helping homeowners rebuild existing properties to be stronger and more elevated. These efforts highlight a critical shift towards climate adaptation, though challenges remain as federal funding for mitigation projects declines under the current administration.</p>

The measures were ordered by the new Education Minister, a high-ranking military officer appointed by President Nayib Bukele, who defends them as necessary to restore order. While some teachers' unions have condemned the move as the "militarization of education," the government insists it is part of a broader effort to strengthen civic values and discipline.

          <p>President Trump's recent attacks on the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture for its focus on slavery are being compared to the century-old "Lost Cause" myth. This historical revisionist narrative, promoted after the Civil War, sought to downplay the brutality of slavery and portray the Confederacy in a more favorable light. Trump's claims that the museum is too negative and his calls to overhaul its exhibits are seen as an attempt to politicize history and impose an ideological agenda on cultural institutions. This reflects a broader effort within the administration to control historical narratives taught in schools and museums.</p>

          <p>A coalition of prominent Democratic lawmakers and immigrant rights advocates is demanding the closure of Camp East Montana, a new large-scale immigration detention facility at Fort Bliss military base in Texas. Critics raise concerns about a lack of external oversight, harsh conditions, and inadequate access to legal services at the sprawling tent facility. The camp, which is set to expand to 5,000 beds, is seen as a central part of the Trump administration's hardline immigration agenda and plan for mass deportations. Opponents have labeled the use of a military base for immigration detention as a "shameful" misuse of resources.</p>

          <p>A 75-year-old Florida man has received his high school diploma, decades after his education was cut short by severe abuse at the notorious Dozier School for Boys. Eddie Horne was a student at the state-run reform school in the 1960s, where he endured vicious beatings that contributed to him dropping out. He was able to complete his education through a compensation program established by the Florida legislature for victims of abuse at Dozier and a similar institution. Horne's graduation fulfills a lifelong promise to himself and stands as an inspiration for overcoming trauma and adversity.</p>

While supporting robotic space exploration for scientific purposes, Becker views the push for human settlement as a delusion promoted by the ultra-wealthy.

Authorities discovered a vast collection of recordings and other disturbing materials at his home.

Decades of industrial mining have left a legacy of pollution and poverty, forcing many into this dangerous work to support their families. Despite providing an essential source of fuel for local communities, these artisanal miners are treated as criminals by the government. A new draft bill intended to formalize artisanal mining is being criticized for being too restrictive and potentially criminalizing entire communities.</p>

          <p>Utility bills are rising across the U.S., with electricity costs up 5.5% and natural gas up 13.8% over the past year. The primary driver is a surge in electricity demand from data centers for artificial intelligence, oil and gas drilling, and electrification, following 25 years of flat demand. While abundant clean energy projects are waiting to connect to the grid, a lack of transmission capacity is a major bottleneck. Concurrently, Trump administration policies are curtailing renewable energy development and forcing costly extensions for aging coal plants, with these expenses expected to be passed on to consumers.
