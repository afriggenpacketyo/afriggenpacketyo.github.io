          <p>President Trump's new tariffs caused a surge in U.S. imports before their implementation, but this was followed by a significant decline in new freight orders.  This indicates importer hesitation and a 'wait-and-see' approach due to uncertainty about consumer demand and the long-term effects of the tariffs. The Chinese freight market experienced a two-decade low.</p>

These tariffs aim to revitalize U.S. manufacturing but economists predict increased inflation and higher consumer costs. The 10% tariff takes effect April 5th, reciprocal tariffs on April 9th.</p>
