          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to garner support for a budget package containing his legislative priorities, facing resistance from both conservative and moderate factions.

Speaker Mike Johnson is attempting to bridge these divides before a Memorial Day deadline, but disagreements persist on key issues.

          <p>President Trump's tax and spending bill faces challenges in the House of Representatives due to disagreements among Republicans over spending cuts and Medicaid. Four right-wing lawmakers withheld their support, arguing that the cuts should be steeper to avoid swelling America's public debt. Speaker Johnson has promised "minor modifications" to address these concerns, including making the Medicaid work requirements take effect sooner and ditching green energy tax credits. Another point of contention is a tripling of a local tax deduction, which some lawmakers from high-tax states have objected to, saying that the proposed cap is not high enough.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering allowing asset managers to offer ETF share classes of existing mutual funds, potentially giving investors more choice but also raising tax concerns. Over 50 asset managers have petitioned the SEC for exemptive relief to offer this option. One of the SEC's hesitations in approving these relief applications appears to be concern that co-mingling the funds might result in ETF holders getting hit with an unexpected tax bill. Dimensional Fund Advisors has proposed updated guidelines to address tax impact issues, but the SEC has declined to comment.</p>

          <p>A Republican plan to tax university endowments, designed to target "woke" elite institutions, could also affect smaller schools like McPherson College in Kansas. The tax, part of President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," would be tiered based on endowment size and enrollment, with a top rate of 21 percent for schools with endowments of at least $2 million per student. While the stated aim is to ensure elite schools can no longer abuse tax benefits, the plan would also impact institutions in rural areas and Republican states, potentially costing them millions annually. Schools are pushing back, arguing that endowments fund education for poor and middle-class students.</p>

          <p>A recent power outage in Spain and Portugal has prompted questions about the stability of renewable energy sources and reignited debates over the phasing out of nuclear power. The blackout, believed to be one of the worst in Europe's history, occurred shortly after renewables accounted for around 70% of Spain's electricity production. While some have blamed the high reliance on renewables, experts suggest the blackout highlights grid stability issues more than problems with renewable energy sources. Solutions for improving grid stability include virtual inertia, better battery storage, and increased flexibility in grid systems.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring acquiring a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as Air Force One, involving weeks of secret coordination between Washington and Doha. President Trump personally inspected the plane in Florida, expressing his enthusiasm. The plan has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, raising ethical concerns and questions about the financial sense of refitting the plane for presidential use. The Qataris had been trying to sell the luxury jet for years with no luck until Trump's team set its sights on it.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, affirmed that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity efforts. More than half of the company's sales come from the U.S., and Home Depot has been diversifying its import sources. This strategy contrasts with Walmart, which has indicated it will raise prices to cover higher costs from tariffs. Home Depot maintained its full-year sales forecast, despite missing first-quarter earnings expectations, and noted improved sales patterns as the quarter progressed.</p>

While the bill faces challenges in passing due to Republican control of the House, it represents a significant effort to address the issue of religious persecution.</p>

          <p>According to a recent report, over half of US companies plan to raise prices to accommodate the costs of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The unpredictability of US trade policy has also negatively impacted exporters' confidence. Although Trump has eased some tariffs, key levies remain, including tariffs on Chinese imports. Businesses are anticipating higher prices, with consumer inflation expectations reaching levels not seen since 1981. Some companies have been stockpiling goods to circumvent tariffs, but experts predict that price increases will become more widespread by the summer. </p>

Trump's accusations that allies were exploiting US advantages, his pledges to annex Canada and buy Greenland, and his sidelining of Europe in talks with Russia have created fault lines in transatlantic ties.
