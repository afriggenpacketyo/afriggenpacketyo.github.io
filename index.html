        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, currently under Senate consideration, seeks to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent and boost spending on border security and defense. The bill also proposes to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime for workers earning less than $160,000 a year, alongside establishing "Trump savings accounts" for newborns with an initial $1,000 deposit from the government. Further provisions include raising the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 for joint filers making under $500,000 annually, removing the excise tax on gun silencers, repealing the tax on indoor tanning services, and cutting green energy incentives. Republican fiscal hawks are concerned about the bill's potential to increase the deficit, while it remains uncertain whether the proposed changes will garner sufficient support in the Senate. This bill is poised to have a significant impact on various sectors of the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A war of words erupted between President Trump and Elon Musk after Musk criticized Trump's domestic megabill. Trump expressed his disappointment in Musk, stating their relationship may be strained due to Musk's opposition to the bill. Musk responded on X, accusing Trump of "ingratitude" and claiming he was crucial to Trump's election victory. The disagreement stems from Musk's concerns about the bill's impact on the deficit and the removal of electric vehicle tax credits, with Musk advocating for cuts to "disgusting pork" in the legislation. The exchange highlights a significant rift between two prominent figures who were previously aligned, with the future of their relationship now uncertain. Optimism surrounding their relationship appears to have diminished as the dispute unfolds. </p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a 9% drop following a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump regarding the spending bill under consideration in Congress. Trump stated that Musk was upset about the exclusion of EV credits in the bill, prompting a sharp response from Musk on X. Musk has criticized the bill as a "disgusting abomination" and threatened primary challenges for lawmakers who support it. The decline in Tesla's shares follows a 22% rally in May, with the stock now down 13% for the week and more than 25% year-to-date, reflecting investor concerns over the uncertainty surrounding the company's prospects amidst the political turmoil. The market is showing some sensitivity to the evolving relationship between the company and the government.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone to discuss trade tensions, with Trump claiming they reached a "very positive conclusion" for both countries. Trump stated that U.S. and Chinese negotiating teams will meet soon to finalize the agreement, and that Xi invited him to visit China. The call follows recent accusations from Trump that China violated a previous agreement to roll back tariff rates, which China denies. Trump believes they "straightened out any complexity" regarding the agreement, particularly concerning rare earths and magnets, and he expressed openness to Chinese students coming to the U.S., despite earlier administration announcements about visa revocations. This conversation signals a potential thaw in trade relations between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

Heger's father, Joe Heger, emphasized the importance of respecting equipment and enjoying the work, which has contributed to his son's success.

          <p>The government has announced that free school meals will be extended to an additional 500,000 children in England from September 2026. Any child whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible, regardless of their income, saving parents Â£500 a year and potentially lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The government has allocated Â£1 billion to fund the changes up to 2029 and will also review standards to ensure school meals are healthy. While some critics argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective, the government maintains that this initiative will improve educational attainment by ensuring children are not hungry in the classroom. The move has been welcomed by advocates and celebrities who received free school meals themselves growing up.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously rejected a lawsuit filed by Mexico against American gun manufacturers, seeking to hold them accountable for their role in the country's struggle with drug cartels. Mexico argued that the "flood" of illegal guns across the border resulted from "deliberate" practices by U.S. firms that appealed to cartel members. The court upheld a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers from liability if their products are misused, stating that Mexico's complaint failed to prove the manufacturers aided and abetted unlawful sales. The case marked the first time the court addressed the PLCAA shield law, which limits the ability of victims of gun violence to sue firearms manufacturers. This decision will have implications for future attempts to hold gun manufacturers accountable for violence in other countries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee has passed several China-focused measures, including bipartisan bills aimed at countering Beijing's overseas military expansion and strengthening Taiwan's role in global finance. The Counter Act of 2025, co-authored by Senators Chris Coons and Pete Ricketts, directs the U.S. government to develop a strategy to respond to China's efforts to establish military bases overseas. The legislation would require a classified assessment of risks posed by Chinese bases and instruct the State and Defense departments to identify at least five high-risk locations. These measures reflect growing concerns in the U.S. about China's increasing military and economic influence around the world. The goal is to ensure a proactive rather than reactive approach to China's global activities.</p>

          <p>Stellantis is bringing back its V-8 Hemi engine for Ram 1500 pickup trucks, reversing a previous decision to discontinue it due to fuel economy regulations. Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis admitted the decision to cancel the Hemi engine was a mistake and emphasized the company's commitment to providing powertrain choices for customers. The announcement is part of a new product turnaround plan that includes 25 product announcements over 18 months, with the Hemi expected to represent 25% to 40% of Ram 1500 sales. While the Hurricane engine will still be offered, the Hemi will be available as an option on most models. The move comes as EV adoption has been slower than expected, leading automakers to reevaluate their plans. </p>

Adams expressed her disappointment, stating she was "robbed" and "didn't do anything wrong," while her father, who is also her sprint coach, criticized the officials' handling of the situation. Inspired by former U.S. sprinter Maurice Greene, Adams' celebration was intended as a tribute, but it was not well-received by CIF officials, who did not provide a specific rule violation.

Three U.S. senators have warned that paying Trump to drop the $20 billion lawsuit could be considered a bribe, while California Democrats have proposed a state Senate hearing to investigate the matter. Settling the lawsuit is seen as crucial for regulators to approve the Skydance deal, but Trump's demands, including a large cash payment and an apology, are complicating the situation. Legal experts caution that proving bribery may be difficult, but the controversy raises concerns about potential abuse of power and the chilling effect on investigative journalism.

The House-passed legislation extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, increases military and border security spending, and makes cuts to social programs, potentially adding $3 trillion to the deficit.

          <p>The alliance between President Trump and Elon Musk has dramatically fractured over Trump's tax bill, with Musk claiming he was essential to Trump's election victory. Trump stated that Musk opposes the budget package because he is "upset" about the elimination of electric vehicle credits and Trump nixing his pick to run NASA. Musk fired back, calling the bill a "disgusting abomination" and asserting that without his financial backing, Trump would have lost the election. Tesla shares experienced a decline as the feud between Musk and Trump intensified. The public disagreement highlights a significant rift between the two figures, with Musk questioning the direction of American politics and Trump defending his legislative agenda. </p>

          <p>The L.A. Phil's Seoul Festival, curated by Unsuk Chin, showcases a range of emerging Korean composers and performers, offering a glimpse into the musically mysterious landscape of Korea.

The festival features a Green Umbrella concert of new music, revealing a diverse array of approaches among the next generation of composers. The event also highlights the blend of Korean, European, and American traditions, with soloists specializing in both Western and Korean instruments. This festival seeks to bridge the gap and introduce the world to the unique sounds and talents of Korean classical music. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO defense ministers have generally endorsed a plan to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, in response to US President Trump's demands for greater investment from alliance members. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte expressed confidence that allies are ready to increase the target, with a formal agreement expected by the next NATO summit in The Hague. While most members currently commit to spending at least 2% of GDP on military expenditure, some countries, including Spain, are hesitant to significantly increase their contributions. The increased urgency among NATO members to bolster defense capacity in Europe is driven by Russia's war in Ukraine. This move reflects a growing commitment to collective security in the face of geopolitical challenges.</p>

P&G faces slowing growth in the U.S. and expects a negative impact on earnings from tariffs. The company aims to reevaluate its portfolio, restructure its supply chain, and streamline its corporate organization.

Despite Yusuf's contributions to the party's success in recent elections, internal disagreements appear to have led to his departure. Nigel Farage expressed regret over Yusuf's resignation, acknowledging his significant role in the party's achievements.

The SSA has completed 90% of its caseload, with beneficiaries receiving one-time payments deposited into their bank accounts. While most eligible parties should have seen monthly benefit increases starting in April, some cases require manual processing and may take longer, with all beneficiary records expected to be updated by November 2025.

          <p>The Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in Catholic Charities v. Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission, focusing on a narrow distinction in Wisconsin law regarding unemployment taxes. The case involved a law that exempts some nonprofits from paying unemployment taxes, but only those operating "primarily for religious purposes." The Court reversed the state supreme court's decision, granting Catholic Charities an exemption, as the state cannot prefer one religious denomination over another. The decision avoids a broader fight over religious organizations ignoring the law, but leaves some ambiguity regarding the definition of "theological" choices. This ruling highlights the Court's cautious approach to religious exemptions in the workplace. </p>

          <p>The number of pupils attending private schools in England has decreased by 11,000 compared to the previous year, according to the latest school census data. This decline follows the government's removal of a VAT exemption for private schools on January 1st. While the government maintains that the drop remains within historical patterns, private schools argue that higher fees are putting pressure on parents, leading to more pupils leaving the independent sector. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) suggests that the VAT on fees is the reason behind the drop, with average school fees being significantly higher in January 2025 compared to the previous year. The census data does not provide clear reasons for the decline, which could include shifts in international students or a move to home-schooling. </p>
