Bell defended his position, stating Hamas is a genocidal terrorist group, while also calling for increased humanitarian aid and an end to the war. The event was marked by constant interruptions and heated exchanges between the congressman, protesters, and other attendees who wanted to discuss local issues. The confrontation highlights the deep divisions within the Democratic party and the public over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has condemned a federal appeals court decision that temporarily blocked a land transfer required for the Resolution Copper mine in Arizona, a joint venture by Rio Tinto and BHP. He labeled the opposition from groups like the San Carlos Apache Tribe as "anti-American," emphasizing the nation's need for copper for economic and strategic purposes. The tribe is challenging the project on religious, cultural, and environmental grounds, calling the proposed mine a "rip-off" that will destroy a sacred area. The dispute underscores the conflict between economic development, resource demand, and Indigenous rights.</p>

To further attract professional contractors, the company announced its acquisition of Foundation Building Materials, a major distributor of interior building products, for $8.8 billion. While sales to do-it-yourself customers showed improvement, CEO Marvin Ellison noted that the market for larger projects remains soft due to high mortgage rates. The acquisition is a strategic move to position Lowe's for growth when the housing market eventually recovers. (not investment advice)</p>

She shared that while some days are better than others, she is functioning and finding moments of happiness. Plaza and Baena, who began dating in 2011 and married in 2021, were a long-term couple in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>A 55-year-old man from High Wycombe, Jason King, has been sentenced to nine years in prison for shooting a police officer in the leg with a crossbow. The incident occurred after police were called to a neighbor dispute, during which King also stabbed another person. After firing at officers from his window, King chased them with the weapon before being shot and apprehended by an armed officer. The judge described King's actions as an attempt to "hunt down" the officer and commended the officers for their bravery.</p>

The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown that includes increased wall construction, with about half a mile being built daily. The administration claims that its policies have led to a significant drop in border crossings, acting as a deterrent.</p>

Legal experts suggest the administration may use the Constitution's Commerce Clause, which grants Congress power over interstate commerce, to argue that certain state regulations create unnecessary burdens. This strategy would likely require persuading Congress to pass new federal legislation to preempt state laws, a difficult task in the current political climate.

In trials, bee colonies that consumed the supplement saw up to a 15-fold increase in the number of young bees surviving to adulthood.

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are scheduled for parole hearings this week after their sentences were recently reduced. The brothers, now in their 50s, were resentenced to 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible for parole after serving 35 years. Their family has expressed cautious optimism, stating the brothers have taken full accountability and shown sincere remorse. The parole board's decision will ultimately be subject to approval by California Governor Gavin Newsom, marking a critical moment in their long-running and highly publicized case.</p>

          <p>According to a report in The New Yorker, Attorney General Pam Bondi has overseen a significant transformation of the Department of Justice to align with President Trump's agenda. The article describes this period as one of the most convulsive transitions since Watergate. Key actions under Bondi's leadership include the aggressive reversal of previous policies, the initiation of investigations into Trump's political adversaries, and the dismissal of staff members. This reshaping of the DOJ reflects a broader effort to wield the department's power in support of the administration's political objectives.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military is calling up approximately 60,000 reservists in preparation for a major ground offensive aimed at capturing all of Gaza City. The plan, approved by the defense minister, is expected to involve ordering hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians to evacuate to southern Gaza. This escalation comes after negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas stalled. The planned offensive has drawn condemnation from international allies and humanitarian organizations, who warn of a catastrophic impact on Gaza's already devastated population.</p>

          <p>A coalition of Western countries, including France, Britain, Canada, and Australia, are preparing to formally recognize a state of Palestine at the upcoming UN General Assembly. This move is a significant diplomatic step intended to bolster the two-state solution, even without an active peace process. The recognition would support the secular Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, thereby weakening its rival, Hamas. It also serves as a rebuke to Israel's expansion of settlements in the West Bank, which threatens the viability of a future Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that only 54% of U.S. adults report drinking alcohol, the lowest percentage in nearly 90 years of tracking. This decline is accompanied by a growing public belief that even moderate drinking is unhealthy, a view now held by a record 53% of adults, up from 28% in 2015. The shift in perception is most pronounced among young adults but is also increasing among older age groups. The findings suggest that years of public health information linking alcohol to risks like cancer are influencing American habits and attitudes.</p>

          <p>Homeowners with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) may see their monthly payments decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in the coming months. Because HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the prime rate, a Fed rate cut usually leads to a corresponding drop in the HELOC interest rate. However, the timing of payment relief can vary based on the lender's adjustment schedule and the loan's specific terms, such as introductory rates or interest rate floors.
