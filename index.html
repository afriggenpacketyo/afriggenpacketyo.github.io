          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility while visiting with New Jersey's congressional delegation. According to the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Baraka was charged with trespassing after ignoring warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to leave the premises. Congress members Menendez and Watson Coleman, who were present, claimed the arrest was an act of intimidation against the mayor and others protesting the facility's opening without proper permits and inspections, with DHS alleging that the members of Congress stormed the gate at the ICE facility. Baraka, a Democrat running for governor, has been a vocal critic of the facility, arguing it is dangerous and illegal.</p>

          <p>Asfandyar Mir argues that the India-Pakistan rivalry has entered a more dangerous phase due to India's rise as a geopolitical power and Pakistan's ongoing crises. A recent terrorist attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir triggered a military conflict, highlighting the elimination of diplomatic space between the two nations. India, under Narendra Modi, has adopted a more uncompromising stance towards Pakistan, while Pakistan is unwilling to back down on issues like Kashmir. The article suggests that the United States has stepped back from its role as a crisis manager, and the lack of communication channels between the two countries further exacerbates the situation, increasing the risk of escalation and potential nuclear conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested the U.S. might lower tariffs on China, proposing an 80% tariff, ahead of trade talks between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Chinese negotiators in Switzerland. Trump emphasized China should open its markets to the U.S. The two countries have been in a trade war since last month when Trump announced tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, prompting China to retaliate. Wall Street analysts anticipate a reduction below 80% following the Geneva negotiations, with UBS suggesting tariffs may settle around 34%.</p>

          <p>Elton John, Dua Lipa, and over 400 British artists have signed a letter urging the Prime Minister to amend the Data (Use and Access) Bill to protect their work from AI. The artists seek transparency from AI developers regarding the use of copyrighted material for training AI models, fearing that failing to do so would mean "giving away" their work to tech firms. The letter supports an amendment proposed by Baroness Beeban Kidron, which aims to allow licensing agreements between creators and companies. While the government acknowledges the need to balance creative industries and AI companies, some argue that restrictive copyright regimes could harm the UK economy.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual statewide mussel quarantine due to naturally occurring toxins, such as paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins, which make the species potentially poisonous to humans. The quarantine, effective through October 31, warns against eating sport-harvested mussels off the West Coast. Symptoms of paralytic shellfish poisoning include tingling of the lips and tongue, loss of balance, and muscular paralysis, while domoic acid poisoning has no reported human cases in California. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine due to frequent testing.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that left-handedness may be associated with a higher risk of certain neurological disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. Researchers found that people with autism are 3.5 times more likely to be left-handed. The study also indicated a potential link between atypical handedness and linguistic symptoms like stuttering and dyslexia. Experts caution that correlation does not imply causation and that being left-handed does not mean someone will develop these disorders. The study may help experts understand brain organization and development, potentially improving neurorehabilitation for patients with brain conditions.</p>

          <p>As trade tensions escalate between the U.S. and China, analysts suggest China could destabilize the U.S. housing market by flooding the market with its $1.2 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. Such a move could trigger higher interest rates and a chain reaction among other nations holding MBSs. Guy Cecala of Inside Mortgage Finance suggests this is a powerful lever China could use to exert pressure. Rising mortgage rates and economic strain on American households could exacerbate the impact (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump signaled openness to cutting tariffs on China ahead of upcoming talks, suggesting the U.S. could almost halve the tariffs on Chinese goods. Meanwhile, Admiral Sir Ben Key, the Navy chief, stepped back for "private reasons" amid a misconduct probe into an alleged affair. In other news, the Times reported that net migration is set to stall unless radical policies are introduced, and the Daily Express claimed obesity drugs could give a Â£4.5 billion boost to the economy.</p>

          <p>Google agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating the data privacy rights of state residents, announced by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The lawsuit, filed in 2022, accused Google of unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data. This settlement follows a similar $1.4 billion settlement with Meta over unauthorized use of biometric data. Google did not admit any wrongdoing and stated the settlement covers old claims related to Chrome's incognito setting, location history, and biometric claims related to Google Photo.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington as documents related to his abandoned federal corruption case were released. Adams stated that he discussed New York City priorities, including a wind farm project off Long Island that was canceled by the Trump administration. Trump claimed that Adams came to thank him, while prosecutors released material related to the case, including search warrants and affidavits. The material helps to elucidate the charges against Mr. Adams, which a federal judge, Dale E. Ho, dismissed last month after a request from high-ranking officials in the Justice Department who said the case was hindering the mayorâ€™s cooperation with the presidentâ€™s immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus for migrants, a move that would curtail a constitutional right to due process. Miller justified the potential suspension by arguing the U.S. faces a national security threat from undocumented migrants "invading" the country. Legal experts contend that a president cannot suspend habeas corpus without authorization from Congress. The Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus in extraordinary circumstances such as an invasion or rebellion.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs policy has significantly impacted the port of Long Beach, the busiest port in the western hemisphere, with traffic down by a third compared to last year. The reduction in traffic translates to fewer ships, containers, and jobs, affecting local businesses and workers. A shortage of certain items imported from China and price hikes are taking hold, impacting businesses and consumers. The US trade secretary is set to meet with his Chinese counterpart in Switzerland to address the growing pressure to strike a deal with China.</p>

China's foreign ministry claims the talks were held at the request of the US, while the Trump administration insists Chinese officials want to do business. Factory output in China has taken a hit, and uncertainty caused by tariffs led to the US economy contracting.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, potentially leading to new tariffs. The investigation, under the Trade Expansion Act, will assess industry input on demand, the role of foreign suppliers, and government favoritism. Tariffs could harm the aerospace industry, which relies heavily on global suppliers. Boeing has described the direct effects of existing tariffs as minor but expressed concern about their impact on suppliers.</p>
