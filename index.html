          <p>Despite ongoing high-level summits, the relationship between the European Union and China has failed to achieve a significant reset. EU officials express frustration over China's portrayal of the relationship as problem-free while fundamental disagreements persist. Key points of contention include China's significant economic imbalances and its continued diplomatic and economic support for Russia. The EU aims to rebalance this dynamic, but deep-seated divisions suggest that meaningful progress remains elusive for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng has successfully navigated an intense domestic price war, reporting its eighth consecutive month of over 30,000 vehicle deliveries in June. This performance stands out as competitors like Nio and Li Auto show more modest or declining sales momentum. The fierce competition, described by the government as "disorderly," has put pressure on all players, including market giant BYD and international competitor Tesla.

President Trump expressed doubt that a deal would be made, specifically citing Japan's restrictions on U.S. rice imports as a point of contention.

          <p>President Donald Trump has made comments suggesting that some U.S.-born citizens who commit certain crimes should be deported, a statement that an expert on authoritarianism has labeled as a "chilling" new level of rhetoric. During a visit to a migrant detention facility, Trump referred to these individuals as "homegrowns" and stated that getting them "the hell out of here" might be a future policy goal. This echoes previous remarks and signals a potential expansion of his administration's hardline immigration and deportation policies.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has suffered a significant political blow after his government was forced to abandon its central welfare reform plans due to a large-scale rebellion from his own Labour MPs. The dramatic U-turn on changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) has been described as a moment of chaos, leaving a multi-billion pound hole in the public finances. This episode has severely weakened the Prime Minister's authority and raised serious questions about his government's stability and control over its own agenda.</p>

          <p>President Trump recently toured a newly constructed migrant detention center located in a remote area of the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The facility, built rapidly by the state to support the administration's immigration crackdown, can house thousands of detainees in spartan conditions surrounded by swampland. Trump praised the facility as a deterrent, highlighting its secure and isolated location. The center has drawn sharp criticism from immigration advocates and human rights groups over its harsh conditions and potential for constitutional violations.</p>

This continues an extraordinary decline in unlawful immigration since President Trump took office. The administration attributes the record-low numbers to its aggressive enforcement and deportation policies, which include empowering officials to swiftly deport migrants without hearing asylum claims.
