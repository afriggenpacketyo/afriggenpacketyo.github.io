            <p>An American Airlines plane's wingtip struck another American Airlines plane on a taxiway at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, prompting an FAA investigation. No injuries were reported, and both planes returned to their gates for inspection. The incident caused concern among members of Congress who were on one of the flights, raising questions about FAA staffing levels and safety. The airline stated that the damage was limited to a winglet on each aircraft, and the planes were taken out of service for inspection, with the airline apologizing to customers for the inconvenience.

            <p>Sweeping global tariffs announced by Donald Trump triggered rapid market declines, forcing investors to quickly assess and react to potential impacts. Trillions were wiped off global financial markets as leading share indexes experienced steep declines, and investors sought safe-haven assets. The uncertainty caused by the tariffs has led to a cautious approach among portfolio managers, with some holdings performing well while others, like Apple, face challenges due to manufacturing in China. While a temporary pause in tariffs provided some relief, the market remains volatile due to the remaining tariffs on China. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariff policies have sent Amazon sellers into a panic, as many rely on China for manufacturing and assembly. Sellers are faced with raising prices or absorbing the increased cost of importing goods, with Amazon anticipating that sellers will likely pass the cost on to consumers. Some sellers are considering moving manufacturing out of China, while others are advocating for reviving U.S. manufacturing. The closure of the "de minimis" loophole, which allowed orders under $800 to avoid duties and taxes, is seen as a boon for U.S.-based sellers. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is warning states that they must comply with federal orders to house inmates based on their biological sex or face funding cuts. This decision follows a case in Maine, where a transgender inmate was housed in a women's facility. The administration argues that housing transgender women in female facilities violates the rights of women and creates sex-based discrimination. Several states allow transgender people to be housed in facilities that align with their gender identity, and the administration is battling in court to strip federal prisons of gender-transition treatments and housing preferences.</p>

Kennedy has insisted that no essential services would be cut and has promised to look into the impacted programs.

            <h2>Study Reveals Fish Are Being Exposed to Human Medications in Waterways</h2>

            <p>A new study reveals that fish in waterways are being exposed to human medications, particularly benzodiazepines, due to incomplete filtration by sewage treatment plants. Researchers found that salmon exposed to clobazam, a benzo, were more likely to make it out to sea, possibly due to reduced stress. However, experts warn that any changes to natural behavior can have negative consequences, and the long-term effects of this exposure are still unknown. The study highlights the broader issue of pharmaceuticals in the environment and their potential impact on wildlife.</p>

            <h2>Social Security COLA Projected to Be Lower in 2026, But Tariffs Could Change That</h2>

            <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be lower than recent years, but this could change due to potential inflationary pressures from tariffs. Current estimates place the COLA around 2.2% to 2.3%, lower than the 2.5% increase in 2025. Economists expect that if Trump's tariffs are implemented as planned, they will raise consumer prices, potentially prompting a higher Social Security COLA for 2026. The Social Security Administration determines the annual COLA based on third-quarter data for the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. (not investment advice)</p>

President Trump has called the spending plan a "big, beautiful bill", while Democrats criticize the potential cuts to programs like Medicaid. The bill aims to extend tax cuts passed during Trump's first term, but concerns remain about the potential increase in US government debt.</p>
