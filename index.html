        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The diamond industry is grappling with a confluence of challenges, including US tariffs and the rise of lab-grown diamonds (LGDs).  Tariffs impose a 10% import duty on diamonds to the US, impacting an industry already facing slowing demand and competition from LGDs, which sell at an 80% discount.  Major players like De Beers are re-evaluating strategies, closing their LGD brand to focus on natural diamonds, while others see a potential stabilization point as price differences become more pronounced.  The article highlights the complex supply chain of mined diamonds and the industry's efforts to secure exemptions from tariffs.</p>
