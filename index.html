          <p>A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing became contentious when Senator Cory Booker and FBI Director Kash Patel engaged in a heated argument. Booker accused Patel of weakening the country's safety and predicted his tenure as director would be short, leading to a yelling match between the two. The confrontation stemmed from Booker's questions about firings at the FBI and Patel's sealed grand jury testimony related to a prosecution against President Trump. The exchange highlighted the deep political divisions and palpable tension surrounding the FBI's leadership and its recent actions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second state visit to the U.K. is marked by awkward timing and a tense political atmosphere. The trip comes immediately after Prime Minister Keir Starmer fired his U.S. ambassador, Peter Mandelson, over newly revealed ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a subject that also brings scrutiny to Trump's own past association. Trump is visiting a Britain facing its own deep political divisions, highlighted by recent far-right demonstrations and growing polarization. The context of the Mandelson scandal and domestic UK turmoil creates a challenging diplomatic environment for both leaders during the high-profile visit.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewable sources are the most affordable option. According to a report from investment bank Lazard using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) metric, onshore wind and utility-scale solar are more cost-competitive to generate than coal, natural gas, or nuclear power. While renewables have high upfront capital costs, their operational expenses are significantly lower, and they are not subject to volatile fuel prices. The article also discusses how government policies, such as tax incentives and tariffs, impact these costs, concluding that a diverse energy portfolio is crucial for grid stability.

          <p>The landmark case of Etan Patz, a 6-year-old boy who vanished in New York City in 1979, is facing a new legal chapter. A federal appeals court has ruled that Pedro Hernandez, who was convicted in 2015 for Etan's murder, must either be given a new trial or be released from prison. The original case profoundly changed how law enforcement and society handle missing children cases. This latest court decision reopens questions about Hernandez's confession and his mental state, potentially undoing a conviction that took decades to secure and leaving the search for definitive justice for the Patz family unresolved once again.</p>

          <p>A proposed agreement to eliminate the 25% tariff on UK steel exports to the United States has been put on hold indefinitely, according to BBC sources. This development is a setback for the UK steel industry, which is facing significant financial distress. While government sources insist the UK remains in a competitive position compared to other nations facing 50% tariffs and that a path to zero tariffs still exists, the delay adds uncertainty. The hold-up is reportedly linked to US questions about production methods at Tata, the UK's largest steel maker, during its transition to new furnace technology.</p>

          <p>This article details a crucial but often overlooked aspect of reverse mortgages: the 6-month rule. This guideline stipulates that once the borrower passes away or permanently leaves the home, their heirs have a six-month window to either repay the full loan balance or sell the property to settle the debt. This rule applies to the most common type of reverse mortgage, the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). Understanding this timeline is critical for homeowners and their families to properly plan their estates and avoid the stress of a tight deadline or potential foreclosure.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has significantly expanded its ground operations into the center of Gaza City, a move described by officials as being of "decisive importance" for the war against Hamas. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimate it could take several months to gain control of the city and even longer to clear Hamas infrastructure. The Palestinian Authority has condemned the offensive, calling for urgent international intervention to protect civilians and accusing Israel of attempting to turn the city into a "mass grave." The escalation marks a critical and destructive new phase in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>The new migrant return deal between the UK and France is facing its first legal challenge at the High Court. An Eritrean man who arrived in the UK on a small boat is seeking to block his removal to France, which was scheduled under the pilot "one in, one out" scheme. His lawyers argue there is a "real risk of destitution" if he is deported, while the Home Office contends he should have claimed asylum in France. This case represents the first judicial scrutiny of the controversial agreement, which aims to return some migrants who cross the Channel in exchange for accepting vetted refugees from France.</p>

          <p>U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited the Chicago area as the Department of Homeland Security increased its immigration enforcement operations in the city. The initiative, named "Operation Midway Blitz," is described by DHS as targeting "criminal illegal aliens" who have been drawn to the area due to its sanctuary city policies. Noem's visit underscores the high-level federal focus on the crackdown, which has been a point of contention between the Trump administration and local Illinois officials. The operation has heightened tensions and fear within local immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown looming, House Republicans have introduced a stopgap spending bill to fund federal agencies through November 21. The legislation, known as a continuing resolution, would maintain current funding levels and add millions for enhanced security for government officials. Speaker Mike Johnson stated the bill provides more time for negotiations on year-long spending agreements. However, Democrats are demanding that any extension also address expiring healthcare subsidies, setting the stage for a contentious debate as the funding deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>Two years after its historic strike, the actors' union SAG-AFTRA has officially established a new fund to distribute a portion of streaming profits more broadly among its members. Dubbed the "Robin Hood" fund, it will collect 25% of the bonuses generated when a high-budget streaming show becomes highly successful. This money will then be distributed to a wider pool of performers, including background actors, stunt riggers, and others who work on the project but previously did not share in its success. The fund represents a key gain from the 2023 contract negotiations, creating a new secondary income stream for many working actors.</p>

An 11-member deep-sea diving team retrieved items including the ship's bell, a navigation light, and silver-plated trays from the vessel, which lies nearly 400 feet deep in the Aegean Sea. The Britannic was serving as a hospital ship when it struck a mine in 1916.

          <p>A public inquiry into the Southport attack, where Axel Rudakubana murdered three young girls at a dance studio, has revealed systemic failures to intervene despite numerous warning signs. The inquiry heard that a teacher at his school had emailed a colleague in frustration about the "frightening red tape" that prevented police, social services, and mental health services from taking action. Despite a history of violence, carrying weapons, and referrals to the government's counter-extremism program, various agencies reportedly failed to take ownership of his case, highlighting potential missed opportunities to prevent the tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Donald Trump's credible willingness to let TikTok "go dark" in the U.S. was the key factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent stated that the commercial terms had been largely settled for months, but the Chinese side paused negotiations after Trump's tariff announcements. The President's firm stance on prioritizing national security over the deal itself reportedly broke the stalemate, leading to the current agreement that will restructure the app's U.S. operations. This provides insight into the administration's hardline negotiation tactics in its dealings with China.</p>

Captain Bernard Gallacher's European team, considered underdogs, traveled to Oak Hill in New York and overcame a 9-7 deficit heading into the final day's singles matches. Key performances from players like Nick Faldo and a crucial final point secured by rookie Philip Walton led Europe to a stunning 14½ to 13½ victory.
