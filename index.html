          <p>The Trump administration has formally requested the Supreme Court to expedite an appeal concerning the legality of his "reciprocal tariffs." This action follows a federal appeals court ruling that found the president overstepped his authority by imposing steep levies on trading partners, stating that tariffs are a core power of Congress. The administration argues the lower court's decision creates legal uncertainty that undermines the president's ability to conduct diplomacy and protect national security. A decision from the high court could come in the summer of 2026.</p>

          <p>Director Aziz Ansari has commented on the 2022 misconduct allegations against actor Bill Murray, which led to the shutdown of their film "Being Mortal." Ansari stated that Murray was "devastated" by the claims, which involved inappropriate behavior with a younger female staffer on set and resulted in a reported $100,000 settlement. Murray has since reflected on the incident, which he thought was funny at the time, acknowledging it was a "great disappointment" and that he has learned from the experience.</p>

The positive movement occurred despite ongoing concerns about the global economy, with global bond markets remaining a key focus for investors.

The initial demotion followed a Pentagon investigation that found he made "sexual and denigrating" comments about a female subordinate and violated alcohol policies while serving as a White House physician. Jackson, who has consistently denied the allegations and called them a "political hit job," announced the reinstatement, which was confirmed by the Navy Secretary in a letter.</p>

          <p>A bill that would permit Texas residents to sue out-of-state providers of abortion-inducing drugs has been passed by the legislature and now awaits the governor's signature. The measure allows for lawsuits of up to $100,000 against those who manufacture, transport, or provide the pills to anyone in Texas, though the women receiving them are not liable. Opponents argue the law is designed to intimidate providers in other states and creates a "chilling effect," while supporters claim it is a necessary tool to enforce the state's abortion ban.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Argentina have successfully recovered "Portrait of a Lady," an 18th-century painting by Italian artist Giuseppe Ghislandi that was looted by the Nazis during World War II. The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, was originally owned by Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before his collection was seized by Hermann Göring. The painting was discovered after it was spotted in an online real estate listing for a home in Mar del Plata belonging to the daughter of a former high-ranking Nazi lawyer.</p>

          <p>At an emotional press conference on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse called for the public release of all files related to the investigation. One survivor, Lisa Phillips, announced that the group has begun compiling its own confidential list of Epstein's associates who they say were involved in the abuse, stating it will be "done by survivors, and for survivors." The event, organized by lawmakers pushing for transparency, featured nine women who detailed their experiences at the hands of the convicted sex offender.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The municipal government of Shaoxing, China, has introduced a stimulus measure offering subsidies to individuals who host large banquets. As part of a broader effort to boost consumption, residents can receive up to 5,000 yuan (US$700) if they host five or more tables and spend over 10,000 yuan on the event. This policy highlights the challenge for local officials who are being urged to stimulate economic growth while also adhering to national anti-corruption campaigns that discourage extravagance. The new measures are expected to generate significant additional consumer spending.</p>

          <p>An article explores the phenomenon of Gen Z travelers portraying lavish lifestyles on social media that they cannot genuinely afford. Some individuals reportedly go into debt or use deceptive tactics, such as booking day passes at luxury resorts for photo shoots or splitting a high-end rental for one night to create the illusion of a week-long vacation. This trend is driven by the desire to build an online persona that can lead to lucrative brand partnerships, effectively turning a fabricated image into a source of income.</p>

          <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC), the UK's main federation of trade unions, is calling on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider implementing a range of wealth taxes in the upcoming budget. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak argued for a more progressive tax system to fund public services, suggesting taxes on windfall profits for banks and financial institutions. The Treasury responded by stating the government believes it has already achieved the right balance in taxing the wealthy, though the debate within the Labour movement continues.

          <p>The United Arab Emirates has issued a strong warning to Israel, stating that any move to annex the occupied West Bank would be a "red line" and would undermine the 2020 Abraham Accords that normalized relations.

The warning came after Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, unveiled a proposal for the annexation of approximately 80% of the West Bank, a move the Palestinian Authority called a "direct threat."</p>

The rapid adoption of its new AI-powered Agentforce platform, which has already closed over 6,000 paid deals, is highlighted as a key driver for potential future revenue reacceleration and margin improvement.

          <p>A former police detective shares essential advice on what to do immediately after being involved in a car crash, drawing from a recent personal experience of a head-on collision. The first crucial step is to stop the car and turn off the engine, as failing to do so is a legal offense. After checking for injuries, if possible, the vehicle should be moved to a safe location with hazard lights on; otherwise, occupants should exit and stand well away from traffic. The article stresses the importance of calling 999 if anyone is injured.</p>

The new agreement allows these voters to provide the missing information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively curing the issue and allowing their vote to be counted.</p>
