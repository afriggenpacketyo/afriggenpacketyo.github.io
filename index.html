          <p>At least 13 people have died after catastrophic flash floods struck the Texas Hill Country, with the Guadalupe River rising an astonishing 26 feet in under an hour. The sudden and destructive deluge has led to widespread property damage and ongoing water rescue operations. In a particularly tragic development, officials reported that around 20 children were unaccounted for at an all-girls summer camp that was hit by the floodwaters. The state has mobilized resources to assist with the search and recovery efforts as communities grapple with the aftermath of the historic flooding event.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team has kept its T20 series against India alive with a thrilling five-run victory at The Oval. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball, but captain Harmanpreet Kaur was caught, ending their chase at 166-5. Earlier, England posted a strong total of 171-9, thanks to impressive half-centuries from Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge, before suffering a dramatic late-innings collapse. The tense win reduces England's series deficit to 2-1, setting up a crucial fourth match at Old Trafford.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a detailed interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns describes the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it created the novel concept of a "citizen" rather than a subject. He emphasizes that the nation was born from a bloody and divisive civil war, and that understanding the founders' deep flaws is essential to appreciating their achievements. Burns argues that embracing this complex, gritty history, rather than a sanitized version, makes its lessons more powerful and accessible for navigating the divisions of the present day. He views the founding documents as an ongoing inspiration for a more inclusive nation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to claims that President Trump's new spending bill eliminates federal taxes on Social Security, the legislation does not fundamentally change how benefits are taxed. Instead, the bill introduces a new, temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65, which is set to expire in 2028. Policy experts note this deduction primarily benefits higher-income seniors who have a larger tax liability to reduce. The measure does not assist low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax, and it could worsen Social Security's long-term financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has floated the idea of hosting a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds as part of the nation's 250th anniversary celebrations next year. During a speech in Iowa, Trump said he had discussed the proposal with UFC CEO Dana White, a vocal supporter, to hold a full fight card for 20,000 to 25,000 people. The president suggested building a temporary venue on the extensive land at the White House. If it were to happen, it would be the first time a major professional sporting event has been hosted on the executive mansion's grounds.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has suspended a proposed project with SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from Johnston Atoll, a remote Pacific wildlife refuge. The decision follows a Reuters report highlighting concerns from biologists that the project would severely harm the 14 species of tropical seabirds that nest on the island. The program aimed to test the delivery of up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth in about 90 minutes. The Air Force is now reportedly exploring alternative locations for the breakthrough military logistics program due to the environmental opposition.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose 17% tariffs on a wide range of food and farm exports from the European Union, a move that could significantly escalate trade tensions. The warning was reportedly delivered by top U.S. officials to the EU's trade commissioner during negotiations in Washington. This aggressive stance is part of a broader strategy by President Trump to secure new trade deals by a self-imposed July 9 deadline. The EU has stated it prefers a negotiated solution but is prepared to implement retaliatory tariffs if the U.S. proceeds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The LGBTQ+ community in Turkey is facing a systematic campaign of repression, with Pride events banned, activists arrested, and online media being blocked by court orders. Activists and journalists report that hostile rhetoric from government officials, who describe the community as "deviant" and a threat to the family, has fueled a dangerous atmosphere and an increase in hate crimes. Despite the crackdown, the community has adopted the slogan "Insisting on life" for this year's Pride Month, signaling their determination to remain visible and active in the face of growing intimidation.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has publicly refuted allegations of abuse from Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported from the U.S. who claimed he was beaten and psychologically tortured in a Salvadoran prison. In a new legal filing, Abrego Garcia detailed severe beatings and confinement in a constantly lit, overcrowded cell. President Bukele responded on social media with photos and videos of the man in detention, questioning how he could look so well if he had been starved and tortured. Abrego Garcia has since been returned to the U.S. and faces human smuggling charges.</p>

          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, an epic partnership between Jamie Smith (184 not out) and Harry Brook (158) helped England fight back from a precarious position against India. The pair added 303 runs for the sixth wicket after England had collapsed early in the day. However, India's bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj's six wickets, roared back with the second new ball, causing England's last five wickets to fall for just 20 runs. India secured a 180-run first-innings lead and extended their overall advantage to 244 by the close of day three, remaining in a dominant position.</p>

          <p>A residential building has collapsed in Lyari, one of the poorest neighborhoods in the Pakistani port city of Karachi, resulting in at least seven confirmed deaths. Rescue operations are ongoing, with emergency services working to find survivors who may still be trapped in the rubble of what was home to as many as 100 people. Efforts have been complicated by narrow streets impeding heavy machinery and by unruly crowds at the scene. Building collapses are a frequent tragedy in Pakistan, where lax construction regulations and poor oversight are widespread issues.</p>

          <p>The market share for cars manufactured in China has surged in the United Kingdom, with one in every ten new cars sold in June being Chinese-made. This rapid growth, driven by brands like BYD and MG, marks a significant increase from previous years and contrasts with other G7 nations that have recently imposed steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports. The trend has been fueled by the popularity of electric cars and the competitive pricing and innovation of Chinese models, sparking a debate about the future competitiveness of the UK's domestic auto industry.</p>

          <p>The prospect of a new political party to the left of Labour is gaining traction in the UK, following MP Zarah Sultana's announcement that she is leaving Labour to help launch an alternative with former leader Jeremy Corbyn. While Corbyn confirmed that discussions for a new party are ongoing, he indicated that the project is still in its foundational stages. Polling suggests such a party could attract up to 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from young voters and potentially impacting the electoral fortunes of both the Labour and Green parties.</p>
