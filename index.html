The presidential aircraft was carrying President Trump and the first lady at the time of the incident. While the planes never reached a distance the FAA considers unsafe, flight data showed they came within approximately 11 miles of each other, prompting sharp rebukes from the control tower.

          <p>British pharmaceutical giant GSK has announced a major investment of at least $30 billion into its United States operations over the next five years. The commitment, revealed during President Trump's state visit to the U.K., will focus on research, development, and advanced manufacturing capabilities. This includes $1.2 billion for next-generation biopharma facilities and the integration of AI and digital technologies. The move follows similar large-scale U.S. investment announcements from other global pharmaceutical firms amid the Trump administration's push to bolster domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues for the accelerated production of the B-21 Raider, America's new sixth-generation stealth bomber, to effectively counter strategic threats from nations like China. The piece highlights the successful flight tests of the second B-21, nicknamed "Spartan," as evidence of the program's remarkable progress and efficiency, noting it is running significantly under budget. The author suggests that the current fleet of B-2 stealth bombers is insufficient for modern deterrence needs. President Trump is urged to authorize a second production line to expand the fleet more rapidly.</p>

          <p>A new archaeological study indicates that inhabitants of ancient southern China and Southeast Asia were practicing mummification as early as 12,000 years ago. This discovery suggests the practice is far older than previously thought, predating the well-known Chinchorro mummies of Chile by 5,000 years and the earliest Egyptian examples by over 7,000 years. Researchers from several international institutions analyzed 54 pre-Neolithic burials, finding evidence that bodies were smoke-dried over long periods. This reveals complex mortuary practices among the region's ancient hunter-gatherer populations before the Neolithic era.</p>

          <p>With Affordable Care Act (ACA) premiums expected to rise, the Trump administration is encouraging consumers to consider "catastrophic" health insurance plans, which feature lower monthly costs but very high deductibles. Officials have expanded eligibility for these plans, which are typically limited to people under 30, as a potential alternative for those who may lose their premium tax credits. The move comes as Congress debates extending enhanced subsidies implemented during the pandemic, which are set to expire.

Furthermore, gun-related incidents on K-12 school properties have surged since the pandemic, often stemming from escalated disputes. Data also indicates a rise in political violence over the last decade, creating a complex and concerning national picture.</p>

This action is part of a broader pattern of challenging the independence of various government bodies and inspectors general.

          <p>Three companies that conducted forward stock splits in 2025—O'Reilly Automotive, Fastenal, and Interactive Brokers Group—have seen their stock values rise dramatically, far outpacing the benchmark S&P 500's year-to-date gains. Forward stock splits, which lower a company's share price to make it more accessible, are often undertaken by businesses that are outperforming their competitors. O'Reilly has benefited from an aging vehicle fleet, Fastenal from its strong B2B integration, and Interactive Brokers from increased trading activity, with all three seeing year-to-date gains of over 30%.

          <p>A report mandated by the state of California has revealed that the Los Angeles Police Department fired more than 1,000 projectiles, including bean bags and rubber rounds, at protesters on a single day in June. The demonstrations were in response to the Trump administration's immigration policies and the deployment of the National Guard. On June 8, police used 1,040 projectiles against a crowd of about 6,000 people, resulting in six reported injuries. The high volume of munitions used has raised concerns among policing experts about whether the department violated state laws restricting less-lethal force.</p>

          <h2>Doubts Arise Over the Viability of Green Hydrogen as Major Projects Are Canceled</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 03:21:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The future of green hydrogen as a cornerstone of the clean energy transition is facing uncertainty as major investment deals and projects are being scaled back or canceled. A landmark agreement for Australian firm Fortescue to supply green hydrogen to German utility E.On has collapsed, and energy giant BP has abandoned a $36 billion project in Australia. The primary obstacle remains the high cost of production, which requires vast amounts of renewable electricity to be economically competitive with fossil fuels. Consequently, many now believe green hydrogen will likely serve niche industrial purposes rather than becoming a widespread fuel source.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's hopes for a deal that would eliminate the 25% tariff on its steel exports to the United States have been put on hold indefinitely. While President Trump hinted at potential relief ahead of his state visit, no agreement was reached, disappointing the British steel industry. Government sources maintain that the UK is still in a competitive position compared to other nations facing 50% tariffs. However, the failure to secure a zero-tariff quota represents a setback for UK steel producers who were anticipating improved access to the American market.</p>

          <p>The sun is approaching the peak of its 11-year cycle in 2025, leading to an increase in the intensity and frequency of solar storms. Scientists warn that a particularly powerful storm, on the scale of the 1859 Carrington Event, could have a devastating impact on modern technology. Such an event has the potential to knock out power grids, damage satellites, and paralyze global internet infrastructure, particularly vulnerable undersea communication cables. While many warnings can be overhyped, research confirms that the world's digital infrastructure is not adequately prepared to withstand a severe geomagnetic disturbance.</p>

If appointed, he would return to manage in his home country for the first time since leaving Porto for Chelsea in 2004.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese tech company Baidu surged nearly 16% in Hong Kong, reaching a two-year high, following a positive assessment of its artificial intelligence ventures. The stock rally was spurred by a ratings upgrade from an equity research firm, which cited a promising outlook for Baidu's AI chip and cloud-computing revenues. The company has been investing heavily in its AI capabilities, including its popular Ernie Bot, and has reportedly begun using its own internally designed chips to train its models. This strategic pivot towards AI is seen as a way to offset slowing growth.</p>

This resignation is the latest development in a long-running dispute that escalated in 2021 when Ben & Jerry's attempted to stop selling its products in Israeli settlements.
