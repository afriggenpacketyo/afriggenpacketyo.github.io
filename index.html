          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 10:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's unexpected tariff actions have created uncertainty in Taiwan regarding the reliability of American support, blindsiding the Lai administration, which had anticipated a maximum 10% tariff, instead facing a 32% levy, sending shockwaves through Taiwan's hi-tech manufacturing sector. This move has frustrated policymakers who believed Taiwan had already made significant contributions to the United States, including TSMC's substantial investment in Arizona and Taipei's commitment to increasing defense spending. The exclusion of Taiwan from the initial round of trade negotiations has raised questions about the island's strategic value being primarily assessed based on economic and military contributions.</p>

          <p>With the Real ID deadline approaching, U.S. travelers who lack compliant identification may face difficulties boarding domestic flights, but experts say there are alternatives, such as a valid U.S. passport, passport card, or trusted traveler cards. While about 19% of travelers lack Real ID-compliant identification, these other forms can be used, however, passengers without acceptable ID can expect delays and additional screening at airports. Travel experts recommend arriving at the airport at least 1.5 hours before the flight to account for potential security line delays as enforcement begins.</p>

          <p>Despite Trump administration efforts to hinder wind energy, the industry is experiencing a "repowering" era, where aging wind farms are being upgraded or replaced with more efficient models, creating new business opportunities for companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa. Although the growth of new onshore wind farms has slowed, the U.S. is still poised to surpass 160 GW of wind capacity in 2025, with a growing number of turbines nearing the end of their lifecycle. Repowering offers economic benefits by avoiding the need to acquire new property and increasing electricity output by up to 50%.</p>

          <p>A therapist with extensive experience working with couples identifies five common habits that can erode relationships: assuming your partner can read your mind, keeping score, passive-aggressive behavior, backseat driving their life, and listening only to respond. These behaviors create resentment, diminish gratitude, and prevent constructive communication, turning a partnership into a competition. The therapist emphasizes the importance of clear communication, giving without expecting anything in return, and supporting your partner's autonomy to build a healthy and loving relationship.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent statements after meeting with President Zelensky have offered a small glimmer of hope to Ukrainians, who have grown increasingly wary of American support. Trump questioned why Putin would continue to attack Ukraine while the U.S. is trying to broker peace, suggesting a potential shift in his approach to the conflict. This comes as the U.S. has been pushing Ukraine to accept a peace plan that would require them to abandon NATO aspirations and recognize Crimea as Russian, which Ukraine has rejected.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that President Trump's first 100 days are seen as bringing significant changes, but his focus on tariffs is weighing on his approval ratings on the economy and inflation. While he maintains support from his base, concerns about tariffs and rising prices are growing among other groups, including independents and young people. The poll also reveals a partisan divide in economic outlook, with MAGA Republicans expressing greater optimism than other Americans.</p>

          <p>The increasing reliance on phone navigation apps is leading to more people getting hopelessly lost, particularly in natural environments, as evidenced by a record number of mountain rescue callouts. The apps' shortcomings in providing detailed information and the resulting decline in spatial memory contribute to this problem. The author argues that the digital revolution has created a sense of disorientation and environmental detachment, urging people to improve their understanding of the countryside and develop better navigation skills.</p>
