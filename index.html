          <p>Israel's security cabinet has officially approved a proposal from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to expand military operations by occupying Gaza City. The plan, which aims for the "defeat of Hamas," also includes providing humanitarian aid to civilians outside combat zones and establishing a new civil administration. This decision comes amidst growing international concern over the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and appeals from hostage families to prioritize negotiations. The move signals a significant escalation in the conflict, with the government stating it chose this path over an alternative plan deemed insufficient to achieve its objectives.</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has issued a stern warning to the Philippines, urging the nation to cease "playing with fire" regarding its stance on Taiwan. The admonition followed comments from the Philippine president suggesting that his country could not remain neutral in a potential U.S.-China conflict over the island due to its geographical proximity. Beijing responded by stating that such rhetoric violates international law, undermines regional stability, and reneges on the Philippines' commitment to the one-China principle. China considers Taiwan an internal affair and firmly opposes any form of external interference.</p>

The piece defines this objective as achieving top-tier global indicators in military competition and development, ensuring the protection of national security, and possessing strong international influence. The vision requires advancements not only in weaponry and combat systems but also in military theory, personnel training, and organizational structure.

The company reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a sharp turnaround from the loss posted in the same period last year, marking its second consecutive profitable quarter. The strong performance was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, attributed to successful investments in companies like Grab Holdings and Swiggy. Several of its portfolio companies, including Lenskart and PayPay, are also expected to pursue initial public offerings soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A WNBA game between the Atlanta Dream and the Chicago Sky was interrupted when a sex toy was thrown onto the court, marking the latest in a series of similar incidents. This event follows comparable disruptions at recent games in Atlanta, Chicago, and Los Angeles, leading to arrests in some cases. In one instance, a man was arrested in Georgia and charged with disorderly conduct and public indecency for allegedly throwing toys during two separate games. Another man was arrested in Phoenix on suspicion of assault after a toy he threw struck a spectator.</p>

          <p>A violent incident in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, left a woman dead and two state troopers seriously injured after they were ambushed by a gunman. The suspect, identified as 61-year-old Carmine Faino, first shot and killed his 57-year-old neighbor, Lori Wasko, before opening fire on the responding officers with a rifle. The troopers, Joseph Perechinsky and William Jenkins, were airlifted to hospitals and are now in stable condition. The suspect was later shot and killed by police, ending the threat to the public, in what the State Police Commissioner described as an ambush.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the new figure, accusing Maduro of being a major narco-trafficker who collaborates with cartels to bring fentanyl-laced cocaine into the U.S. Maduro was first indicted on narco-terrorism charges in 2020, with an initial bounty of $15 million. Venezuela's Foreign Minister dismissed the increased reward as "pathetic" political propaganda and a desperate distraction, while the U.S. Justice Department noted it has seized over $700 million in assets linked to Maduro.</p>

Crocs' CEO noted that some shoppers are no longer even visiting their stores, and the company plans to reduce discounts, which could further impact sales. The firm also anticipates a $40 million financial hit for the rest of the year due to President Trump's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a fourth court decision blocking President Trump's executive order that seeks to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman granted a preliminary injunction, arguing the plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed in their claim that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The Trump administration contends the amendment's citizenship clause does not apply to these children, but courts have consistently blocked the policy. This ruling certifies a nationwide class of affected children, preventing the order from taking effect.</p>

          <p>Research published in Science Advances reveals that California's fire season is beginning substantially earlier and lasting longer than it did in the 1990s, a shift attributed primarily to human-caused climate change. In some areas, like the Cascade Range, the season now starts 46 days sooner. The study identifies earlier snowmelt and increased drying of vegetation from rising temperatures as the main drivers, ruling out human-ignited fires, which have decreased. This year, California has already seen over 220,000 acres burn, underscoring the growing and near-constant threat of wildfires across the state.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's directive to create a census excluding undocumented immigrants, this article explains the complexities of the constitutionally mandated process. The U.S. Constitution requires an "actual enumeration" every ten years to determine congressional apportionment, with planning for the 2030 census already underway since 2019. An attempt by the Trump administration to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census was blocked by the Supreme Court, though the door remains open for future attempts. The decennial census does not collect data on political affiliation, income, or religion, and past counts have seen underrepresentation of minority populations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, describing him as "highly conflicted" in a post on Truth Social. The demand follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton expressing concern over Tan's reported investments and business ties to numerous Chinese companies, some with alleged links to the Chinese military. The senator also highlighted that Tan was CEO of Cadence Design Systems when it illegally exported products to a Chinese military university. Intel's stock price slipped following the president's statement, and the company has not yet issued a response.</p>

          <p>Police records reveal that the man responsible for a deadly shooting in New York had a history of mental illness and two emergency psychiatric holds in Las Vegas, yet was still able to legally purchase the AR-15-style rifle he used. Nevada law does not automatically report temporary, 72-hour mental health holds to the national background check system unless they lead to a court-ordered involuntary commitment. Experts note that while Nevada has a "red flag" law that could have temporarily blocked his firearm purchases, there is no record that authorities sought such an order, highlighting a potential gap in the system.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is auctioning the Amadea, a luxurious 348-foot superyacht valued at over $300 million, which was seized from a sanctioned Russian oligarch. The vessel, currently docked in San Diego, features eight staterooms, a glass elevator, a mosaic pool, a helideck, and a marble fireplace. The Justice Department maintains the yacht was owned by Suleiman Kerimov, who was sanctioned in 2018 for his role in advancing Russia's malign activities. The sealed-bid auction requires a $10 million deposit, with the sale intended to put pressure on Russian elites close to President Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps and embracing old-fashioned, in-person singles events. Organizers of event series like Date Cincy report rising attendance, as users grow tired of the limitations and potential for misrepresentation in online dating. This trend aligns with market data showing a decline in the value of companies like Bumble and a 42% increase in attendance at singles events last year. Couples who have met at these events credit their success to the ability to connect face-to-face and gauge chemistry in a way that apps cannot replicate.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that Americans derive an average of 55% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. These foods, defined as energy-dense and low in fiber while high in salt, sweeteners, and unhealthy fats, are consumed at even higher rates by young people. The top sources of these calories include sandwiches, burgers, sweet bakery products, and sweetened beverages. This data comes as public health officials target ultra-processed foods, which previous research has linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other negative health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in prison for perjury and obstruction of justice.

PETA, which had pursued legal action against Haddix, discovered the celebrity chimp confined to a small cage with no outdoor access.

          <p>President Trump's implementation of widespread tariffs has pushed the average duty on imported goods in the U.S. to 18.3%, the highest level since 1934. The move has triggered global reactions, with nations like Brazil planning state aid for affected companies and Switzerland seeking new talks after failing to secure an exemption. The White House remains confident that the policy will stimulate domestic manufacturing and investment. However, world leaders and industry groups have expressed significant concern, with Brazil's president calling the duties "unacceptable blackmail" and a Swiss industry group describing them as a "horror scenario."

Monitored by enhanced electronic tagging, this system aims to provide victims with greater peace of mind and the freedom to travel without fear of encountering their attacker.
