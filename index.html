          <p>President Xi Jinping called for countries to unite in promoting global peace and stability, cautioning that 'there were no winners in tariff wars' in an apparent reference to the United States. Speaking at the China-Celac forum in Beijing, Xi stated that 'bullying or hegemonism only leads to self-isolation.' This message aligns with China's broader efforts to gain support from other countries, particularly in the Global South, amidst its trade war with the United States. Washington is also attempting to expand its influence in Latin America, including pressuring Panama regarding Chinese control of the canal.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed a 'total reset' in relations with China after agreeing to a 90-day pause in the trade war, with tariffs to be lowered. Wall Street responded positively, with major indices rising sharply. The first group of white South Africans granted refugee status by the Trump administration arrived in the US, sparking controversy in South Africa. Additionally, Democrats are fighting against Trump's plan to accept a luxury jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, and Hamas has freed the last living US citizen it held in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The auction of Louise Riggio's art collection at Christie's in New York saw quiet bidding and executives wiping their brows, signaling a caution flag for the art market. Experts attributed the sale's anticlimactic nature to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs, which could negatively impact the global art market. While the Riggio collection appeared to perform well with a $272 million total, the sale fell short of the auction houseâ€™s pre-sale expectations. A Monet painting of poplar trees sold well, indicating continued demand for blue-chip art.</p>

          <p>Proposed cuts by the Trump administration threaten to end decades of critical scientific research at NOAA, including the ongoing collection of CO2 samples. Professor Ralph Keeling, continuing his father's work in monitoring CO2 levels, expressed concern that these cuts would degrade the nation's ability to project the impact of climate change. NOAA's carbon sampling program collects air from all over the world, contributing to the Keeling Curve, which tracks the unchecked rise of carbon dioxide.</p>
