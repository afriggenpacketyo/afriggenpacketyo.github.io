          <p>Pay review bodies in the UK have recommended that ministers increase pay for public sector workers, including teachers and NHS staff, by as much as 4%. This is significantly higher than the 2.8% the government had budgeted for, potentially straining public finances. While Health Minister Stephen Kinnock stated the government will carefully consider the recommendations, he emphasized the need to balance the books. The government's decision could lead to renewed strikes if higher pay isn't funded adequately, especially with local elections approaching.</p>

          <p>The Children's Commissioner for England is urging the government to ban AI apps that create explicit images of children. Dame Rachel de Souza highlighted that these apps, which allow "nudification" or create deepfake images, disproportionately target girls. She calls for legal obligations on developers to address the risks to children and remove such images from the internet. The government says creating or distributing child sexual abuse material, including AI-generated images, is illegal and platforms must remove such content or face fines.</p>

          <p>Trump Coins, a venture launched by Donald Trump, claims that rising gold prices are due to his "return to the spotlight" and economic policies. However, experts suggest that the surge in gold value is actually a result of financial uncertainty caused by Trump's economic policies, including tariffs. They argue that gold prices typically rise during economic turmoil, such as trade wars or anticipated inflation. This situation highlights the conflicting interpretations of economic indicators in the context of political messaging. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Montana, a broken mental health system forces communities to use jail cells as institutions of last resort for individuals in mental health crises. Due to a lack of adequate mental health services and inpatient beds, people accused of crimes are held in isolation cells for extended periods, awaiting treatment. This situation highlights the nationwide failure to provide sufficient mental health care, with nearly half of those in local jails suffering from mental illness. The state is exploring options like jail-based stabilization services and new psychiatric hospitals, but implementation could take years.</p>

Despite promises of significant savings, DOGE has not delivered substantial efficiency or transparency, with savings claims often inaccurate and overstated. The group has reshaped the federal government through mass firings and attempts to control sensitive data, leading to legal challenges and concerns about data abuse. Musk's role is diminishing, but DOGE's impact on the federal workforce and data access remains significant.</p>
