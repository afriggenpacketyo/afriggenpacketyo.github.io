          <p>The U.S. Treasury is exploring the creation of a one-dollar coin depicting President Donald Trump for the nation's 250th anniversary, with a draft design featuring his face and the phrase "Fight, Fight, Fight" from a 2024 rally. This proposal raises legal questions, as an 1866 amendment generally prohibits living persons on U.S. currency, though a 2020 law allows for commemorative $1 coins. A Treasury spokesperson indicated the draft reflects the enduring spirit of the country, even in the face of immense obstacles. Further details on the final design are expected soon, amidst the ongoing government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez was hospitalized in Indianapolis early Saturday morning following a "physical disturbance," with reports suggesting he sustained apparent stab wounds. His agent confirmed Sanchez is in stable condition and recovering, though specific details of the incident remain limited. Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department stated two adult men, who appeared to know each other, were involved in an altercation around 12:30 a.m., resulting in one man suffering stab wounds. Sanchez, now a FOX Sports analyst, was in town for a Colts vs. Raiders game. The police investigation is ongoing, and the case will be presented to the Marion County Prosecutor's office for a charging decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Certain fruits, rich in natural hormones and minerals, can significantly improve sleep for Americans, according to board-certified dietitian Kendall Mackintosh. Tart cherries are highlighted for their high melatonin and tryptophan content, which help regulate circadian rhythms and promote sleep. Kiwi consumption has also been shown to improve sleep quality and duration in studies, particularly among elite athletes. Additionally, grapes, containing melatonin, are recommended as a beneficial, low-calorie evening snack when consumed in their natural, unprocessed form. Experts also advise reducing evening blue light exposure and maintaining a cool, dark bedroom for optimal sleep.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police arrested at least 442 individuals during Palestine Action protests in central London, which proceeded despite calls to postpone following a deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers, Defend Our Juries, supported the proscribed group, leading to extensive police intervention in Trafalgar Square and Whitehall. Amnesty International UK criticized the mass arrests, arguing they breached international human rights obligations. Jewish community figures also condemned the demonstrations as "phenomenally tone deaf" given the recent attack. The article highlights the ongoing tensions and the legal complexities surrounding support for proscribed organizations in the UK.</p>

          <p>Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard has set an unwanted Premier League record by being substituted before half-time in three consecutive starts, highlighting persistent injury woes. The 26-year-old Norwegian was withdrawn against West Ham due to a knee-to-knee collision, following earlier exits from games against Leeds and Nottingham Forest for recurring shoulder issues. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed significant concern, emphasizing Odegaard's crucial role as captain and attacking player.

          <p>Rite Aid, a prominent U.S. pharmacy chain, has announced the closure of all its remaining locations, effective immediately, as stated on its website. This decision follows a series of financial difficulties, including multiple bankruptcy filings, with the most recent in October 2023 leading to the closure of 154 stores. The company has also been grappling with declining sales and extensive opioid-related lawsuits, including a Justice Department complaint accusing it of filling unlawful prescriptions. Over 520 Rite Aid pharmacies have ceased operations since late 2023, marking the end of a business founded in 1962.</p>

In contrast, Mercedes' George Russell plans to use the system, noting team improvements in car cooling despite the dry ice melting faster in hotter conditions.

          <p>Populist Czech billionaire Andrej Babiš has won the parliamentary election, marking a significant political comeback for his ANO movement with 35% of the vote. This victory signals a potential shift in the country's foreign policy, moving away from its pro-Ukrainian stance and aligning more with pro-Russian positions adopted by Hungary and Slovakia. Babiš defeated the pro-Western coalition led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala, who had previously unseated him in 2021. The election filled 200 seats in the lower house, with other parties like STAN, the Pirates, and the Freedom and Direct Democracy party also securing significant votes, potentially forming a majority government with Babiš.</p>

          <p>Police in Tbilisi, Georgia, used water cannons and pepper spray to disperse anti-government protesters who attempted to storm the presidential palace. The demonstrations are a strong response to the ruling Georgian Dream party's victory in last year's parliamentary election, which the pro-European Union opposition claims was stolen. Since the disputed election, the government has paused talks on joining the EU and intensified a crackdown on activists, independent media, and political opposition, with many leaders now imprisoned. Tens of thousands of protesters, waving Georgian and EU flags, marched in central Tbilisi, calling for the arrest of senior ruling party figures.</p>

Curry, 53, previously led the Metropolitan Chicago Synod and aims to foster a more connected church, from local congregations to the hierarchy.

          <p>Democrats are actively countering Republican claims that their proposed funding resolution would provide "free healthcare for illegals," a narrative fueling the ongoing government shutdown. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries clarified that federal law strictly prohibits the use of Medicare, Medicaid, and ACA for undocumented immigrants. Instead, the Democratic funding patch seeks to reverse Medicaid cuts and restore access to federal health programs for lawfully present noncitizens, such as refugees and asylum seekers, who have entered the country legally. This political messaging battle shifts the debate from healthcare provisions to immigration, complicating efforts to resolve the funding impasse.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza are experiencing a profound mix of hope and fear following Hamas's conditional agreement to President Trump's peace plan. Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod is among the remaining hostages, expressed both intense expectation and apprehension about potential setbacks, recalling past disappointments. While there is a renewed sense of optimism for a deal, particularly with Trump's direct involvement, families like Eitan Horn's underscore the continued suffering and constant danger faced by their loved ones. Many emphasize the critical urgency of bringing all hostages home and finally ending the protracted war.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw has been added to the Dodgers' National League Division Series roster, marking his anticipated return to playoff action after being left off the wild-card round roster. Expected to pitch from the bullpen, Kershaw provides crucial left-handed depth to combat the Philadelphia Phillies' lineup, which includes several strong left-handed hitters. Fellow left-hander Anthony Banda also joins the pitching staff as part of an 11-man group. Catcher Will Smith remains active despite a fractured hand, though his starting status for Game 1 is uncertain. The Dodgers aim to leverage Kershaw's veteran presence and experience in what could be his final postseason series.</p>

          <p>Great Western Railway (GWR) has been fined £1 million for breaching health and safety law after 28-year-old Bethan Roper died in 2018, having leaned out a droplight window and struck a tree branch. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) prosecuted GWR, citing its failure to implement risk assessment recommendations made two months prior to the incident, which highlighted droplight windows as a significant safety risk. An inquest found a "Caution do not lean out" label to be an insufficient deterrent. Since Roper's death, the rail industry has introduced measures, including engineering controls, to prevent windows from opening on moving trains, actions welcomed by the ORR.</p>

          <p>A senior White House official inadvertently revealed plans to deploy the elite 82nd Airborne Division to Portland, Oregon, through Signal messages. Anthony Salisbury, a top deputy to Stephen Miller, was observed discussing the deployment with other high-ranking federal officials, including a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The messages indicated Hegseth sought direct approval from President Trump due to potential backlash from deploying the specialized unit to a city Trump has repeatedly labeled "war-ravaged."

Notable stock movements included Nike's strong quarterly earnings, Boeing's production updates, and the trimming of Bristol Myers Squibb shares. Analysts made big calls on other stocks, but the market's overall resilience was a key takeaway. (not investment advice)</p>

The activists, from various countries including the US and UK, were labeled "provocateurs" by Israel, which also alleged links to Hamas, though providing little evidence. The interception, condemned by world leaders, sparked major pro-Palestinian protests globally, with tens of thousands demonstrating in cities like Barcelona and Rome. This event unfolds amidst ongoing Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks, with Israel now reportedly in a defensive-only position in Gaza, not actively striking.</p>

          <p>The increasing prevalence of digital money, including cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, presents substantial regulatory challenges for global financial centers. While the UK aims to foster innovation, the US, under President Trump, is pushing for a "wild west" approach with private dollar-backed stablecoins, explicitly excluding Federal Reserve involvement. This contrasts sharply with Europe's move towards central bank digital currencies and raises concerns about potential financial instability and systemic risks, as highlighted by economists like Nobel prize winner Simon Johnson.

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is being considered for a leading role in a "Board of Peace" for Gaza under President Trump's new peace plan, a prospect that has drawn significant criticism. His controversial history, particularly his role in the 2003 Iraq War and a previous eight-year tenure as Middle East envoy that yielded little progress, makes his potential appointment contentious. Critics, including Palestinian officials and human rights rapporteurs, argue against his suitability, citing his "checkered history" and past business interests in the region. Despite the backlash, Blair described Trump's plan as "bold and intelligent" and the "best chance" for peace.</p>
