          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is working to pass a "historic" budget bill before Memorial Day, despite a failed committee vote. Johnson aims to move the bill to the Rules Committee by midweek and to the House floor by the end of the week. Some Republicans have expressed concerns about Medicaid requirements and spending, while Senator Ron Johnson has criticized the bill. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has emphasized the need to pass the bill by July 4, adding further pressure to the timeline.</p>

Rubio claims the gang is "exported by the Venezuelan regime" and contracted to murder an opposition member in Chile. This disagreement centers on the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected gang members. The Supreme Court is currently blocking the administration from deporting Venezuelan men detained in Texas under this act.</p>

A warmer-than-average start to May has accelerated the ripening process, resulting in a larger harvest. The season contrasts with 2024 when wet conditions delayed ripening.</p>
