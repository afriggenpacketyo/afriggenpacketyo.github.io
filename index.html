          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military operations in Gaza, potentially involving the occupation of additional territory. This decision comes as attempts to negotiate a cease-fire with Hamas remain stalled, with both sides holding firm on their demands.

          <p>A mainland Chinese military magazine suggests that China's developing sixth-generation fighter jet, unofficially called the J-36, could significantly impede the US military's air operations in the Western Pacific. The article claims the fighter could potentially block airspace up to 1,000km from the Chinese coast, hindering US intervention in a conflict over Taiwan. This development is seen as a response to perceived weaknesses against the American B-21 stealth bomber. The J-36 has been observed undergoing flight tests, indicating rapid progress in its development, and reflects the ongoing advancements in military technology and the evolving balance of power in the region.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the powerful impact of Lewis W. Hine's photographs documenting child labor in the early 20th century, which led to significant reforms. The article contrasts the historical context of these images with today's media-saturated landscape, where photographs often fail to generate the same outrage. As some states consider rolling back child labor laws, Hine's work serves as a potent reminder of the pain and exploitation that these laws were designed to prevent. The piece underscores the importance of remembering the past in order to protect vulnerable children from exploitation in the present.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the United States, citing concerns about the decline of the American film industry. He blames other countries' incentives for attracting filmmakers and studios, describing it as a "National Security threat". The move has sparked warnings from industry unions about the potential for a "knock-out blow" to the industry. The announcement raises questions about the scope of the tariffs and their potential impact on streaming services and American production companies filming abroad.</p>

          <p>The Israeli security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas in Gaza, potentially including capturing and holding territory. The military has called up tens of thousands of reservists in preparation for the move, aiming to increase pressure on Hamas to release hostages. The cabinet also reportedly approved resuming humanitarian aid deliveries through private companies, but this is contingent on certain conditions. Critics argue this strategy is failing, and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the plan prioritizes territories over hostages.</p>

The brain's neuronal structures change as people become more proficient in a new language, a process known as neuroplasticity.

Research indicates that young children learn new languages more easily than adults due to their brains' greater adaptability.</p>
