          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested eleven Iranian nationals across eight states and nine cities in a 48-hour operation, including one individual on a watchlist. Mehran Makari Sahel, allegedly a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) with Hezbollah connections, was among those apprehended. ICE reported that five of those arrested had prior criminal convictions, and all eleven face charges beyond civil immigration violations, posing a potential threat to public safety. In addition to the Iranian nationals, a U.S. citizen was arrested for threatening law enforcement officers and harboring an illegal alien, with officials stating the arrests are part of a crackdown on illegal immigration following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The Department of Homeland Security activated its National Terrorism Advisory System due to concerns about potential retaliation, and officials are collaborating with local authorities to address potential threats. Optimism is tempered by the serious nature of the alleged crimes and the potential for escalation, but the proactive measures taken by law enforcement provide a degree of reassurance.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, an initial glimmer of hope for de-escalation emerged, with Israel confirming acceptance of a ceasefire and Iranian state media reporting a ceasefire imposed on the enemy. Iran reportedly issued a warning before missile strikes on a U.S. base in Qatar, which some observers interpreted as a sign that a weakened Iranian regime might not want to intensify direct conflict with the U.S. However, less than three hours after Trump's ceasefire announcement, Israel claimed to have detected another barrage of missiles and vowed a forceful response, which the Iranian military denied.</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed frustration with both Israel and Iran after a ceasefire agreement he announced appeared to falter quickly, with Israel accusing Iran of launching more missiles and vowing retaliation. Trump demanded that Israel halt further bombing and ordered warplanes to return home, reportedly after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated he instructed the IDF to continue attacking Tehran due to Iran's alleged violation of the ceasefire. Iranian officials denied launching missiles after the ceasefire took effect, and Trump acknowledged that both countries had violated the agreement, though "not intentionally". The fragile situation underscores the deep-seated tensions between the two nations and the challenges in achieving a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Following recent attacks between Iran and Israel, residents in the Middle East are experiencing anxiety, frustration, and a sliver of hope as a shaky ceasefire brokered by President Trump hangs in the balance. The developments come after an Iranian missile barrage on the U.S.'s Al Udeid air base in Qatar, which closed airspace and sparked panic across the region. Some residents believe the conflict was a choreographed show, while others express fears of further escalation and the impact on daily life. Despite the uncertainty, many hope the focus will shift back to resolving the conflict in Gaza and that the region can find a path towards peace.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume expedited deportations of certain immigrants to countries other than their own, without advance warning or the chance to challenge the deportations based on potential torture or death. The court lifted an injunction issued by a federal District Court judge, enabling the administration to enforce an executive order signed in January. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, criticizing the Court's decision as an abuse of discretion. Assistant Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin praised the ruling, while the head of a legal group representing the immigrants expressed concern that it strips away critical due process protections.</p>

          <p>Increasingly aggressive immigration raids carried out by masked federal agents in Los Angeles are creating problems for local law enforcement and sowing fear among residents. The agents, sometimes using unmarked vehicles, operate without informing local police, leading to confusion and eroding trust in law enforcement within immigrant communities. Incidents involving agents pointing guns at pedestrians and detaining workers have sparked confrontations and raised questions about their authority. Local officials are calling for greater transparency and accountability from federal agencies to prevent accidental shootings and ensure the safety of residents.</p>

          <p>A 5.7 magnitude earthquake struck in waters northeast of the Dominican Republic, causing minor damage in neighboring Puerto Rico. Some neighborhoods in the northwest town of Utuado, Puerto Rico, experienced power outages. The quake occurred at a depth of 42 miles, approximately 48 miles north-northeast of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. At least a dozen aftershocks have been recorded since the initial quake. Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic are located in a region with high seismic activity due to the meeting of the North American Plate and the northeast corner of the Caribbean plate.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation impacting the economy, saving money can be a challenge, but certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way to earn returns that exceed the inflation rate. CDs allow investors to lock in high rates for the term of the CD and are generally insured by the FDIC or NCUA. While national average CD rates vary by term, some online banks offer significantly higher rates, particularly for short-term CDs. Strategies like laddering CDs and considering online banks can help savers secure the best rates and maximize their returns. (not investment advice)</p>
