            <p>China's consumer prices declined for the second consecutive month, dropping 0.1% year-on-year in March, while producer price deflation deepened, falling 2.5%, marking the largest contraction since November 2024. This data signals rising deflationary pressures as Chinese exporters face increased challenges due to escalating trade tensions with the U.S., which has ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%. However, core inflation rose slightly, and the government is considering stimulus measures focused on boosting domestic consumption to offset weaker exports, including doubled subsidies for a consumer trade-in program. The onshore yuan weakened, while mainland China's CSI 300 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose amid a broader recovery in Asian markets. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Analysts are cautioning against complacency following US President Donald Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs for most nations, describing it as a "tactical retreat" rather than a change in overall objectives. The tariffs on imports from China have been raised to 125%, intensifying the trade war between the two largest economies. Experts express concerns about the impact on global supply chains and the potential for economic disruption. One report suggests the current tariffs on Chinese products could generate significant tax revenue, but this would disappear if China ceased exporting.</p>

            <p>A Meta whistleblower, Sarah Wynn-Williams, testified before US senators that the company worked with China on censorship and undermined national security to build an $18 billion business. She alleged that Meta provided the Chinese Communist Party with access to the data of Meta users, including Americans, and built censorship tools to silence critics. Meta denies operating its services in China today, but it does generate advertising revenue from advertisers based in China. Wynn-Williams also claims that Meta capitulated to China's demands to delete the Facebook account of Chinese dissident Guo Wengui.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for most countries, while significantly increasing tariffs on China to 125%. After days of insisting on his aggressive trade strategy, Trump stated that countries that hadn't retaliated against US tariffs would receive a reprieve and only face a 10% tariff. The move follows a week of turmoil in the markets and warnings of a recession. Trump explained that the pause was ordered because “People were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy.”</p>

Streaming companies and industry groups have raised concerns about the impact of a levy on investment and competitiveness.
