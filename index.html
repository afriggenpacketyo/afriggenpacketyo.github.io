          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is currently holding approximately 59,000 detainees, a record high, as the Trump administration increases immigration arrests nationwide. According to internal data, nearly half of those detained lack a criminal record, signaling a broadening of the administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. ICE arrests have nearly doubled since the beginning of Trump's second term, with over 70% of detainees being arrested in the U.S. interior, reversing previous policies that focused on serious criminals and recent arrivals. The administration is exploring options to expand detention capacity, including converting military bases and seeking additional funding from Congress to accommodate the growing number of detainees. The current detention rate has raised concerns about ICE's ability to uphold basic standards of civil detention and due process.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's Venice wedding party has been moved from the city center to a more isolated location due to protests. Residents and pressure groups have rallied against the event, arguing that it transforms the city into a private amusement park for the wealthy. The party, expected to cost between €40-€48 million, will now be held in the Arsenale, a venue surrounded by water and more secure than the original location. Bezos is reportedly making charitable donations, including €1 million to study Venice's lagoon ecosystem, while supporters argue the event will bring significant revenue to local businesses. Protesters plan to disrupt the event, aiming to turn it into a "nightmare" for Bezos and his guests.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by several months. The Defense Intelligence Agency found that the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, with the resumption of the program depending on the time required to clear the entrances and repair infrastructure. Some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes. While President Trump claimed complete obliteration of the facilities, the assessment suggests that the underground enrichment infrastructure remains largely intact, though a complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled. The White House has disputed these findings, with the press secretary calling the assessment "flat-out wrong."</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has issued new safety recommendations to the FAA and Boeing following the 2024 incident where a door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines flight. NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy stated that the accident was due to multiple system failures, partly blaming Boeing's safety processes. The investigation revealed that four bolts meant to secure the door plug were missing, and the NTSB faulted both Boeing for inadequate training and oversight and the FAA for ineffective compliance enforcement. The FAA said it is taking the recommendations seriously and has fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing, while Boeing has expressed regret and is working to strengthen safety and quality.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's claims of complete obliteration, doubts have emerged regarding the success of the American bombing of Iran's nuclear sites. Leaks from the U.S. Defense Department suggest that the strikes may have only set back Iran's nuclear capabilities by months, with core pieces of the program remaining intact. The White House has dismissed these leaks as false, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth maintains that the bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons. Former CIA Director David Petraeus cautioned against drawing conclusions prematurely, emphasizing that battle damage assessments take time and require extensive intelligence analysis.</p>

While proponents claim that lab-grown meat can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and land use, critics argue that its environmental benefits are oversold and that reducing meat consumption is a better approach. The science behind lab-grown meat involves growing animal cells in a lab, but the process is energy-intensive and the long-term climate impact is still uncertain. Lab-grown meat has been approved for sale in some countries, but mass production faces challenges in terms of cost and scalability.</p>

Cramer argues that the initial panic over DeepSeek was an overreaction and a microcosm of situations where investors unnecessarily sell off stocks. The market's renewed confidence in AI stocks reflects a refutation of the idea that China has surpassed the U.S. in the AI race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explores the diminishing impact of scandals on voters' decisions, exemplified by the potential comeback of politicians like Andrew Cuomo. While scandals once disqualified candidates, voters now weigh them against other factors, such as experience and electability. The public's view of sex scandals has evolved, with harassment allegations carrying more weight than consensual affairs. Multiple scandals may not hurt candidates more due to the cognitive load on voters. The polarized political landscape also influences voters to support candidates they dislike if they are seen as the lesser of two evils.</p>
