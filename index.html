          <p>Chinese authorities have issued warnings regarding fire and road safety as millions travel for the Ching Ming festival, also known as tomb-sweeping day. The transport ministry anticipates approximately 760 million journeys during the three-day holiday, leading to expected congestion on major roads and 84 million rail journeys. The public safety ministry has separately reminded travelers to drive safely and be aware of potential risks from bad weather. Social media has shown photos of crowds at popular tourist spots, such as Wutong Mountain and expressways out of Shanghai, which have been gridlocked for hours.</p>

          <p>The Senate has passed a budget framework promoting President Trump's agenda, following a marathon series of amendment votes where Democrats aimed to challenge Republicans on issues like tariffs. The framework would raise the debt ceiling by up to $5 trillion and make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent. While some conservatives have expressed reservations about using a current policy baseline to score the tax cuts, Senate GOP leaders have voiced strong support for the framework. The budget would also address border funding and extend Trump's tax cuts, setting the stage for further policy and spending changes.</p>

Despite new criminal, public health, and prevention efforts, only about 300 people have gone through the official rehab program, mostly men.

          <p>President Trump has delayed a potential ban on TikTok for a second time after China reportedly stalled on a deal to sell its US operations due to disagreements over his "Liberation Day" tariffs. The initial ban was set to occur before Trump's return to the White House, but he has extended the deadline, citing the need for further approvals. The deal aims to have TikTok's US operations run by a new US-based company with primarily US investors, although Chinese government approval remains a key issue. Trump has suggested he would reduce tariffs on China to facilitate the TikTok deal.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent overhaul of US trade policy, marked by the announcement of widespread tariffs, represents a culmination of his decades-long advocacy for protectionist measures. Despite widespread concerns from businesses, economists, and politicians, Trump has consistently argued for tariffs as a means to revitalize the US economy and address trade imbalances. While early actions were limited, Trump's recent move to impose universal tariffs reflects his commitment to a vision he has held since the 1980s. However, critics warn that the tariffs could lead to increased costs for American consumers and businesses.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a potent vaccine booster called a molecular 'elevator,' which amplifies immune responses against cancer and viruses by up to 150-fold. This advancement has the potential to improve treatments for malignancies like melanoma and liver cancer, as well as enhance vaccine effectiveness against rapidly mutating coronaviruses. The system, known as SABER, efficiently delivers vaccine antigens directly to the endoplasmic reticulum, overcoming cellular barriers. Experiments have shown that it functions as a dedicated courier, accurately delivering antigens from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs, including a 10% tariff on nearly all imports, have gone into effect, contributing to continued economic fallout. More severe tariffs on imports from several countries are scheduled to take effect soon. Wall Street has reacted negatively to the announcement, with Friday marking the worst day for US stocks since 2020. Trump has dismissed concerns about the potential short-term pain for American consumers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods from Asia, where Nike produces most of its shoes, have raised concerns about potential price increases for iconic sneakers like the Air Jordan 1s. Nike's shares fell after the tariff announcement, and analysts estimate a potential 10-12% increase in prices. While Nike could absorb some of the costs, it may have to pass some of the increase on to consumers. Some experts suggest Nike could also downgrade the level of technology in the shoes or refresh designs less frequently to keep retail prices low.</p>

          <p>Financial markets experienced a significant downturn, with the Dow plunging more than 2,200 points and the Nasdaq entering a bear market, fueled by concerns about the economic consequences of new US tariffs and a potential global trade war. Economists have downgraded their forecasts for US economic growth, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has warned of higher inflation and slower growth. China's response, including tariffs on US products and restrictions on rare earth exports, has further heightened concerns. The free-fall has wiped out trillions of dollars in investor wealth.</p>

          <p>President Trump has granted TikTok a second 75-day extension to comply with a law requiring the app to either sell its US operations or face a ban. Trump stated that he does not want TikTok to "go dark" and looks forward to working with TikTok and China to close the deal. ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, said that it has been in discussion with the Trump administration but that an agreement has not been executed. The extension comes as the Trump administration tries to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership.</p>

          <p>Amidst the recent market downturn, some analysts are calling for the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates. The recent market volatility, triggered by tariff concerns, has raised anxieties about the potential for an economic slowdown. Lowering interest rates could provide a stimulus to the economy and help stabilize financial markets. However, the Fed will need to carefully weigh the potential benefits of rate cuts against the risks of fueling inflation.</p>
