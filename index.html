        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Ohio police officer was killed and two others were wounded in what authorities describe as an ambush attack in Lorain. The incident highlights a disturbing national trend of increasing ambush-style assaults on law enforcement. Data analysis reveals that at least 50 officers have been shot in such attacks this year, putting 2025 on track to surpass the previous year's total. The FBI is actively studying this rise in violence against police, emphasizing the need for constant situational awareness among officers who are facing growing threats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SHARE Act, has been introduced in Congress to incentivize public companies to distribute stock to their employees. The legislation would offer a 3 percentage point corporate tax cut to large companies that grant at least 5% of their stock to the bottom 80% of their workforce. Proponents, like Rep. Tom Suozzi, argue the bill aims to address wealth inequality, where the top 10% of Americans own 93% of stock. The plan is designed to foster employee loyalty and expand ownership to millions of middle-class Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Rep. Ralph Norman, a conservative member of the House Freedom Caucus, has officially announced his campaign for governor of South Carolina. Known as a fiscal hawk, Norman joins a crowded Republican primary field to succeed term-limited Gov. Henry McMaster. His entry sets up a competitive race where an endorsement from former President Donald Trump is expected to be highly influential. Norman, a former real estate developer and state legislator, previously endorsed Nikki Haley before shifting his support to Trump.</p>

          <p>The UK's Home Office has issued new guidance stating that single adult male asylum seekers who refuse to move from hotels to alternative accommodations will have their support withdrawn, risking homelessness. The government says this "Failure to Travel" policy targets those who "game the system" and aims to reduce the costly use of hotels for housing. This move comes amid pressure to manage the asylum system more efficiently, which currently houses over 32,000 people in hotels. Critics suggest focusing on processing claims faster and allowing asylum seekers to work would be more effective solutions.</p>

          <p>A significant cross-party group of 220 Members of Parliament has signed a letter urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The letter, supported by over half of Labour's own MPs, argues that recognition is a vital step toward a two-state solution and sends a powerful symbolic message. The call puts additional pressure on the UK government, especially after France committed to similar recognition. In response, Starmer affirmed that recognition must be part of a broader, coordinated peace plan, not an isolated gesture.</p>

          <p>This article explains the significant financial consequences of not paying off a balance transfer credit card before the 0% introductory APR period ends. When the promotional window closes, the standard interest rate, often between 18% and 30%, is applied to the remaining balance, potentially negating any initial savings. Some cards may even charge deferred interest retroactively from the original transfer date, leading to a sudden and substantial increase in debt. The article advises creating a strict payoff plan and avoiding new purchases on the card to successfully eliminate debt. (not investment advice)</p>

The timeline also covers the civil lawsuits brought by victims like Virginia Giuffre against associate Ghislaine Maxwell and the investigative journalism that reignited public interest.

          <p>A photo essay from inside New York's largest federal immigration courthouse documents the intense anxiety and emotional turmoil faced by immigrants amid the Trump administration's enforcement crackdown. The images capture moments of families being separated, as individuals attending routine hearings are apprehended by federal agents in the courthouse hallways. The practice of courthouse arrests has turned these legal spaces into sites of fear, where showing up for a hearing can lead to immediate detention. The visual timeline highlights the human cost of these policies, as lives are irrevocably changed in an instant.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ended Department of Justice investigations and consent decrees in several major cities, rolling back a key tool for police accountability. This reversal affects cities like Louisville, Kentucky, where the DOJ had found the police department engaged in a pattern of violating civil rights following the killing of Breonna Taylor. The move halts federal oversight intended to curb police abuses, a practice expanded after the 2020 racial justice protests. While some local officials have pledged to continue reforms voluntarily, critics are skeptical they can be trusted to hold themselves accountable without federal pressure.</p>

The Australian world championship leader was nearly half a second faster than Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who will start second. Piastri's teammate Lando Norris secured the third position on the grid. The impressive pace from the McLaren team, particularly in the corner-heavy second sector of the Spa circuit, suggests a new, more efficient rear wing has given them a significant advantage.

The company cited the disruptive impact of U.S. tariffs, which cost it €1.3 billion in the first half of the year, as a primary reason for the downturn. VW now expects its operating return on sales to be lower than previously forecast and anticipates full-year sales to be flat. The results highlight the vulnerability of European automakers to global trade disputes and the challenges of transitioning to electric vehicles, which currently have lower profit margins.
