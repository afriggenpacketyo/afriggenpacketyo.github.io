          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's dedication to preventing an "ongoing inflation problem," even amidst criticism from President Trump. Powell indicated that policymakers would likely remain cautious until they better understand the impact of tariffs on prices, characterizing economic growth as strong with the labor market near full employment. He reiterated that policy changes are constantly evolving, and their effects on the economy remain uncertain, while defending the Fed's independence from political pressure. House members questioned Powell on the criteria for a rate cut, to which he responded that data collected over the summer would be necessary to assess the potential inflationary effects of tariffs.

          <p>Two European brown bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park near Exeter, prompting an evacuation and a "code red" emergency procedure. The bears, weighing about 180kg each, made their way to the food store and consumed a week's worth of honey, remaining calm and not breaching any public areas. Trained firearms staff and police were deployed, and Lucy was eventually lured back with her favorite foods after about 55 minutes of roaming. An investigation has been launched to determine how the bears escaped, as there were no signs of damage to the enclosure.</p>

Despite opposition from over 120 Labour MPs, Starmer insists on pressing ahead with the reforms, citing the current welfare system as "unsustainable." The proposed changes would tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payments (Pips), requiring claimants to demonstrate a higher need for assistance with daily tasks.

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court order preventing the Trump administration from deporting migrants to third countries without providing them an opportunity to raise fears of torture or persecution. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, with Sotomayor accusing the government of "flagrantly unlawful conduct." The Department of Homeland Security hailed the ruling as a victory for American safety, allowing them to deport illegal aliens to willing countries. The ruling comes amid ongoing legal battles over the administration's efforts to swiftly deport migrants, including those under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.</p>

          <p>Longevity expert Dan Buettner suggests that diets with less protein may extend life expectancy, citing figures showing Americans consume more protein than recommended. He points to research indicating that low-protein diets are beneficial, especially in middle age, and recommends about 3g of protein for every 10 pounds of body weight. Plant-based proteins are highlighted as particularly important, with beans, legumes, and nuts being excellent sources. Studies suggest that high protein intake in younger individuals may be linked to increased risks of cancer and mortality.</p>

          <p>A gay anti-bullying PSA from the late 2000s, featuring Hilary Duff, has become a cult classic due to its memorable message and over-the-top style. The PSA, part of GLSEN's "Think B4 You Speak" campaign, aimed to combat the use of "that's so gay" as an insult. The ad's success is attributed to Duff's popularity, the support of the Advertising Council, and its early presence on social media platforms. The campaign led to a decrease in the use of the phrase and a reduction in bullying rates, according to GLSEN data.</p>
