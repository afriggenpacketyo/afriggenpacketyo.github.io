          <p>The Ukrainian president expressed readiness to meet with Russia's leader in Turkey, contingent on an immediate truce. This comes as President Trump advocated for Ukraine to accept Russia's proposal for direct talks, diverging from the European leaders' plan for a 30-day cease-fire deadline and potential sanctions. Amidst these diplomatic maneuvers, President Zelensky introduced a new element by offering to personally attend negotiations, setting the stage for potential talks in Turkey. However, Russia resumed long-range drone attacks on Ukraine, complicating the already delicate diplomatic situation and underscoring the challenges in achieving a lasting resolution. Optimism surrounding the potential for peace is tempered by ongoing military actions and divergent diplomatic strategies.</p>

          <p>A woman was arrested in Laurel, Maryland, after driving her car through barriers and into a crowd at the Main Street Festival. The incident occurred hours after a propane explosion injured one person during vendor setup, leading to the cancellation of the festival's parade. Body camera footage shows the woman, identified as Kai Deberry-Bostick, arguing with a police officer before removing caution tape and driving into the festival area, striking the officer. No festival-goers were harmed due to the rapid response of law enforcement, and the propane explosion is believed to be accidental.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer has announced plans to reform the UK's immigration system, including stricter English tests for visa applicants and their adult dependents. Migrants will need to wait ten years before applying for settlement, instead of five, with a faster track available for skilled workers like nurses and engineers. The proposals aim to create a controlled, selective, and fair system, with critics warning that stricter language requirements could split families. The changes are part of a broader effort to tighten immigration rules, with the government also planning to end overseas recruitment for care workers.</p>

          <p>California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara is considering a formal inquiry into State Farm General's handling of Los Angeles wildfire claims, following numerous complaints from survivors about delays, difficulties in toxic substance testing, and low cash offers. The commissioner's office has previously conducted similar investigations after other large fires. State Farm claims it is focused on helping customers recover and has paid over $3.4 billion to customers as of May 5. The potential inquiry comes as State Farm awaits a decision on its request for an emergency rate hike, and follows a letter from the department seeking information on how the California FAIR Plan Assn. is handling smoke damage claims.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the royal family of Qatar to use as Air Force One. The administration plans to retrofit the plane for Trump's official use and transfer it to his presidential library foundation after his second term. The offer has raised legal and ethical questions, but the White House insists it complies with all applicable laws. The move comes as Trump expressed frustration over delays in modernizing existing Air Force One aircraft.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is reportedly donating a jumbo jet for President Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane, but the plane needs to be checked for security and spying devices before it is accepted. The plane will be donated to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office. A Qatari spokesperson said it was “inaccurate” to say that the jet would be gifted “during the upcoming visit of president Trump”. A Democratic representative has called for an ethics investigation into the gift.</p>
