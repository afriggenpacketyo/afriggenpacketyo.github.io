            <h2>Oil Prices Dip Following OPEC's Revised Demand Forecast Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

            <p>U.S. crude oil prices experienced a decline after OPEC adjusted its demand growth forecast downwards due to concerns over President Trump's tariffs. OPEC's report indicated a reduction of about 150,000 barrels per day in demand growth estimates for both this year and the next. Despite an initial price surge prompted by Trump's tariff exemptions on key tech products, recession fears have contributed to an overall price decrease of over 14% since early April. Goldman Sachs projects West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude to average $59 and $63 per barrel, respectively, for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump and his trade officials created confusion regarding tariff plans, particularly concerning exemptions for reciprocal tariffs on electronics. Initially, exemptions were announced for electronics like phones and computers, but Trump and Commerce Secretary Lutnick suggested these could be reversed soon. The exemptions, intended to benefit tech companies like Apple, were cast into doubt, raising uncertainty about the administration's trade policy. Democratic lawmakers criticized the changes for causing "chaos" and damaging Trump's credibility.</p>

            <p>Critics are voicing concerns that proposed Republican Medicaid cuts could severely impact fentanyl addiction treatment programs, potentially affecting over a million Americans receiving care. Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act has become a leading source of insurance for addiction treatment. Experts warn that these cuts could reverse progress made in reducing drug overdose deaths, which have significantly decreased in recent years. House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested limiting Medicaid eligibility for certain groups, including young men, who are disproportionately affected by drug overdoses.</p>

            <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that the U.S. has received "amazing" trade deal offers from over ten countries after President Trump imposed tariffs. Hassett also asserted that there is "100% not" a chance of a U.S. recession in 2025. He denied any insider trading by Trump or White House officials ahead of the tariff adjustments. Hassett's optimism contrasts with a survey indicating that most U.S. CEOs expect a recession within six months.</p>

            <p>A Saturday Night Live skit mocking Aimee Lou Wood's teeth has drawn criticism for relying on outdated stereotypes about British dental health. The comedian Athena Kugblenu argues that the joke's premise is dishonest, as Wood's teeth are not unhealthy. The skit, part of a wider parody of the Trump administration, has been deemed "mean and unfunny" by Wood herself. The controversy highlights the complexities of satire and the importance of truth and cleverness in comedy.</p>
