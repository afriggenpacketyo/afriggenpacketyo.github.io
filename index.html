            <h2>China Criticizes Nations Appeasing US Trade Demands Amid Tariff Disputes</h2>

            <p>A Chinese official has condemned countries for allegedly attempting to appease the United States in trade negotiations concerning President Trump's tariffs. This criticism arises from reports that the U.S. plans to pressure other governments to restrict trade with Beijing in exchange for exemptions from U.S. import taxes. The Trump administration has initiated tariff talks with various trading partners, including Japan and South Korea, after imposing significant tariffs on Chinese imports and levies on goods from other nations. The Chinese spokesperson asserts that these negotiations are unfair and disadvantageous to China.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing scrutiny after allegedly sharing details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen within a private Signal group that included his wife, brother, and personal attorney. The messages reportedly contained flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets tasked with striking Houthi targets, mirroring information shared in a previous Signal chat that inadvertently included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief. The Defense Department spokesperson has stated that no classified information was shared in any Signal chat, but the incident raises concerns about the handling of sensitive military information by senior officials.</p>

            <p>Dominik Mysterio achieved a significant milestone at WrestleMania by winning the Intercontinental Championship in a fatal four-way match against Finn Balor, Penta, and Bron Breakker.

This marks Mysterio's first Intercontinental Championship reign and his first main-roster singles title, solidifying his position in WWE. The match included interference from Carlito and showcased Breakker's power before Mysterio seized the opportunity for the win.</p>

            <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has decided to keep its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%, as it focuses on stabilizing the yuan amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. This decision follows China's report of better-than-expected economic data for the first quarter, allowing the central bank room to maintain steady rates. The move aligns with economists' expectations and reflects a cautious approach to monetary policy in the face of external pressures, as the Chinese onshore yuan was trading flat following the announcement. </p>

            <p>This article analyzes the second season of HBO's "The Last of Us," focusing on the death of Joel and its impact on Ellie. The show deviates from the game by providing Abby with a more explicit motive for killing Joel, diminishing the shock value. While the first season explored the building of bonds in impossible circumstances, the second season delves into the fracturing of those bonds and the cyclical nature of violence. The show's unrelenting cheerlessness and focus on undiluted pain make it a punishing watch, lacking the elegant insights of the first season.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for a Chinese airline has been returned to Boeing's U.S. production hub due to increased costs resulting from tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The jet, which was destined for Xiamen Airlines, landed in Seattle after China retaliated against increased U.S. tariffs with its own levies. This situation has created uncertainty for aircraft deliveries, with some airline CEOs considering deferring deliveries rather than paying the duties. This action underscores the tangible impacts of trade tensions on specific industries and international commerce.</p>

            <p>In Japan, "friendship marriages," nonsexual unions offering practical benefits like social security, are gaining traction despite contradicting traditional norms. A Tokyo-based agency has facilitated over 300 such marriages in the past decade, exemplified by Satsuki and Minato, a couple in their 30s who chose this arrangement. Satsuki, attracted to women, sought a partnership that bypassed societal pressure for marriage, while Minato, attracted to men, desired companionship without romantic involvement. This trend reflects evolving values and a response to the lack of legal recognition for same-sex marriage in Japan.</p>

It argues that China is not eager to negotiate and recognizes that the U.S.'s strategic goal is to systematically strangle China's economic rise, not merely rebalance trade. The author proposes that China should focus on resolving its own economic weaknesses, particularly the fragmentation of its domestic market, to weather the economic war with the U.S.</p>

The rollout of the scheme, aimed at providing 30 hours of childcare per week for eligible working parents, has not been the panacea many hoped for, with some areas becoming "childcare deserts". Private nurseries are facing increased operating costs, and local authority-run nurseries are declining, raising concerns about access to childcare for disadvantaged children and the impact on child development.</p>

            <p>Mortgage rates are expected to decrease over the next year, potentially enabling more people to become homeowners. There are various ways for first-time buyers to save for a deposit and enter the housing market, including Lifetime ISAs and low-deposit mortgage options. Shared ownership schemes and "income boost" mortgages, where family members can increase borrowing potential, are also available. Experts recommend starting to save early and exploring different options to find the best fit. (not investment advice)</p>

            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 20:17:45 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Men are less likely to visit doctors than women, often delaying seeking medical help until symptoms become severe. This reluctance is attributed to societal expectations of masculinity, which emphasize self-reliance and discourage vulnerability. Concerns about appearing weak and appointment systems that don't accommodate working patterns also deter men from seeking medical care. Experts emphasize the importance of addressing these barriers to improve men's health outcomes and encourage preventative care.</p>

            <p>President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has proposed a prisoner exchange with Venezuela, offering to repatriate hundreds of Venezuelans deported from the United States in exchange for the release of Venezuelan "political prisoners."

The offer includes several named political prisoners and nearly 50 detained citizens from other countries, including the U.S., but the Venezuelan government has not yet responded. The proposal comes amid scrutiny of El Salvador's willingness to accept deported migrants.</p>

            <p>India's roads are among the world's deadliest, with over 172,000 fatalities in 2023, averaging one death every three minutes. The crisis stems from a combination of human behavior, enforcement gaps, and systemic neglect, including over-speeding, lack of safety precautions, and driving without a valid license. Poor civil engineering practices, flawed road design, and substandard construction also contribute to the high accident rate. The economic burden of road crashes costs India 3% of its annual GDP.</p>
