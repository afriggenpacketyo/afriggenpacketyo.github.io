          <p>Oisin Murphy, a prominent jockey, has been charged with drink driving and failing to cooperate with police following a car crash in Hermitage, Berkshire, in April. The 29-year-old was arrested after his Mercedes A Class crashed into a tree. He is due to appear at Reading Magistrates' Court on July 3, facing charges related to driving over the prescribed alcohol limit and obstructing a preliminary roadside test. The incident occurred on April 27, raising concerns about Murphy's conduct and adherence to legal standards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of South Carolina, allowing the state to block Medicaid funds from Planned Parenthood. The court found that Planned Parenthood and a patient cannot sue the state to enforce the Medicaid Act's any-qualified-provider requirement. This decision reverses a lower court ruling and potentially opens the door for more states to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs. The ruling does not involve abortion directly, but it arrives amid ongoing efforts by Republican-led states to restrict Planned Parenthood's access to Medicaid funds, as South Carolina bans abortion after six weeks gestation.</p>

          <p>A panel has determined that two Metropolitan Police officers committed gross misconduct in the strip-search of Child Q, a 15-year-old Black schoolgirl, at her school in Hackney in 2020. The girl, suspected of possessing cannabis, was searched without an appropriate adult present and while on her period, causing her significant trauma. While the panel acknowledged that Black people are disproportionately stopped and searched by police, they did not find that race was a factor in this specific case. The Met Police has apologized for the incident, acknowledging organizational failings and inadequate training around strip-search procedures.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans faced a setback as the Senate parliamentarian ruled against a key provision in their tax and spending package related to state taxation of Medicaid providers. The parliamentarian determined that the proposed change did not meet the rules for passage with a simple majority, jeopardizing a $15 billion rural health stabilization fund intended to offset the costs of the bill's tax cuts. Democrats hailed the ruling as a victory, estimating it removes over $250 billion in healthcare cuts from the bill. Republicans, however, are seeking alternative solutions to achieve the desired savings, emphasizing that the issue is not as significant as Democrats claim.</p>

          <p>Congressman Ro Khanna is calling on the Democratic Party to reclaim its identity as the anti-war party, particularly in the wake of recent U.S. military actions in Iran. Khanna argues that the Democratic Party's foreign policy, including support for Israel's war in Gaza, has alienated young voters. He believes that opposing wars and focusing on domestic job creation is both morally correct and politically advantageous, and he has partnered with Republican congressman Thomas Massie to sponsor a war powers resolution requiring congressional approval for military action against Iran. Khanna contends that most Americans oppose foreign wars and increased defense spending, favoring instead investments in their communities.</p>

This back-and-forth mirrors a similar incident earlier in the month, where Norton expressed her desire to run before her office clarified that a final decision was pending. Norton has served as the D.C. delegate in the House since 1991, participating in committees and legislative debates but lacking the ability to vote on bills in the full House.</p>

          <p>This article explores the challenges faced by volunteer emergency medical services (EMS) in small U.S. towns. With an aging volunteer base and fewer young people signing up, these agencies are struggling to maintain adequate staffing.

Experts suggest that paying volunteers for their time could be a solution to attract and retain more individuals, ensuring the continued provision of essential emergency services in these communities.</p>

Mamdani's support for socialist policies and wealth redistribution clashes with Wall Street's preference for deregulation and low taxes. Some sectors of the stock market, particularly regional banks and office-focused real estate, have already experienced negative impacts due to the prospect of a Mamdani-led administration.</p>

He explores various scenarios, including a possible succession by Khamenei's son, the rise of hard-liners, or a shift towards a more pragmatic, developmentalist approach focused on economic integration with the West.

The prosecution rested after calling 34 witnesses, including Cassie Ventura Fine, who testified about alleged abuse and forced participation in "freak-offs." The defense presented a brief case, arguing that Combs' sexual habits do not amount to sex trafficking and that Ventura Fine was a willing participant.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US economy experienced a greater contraction than initially estimated in the first quarter of 2025, with real gross domestic product falling by 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department. This decline primarily reflects downward revisions to consumer spending and exports, partly due to a surge in imports ahead of President Trump's tariffs. The import influx, driven by businesses stockpiling goods, is not expected to repeat in the second quarter, with economists anticipating a rebound in GDP growth. Trump's upcoming tariff deadline in July adds uncertainty to the economic outlook (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asserted that the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites was a "historically successful attack" and criticized media coverage that he claimed was focused on undermining President Trump. Hegseth condemned the leak of a Defense Intelligence Agency report suggesting the damage was limited, emphasizing that it was a preliminary assessment. CIA Director John Ratcliffe stated that Iran's nuclear program has been "severely damaged," while Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard claimed that Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed. Gen. Dan Caine of the Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed that the strikes went according to plan, but deferred battle damage assessment to intelligence agencies.</p>

          <p>London's West End production of Evita, playing at the Palladium theater, has gained attention for its unique staging. During Act Two, Rachel Zegler, who plays Eva PerÃ³n, performs "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" on a balcony, with the music piped outside and the performance livestreamed into the theater. This has attracted large crowds outside the theater, drawing comparisons to the real PerÃ³n's appeal to the masses. The production's unconventional approach is characteristic of director Jamie Lloyd and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, who sought to involve the public in the show.</p>

Experts had suggested the phone would likely be manufactured in China due to the lack of an advanced supply chain for smartphones in the U.S. The phone's specifications have also been updated since its initial announcement, with changes to the screen size and RAM.</p>
