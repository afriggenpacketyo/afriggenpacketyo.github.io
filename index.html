          <p>A tragic bus accident in Kano State, Nigeria, resulted in the deaths of at least 21 athletes who were returning from the National Sports Festival held in Ogun State. The bus, carrying over 30 passengers, reportedly lost control on the Chiromawa Bridge along the Kano-Zaria expressway. Authorities suggest that fatigue and excessive speed may have contributed to the crash, which also left several others injured. The state governor has declared a day of mourning and pledged financial support to the families of the victims, with the President also acknowledging the festival's role in promoting national unity. The incident highlights the ongoing issue of poor road conditions and lax traffic enforcement in Nigeria, where road accidents are frequent. Optimism about road safety improvements is low given the historical trends.</p>

          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that the Trump administration remains confident that courts will uphold its tariff agenda, despite recent legal setbacks. Hassett conveyed this assurance following an appeals court decision to reinstate President Trump's tariffs after a previous court order had blocked them. The initial injunction was based on the court's interpretation that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The White House contends that the court order could impede progress in ongoing trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Celebrations in France following Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League victory were marred by violence, resulting in the deaths of two fans and injuries to a police officer, who is now in a coma. A 17-year-old was stabbed in Dax, and a man in his 20s died in Paris after his scooter was hit by a car, while a police officer in Coutances was critically injured by fireworks. Over 550 people were arrested nationwide, with nearly 500 in Paris, as authorities deployed thousands of police officers and used tear gas and water cannons to control crowds.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump shared a post on Truth Social claiming that President Joe Biden was executed in 2020 and replaced with clones. The post, originating from a small account on the platform, alleges that "Biden clones, doubles and robotic engineered soulless, mindless entities" are being presented to the public. Trump did not add any commentary to the post, simply sharing the link. This comes amid controversy over Biden's health, following his announcement of stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer. The incident adds to the ongoing political tensions and misinformation surrounding Biden's health. The spreading of conspiracy theories is a low point in American politics.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-01 09:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the gendered dynamics of working from home, suggesting that men often disproportionately claim dedicated workspace in heterosexual couples. It references Helen Garner's diaries and Jessica Stanley's novel to illustrate how women's work can be subtly sidelined in domestic spaces. The article cites research indicating that women experience more interruptions and less access to unshared workspaces, impacting their emotional well-being and professional lives. It draws a parallel to Virginia Woolf's "A Room of One's Own," arguing that despite progress, intimate domestic spaces remain stubbornly unequal. The article advocates for greater awareness and equity in the allocation of workspace to address the ongoing challenges women face in balancing work and home life.</p>

          <p>The UK's upcoming defense review will send a "message to Moscow" by outlining plans to deter "growing Russian aggression," according to Defence Secretary John Healey. The review is expected to conclude that the UK faces a "new era of threat" and will commit Â£1.5 billion to build six new munitions factories. Healey noted that Russia launches cyber-attacks on UK military networks "every day." The increased defense spending is intended to strengthen the armed forces and boost British jobs.

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an infrared contact lens that converts infrared light into visible light, enabling humans to see in the dark. The lenses combine conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles consisting of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. The upconversion contact lenses (UCLs) convert infrared light with wavelengths between 800 and 1,600 nanometers into visible light. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses allow users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals in the dark, even with closed eyes. This innovation holds potential applications in surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations. The innovation provides new possibilities for human vision.</p>
