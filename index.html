        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's nearly $87 billion exports to the U.S. are threatened by new 50% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, effective Wednesday. These significant levies are a direct response to India's continued oil purchases from Russia, a move that is expected to substantially diminish the allure of Indian exports compared to regional competitors. Analysts predict a material impact on India's economy, potentially slowing GDP growth from 7% to closer to 6% this year and next. The article details the vulnerability of major export sectors such as engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, gems, and textiles, underscoring India's challenge in diversifying its trade partners.

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have announced their initial 53-man roster for the upcoming NFL season, confirming Trey Lance as the backup quarterback to Justin Herbert. Head Coach Jim Harbaugh has largely shaped a settled roster, though 25 players, including eight veterans, were waived, and several were placed on injured reserve. This article provides a comprehensive breakdown of the team's composition across all positions, highlighting new talent like running backs Omarion Hampton and Najee Harris, and veteran receiver Keenan Allen. The depth behind starters, particularly on the offensive line, remains a question mark, and the team anticipates further roster adjustments even after this initial selection.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott expressed strong confidence that star pass rusher Micah Parsons will suit up for the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles, despite an ongoing contract standoff. Parsons has been designated as a training camp hold-in, skipping team practices while awaiting a new long-term deal from the Cowboys. Although owner Jerry Jones has publicly stated his stance against trading Parsons, Prescott believes the situation is not a locker-room distraction. However, cornerback Trevon Diggs conveyed less certainty, acknowledging Parsons has trained independently but ultimately desires to be with his teammates for the season.</p>

          <p>Microsoft called for police intervention to remove protesters who had improperly entered a building at its Redmond headquarters, demonstrating against the company's alleged work with the Israeli military in the context of the Gaza conflict.

          <p>A funeral director in Leeds, Amie Upton, has been banned from NHS maternity wards and mortuaries following a BBC investigation that uncovered her practice of keeping babies' bodies at her home. One mother described her profound distress upon discovering her deceased three-week-old son in a baby bouncer "watching cartoons" in Upton's living room. Another bereaved couple, Sharon and Paul, also learned their stillborn daughter was at Upton's house, not a funeral parlor as they had been led to believe, raising concerns about proper temperature storage. This article highlights the critical issue of the unregulated funeral industry in England and Wales, where there are no legal requirements for body storage or professional qualifications.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has finalized settlements with a group of current and former FBI agents who alleged they were disciplined for expressing personal and political views, including those concerning the January 6 Capitol riot and COVID-19 vaccine mandates. Empower Oversight, representing the agents, announced resolutions for ten cases, with eight settlements concluded in the last two weeks. The outcomes include three agents returning to FBI duty, others opting for voluntary retirement, and some receiving back pay and benefits. This article underscores the persistent internal disputes within the FBI regarding accusations of politicization during the Biden administration, a claim that leadership has consistently denied, and the broader challenges of maintaining institutional impartiality.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Skeptical Tariffs Alone Can Revive US Furniture Manufacturing</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed strong skepticism that President Trump's recently announced investigation into furniture imports and potential tariffs would be sufficient to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. Cramer argued that many of these industries are unlikely to return, as the country has favored a cheaper import supply chain for years, leading to a significant loss of a skilled domestic workforce. He suggested that higher tariffs would predominantly lead to price increases on products rather than a resurgence of local production, citing companies heavily reliant on foreign sourcing. The article highlights Cramer's view that while some domestic manufacturers like Ethan Allen might see a temporary advantage, the long-term impact on national security or job creation in this sector is questionable.

          <p>Millions of UK households are preparing for an anticipated rise in gas and electricity prices this autumn and winter, with regulator Ofgem scheduled to announce its latest price cap. Analysts forecast a slight annual increase of approximately 1%, signaling another season of relatively high energy bills for consumers. The Ofgem price cap, which determines the maximum unit charge for about 21 million households, is adjusted every three months, primarily reflecting wholesale energy market costs. This article notes that while government support measures like the expanded Warm Home Discount are available, campaigners warn that many families continue to struggle with energy debt accumulated during previous periods of high prices.

          <p>President Donald Trump's declaration that he would fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook has created significant unease in global markets, sparking concerns about the central bank's historical political independence. Cook, the first African-American woman on the Fed board, whose 15-year term is set to expire in 2038, has publicly stated her intent to sue, asserting that the president lacks the legal authority for her removal. This article provides crucial context, detailing the Federal Reserve's dual mandate, Cook's extensive economic background, and the legal complexities surrounding the "for cause" clause for governor removals. The move is widely perceived as part of Trump's broader campaign to pressure the Fed for lower interest rates, with potential profound long-term ramifications for U.S. economic policy.

          <p>This article presents an analytical perspective on how Donald Trump's consistent dissemination of falsehoods and his efforts to erode objective truth could ultimately undermine his own credibility and the functioning of governance. It highlights recent events, such as the FBI raid on John Bolton's home and the attempted firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, as instances where public skepticism is heightened due to Trump's history of actions and appointments. The piece argues that this "fire hose of falsehoods" fosters political nihilism, making it increasingly difficult for the public to believe the government, even when conveying critical information like public safety warnings. This, the article suggests, ultimately obstructs the efficiency of the governmental system.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported and subsequently re-arrested, have filed an emergency motion to reopen his immigration case to seek asylum in the United States. Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was deported to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison despite a 2019 court order prohibiting it due to fear of persecution, and is now detained in Virginia. His lawyers contend that his re-entry makes him eligible for asylum and that he fears persecution and torture if deported to Uganda, a country the government indicated as a potential destination. This article highlights the complex legal battle, with attorneys accusing government officials of "vindictive and selective prosecution" and attempting to coerce an involuntary plea.</p>
