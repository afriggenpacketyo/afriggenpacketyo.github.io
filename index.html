          <p>Shares of Toyota Industries experienced a significant drop after the Toyota Group announced a $33 billion deal to take the company private. This move comes amid increasing pressure on Japanese firms to unwind long-standing cross-shareholding ties, with the Financial Services Agency advocating for their reduction. The deal involves a tender offer of $26 billion for shares of Toyota Industries at 16,300 yen apiece, lower than the previous closing price. While the deal is seen as positive for the Toyota Group in the long term, some analysts suggest the offer is unattractive, noting it falls below the valuation range provided by independent financial advisers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia's economy experienced slower-than-expected growth in the first quarter, expanding by 1.3% year-on-year, which is below the estimated 1.5% growth. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the soft growth to reduced public spending, weakened consumer demand, and decreased exports. In response, the Reserve Bank of Australia previously lowered rates to 3.85% to stimulate growth, but the first-quarter GDP release may prompt further monetary policy easing. Despite these challenges, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index saw a rise following the GDP release, and the Australian dollar remained stable.</p>

          <p>A man was arrested after attempting to scale a fence at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. The man allegedly told local police he hoped to speak with Mr. Trump about "the gospel" and wanted to marry his 18-year-old granddaughter. The Secret Service detained the individual without incident, and he was subsequently charged with trespassing by local police. Mr. Trump was not present at the club during the incident, and there were no Secret Service protectees present at the time.</p>

Two senior government watchdogs, the Domestic Abuse Commissioner and the Victims Commissioner, jointly wrote to Starmer, highlighting that victim support services are being pushed to the brink due to funding cuts and rising costs. This intervention precedes the chancellor's spending review, which is expected to feature cuts to some areas of public spending.
