          <p>The UK government approved expansion plans for London Luton Airport, nearly doubling its annual passenger capacity to 32 million by 2043.  This decision comes despite the Planning Inspectorate's recommendation against expansion due to environmental worries.  Supporters cite significant economic benefits, including job creation and increased revenue for the local council. Opponents, however, highlight the detrimental impact on the environment and residents' quality of life due to increased air traffic.</p>

          <p>Hungary announced its intention to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Budapest.  This decision follows the ICC issuing an arrest warrant for Netanyahu for alleged war crimes.  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n, a close ally of Netanyahu, criticized the ICC's impartiality, while Netanyahu expressed gratitude for Hungary's support. The move is seen as a defiance of international law and a challenge to the ICC's authority.</p>
