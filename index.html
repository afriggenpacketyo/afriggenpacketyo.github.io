        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "numbskull" and urging him to lower interest rates. Trump claimed that a two-percentage-point rate cut would save the U.S. $600 billion annually, expressing frustration that Powell had not taken such action. His remarks followed a Labor Department report indicating that U.S. producer prices rose less than anticipated in May, which has intensified pressure on the Fed to act. Despite Trump's remarks, markets remained largely unmoved, with traders pricing in minimal chances of a rate cut in the near term.</p>

          <p>Debt collectors may illegally "re-age" old debts, resetting the clock to make them appear newer and pursue collection more aggressively. This tactic violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act and can negatively impact credit scores.

To combat this, individuals should dispute inaccuracies with credit bureaus and report violations to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Medical debt financing companies are offering services to struggling rural hospitals as congressional Republicans consider healthcare cuts that could leave millions without insurance. These companies act as intermediaries between hospitals and patients, aiming to facilitate payments from "subprime patients," including the uninsured and low-income. They charge hospitals fees for their services, while also offering financing options to patients, including payment plans and interest-bearing loans. Critics raise concerns about whether these companies prioritize financial products over hospitals' charity care programs for eligible patients.</p>

          <p>Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats are requesting an investigation into top Justice Department official Ed Martin over his plans to "shame" political opponents of President Trump and other actions. They are concerned about Martin's intention to abuse his roles as lead of the "Weaponization Working Group" and as DOJ’s Pardon Attorney. Durbin's letter requests Bondi provide a host of records related to Martin's appointment and early days as head of the Weaponization Working Group and Pardon Attorney's Office.

          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of a Georgia family whose home was wrongly raided by the FBI, stating that their case can proceed under an exception to law enforcement immunity. The family was previously unable to sue for damages due to this immunity. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the opinion, allowing the case to move forward. The decision clarifies the scope of law enforcement immunity in cases of mistaken identity and property damage.</p>
