          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett states she is not afraid despite facing routine protests, harassment, and death threats, including being a target in an assassination plot against Justice Kavanaugh. In a recent interview, she explains that she has developed a businesslike detachment from the protests, refusing to reward threats with an emotional response. Barrett emphasizes that her judicial philosophy, rooted in originalism and analytical reasoning, requires her to separate her decisions from emotion, public opinion, or political pressure. This disciplined mindset allows her to focus on interpreting the law for future presidencies, not just the current one.</p>

          <p>At 70 years old, Colombian marine biologist Elvira Alvarado, known as the "mother of Colombian corals," is leading a critical mission to save the nation's endangered coral reefs. Witnessing the devastating effects of climate change and pollution, which have killed over half of Caribbean coral since the 1970s, she has turned to an innovative solution. Alvarado and her team are using in-vitro fertilization to collect eggs and sperm from stress-resistant corals, raising the hatchlings in nurseries before transplanting them to regenerate the reefs with hardier varieties, ensuring her legacy continues through the new generation of scientists she has mentored.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent, seemingly random popularity of items like Labubu dolls and Dubai chocolate highlights a major shift in how consumer trends are formed in the age of algorithmic social media. Unlike past fads such as Beanie Babies, which had traceable origins in marketing and new commerce platforms like eBay, today's trends often lack clear cultural context. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels prioritize highly stimulating, visual content that grabs attention instantly, causing niche products to go viral without traditional tastemakers. This phenomenon creates a decontextualized, rapidly changing consumer culture that can feel nonsensical to those outside the algorithmic loop.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a massive overnight attack on Ukraine, firing over 50 missiles and hundreds of drones that killed at least five people and left tens of thousands without electricity. The strikes targeted energy infrastructure and civilian areas across multiple regions, including a deadly attack in Lviv that killed four members of one family. The intensity of the assault near the Polish border prompted Poland's military to scramble its fighter jets to secure its airspace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the aerial terror and reiterated his urgent call for more advanced air defense systems from allies.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced that police will be given broader powers to manage and place conditions on repeated protests. Under the new rules, senior officers can consider the "cumulative impact" of previous demonstrations at a specific location, allowing them to instruct organizers to move their event elsewhere or limit its duration. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the move is about balancing the right to protest with the community's right to live without fear or intimidation.

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has defended her leadership approach, stating she is willing to pay a short-term "price to pay" in opinion polls to get her party's policies right. Speaking as the party conference begins, she argued that unlike Labour and Reform UK, she refuses to rush out announcements without thorough consideration of their impact. Badenoch insists that this patient, methodical strategy will "pay off eventually" and is a necessary departure from previous governments that won elections without a solid plan. She frames her approach as a way to build a more stable and effective political foundation for the future.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are continuing intense strikes in Gaza City, with one attack reportedly destroying Al-Azhar University. Israel's Defense Minister has threatened to escalate military pressure if Hamas refuses to release all remaining hostages, suggesting news of their return could come soon. This military action persists despite ongoing ceasefire negotiations based on a proposal from U.S. President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, a coalition of eight foreign ministers, including those from Qatar and Saudi Arabia, has praised Hamas's positive response to the peace proposal, signaling complex international dynamics surrounding the conflict.</p>

Critics, who had flagged the implausible findings to the journal over a year ago, say the retraction was long overdue.

          <p>An opinion piece characterizes Donald Trump's recent speech to the nation's top military commanders at Quantico as a disaster, arguing it was an unprecedented act of humiliation. The author contends that Trump belittled the senior officers as failures, insulted their appearance, and failed to comprehend their constitutional duty to remain non-partisan, which they demonstrated with their silent discipline. The article asserts that Trump's primary goal was to enlist the military in a new domestic mission against his political opponents, viewing the armed forces as his personal pawns rather than defenders of the nation.</p>

          <p>According to a recent analysis, President Donald Trump's aggressive rollback of clean energy policies and his fervent promotion of fossil fuels are causing the United States to lag significantly in the global transition to renewable energy. By withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, dismantling environmental protections, and actively working to halt wind and solar projects, the administration is ceding technological and economic leadership to competitors, particularly China. This approach has already slowed clean energy adoption in the U.S., costing jobs and risking the nation's long-term energy dominance, according to experts cited in the article.</p>

After a period of granting the administration temporary wins on emergency appeals, the court will now conduct a full review on the merits of these cases.

To gain the four seats needed for control, Democrats must win toss-up contests in Michigan, North Carolina, and Georgia, defend their own vulnerable seats, and capture at least one Republican-held seat in states like Ohio or Texas, where the party has historically struggled.</p>

          <p>Despite recent sales growth, the United States is falling behind other major markets like China and Europe in the adoption of electric vehicles. Analysts attribute this lag to several factors, including comparatively weaker government support and the recent expiration of a significant $7,500 federal tax credit, which is expected to cause a sharp drop in demand. While EV sales hit a new high in August, the overall market share remains lower than in many other developed nations. High tariffs on Chinese-made EVs have also kept lower-cost options out of the U.S. market, contributing to higher average prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of 300 National Guard members to Chicago, citing what the White House described as "ongoing violent riots and lawlessness." This action follows similar deployments in other U.S. cities like Portland and Washington. The move was strongly condemned by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who called it an "outrageous and un-American" ultimatum and a "manufactured performance" rather than a genuine effort to ensure public safety. The deployment represents a significant escalation in the federal government's response to local protests and civil unrest.</p>

          <p>A British doctoral student at Cornell University has written a personal account of his decision to self-deport from the United States after his pro-Palestinian activism led to severe repercussions. The student was banned from campus after a brief protest, and as the Trump administration targeted non-citizen protesters, he went into hiding and eventually fled. His fears were confirmed when he received notifications that his student visa was terminated and that Google had provided his data to the Department of Homeland Security. His story highlights concerns about the use of surveillance technology and the suppression of free speech for non-citizens.</p>

          <p>Ethan Mbappe, the 18-year-old brother of global soccer superstar Kylian, is beginning to forge his own path after moving to French club Lille.

Praised for his calm demeanor and football intelligence, the young midfielder is now aiming to emerge from his famous brother's considerable shadow. Having recently scored his first goal for his new club, he is set to face his former team, PSG, in an upcoming match.</p>

          <p>In the investigation into the murder of Kenneth Fandrich at an Intel campus parking garage, detectives faced a critical setback when a key piece of evidence was nearly lost forever. Police believed the victim was killed inside a maroon minivan, which the suspect later abandoned. After tracing the vehicle's VIN, a detective raced to a metal scrapyard only to be shown a video of the minivan being crushed into scrap just a week earlier. The case highlights the challenges investigators face in preserving crime scenes, especially when they are mobile and can be quickly disposed of.</p>

          <p>Four years after its controversial Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone a significant transformation, marked by modernized facilities, a Carabao Cup victory, and consistent Champions League qualification. However, the club's vast wealth has not translated into unchecked spending due to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), which limit financial losses. This has forced a more gradual build compared to previous takeovers like Manchester City's. The club must now focus on growing its commercial revenue to create more financial headroom and compete with the league's established elite. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese central government has earmarked 200 million yuan (US$28 million) for disaster recovery efforts in the southern provinces of Guangdong and Hainan, which were struck by Typhoon Matmo. The storm, which made landfall as a severe typhoon, brought strong winds and heavy rain, forcing authorities to relocate over 150,000 residents in Guangdong ahead of its arrival. The typhoon also caused the suspension of rail services in Hainan during a peak holiday travel period. Matmo is the 21st typhoon to affect China this year and triggered the highest-level red alert from the national weather authority.</p>

          <p>Germany's government is launching a "Modernization Agenda" to embed artificial intelligence across its public administration, aiming to cut bureaucracy costs by 25% by 2029. Key initiatives include using AI to streamline export regulations for businesses and to expedite the review of visa applications. While officials champion AI as essential for future growth and efficiency, some experts express concern. They caution against over-reliance on American technology, such as the new partnership between Germany's SAP and OpenAI, and stress the need for independent, science-guided oversight to ensure responsible and ethical implementation.</p>

          <p>South Africa has won the Rugby Championship for the second consecutive year, securing the title with a final-day victory over Argentina. The tournament was highly competitive, with all four southern hemisphere teams earning two wins in the opening four rounds. The Springboks' success is notable as coach Rassie Erasmus used 47 different players, successfully building squad depth with emerging young stars. While New Zealand fell short, they also integrated new talent, Australia showed improvement under a new coach, and Argentina struggled to maintain the consistency they displayed last year.</p>
