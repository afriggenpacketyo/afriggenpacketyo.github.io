          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has formed off the coast of South Carolina, prompting storm warnings for coastal regions of the Carolinas. The National Hurricane Center predicts the storm will make landfall early Sunday, bringing heavy rainfall of two to four inches, with localized amounts up to six inches. This rainfall poses a significant risk of flash flooding. The storm currently has sustained winds of 50 mph, and while little change in strength is expected before it reaches the coast, it is forecast to weaken rapidly after making landfall.</p>

Singer Shakira announced a donation from her San Antonio concert proceeds to Catholic Charities, while San Antonio-based USAA and the NFL's Houston Texans have each pledged $500,000. These funds are directed towards search, rescue, and recovery operations for the victims of the flood, which has resulted in numerous fatalities and left many people, including children from a summer camp, missing.

          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has announced the launch of a new political party, the "America Party," positioning it as an alternative to the traditional two-party system in the United States. The announcement, made on his social media platform X, follows a recent and public falling out with President Donald Trump, for whom Musk was previously a key financial backer and advisor. Musk, who is ineligible to run for president, has not named a leader for the party, and it is unclear if it has been formally registered with the Federal Electoral Commission. The move is framed as a response to what he describes as a "one-party system" of wasteful spending.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in the Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 43 deaths, including 15 children, with search and rescue operations ongoing for 27 missing girls from a summer camp. The tragedy occurred when the Guadalupe River rose approximately 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming Camp Mystic and surrounding areas. Governor Greg Abbott stated that responders are assuming all missing individuals are still alive, though officials acknowledge the chances of finding more survivors are diminishing. The event has prompted a massive response involving over 1,700 personnel, who have rescued about 850 people so far amid warnings of more heavy rain.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million plan to establish "Best Start" family hubs in every local authority across England by April 2026. These hubs are designed to provide a wide range of support services for families, from midwifery and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs. The initiative aims to support an additional 500,000 children in disadvantaged areas, building on a previous rollout of 400 hubs in 75 local authorities. While the government touts it as a "lifeline" for families, the opposition has questioned how much of the plan is new versus a rebranding of existing services.</p>

          <p>After an eight-year legal process, a jury has found Monica Sementilli guilty of murdering her husband, beauty executive Fabio Sementilli, in 2017. Prosecutors successfully argued that she conspired with her lover, Robert Baker, to kill Fabio in a staged home invasion to collect on a life insurance policy. Key evidence included thousands of texts between the lovers, data showing Monica monitoring her home's security cameras during the murder, and a secretly recorded conversation where she appeared to admit culpability. Baker had previously pleaded no contest to the murder, while Monica's defense maintained she was only guilty of having an affair and was unaware of the murder plot.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Pulitzer Prize-winner Ron Chernow, simply titled "Mark Twain," delves into the life of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, one of America's most influential writers. An excerpt from the book recounts Twain's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River, the setting that defined much of his early life and work. Traveling incognito to gather material, he found the experience of piloting a steamboat again to be a profound, dreamlike return to a cherished past. The article notes that this return highlighted a central paradox of Twain's life: the more famous and worldly he became, the more he longed for the "vanished paradise" of his youth.</p>

The rules are designed to standardize the policy coordination and review processes for top-level party organs, such as central commissions and leading groups. According to state media, the new framework directs these bodies to focus on "planning, discussing and checking on major matters." One analyst noted that this formalization of power structures could potentially hint at Xi's long-term succession planning.</p>

The new charges follow the 2023 discovery of Suzanne's remains and a toxicology report that found a combination of tranquilizer drugs, known as BAM, in her bone marrow. The indictment states that Barry Morphew, an avid hunter, was the only private citizen in the area with access to this specific drug compound, which he had admitted to using on deer. Initial murder charges against him were dropped in 2022, but the case was refiled after this new evidence came to light.</p>

          <h2>Timeline Reveals How Fast-Moving Texas Flood Overwhelmed Camps and Residents</h2>

          <p>A detailed timeline of the Texas flooding event reveals how quickly a devastating situation unfolded, catching many by surprise. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch on Thursday afternoon, but the warnings escalated dramatically in the early hours of Friday, with a "particularly dangerous situation" alert sent at 4:03 a.m. By then, the Guadalupe River was already rising at an incredible rate, swelling 26 feet in less than an hour. This rapid surge of water inundated riverside summer camps and homes before many residents, most of whom were asleep, could react to the alerts, leading to a catastrophic loss of life.</p>

          <h2>Texas Officials Face Scrutiny Over Warnings and Preparations for Deadly Floods</h2>

          <p>In the aftermath of the catastrophic flash floods that killed at least 43 people, Texas officials are facing intense scrutiny over their preparedness and the timeliness of public warnings. While the National Weather Service issued escalating alerts, including a rare flash flood emergency, some residents and local officials claim they did not anticipate the severity of the deluge. Questions are being raised about why summer camps along the river were not evacuated sooner and whether a more robust local alert system, which the county had previously considered but deemed too expensive, could have saved lives. Officials have defended their actions, insisting no one could have predicted the flood's unprecedented intensity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New images have provided the first complete view of a mysterious Chinese wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) vehicle, often called an Ekranoplan. The large, flying-boat-hulled aircraft was spotted on a pier in the Bohai Sea and appears suited for littoral missions like resupply, search and rescue, or even anti-submarine warfare. These craft fly efficiently on a cushion of air just above the water, allowing them to travel at high speed while staying below radar horizons. While details about its propulsion system remain unclear, the aircraft's development signifies a modern renaissance for a technology largely pioneered by the Soviet Union.</p>

          <p>A walker in the UK's Peak District has gained viral attention for posting a video of himself kicking over man-made stone stacks. The man, Stuart Cox, argues the stacks are environmentally damaging, as they are often built with stones taken from historic walls that serve as habitats for small creatures and insects. His actions have sparked a debate, with many supporting him while others have sent threats. The Peak District National Park Authority has confirmed that the stacks are detrimental, damaging historic features and disrupting the local ecosystem, and that their prevalence has increased in recent years.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores President Trump's Use of Unpredictability as a Foreign Policy Tool</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that President Donald Trump is strategically employing the "Madman Theory," using his own perceived unpredictability to coerce concessions from both allies and adversaries. This approach, where a leader convinces others they are capable of anything, has seemingly yielded results, such as prompting NATO allies to drastically increase defense spending. However, the article questions the long-term effectiveness of this doctrine, noting it could backfire by making the U.S. an unreliable negotiator or by being ineffective against determined foes like Iran. The strategy centralizes foreign policy on Trump's temperament, fundamentally reshaping America's global relationships and the world order.</p>

          <h2>The Pros and Cons of the UK's Lifetime ISA Savings Product</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Lifetime ISA (LISA), a savings product offering a 25% government bonus for first-time home buyers or retirement, is a source of divided opinion. While some savers have successfully used it to fund a home purchase, others have been penalized by its strict rules. Key criticisms focus on the £450,000 property price cap, which has not been updated since 2017 despite rising house prices, and the penalty for early withdrawal, which can cost savers a portion of their own contributions. Critics, including financial experts and a committee of MPs, are calling for reforms to make the product fairer and more flexible for young savers.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of people participated in a 15-mile "Run Against ICE" through Los Angeles to protest federal immigration raids that have impacted local communities. The run wound through neighborhoods significant to immigrants, including Koreatown, MacArthur Park, and Chinatown, expressing outrage and solidarity with those affected by detention and deportation. Participants described the aggressive nature of the raids as "terrifying and unacceptable" and felt a duty to show support for detained individuals and their families. The event, which passed the Metropolitan Detention Center, was a defiant response to recent enforcement actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
