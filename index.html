          <p>This NPR article discusses the sweeping changes President Trump has made to federal agencies working on climate change, including lifting regulations on fossil fuels, slashing budgets, and shifting directives. These changes are framed as serving everyday Americans by creating jobs, lowering the cost of living, and boosting the U.S. economy. The article raises questions about what everyday Americans are trading away in the process, particularly in terms of environmental protection and climate change mitigation. The article suggests that the changes could have negative consequences for Americans. ()</p>
