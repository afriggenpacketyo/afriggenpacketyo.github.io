          <p>During Liverpool's Premier League victory parade, a driver plowed into a crowd of pedestrians on Water Street, injuring 47 people, including four children, one of whom sustained serious injuries.

          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla visited Canada at the invitation of Prime Minister Mark Carney, marking Charles’s first visit since his coronation two years prior. The visit is viewed as a subtle rebuke to President Trump, who has repeatedly suggested Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. Carney emphasized Canada's distinct heritage and sovereignty, a sentiment echoed by Canadians who see the monarchy as a symbol of their history separate from the United States. During the visit, King Charles will open Canada's Parliament and deliver the speech from the throne, asserting Canada's independent future. </p>

          <p>Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of at least 52 people, including 36 at a school-turned-shelter, prompting renewed concerns about humanitarian aid access. The Israeli military stated it targeted a militant command center inside the school, while Hamas officials reported that a father and his five children were among the dead. Humanitarian groups say that the amount of aid entering Gaza is insufficient to meet the population's needs, with the U.N. describing it as a "drop in the bucket." A new U.S.-backed aid system faces criticism and the resignation of its American head, raising questions about its independence and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed increasing frustration with Vladimir Putin, calling the Russian leader "absolutely crazy" as Russia launched its largest drone attack on Ukraine since the war began. Trump criticized Putin for needlessly killing people and warned that conquering Ukraine would lead to Russia's downfall. Despite this criticism, Trump also reiterated his frustration with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. While the Russian government downplayed Trump's remarks, some European leaders expressed hope that this shift in tone would translate into action, calling for tighter sanctions on Russia and an end to the war.</p>

          <p>California Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragán urged the Federal Communications Commission on Monday to follow through on plans to modernize the federal emergency alert system and provide multilingual alerts in natural disasters for residents who speak a language other than English at home. The call comes nearly five months after deadly fires in Los Angeles threatened communities with a high proportion of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders — some with limited English proficiency — highlighting the need for multilingual alerts.</p>

          <h2>Trump's FCC Delays Multilingual Emergency Alerts, Sparking Concern in Los Angeles</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's FCC has delayed enabling multilingual Wireless Emergency Alerts for severe natural disasters, prompting deep concern from California Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragán. The delay jeopardizes the ability of communities with limited English proficiency to receive life-saving emergency information in their native languages. Barragán argues that the delay is indefensible and dangerous, particularly in regions like Los Angeles with diverse immigrant populations and high risks of wildfires and earthquakes. The FCC was supposed to publish an order allowing Americans to get multilingual alerts months ago, but the Trump administration's regulatory freeze has stalled the process.</p>

Rocket launches are loud, and big rockets are louder. Launches used to be occasional spectacles, and not many people minded the noise. Dr. Gee and his team have also listened to the noises of other rockets, including the small Alpha rocket from Firefly Aerospace, the first launch of NASA’s giant Space Launch System rocket, the last flight of the Delta IV Heavy from United Launch Alliance and U.L.A.’s soon-to-be retired Atlas V.</p>

As rocket launches become more frequent, the noise, including sonic booms from returning boosters, is increasingly affecting residents. Researchers are studying why Falcon 9 boosters generate a three-part sonic boom and how topography influences sound wave propagation. The goal is to gather data that could help lessen disruptions before problems become pervasive, especially as SpaceX tests the larger and potentially louder Starship rocket.</p>

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd told reporters the two deputies were trying to de-escalate the situation before the man, identified as 42-year-old Timothy Schulz, climbed into their running patrol vehicle and tried to get the weapons inside. That's when the deputies opened fire, Judd said.</p>

          <p>Through more than 18 months of war in Gaza, Israel has faced intense criticism from foreign leaders and aid groups but has rarely experienced sustained public censure, let alone concrete repercussions, from its close allies. But the shift in the tone of their messaging, coupled with some small practical limits on Israeli interests, indicates that Israel’s strongest partners are beginning to lose patience with Mr. Netanyahu. So far, Israel appears unmoved. Responding to the European threats, Gideon Saar, the Israeli foreign minister, said that his country would take its own “unilateral measures” if further steps were taken against Israel.</p>
