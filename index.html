          <p>Thousands of Orange Order members and spectators have participated in annual parades across Northern Ireland to commemorate the 335th anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne. The event, a significant celebration of Protestant tradition and Ulster-Scots heritage, saw large gatherings in Belfast, Keady, and other locations. Officials and participants described the day as peaceful and successful, highlighting it as a positive expression of cultural identity that brings diverse communities together. The parades proceeded largely without incident, with a notable peaceful atmosphere even in historically contentious areas.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek claimed her first Wimbledon championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 win against American Amanda Anisimova in a final lasting just 57 minutes. This victory marks Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title and makes her the first woman since 1911 to win a Wimbledon final without dropping a single game. Anisimova, playing in her first major final, struggled with nerves, committing numerous unforced errors. Swiatek's win on grass, her previously weakest surface, solidifies her position as one of the game's top players.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary report into the Air India Flight 171 crash, which killed 260 people, has revealed a perplexing cockpit conversation just before the disaster. Seconds after takeoff, both fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position, leading to a total loss of engine power. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so. Investigators are now focused on determining who manipulated the switches and why, as this action is highly unusual and unlikely to be accidental.</p>

          <p>A trading card shop in New Bedford, Massachusetts, was robbed of more than $113,000 worth of rare Pokémon cards during an early morning break-in. The thief, captured on surveillance footage, appeared to target specific high-value items, including a Skyridge Crystal Charizard and a 1st Edition Shadowless Blastoise. The store's owners have shared information about the stolen cards, which are serialized and can be tracked, with the community. No arrests have been made, and the owners have temporarily closed the shop to regroup.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched a large-scale overnight attack on Ukraine, firing hundreds of drones and multiple cruise missiles, resulting in at least six deaths and dozens of injuries. The strikes targeted several regions, including Chernivtsi and Lviv in the west, as well as the northeastern city of Kharkiv. Ukrainian officials reported that while their air defenses intercepted a significant number of the projectiles, falling debris and direct hits caused casualties and damage. The attacks represent an escalation in Russia's long-range bombing campaign amid its efforts to advance on the front line.</p>

          <p>Military experts suggest Russia's recent intensification of missile and drone attacks on Ukraine serves two primary strategic goals: crippling Ukraine's military-industrial complex and demoralizing the civilian population. With expanded domestic drone production, Russia is now able to launch massive, combined assaults intended to overwhelm air defenses and terrorize citizens. Analysts believe these attacks are precursors to a potential new summer offensive, aimed at pressuring the Ukrainian government and breaking the country's will to fight. The strategy highlights Russia's reliance on military force to achieve its objectives.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have responded defiantly to President Trump's announcement of a 30% tariff on all EU goods, set to begin August 1. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the bloc will take all necessary steps to safeguard its interests, including adopting "proportionate countermeasures" if required. Leaders from France, Germany, and the Netherlands echoed this sentiment, calling the move concerning while expressing hope that a negotiated agreement can still be reached. The announcement has escalated trade tensions, with European industries like automotive and agriculture bracing for significant impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New online safety regulations are set to take effect in the UK, legally requiring tech platforms to prevent children from seeing harmful content like pornography and material promoting self-harm. The rules, enforced by Ofcom, will mandate age verification systems, with non-compliant companies facing substantial fines. However, the measures are already facing criticism for not covering private messaging, AI chatbots, or misinformation. While campaigners and parents who lost children to online harms see it as a step forward, many, including some in government, acknowledge the rules are already outdated and need further updates.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's visit to flood-stricken central Texas, a panel on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed the administration's approach to federal disaster response. Panelists noted that while Trump can be effective at mobilizing resources, his style differs from predecessors, focusing less on personal empathy and more on touting his administration's actions. The discussion highlighted a shift toward relying more on state and local officials rather than a robust federal-led response. This change in approach marks a potential new direction for how the U.S. government handles natural disasters.</p>

Legal scholars note that the president cannot revoke the citizenship of a U.S.-born individual due to the 14th Amendment.

          <p>According to author James Patterson, who has written a new book on the Idaho murders, Bryan Kohberger may have believed he could commit the "perfect murders." Patterson suggests that Kohberger, an intelligent but socially awkward criminology student, likely experienced "tunnel vision" during the crime, causing him to make a critical error. This mistake was leaving a knife sheath at the scene, which contained the DNA that ultimately led investigators to identify and arrest him for the killing of four university students. Kohberger recently pleaded guilty to the crimes.</p>

Third parties in the U.S. have historically struggled to win seats, typically succeeding only in influencing the platforms of the main parties.
