            <p>A Gaza hospital was reportedly struck by an Israeli airstrike, leading to significant damage to its intensive care and surgery departments, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Witnesses described chaotic scenes as patients and staff evacuated the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, which was already struggling to function after the destruction of other medical facilities in Gaza City. The IDF claimed they are investigating the incident following the health ministry's statement condemning the attack on the hospital, which housed hundreds of patients and medical staff. This attack follows a previous incident in October 2023 where the same hospital was hit, resulting in numerous casualties.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is actively supporting a recall campaign to oust opposition lawmakers, aiming to reclaim control of the legislature. This move is driven by the DPP's frustration with the current legislative balance, where the Kuomintang (KMT) holds a majority, potentially leading to political instability. The DPP needs to successfully unseat at least six district-based KMT legislators to regain a working majority. The campaign has intensified amid legislative gridlock, with the DPP accusing the opposition of obstructing key government initiatives.</p>

            <p>The article analyzes the UK's relationship with Donald Trump in light of recent tariff disputes, questioning the wisdom of aligning too closely with a leader perceived as unreliable. It highlights the potential for a global recession due to Trump's tariff war and suggests Britain should instead strengthen ties with the EU for economic and security reasons. The piece emphasizes that Trump's actions demonstrate he cannot be trusted, regardless of efforts to appease him. It also notes the historical distrust between Europe and the US, and the need for coordinated efforts to avoid economic damage.</p>

Doctors are investigating the rejection, noting a prior infection and changes in her immune-suppressing medication may have contributed to the organ's failure.

The report argues that Washington needs a more strategic approach to compete with China's growing influence in the region. Indonesia's policy of strategic autonomy, balancing security ties with the US and economic ties with China, is becoming increasingly challenging due to decoupling trends.

            <p>Donald Trump's recent decision to exempt smartphones and computers from tariffs has provided a reprieve for big tech companies and global markets. The initial imposition of tariffs on various goods had sparked concerns about rising consumer prices and trade wars. This exemption signals a potential shift in the administration's approach to trade negotiations, possibly indicating a willingness to compromise on certain issues. However, the long-term effects of these policies remain uncertain and could have significant implications for global trade relationships. (not investment advice)</p>
