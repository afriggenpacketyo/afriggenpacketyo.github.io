          <p>A documentary produced by high school students in New Mexico delves into the atrocities committed by Japan's Unit 731 during World War II, a secret group that conducted inhumane experiments on people in China and other parts of Asia. The students' research highlights not only the unit's horrific acts but also America's role in suppressing information about these war crimes. The project, showcased at the National History Day contest, aims to deepen understanding of the past and promote critical thinking, questioning how this history is taught in US schools today. The students hope their work will shed light on this dark chapter of history and encourage a more comprehensive understanding of wartime atrocities.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England permits teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate routine tasks like marking and writing letters to parents, aiming to free up time for face-to-face teaching. The Department for Education emphasizes transparency and checking AI results, limiting its use to low-stakes assignments. While AI offers opportunities for efficiency, concerns remain about data breaches and marking errors, with teachers advised to avoid fully outsourcing tasks. The guidance represents a significant step in integrating AI into education, balancing its potential benefits with necessary safeguards.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of 2,000 additional National Guard troops to Los Angeles, prompting a lawsuit from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who claims the federalization of the National Guard is unlawful.

Trump responded by suggesting he would support arresting Newsom for obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions.

          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the deployment of the state's National Guard to respond to protests in Los Angeles, calling it an "unprecedented power grab."

The state contends that the law cited by the Trump administration does not apply to the protests and that local police have effectively managed any violence. The lawsuit also claims the use of National Guard forces has heightened tensions and created unnecessary provocation.</p>

The water industry is increasingly concerned that farmers may refuse the sludge, prompting lobbying and contingency plans.
