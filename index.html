          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline following Iran's missile strike on the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which resulted in no reported casualties, leading investors to believe that de-escalation is possible. U.S. crude oil futures fell by 6.13% to $69.31 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent decreased by 6.08% to $72.33. The strike was in retaliation for U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, but Qatar confirmed that its air defenses intercepted the missiles, preventing any casualties. Analysts are closely monitoring the potential for further destabilization in the region, particularly regarding the Strait of Hormuz, which is crucial for global oil supply.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Summer 2025 presents opportunities for homeowners to tap into their home equity for expenses like vacations, tuition, or home improvements, but strategic decision-making is crucial. Homeowners should understand the differences between a home equity loan, which disburses equity in a lump sum with a fixed interest rate, and a HELOC, which functions as a revolving line of credit with variable interest rates. Shopping around for rates and terms is essential, as is using the borrowed equity for financially sound purposes like paying off high-interest debt rather than discretionary spending. Utilizing home equity strategically can improve financial health in the long run. (not investment advice)</p>

Medvedev had criticized the U.S. strikes on social media, downplaying their impact on Iran.

          <p>Novo Nordisk is ending its partnership with Hims & Hers Health, ceasing Wegovy sales on the platform due to concerns over "deceptive marketing" practices. The pharmaceutical company alleges that Hims & Hers sold illegitimate versions of Wegovy, posing a risk to patient safety. This decision comes shortly after the companies announced a "long-term collaboration" to improve access to obesity treatment. Novo Nordisk stated that Hims & Hers failed to comply with laws prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs under the guise of personalization.</p>

Cramer pointed to the rise in U.S. oil production as a key factor in the measured reaction, suggesting that the U.S. is unlikely to face substantial oil supply shocks.

The U.S. operates several military bases in the region, including the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which has already been targeted.
