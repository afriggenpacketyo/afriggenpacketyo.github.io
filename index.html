          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA Commissioner review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill, raising questions about its safety. The review comes after concerns were raised by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which published a report claiming the pill causes serious adverse events in women. Medical experts, however, argue that the report lacks transparency and uses questionable definitions of adverse events, such as normal bleeding after medication abortion. The Supreme Court previously rejected a challenge to mifepristone's availability in 2024, preserving access to the drug (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation to ban travel from certain countries, citing national security risks. The ban fully restricts entry from 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and Iran, while partially restricting entry from seven others, such as Burundi, Cuba, and Venezuela. Exceptions will be made for lawful permanent residents, adoptions, dual nationals, and those traveling on diplomatic, U.N., or NATO visas, among others. This action follows an attack in Boulder, Colorado, and is reminiscent of Trump's earlier travel bans, which were challenged in court but ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Munchkin, a baby products company, is facing significant challenges due to increased tariffs on steel and aluminum. The company's CEO, Steven Dunn, stated that the tariffs, which have doubled from 25% to 50%, are making products like baby spoons unaffordable due to an 80% cost increase. As a result, Munchkin has had to lay off workers and is considering discontinuing some products. Dunn argues that the tariffs are harming parents and small businesses, and manufacturing in the U.S. is not currently feasible.</p>

Musk argues that the bill would increase the US budget deficit and burden Americans with debt.

The program has been criticized for tracking U.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes. The circumstances that place individuals on the Quiet Skies list and the process for removal have been largely concealed from the public. The husband of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen was reportedly on the watchlist in 2023 and was removed shortly after she contacted the TSA's then-director.</p>
