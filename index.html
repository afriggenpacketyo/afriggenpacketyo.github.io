        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Crime Agency (NCA) is initiating a nationwide operation to target and imprison perpetrators of child sexual assault, particularly those involved in grooming gangs. This initiative aims to provide long-awaited justice to victims whose cases were previously mishandled and prevent further harm to children. The operation will also focus on improving how local police forces investigate these crimes and ending the culture of denial within local services regarding the prevalence of such abuse. The Home Office stated that over 800 historic cases have been reopened since January, and a national inquiry will be launched to investigate mishandling and cover-ups by various agencies and officials, ensuring accountability for past wrongdoings. The inquiry will have the power to compel investigations and call witnesses to hearings, marking a significant step towards addressing group-based child sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the world's major economic powers convened in the Canadian Rockies for a G7 summit amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, as well as unresolved trade disputes led by the U.S. President. The summit, hosted by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, will forgo the traditional joint statement due to disagreements, particularly regarding tariffs. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has engaged in discussions with Trump and Netanyahu to de-escalate the crisis, with expectations for further intense discussions during the summit. Other leaders invited include those from India, Ukraine, Brazil, South Africa, South Korea, Australia, Mexico, and the UAE, with avoiding tariffs remaining a key concern for many attendees.</p>

          <p>Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were fatally shot, while State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were wounded in targeted shootings at their homes. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, was apprehended after a manhunt and faces murder and attempted murder charges. Authorities believe the shootings were politically motivated, with the suspect impersonating a police officer to gain access to the victims' homes. A search of the suspect's vehicle revealed a list of potential targets, including other lawmakers and officials, along with flyers referencing anti-Trump protests. The incident has sparked widespread condemnation of political violence, with officials emphasizing the importance of compromise and civil discourse in a politically charged environment.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, further aligning with U.S. trade policy amidst rising tensions with Beijing. The International Trade Administration of Taiwan included Huawei and SMIC on its "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to these entities. This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions already followed by companies like TSMC and tightens potential loopholes. The Taiwanese government's decision comes amid tense geopolitical relations with Mainland China, which views Taiwan as its territory. China has called for national reunification with Taiwan and opposition to Taiwan independence.</p>

Ohtani underwent right elbow surgery following that last appearance, keeping him off the mound since then. His return is earlier than initially expected due to injuries within the Dodgers' bullpen.

The CEOs expressed hope for de-escalation, acknowledging the significant effects of recent events on forward prices. Concerns remain about potential disruptions to supplies through the Strait of Hormuz, which could lead to more significant price increases as customers worldwide scramble to meet their energy needs.

          <p>Shared ownership schemes, intended as a stepping stone to property ownership, are facing increasing discontent due to rising complaints regarding repairs, costs, and selling difficulties. Some shared owners report feeling trapped, lacking the rights of homeowners while bearing the obligations of renters. Complaints to the housing ombudsman have surged by almost 400% in the past five years, with common issues including increasing service charges and slow repair completion. The Housing Ombudsman and campaign groups advocate for improved transparency, communication, and addressing fundamental inequities in the design of shared ownership schemes to better protect shared owners.</p>

          <p>Hospice staff are at the center of the debate surrounding the assisted dying bill, which would allow terminally ill adults with six months or less to live to medically end their lives in England and Wales. Many support assisted dying, saying it would give terminal patients autonomy, while others worry about pressure on patients and advocate for improved palliative care. Hospices, largely funded by charity, face uncertainty over how legalizing assisted dying would affect their services and express concern about funding shortages. Staff emphasize the importance of informed choices for patients, including both assisted dying and palliative care options, as the debate progresses.</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos experienced a significant surge following a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion by a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC).

Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, absent a superior proposal. This bid comes as XRG seeks deals in natural gas, chemicals, and lower-carbon energy solutions, offering Santos a potentially successful takeover after past unsuccessful attempts.

          <p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iranâ€™s supreme leader, faces a challenging situation as Israel's air offensive prompts defiance from Tehran, though neither appears likely to halt the Israeli attacks. Khamenei's careful and pragmatic approach is now strained as his coalition of Islamist militias is effectively shattered, leaving him with few good options. Born into a modest background, Khamenei rose through the ranks of the radical regime following the 1979 revolution, consolidating power and deploying proxies to project influence. His legacy is marked by pragmatism in advancing the principles of the revolution, but he now faces ailing health and increasing challenges to his leadership.</p>

          <p>Japan has asked eight countries and regions to block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites, aiming to curb illegal gambling. Gambling with overseas-based betting sites is a crime in Japan, prompting the government to address the issue by urging operators to cut off access. This move follows media revelations of professional athletes and celebrities using online casinos, with a police survey estimating over 3 million people in Japan have gambled online. The government plans to tighten regulations by prohibiting websites from directing traffic to casino sites and will reiterate its request to the involved nations after a new law is enacted.</p>

          <p>Oil prices have increased due to concerns that the conflict between Israel and Iran could disrupt global oil supplies. Crude oil prices settled higher following news of the conflict, with traders particularly worried about potential Iranian actions to disrupt supplies through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait is a critical shipping lane for about a fifth of the worldâ€™s crude consumption, and any blockade could significantly raise oil prices. Tensions have also sparked fears of supply shortages, shifting concerns from oversupply to limited spare capacity among major producers.</p>
