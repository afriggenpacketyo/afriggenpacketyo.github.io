          <p>A powerful earthquake in Myanmar caused significant damage and casualties, particularly in Naypyidaw.  In Bangkok, tremors led to a building collapse, resulting in deaths and injuries.  The Thai government declared Bangkok a disaster zone, while the Myanmar junta appealed for international aid; the economic impact on Thailand appears minimal, according to the Finance Minister, but there's potential bias towards downplaying the situation.</p>
