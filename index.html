          <p>President Trump has directed an investigation into the Biden administration's alleged use of an autopen to sign presidential documents, raising concerns about Biden's cognitive state. The investigation aims to determine if Biden's aides conspired to deceive the public and unconstitutionally exercise presidential authorities. Trump's memo cites executive actions like pardons and federal judge appointments, suggesting doubts about Biden's awareness of these actions. The investigation will also examine which executive actions involved autopen use and who directed it, though a Biden spokesperson declined to comment. </p>

          <p>President Trump has barred most international students from studying at Harvard University, citing concerns about the school's handling of disciplinary records and ties to researchers in China. The order suspends entry for foreign students unless deemed in the national interest and directs consideration of visa revocations for current students. This action escalates the administration's conflict with Harvard, which has faced previous attempts to restrict international student enrollment and federal funding. Harvard argues it is being punished for First Amendment-protected speech regarding pro-Palestinian protests and alleged antisemitism.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, which were crucial for early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years. The study highlights the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift as an essential feature of bird evolution. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same ability to fly.</p>

          <p>The White House's steel and aluminum tariffs are significantly impacting Munchkin, a baby products company based in Los Angeles. The company's CEO, Steven Dunn, stated that the tariffs would increase the cost of making their soft bite baby spoon by 80%. Dunn expressed concern about the unintended consequences of the tariff policy and its effect on parents and small businesses. The tariffs have already led to layoffs at Munchkin, and some products are being discontinued due to rising costs.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women using weight-loss jabs to stop if they are trying for a baby, have become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. The UK drugs regulator and medical professionals are concerned that popular GLP-1 medicines are not being used safely. There are concerns about the potential harm to unborn babies and the lack of medical advice for those buying the drugs online. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before trying to become pregnant.</p>

This marks the second case this year of law enforcement pointing to the use of AI in assisting with a bombing or attempted bombing.
