            <p>Apple's stock experienced its most significant single-day gain since 1998, soaring 15% following President Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause on tariffs affecting production in Vietnam, India, and Thailand. This rally boosted Apple's market capitalization by over $400 billion, bringing it close to $3 trillion. The tariff pause offers potential relief for Apple, which has been significantly impacted by trade tensions due to its reliance on importing physical devices into the U.S., though most of its iPhones are still made in China which was not exempted from tariffs. Investors are now anticipating insights from CEO Tim Cook on the tariff situation during the upcoming earnings call on May 1.</p>

            <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expressed concerns about the U.S. economy potentially heading into a recession due to the escalating trade war initiated by President Trump's tariffs. Dimon highlighted the rising uncertainty in financial markets as a result of the tit-for-tat tariff exchanges between the U.S. and China, with China imposing an 84% tariff on U.S. goods. JPMorgan economists anticipate a mild contraction of 0.3% in U.S. GDP this year, Dimon urged the U.S. to negotiate trade deals to mitigate potential market deterioration, while also supporting the confirmation of Fed Governor Michelle Bowman as vice chair for supervision.

            <p>Constellation Brands, the owner of Modelo and Corona, issued a disappointing outlook for fiscal year 2026 and slashed its medium-term forecast, citing the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on its beer imports from Mexico. The company faces a 25% tariff on all imported canned beer and aluminum cans, despite a temporary reduction in reciprocal tariffs on other countries. While Constellation exceeded Wall Street's estimates for its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, its outlook overshadowed the positive results. The company is also repositioning its portfolio by divesting mainstream wines to focus on premium brands.</p>

            <p>Kash Patel has been replaced as the interim head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) by Dan Driscoll, the secretary of the army. This move places the ATF, responsible for enforcing gun laws, under the control of the defense department for the first time. The Trump administration has expressed skepticism towards the ATF's mission, with discussions about potentially merging it with the Drug Enforcement Administration or significantly reducing its scope. This decision coincides with plans to eliminate the Biden-era ATF's 'zero tolerance' policy for firearms dealers violating federal laws.</p>

            <p>UK scientists have developed a saliva test that analyzes men's DNA to identify those with a higher risk of developing prostate cancer. The test identifies 130 mutations in men's DNA, each of which can increase the risk of prostate cancers developing. Early results show the test can identify aggressive cancers that may otherwise go unnoticed, however, it is not yet proven to save lives and routine use is years away. The test could potentially reduce the need for unnecessary treatments by identifying men at lower risk.</p>

            <p>Senate Republicans erupted in applause during a closed lunch upon hearing the news that President Trump planned a 90-day pause on tariffs. Senators expressed surprise at the announcement but welcomed the news, viewing it as a sign that Trump's tactics are working. Some senators, like Ted Cruz, had previously discussed tariffs with Trump and advocated for lower tariffs. While most Republicans supported Trump's plan to continue imposing tariffs against China, some expressed concerns about the overall impact on certainty and the need for swift trade deals.</p>

The jury awarded $280 million in compensatory damages and $1.4 billion in punitive damages to the plaintiffs. The lawsuit, filed under New York’s Adult Survivors Act, drew on allegations from a 2017 investigation into Toback's behavior.

Drummond learned that the state's key witness lied during Glossip's trial and that evidence was withheld 27 years ago. Despite Glossip's conviction in the 1997 murder of a man, Drummond believed it was his duty to ensure justice was served, even if it meant taking a 'great political risk'.

            <p>US stocks surged after President Trump announced a pause on steep tariffs for most countries, replacing them with a 10% import tax rate. The S&P 500 experienced its biggest one-day rally since 2008, following days of turmoil sparked by the tariffs. The White House stated it was backing off higher levies for trade partners agreeing to negotiate, while Trump raised tariffs on goods from China to at least 125%. The Dow ended the day up significantly, and the Nasdaq skyrocketed, but the leading indexes in the US remain lower than they were before Trump's initial announcement.</p>

            <p>Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily halted lower court decisions that prevented President Trump from firing members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board. This allows their removals to go back into effect for now, giving the Supreme Court more time to consider the Justice Department's request. The Justice Department argues that the orders harm the president and the separation of powers. The case centers on the president's authority to remove executive branch officers from their positions at independent agencies.</p>
