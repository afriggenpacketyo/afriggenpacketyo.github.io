          <p>The Rijksmuseum in the Netherlands is exhibiting a nearly 200-year-old condom decorated with erotic art. Believed to be made around 1830 from a sheep's appendix, the condom is part of the "Safe Sex?" exhibition about 19th-century sex work. The condom features an erotic image of a nun and three clergymen, along with the phrase "This is my choice" in French, referencing a Renoir painting. The museum acquired the condom at an auction to highlight 19th-century sexuality and prostitution, a subject underrepresented in their collection, and it will remain on display until the end of November. The museum emphasizes that it embodies both the playful and serious aspects of sexual health during an era fraught with fears of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. </p>

          <p>Scientists at the American Museum of Natural History preparing a planetarium show about the Milky Way made an unexpected discovery about the Oort Cloud. While fine-tuning a scene, they noticed a spiral shape within the cloud's inner section, resembling a bar with two waving arms, similar to the Milky Way. This contradicted the long-held belief that the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, and the researchers published their findings in The Astrophysical Journal. The discovery, based on data on celestial object movements and simulations, may be difficult to confirm with observations, but it provides a new understanding of the outer solar system. </p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a £15 billion investment in transport projects across mayoral authorities in the Midlands, North, and West Country. The funding will focus on tram, train, and bus projects, with Greater Manchester receiving £2.5 billion to extend its tram network and the West Midlands getting £2.4 billion for extensions from Birmingham. Six other metro mayors will also receive investments for various transport improvements in their regions, marking a shift away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the South-East. While some Conservative figures criticized the plan as lacking serious planning, local leaders welcomed the investment as a boost for their regions. </p>

Carsley's future was uncertain during his interim role as head coach for the senior England team. The U21 squad is filled with promising young players, but preparations have faced challenges due to potential player unavailability related to club transfers and the Club World Cup. </p>

          <p>Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa stated that the company's short-term priority is to stabilize the struggling automaker through major restructuring. Espinosa, who assumed leadership in April, faces challenges including declining sales, the electric vehicle transition, and competition, particularly from Chinese rivals. These issues are compounded by President Trump's 50% global tariffs on steel and aluminum. The company plans to cut 11,000 jobs and close seven plants, anticipating a 3% drop in sales volumes this fiscal year, and previous talks of a merger with Honda broke down in February.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has processed approximately 91% of cases related to the Social Security Fairness Act, leading to increased benefits and lump-sum retroactive payments for nearly 3 million people. The Fairness Act eliminated the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which previously reduced benefits for individuals receiving income from public pensions without Social Security payroll taxes. The agency credits automation for expediting payments, and expects to update all beneficiary records affected by the law by early November.

Researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University said the optical fiber network is theoretically scalable, showing the viability of this type of quantum network. The quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network uses multiple lasers to send paired photons between users, with added noise to help hide the signals. The transmission rate is still too low to handle images, but the researchers aim to develop a 10,000km-level quantum communication network containing hundreds or thousands of users. </p>

The protest, which included a rally outside the US Supreme Court, aimed to derail legislation that Barber argues would result in millions losing access to Medicaid and health insurance.

The piece examines the life of Marilyn vos Savant, who was labeled a genius based on her childhood IQ score, and the downsides of ultrahigh-IQ societies, which are often plagued by infighting and a lack of worldly success. The author questions the validity and cultural biases of IQ tests, and suggests that the qualities that truly define genius, such as perseverance and creativity, are not accurately measured by these tests.

          <p>Air quality regulators in Southern California are considering new rules to phase out the sale of gas-powered furnaces and water heaters. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) is set to vote on regulations that would establish zero-emission sales targets for manufacturers, distributors, and installers, starting in 2027 and increasing to 90% by 2036. While gas-powered appliances would still be available, manufacturers would face surcharges, likely increasing costs for consumers. Officials argue the plan is crucial for reducing air pollution and improving public health, but opponents worry about strains on the electric grid and higher consumer costs.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the increasing use of military equipment and tactics by police forces presents a growing danger to civil liberties. The author points to the White House's executive order aimed at strengthening law enforcement, which directs resources toward expanded police training and increased provision of military assets to local jurisdictions. This trend blurs the line between police and military, undermining the role of police as civilian peacekeepers who protect the rights of all individuals. The author cites the development of SWAT teams and the 1033 Program as examples of how military tools and strategies have been adopted by local police, leading to a militarized approach to law enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered that over 90% of popular freshwater fish in Southern California carry human-infecting parasites called trematodes. These parasites, including Haplorchis pumilio and Centrocestus formosanus, can cause gastrointestinal problems, weight loss, and lethargy when consumed in infected fish, and in rare cases, strokes or heart attacks. The parasites were likely introduced to the U.S. by the red-rimmed melania snail and are now widespread in lakes and reservoirs across the state. To protect against illness, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends thoroughly cooking freshwater fish or freezing it before consumption to kill any potential parasites.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Stanford University have found that a sustained signal in the brain after an experience may explain how experiences lead to emotions. The process involves a lingering signal that puts the brain into a broader state, allowing experiences to merge and interact. This finding could help explain emotional differences seen in some neuropsychiatric conditions, such as autism and schizophrenia. While some researchers question whether this signal is specific to emotion, the study suggests that persistent signals in the brain play a role in altering a person or animal's brain state. </p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed tax bill could eliminate a popular workaround that allows certain business owners to bypass the $10,000 limit on state and local tax (SALT) deductions. The SALT deduction cap, enacted in 2017, has been a point of contention in high-tax states. Currently, many states have implemented a pass-through entity (PTE) level tax, allowing business owners to pay state and local taxes through their business and deduct their share of SALT. The House-approved bill would block specified service trade or businesses (SSTBs) from using this workaround, while some non-SSTB pass-through businesses could potentially benefit from a larger qualified business income (QBI) deduction and continue to claim an unlimited SALT deduction via the PTE workaround.

          <p>French cognac businesses are expressing optimism that recent talks between China and France could lead to a rollback of tariffs imposed by Beijing.

One cognac director reported that a Chinese client refused to take a paid order due to the additional fees, awaiting the outcome of negotiations. The hope is that positive discussions between officials will result in the removal of these duties, providing relief to the affected industry. </p>
