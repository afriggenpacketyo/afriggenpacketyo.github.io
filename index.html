          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' sexual assault trial continues with testimonies from ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, male escorts, and former assistants. While the prosecution aims to corroborate Ventura's claims and establish sexual assault and racketeering, the defense is using cross-examination to argue that the federal charges are unsubstantiated. Witnesses like Kid Cudi testified about Diddy's violence towards Ventura, while male exotic dancer Sharay Hayes claimed encounters with Cassie were consensual.

          <p>The head of Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) warns of youth radicalization leading to serious crimes, following a crackdown on a far-right extremist cell with members as young as 14. Separately, train services at Hamburg's main station have returned to normal after a knife attack injured 18 people, with a female suspect arrested. Police do not believe the suspect acted alone and did not have a political motive, but rather, they believe she may have been "in a state of mental distress".

While NHS England hails this as a pioneering model, Andy Bell of the Centre for Mental Health expresses skepticism, calling for robust testing and better funding for NHS mental health services. A recent study highlighted the high number of people waiting over 12 hours in A&E, underscoring the need for improved mental health support.</p>

          <p>Germany prides itself on confronting its Nazi past, but this reckoning is often selective and contradictory, embraced when it flatters Germanyâ€™s self-image and ignored when it threatens personal gain or strategic interests. The Herbert Quandt Media prize, awarded to journalists, celebrates the legacy of an early SS supporter who profited from slave labor during the Nazi regime. Despite exposure of the Quandt family's Nazi-era crimes, journalists continue to accept the prize, highlighting a broader German refusal to confront the depths of societal entanglement with state violence and genocide.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's financial system is crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan, amid geopolitical tensions and discussions on de-dollarization. International businesses are actively looking to diversify from the US dollar, with businesses in Qatar keen to take advantage of the yuan by using tools available in Hong Kong. This trend dovetails with Chinaâ€™s effort to internationalize its currency, a strategy that dates back to the 2008 financial crisis and aims to mitigate risks and assert financial independence amid escalating Sino-American decoupling.</p>

          <p>A brief loss of contact between the Pentagon tower and an Army Black Hawk helicopter led to two commercial jets aborting their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in early May. The incident raised concerns about air traffic control coordination and safety near the nation's capital. An antenna setup during construction of a new control tower is thought to be the cause of the lost contact. The Army paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon as it works with the FAA to address safety issues.</p>
