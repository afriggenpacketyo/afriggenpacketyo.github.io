        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aston Villa has lodged a formal complaint with the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) regarding a controversial refereeing decision during their match against Manchester United. The disputed call involved a disallowed goal, with Villa captain John McGinn expressing strong disagreement, stating that VAR should have intervened to correct the "incredible" error. BBC Match of the Day pundits Alan Shearer and Michael Richards echoed Villa's sentiment, labeling the decision a significant mistake due to the premature whistle, preventing VAR review, and thus denying Aston Villa a crucial goal with Champions League implications. The referee's youth and inexperience were also called into question by McGinn.</p>

          <p>Alex Palou, representing Chip Ganassi Racing, achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first Spanish driver to win the Indianapolis 500, triumphing over Marcus Ericsson in the final laps. The race was marked by several unusual incidents, including Scott McLaughlin crashing during warm-up laps and Alexander Rossi's pit stop resulting in a fire. Kyle Larson's attempt to complete the "double" was cut short by a three-car collision, preventing him from reaching the Coca-Cola 600 in time. Palou's victory was celebrated by his team and family, marking a significant achievement in his racing career, adding to his already impressive record of three IndyCar titles in four years.</p>

EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic emphasized the need for mutual respect in trade relations, stating the EU's readiness to defend its interests.

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder ignited the Black Lives Matter movement, a backlash is taking hold, with the politics of "white grievance" championed by President Trump gaining prominence. While the movement initially garnered widespread support, including from Republicans, recent polls show a decline in public approval and a sense that it has not led to significant improvements in the lives of Black people. The Trump administration has dismantled diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and the president has expressed concerns about anti-white discrimination. Despite these challenges, some argue that the struggle for racial justice is ongoing and that Black activism remains essential for a robust democracy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" has emerged, emphasizing emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This style focuses on accepting a child's emotions without dismissing them, responding without shame, and viewing "bad" behavior as stress signals. Emotionally safe parents take responsibility after conflicts, do internal work to become less reactive, and create an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves. Practicing this involves inner reflection, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame through healthy repair, fostering resilience and connection.</p>

Critics argue that Trump has dismantled ethical boundaries and accountability mechanisms, leading to a lack of official scrutiny.

Under the current system, federal judges are protected by the US Marshals Service, managed by the Justice Department, and the judges fear Trump might instruct the marshals to withdraw security protection from judges who rule against him.</p>
