        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chipmaker Nvidia's market capitalization surpassed $4 trillion for the first time, a historic milestone for any public company. The surge is driven by immense investor demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential for powering the ongoing generative artificial intelligence boom. This achievement solidifies Nvidia's position as the world's most valuable company, having overtaken tech giants Microsoft and Apple. The company's value has grown exponentially, crossing the $2 trillion mark in February 2024 and the $3 trillion mark just last month in June. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Scotland have confirmed that they are actively planning for a potential visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to the country later this month. While the visit has not been officially confirmed, it is expected he will attend the opening of a new course at his Aberdeenshire golf resort. This would be his first trip to Scotland since his election victory, and authorities are preparing for a significant security operation. His last visit as president in 2018 prompted major protests across several Scottish cities, which authorities are preparing for again.</p>

          <p>Analysts are evaluating President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," a major tax and spending act, for its potential impact on China's economy. The legislation, which makes tax cuts permanent and increases the U.S. debt limit, is not directly aimed at Beijing but is expected to have indirect effects. Some experts suggest that while it could cause challenges for China, it might also create opportunities. These could arise from potential U.S. political instability or damage to American domestic sectors, such as clean energy, due to the bill's provisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's efforts to influence monetary policy are creating potential credibility challenges for his eventual nominee to lead the Federal Reserve. Reports suggest Trump is considering appointing a "shadow chair" to pressure current Chair Jerome Powell into cutting interest rates, a move that could undermine the central bank's political independence. This strategy raises concerns that the next Fed leader might be perceived as a political appointee tasked with lowering government debt-servicing costs, rather than managing inflation and employment based on economic data.

While the White House states this will result in nearly 90% of beneficiaries paying no tax on their benefits, policy experts clarify this is due to the new deduction, not a direct change to how benefits are taxed.

          <p>An opinion article argues that the new budget signed by President Trump will transform Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) into the largest domestic police force in the United States. The budget allocates $45 billion for immigrant detention and funds the hiring of 10,000 new ICE agents, creating a force with more resources than many federal agencies combined. The author warns that this buildup creates a powerful internal security apparatus with the authority to surveil and detain anyone the administration deems undesirable, a structure that would be difficult for any future president to dismantle.</p>

          <p>Despite a strategic pivot towards boosting domestic consumption, China has pledged to maintain significant investment in large-scale infrastructure projects to drive economic growth. An official from the country's top economic planning agency, the NDRC, stated that maintaining a certain scale of investment is essential for development, noting that China's per capita GDP has only recently crossed the $13,000 threshold. This approach echoes past stimulus efforts, like the massive package during the 2009 financial crisis, but also raises concerns about increasing debt levels, particularly from local government borrowing.</p>

          <p>Australia has implemented a first-of-its-kind climate visa for citizens of Tuvalu, a low-lying Pacific nation existentially threatened by rising sea levels. The Falepili Union Treaty allows up to 280 Tuvaluans each year to live, work, or study in Australia, providing a dignified mobility pathway before climate change renders their homeland uninhabitable. This proactive approach differs from traditional refugee policies, as it grants people agency to move before disaster strikes. The treaty also commits to preserving Tuvalu's statehood and sovereignty, setting a potential model for other nations facing similar climate-induced threats.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has refused to rule out extending the current freeze on income tax and National Insurance thresholds beyond its planned end in 2028. This policy, known as fiscal drag, pulls more people into higher tax brackets as their wages rise with inflation. During Prime Minister's Questions, Starmer would only commit to the pledges in Labour's manifesto, which included no increases to the rates of income tax, NI, or VAT but made no specific promise on thresholds. Extending the freeze could raise an estimated £7 billion annually but would contradict a previous pledge by the Chancellor.</p>

          <p>Small business owners facing tax debt have several relief options available through the IRS to avoid severe consequences like frozen bank accounts or property liens. These programs include business installment agreements, which allow for monthly payments, and an Offer in Compromise (OIC), which can settle the debt for a lower amount in cases of severe financial hardship. Other options are Currently Not Collectible (CNC) status, which temporarily pauses collections, and penalty abatement for reducing certain penalties. Experts advise that addressing tax debt proactively is crucial, especially for payroll taxes where owners can be held personally liable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A decade after China's "709 crackdown," which saw the arrest of over 300 human rights lawyers and activists, the legal and political environment in the country has become increasingly restrictive. Lawyers convicted during the crackdown face constant surveillance and harassment even after their release, while others who take on sensitive cases face new waves of persecution. The government's vision of "socialist rule of law" prioritizes political control over legal accountability, making rights-defense work nearly impossible. Despite the risks, some lawyers continue to resist, filing complaints and using social media to document ongoing repression.</p>

By morning, they witnessed the "complete destruction" of parts of the camp, where at least 27 people ultimately lost their lives. The camp, which had over 500 campers and 100 staff, had its emergency plans approved by state health services just two days before the catastrophic flood.</p>

In a new report, Sir Brian Langstaff highlighted "obvious injustices" in the program designed to compensate the estimated 30,000 people infected with HIV and hepatitis from contaminated NHS blood products. Despite an £11.8 billion fund, only 460 people have received full compensation so far.

          <p>The Middle East is experiencing what experts call a "quiet revolution" as fertility rates across the region have fallen dramatically over the past three decades. The average number of children per woman has more than halved since the 1960s, a decline attributed to a mix of economic, political, and social factors. These include political instability, rising costs of marriage, increased female education and employment, and a cultural shift towards smaller families. This trend could lead to significant demographic challenges, such as an aging population straining social safety nets in countries with less-developed economies.</p>
