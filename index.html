          <p>Donald Trump's administration is facing significant challenges to its tariff policies, with a New York court blocking his signature trade policy and raising questions about the legality of his actions. The court's decision, based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), has been temporarily stayed, but it represents a major setback. Trump's initial plan to hike tariffs dramatically, raise trillions of dollars, cut taxes, and lure manufacturers back to the US has been met with market panic and forced retreats. Despite these challenges, Trump's administration remains committed to its economic agenda, even if it means finding alternative legal justifications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a knife attack in Hamburg, social media has been flooded with manipulated images and false information targeting Muhammad al-Muhammad, a Syrian teenager who helped stop the assailant. The original reports of his heroism have been questioned as conflicting accounts spread online, with some users creating AI-generated images to discredit media coverage. This disinformation aims to undermine trust in the press and promote right-wing narratives, particularly regarding refugees and immigration. Media experts warn that such campaigns create a climate of uncertainty and alternative realities, making it difficult to discern the truth.</p>

          <p>CPAC, the US Conservative Political Action Conference, held large gatherings in Poland and Hungary, signaling a push by US-backed conservatives to gain mainstream acceptance in Europe. The conferences featured speakers like Viktor Orban, Alice Weidel, and Liz Truss, who derided the EU's Green Deal and complained about immigration and "gender and woke madness". While the MAGA movement aims to reshape the European project with its brand of conservatism, it has faced setbacks, such as the election of a liberal mayor in Bucharest and the failure of a MAGA-backed leader in Albania's parliamentary election. The events highlight the ongoing struggle between traditional liberalism and rising nationalism in Europe.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has accused Russia of undermining the next round of peace talks scheduled to take place in Istanbul. President Volodymyr Zelensky questioned Russia's commitment to progress, noting that Moscow had not yet sent its negotiating proposals, a key demand by Kyiv. While the Kremlin stated that ceasefire conditions would be discussed, Zelensky insisted that the agenda must be clear and negotiations properly prepared for a meeting to be meaningful. As the talks approached, both sides reported explosions, raising concerns about the already fragile peace process.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government's stockpiled rice, released through direct contracts with retailers, has started appearing on store shelves, offering consumers a cheaper alternative. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. are among the first to sell the rice at a price of 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. The move aims to alleviate the soaring price of rice, which has been impacting households. Consumers have been eagerly purchasing the rice, with some stores selling out within minutes of opening, providing relief to families facing financial challenges.</p>

          <p>Patricia Krenwinkel, a member of the Manson "family" convicted for her role in the 1969 Los Angeles killing spree, has been recommended for parole by a California prisons panel. The panel cited her age and spotless behavior record during incarceration as reasons for finding her suitability for release. The decision is subject to review by the full state Board of Parole Hearings and the California governor, who previously reversed a similar recommendation in 2022. Krenwinkel was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder for participating in the Manson family's violent rampage, which included the murder of actress Sharon Tate and several others.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Kim Sajet, the director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery, citing her support for DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives as inappropriate for her position. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Smithsonian as leftist and anti-American, targeting funding for programs with "divisive, race-centered ideology". He has tasked Vice President JD Vance with overseeing efforts to remove "improper ideology" from the institution. This move follows the ousting of leadership at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts, also part of the Smithsonian, and replacing them with loyalists.</p>
