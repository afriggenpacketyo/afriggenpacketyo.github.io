          <p>A new book, *Underdogs*, challenges common political perceptions of the white working class in Britain, arguing that their distinctiveness stems more from geography than ethnicity. The author, Joel Budd, highlights the neglect of smaller towns outside metropolitan areas, leading to limited social mobility and opportunities for white working-class individuals. The study also explores the diversity within this group, categorizing them into "heartlands," "enclaves," and "colonies," and questions the notion of widespread xenophobia, emphasizing that age is a stronger predictor of attitudes toward immigration than class.</p>

          <p>Amidst new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, Britain is urged to resist damaging concessions and instead collaborate with the G7 (excluding the US), the EU, and Asia to uphold a rules-based global trading system. The article suggests that Mark Carney, potentially as the Canadian prime minister, could play a pivotal role in constructing a new global trade order. This would involve associating Canada with the EU as a privileged trade partner, extending the association to a newly relevant Commonwealth, and implementing reciprocal sanctions on selected US service exports. The author argues that Britain must make a choice between aligning with Trump's America or forging a fresh, collaborative path.</p>

          <p>The PLA's Shandong aircraft carrier is believed to have explored an alternative route east of Taiwan before a drill, a move analysts say was likely training to counter American warships and explore alternative routes in a conflict. The warship transited via narrower waterways of the Philippine archipelago, bypassing the wider waterways between Taiwan and the Philippines. This new route could provide the PLA with alternative southbound options to approach the western Pacific via the Bashi Channel, a strategic chokepoint. The Shandong conducted joint maneuvers with naval and aerial units to the southeast of Taiwan.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Mark Cuban has voiced concerns that President Donald Trump's tariff plan, coupled with cuts to the federal workforce, could trigger a long-term economic crisis surpassing the 2008 financial crisis. Cuban suggests that the combination of inflationary tariffs and DOGE-led workforce reductions could have severe economic consequences. During the 2008 crisis, the country experienced a significant GDP decline, a surge in unemployment, and a housing market crash. Cuban's comments highlight the potential risks associated with the Trump administration's economic policies.</p>
