          <p>Actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is taking on a significant dramatic role, portraying real-life mixed martial arts champion Mark Kerr in the film "The Smashing Machine." Johnson reveals that he was nervous about the raw and demanding part, which required him to tap into personal childhood trauma to convey the character's struggles with addiction and depression. He explains that after years of focusing on box office success, he sought a more fulfilling and challenging role to "rip myself open" and explore a new dimension of his acting career, marking a new chapter for him.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her upcoming memoir, "Softly, as I Leave You: Life After Elvis," Priscilla Presley provides a poignant account of the day Elvis Presley died in August 1977. She describes the frantic moments after learning the news, her rush to Graceland, and the surreal atmosphere of grief that enveloped the home. The passage details the profound personal loss she and her daughter, Lisa Marie, experienced, the overwhelming public mourning, and the difficult adjustment to a world without the iconic figure who had been a central part of her life.</p>

          <p>Turkey's primary opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), has re-elected Ozgur Ozel as its chairman in an extraordinary congress. This move is seen as a strategic effort to shield Ozel and other senior party members from a pending court ruling that could annul the results of their 2023 leadership vote. The case is viewed by critics as part of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's broader crackdown on political dissent, and the re-election provides Ozel with a fresh mandate as the government's legal pressure intensifies.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Chris Murphy has voiced grave concerns over what he describes as President Donald Trump's use of federal agencies, such as the FCC and the Department of Justice, to punish political opponents. Murphy stated that this represents one of the most dangerous moments in American history, comparing the actions to tactics used in repressive, authoritarian states like Iran and China. He argues that threatening to reexamine broadcasters' licenses over critical coverage is an illegal use of government power to silence dissent and undermine fundamental rights.</p>

          <p>John Stapleton, a celebrated British television presenter known for his work on programs like the BBC's "Watchdog" and "GMTV," has passed away at the age of 79.

          <p>On the eve of the Jewish New Year, Rabbi Angela Buchdahl offers a commentary on the meaning of Rosh Hashanah, emphasizing its theme of communal atonement and self-reflection. She explains the concept of Teshuvah, or "return," as a hopeful process of returning to one's better self. Buchdahl extends this idea to a national scale, suggesting that the United States could collectively take responsibility for its shortcomings, such as normalizing violence and ignoring the vulnerable, to return to its core values of compassion and generosity.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has strongly rebuked Charles Kushner, the U.S. Ambassador to France, for publicly accusing his government of inaction against antisemitism. Macron deemed the ambassador's published letter, which linked French foreign policy on Palestine to Jewish safety, an "unacceptable" statement for a diplomat and a violation of diplomatic protocol. The French president defended his government's policies, arguing that disagreeing with the Israeli government's actions in Gaza or supporting Palestinian statehood does not equate to antisemitism, a stance that has created friction with both Israel and the U.S.</p>

          <p>A child development expert outlines nine key behaviors that parents can adopt early on to foster exceptional social skills in their children. Instead of focusing on rote memorization of manners, these practices emphasize creating an environment of emotional safety and authentic connection. Key strategies include talking openly about feelings, modeling empathy in daily life, teaching conflict resolution, and validating a child's emotions. By listening more than lecturing and treating mistakes as learning opportunities, parents can help children develop the emotional intelligence necessary for healthy, resilient relationships.</p>

          <p>A credit expert advises consumers on how to maximize the value of rewards credit cards by avoiding three key errors. The first mistake is opting for no-fee cards, which often provide inferior rewards compared to cards with modest annual fees. Another common pitfall is hoarding points, which can be devalued by the issuer at any time, making it wiser to redeem them regularly. Finally, the expert suggests that cardholders should not hesitate to call their credit card company to negotiate the annual fee, as retention departments often offer discounts or bonus points to keep their business.</p>

The 1933 Montevideo Convention's criteria for statehood—including a defined territory and a functioning government—are difficult to meet given the geographical separation of the West Bank and Gaza and the deep political division between Fatah and Hamas. The article highlights the ossified state of Palestinian politics, the lack of recent elections, and the imprisonment of popular leader Marwan Barghouti as major obstacles to forming a cohesive and viable state.</p>

          <h2>Historical Analysis Explores How Authoritarian Regimes Politicize Women's Domestic Roles</h2>

          <p>This analysis examines the historical and contemporary pattern of authoritarian and fascist movements relying on women's traditional domestic roles to implement state ideology. Drawing parallels between Nazi Germany and modern right-wing movements, the article argues that strongmen promote "the cradle and the ladle" to reinforce national strength and patriarchal hierarchy. Today, this is mirrored in the online "womanosphere," where influencers romanticize homemaking and traditional femininity, which can inadvertently support regressive policies that roll back women's rights and autonomy, such as restricting reproductive healthcare and workplace equity.</p>

This public exhibition of advanced Chinese weaponry comes at a time of heightened tensions in Europe. The procurement and display of these systems signal Serbia's deepening military cooperation with Beijing and its strategic positioning within the complex geopolitical landscape of the Balkans and broader European security environment.</p>

          <p>China has entered the top 10 of the UN's Global Innovation Index for the first time, an achievement that highlights the limitations of the United States' technology containment strategy. The article argues that instead of stifling China's progress, U.S. policies like export controls and blacklisting have spurred Beijing to increase its domestic research and development spending, which reached over $500 billion in 2024. This has accelerated China's drive for technological self-sufficiency, challenging the effectiveness and long-term wisdom of America's decoupling efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

They advocate for a more comprehensive curriculum in schools that includes information on reproductive health and fertility, which could empower individuals to make more informed decisions about family planning throughout their lives.</p>
