            <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has strongly criticized opponents of the UK's net-zero carbon emissions target, accusing them of spreading 'nonsense and lies' to undermine the environmental agenda.

He warned that abandoning the net-zero goal would not only risk climate breakdown but also forfeit future clean energy jobs. Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage have expressed concerns about the economic impact of pursuing net-zero policies.</p>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, lasting until midnight Sunday, citing humanitarian grounds. Putin ordered a halt to all fighting, expecting Ukraine to reciprocate, but emphasized readiness to respond to violations or provocations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed skepticism, suggesting an extension beyond Easter to demonstrate genuine intent, while reports indicated continued Russian assaults. The announcement follows frustration from the Trump administration, which has threatened to move on from peace talks if progress isn't made soon.</p>
