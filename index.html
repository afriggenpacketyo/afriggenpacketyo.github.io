          <h2>Japan Considers Expanding U.S. Soybean and Corn Imports Amid Trade Talks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is reportedly considering increasing its imports of U.S. soybeans and corn as part of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. This move is aimed at addressing excess supply in the U.S. market resulting from decreased exports to China due to trade friction. By increasing imports, Japan hopes to secure exemptions from U.S. tariffs on automobiles, steel, aluminum, and other goods. The government also aims to mitigate potential impacts of tariffs and maintain economic stability amidst global trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Director Ryan Coogler negotiated a rare deal with Warner Bros. for his movie "Sinners," granting him ownership of the film rights after 25 years. This allows Coogler to potentially receive royalties from streaming and television broadcasts, and merchandising deals later in life. Coogler, who was once heavily in debt, drew inspiration from his family's history for the film, which influenced his request for future ownership. This deal is uncommon in Hollywood, where directors rarely obtain ownership of their films, even after many years.</p>
