          <p>This article examines the effectiveness of X's Community Notes, finding that the feature can be misleading and is susceptible to manipulation. It cites examples, such as an inaccurate note about a UN official's qualifications and another that distorted a report on systemic inequality by shifting focus to crime statistics. Researchers have also found that the system suffers from declining publication rates, slow response times, and can be gamed by bad actors, raising concerns as other platforms adopt similar models without sufficient safeguards.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has refrained from setting a target for the number of migrants to be returned to France under a new trial scheme. The plan allows the UK to send back some migrants who arrive on small boats in exchange for accepting vetted asylum seekers from France. Cooper stated that the numbers will start low and build over time, but avoided providing specific figures to prevent criminal gangs from exploiting operational details. The policy comes as Channel crossings in 2025 are significantly higher than in the previous year.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court justice has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest for allegedly masterminding a coup plot to stay in power after his 2022 election defeat. The decision was made after Bolsonaro violated previous court-imposed restrictions by addressing supporters via his son's phone during a protest. The case has gained international attention, with the U.S. Trump administration condemning the order and sanctioning the justice involved, escalating political tensions within Brazil and abroad.</p>

          <p>The aftermath of Storm Floris has left thousands of homes in Scotland without electricity and caused significant travel disruption, including suspended train services. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) reported that 22,000 homes were still without power, describing the event as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory. Engineers are working to clear extensive tree-related damage from power and rail lines, but officials warn that full restoration for some customers may take several days due to the complexity of the repairs.</p>

          <p>This article uses Olio Piro, a small Tuscan olive oil producer, as a case study to illustrate the impact of new U.S. tariffs on European businesses. Despite strong American demand for olive oil, which is overwhelmingly imported, the uncertainty and cost of the tariffs have forced the startup to accelerate its plans to expand into more stable markets like Canada and Japan. The new 15% tariff is expected to raise prices for U.S. consumers and poses a significant challenge for small producers who lack the resources to absorb such financial shocks.

          <p>BP's CEO, Murray Auchincloss, expressed strong optimism about the company's future following the release of better-than-expected second-quarter profits and a major oil discovery in Brazil. The positive financial results, which beat analyst expectations, were accompanied by an increase in the company's dividend and a continuation of its share buyback program. This performance comes as BP undergoes a strategic reset to prioritize fossil fuels and contends with ongoing takeover speculation after a period of underperformance. (not investment advice)</p>
