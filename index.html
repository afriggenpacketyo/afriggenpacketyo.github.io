          <p>Hurricane Erick, the first major hurricane of the Eastern Pacific season, made landfall in Oaxaca, Mexico, as a Category 3 storm, posing significant threats of life-threatening flooding and mudslides. Despite being downgraded from a Category 4, the hurricane's strong winds and heavy rain are expected to cause devastating damage, with potential power outages lasting weeks. The National Hurricane Center forecasts between 8 to 12 inches of rain in Oaxaca and Guerrero, emphasizing the risk of dangerous storm surges and large waves.

          <p>Democrats are raising concerns that the Trump administration is using law enforcement to target political opponents, citing several recent arrests and detentions of Democratic officials. Representatives Eric Swalwell and Jamie Raskin have voiced strong criticisms, with Swalwell even taking out liability insurance due to concerns about legal peril during a second Trump term. Recent incidents include the handcuffing of Senator Alex Padilla and the arrests of Representative LaMonica McIver and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, leading to accusations of political intimidation. The White House has responded by questioning why so many Democratic officials feel emboldened to break the law, further inflaming the already toxic political climate.</p>

          <p>Julius Malema, the leader of South Africa's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), has been banned from entering the UK by the Home Office, citing his support for Hamas and statements deemed "non-conducive to the public good." The Home Office letter also referenced statements where Malema allegedly called for the slaughter of white people or hinted at it as an acceptable option. The EFF condemned the decision as stifling democratic debate and defended Malema's views as expressions of frustration over economic exclusion. This marks the second time Malema has been denied entry to the UK in two months, with the Home Office indicating he has no right of appeal.</p>

Following the U.S. withdrawal from the deal in 2018, Iran claimed to have bought extra parts to replace the portion into which officials poured concrete.

          <p>As summer temperatures rise, the US faces a potentially severe wildfire season, with concerns that federal fire crews are underprepared due to budget and staff cuts. Experts worry that the Trump administration's policies have weakened wildfire mitigation and suppression efforts. There are also fears that a new directive to consolidate federal firefighters will add uncertainty. The loss of support staff and the anti-science agenda are expected to have long-term effects, with some funds being withheld and research capacity being diminished.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's vow to be a champion of the First Amendment, critics argue that free speech rights are being eroded under his administration. Concerns are mounting over crackdowns on perceived enemies, including arrests of protesters, attempts to deport dissenting students, and defunding of institutions promoting diversity. Experts say a double standard has emerged, where dissent against the president's agenda is targeted. The deployment of the National Guard to quell protests and the administration's actions against universities and law firms representing opposing causes are cited as evidence of this erosion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democrats are becoming increasingly focused on politics, while many voters are more interested in other activities, creating a disconnect. The author argues that Democrats need to reconnect with these voters by demonstrating interests outside of politics, citing examples of past presidents who successfully balanced their political roles with personal hobbies. The party needs to build audiences through entertainment and then occasionally bring on candidates as guests, drawing inspiration from non-political figures who have gained credibility through their hobbies. To be successful, Democrats should take a page from those who focus first on interests, then issues, and only years later turn to elections.</p>

          <p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), traditionally used by diabetics, are gaining popularity among health enthusiasts who aim to optimize their metabolic health. Promoted by wellness influencers and figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., CGMs are marketed as tools to personalize weight loss and improve dietary choices. However, experts caution that the benefits for nondiabetics are unproven, with concerns that obsessively tracking blood sugar may lead to unhealthy dietary choices. Studies also show that blood sugar levels are affected by more than just food, and can depend on sleep, stress, and exercise levels.</p>
