        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir David Attenborough, ahead of his 99th birthday, is releasing a cinema-length film titled Ocean, which he believes is crucial for saving biodiversity and combating climate change. The film highlights the catastrophic decline in ocean life since Attenborough's first scuba dive in 1957 and showcases the destructive impact of bottom trawling, a fishing practice that releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide. Attenborough emphasizes that the ocean can recover faster than imagined, citing the recovery of whale populations after the ban on commercial whaling. He hopes the film will inspire leaders to take action at an upcoming UN conference to protect a third of the world's oceans, enabling the ocean to thrive and trap more carbon dioxide.</p>

          <p>A fencing match at the Cherry Blossom Open in Maryland has ignited a national debate after fencer Stephanie Turner refused to compete against her transgender opponent, Red Sullivan. Turner's protest, captured in a viral video, has led to a hearing in Congress and amplified discussions about inclusivity and fair play in sports. U.S.A. Fencing finds itself at the center of this debate, with conservative circles politicizing the issue and prompting investigations from the Trump administration.

          <p>President Donald Trump unexpectedly announced the United States would cease bombing Houthi rebels in Yemen, stating the group agreed to stop attacking U.S. ships in the Red Sea. The announcement follows weeks of costly attacks and threats from the Trump administration and was confirmed by a spokesman for Oman's Foreign Ministry. However, a Houthi official stated they would "evaluate" the ceasefire proposal, adding uncertainty to the agreement. The U.S. military has suffered losses, including downed drones and a fighter jet, during the conflict, which began in response to Houthi attacks on vessels connected to Israel's allies.</p>

          <p>In a meeting with President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly stated that Canada is "not for sale" after Trump romanticized the idea of the U.S. acquiring Canada. Carney used real estate terms to convey Canada's position, drawing a parallel to places like Buckingham Palace that are not for sale. Despite Carney's rejection, Trump insisted that trade and other negotiations would not be affected, though he did not completely dismiss the idea of acquiring Canada. Carney later revealed that he asked Trump to stop referring to Canada as the 51st state, highlighting tensions in trade and border relations.</p>

Temple University has suspended a student believed to be involved, and the university is conducting an investigation. Portnoy, who is Jewish, initially expressed outrage and vowed to "ruin" those responsible but later offered to send them on a tour of Auschwitz, though he later revoked the offer for one student.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz became Germany's new chancellor after an unprecedented initial failure to secure enough votes in Parliament, raising concerns about his ability to lead effectively. Despite eventually winning on a second ballot, the setback has damaged his credibility both domestically and internationally. Analysts warn that this could make it more difficult for Merz to address critical issues such as President Trumpâ€™s tariff threats, economic malaise, and an aggressive Russia. The article highlights the challenges Merz faces, including a shrinking economy, immigration concerns, and the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party.</p>
