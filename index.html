          <p>A shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in the death of one adult man and injuries to several other individuals. Authorities have detained a person of interest, and after reviewing surveillance footage, they confirmed there was only a single shooter involved in the incident. The investigation is ongoing, but police have assured the public that there is no further danger. Witnesses described a chaotic scene where the suspect was reportedly subdued after being hit with a chair before running through a wedding reception.</p>

          <p>Lifestyle personality Martha Stewart, 84, has revealed that her viral "thirst trap" photos on social media have led to a significant number of people sending her flirtatious direct messages. During an appearance on the "Today" show, she confirmed that while she receives many propositions, she is currently single and finds happiness in her friendships. Stewart first gained attention for these posts in 2020 with a sultry poolside selfie, and she has since embraced the provocative and fun nature of sharing such images, which she says has led to new opportunities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has found evidence of recent landslide activity on the moon, challenging the long-held belief that the moon is geologically dormant. By comparing high-resolution images taken since 2009, researchers identified 41 new landslides that appear to have been triggered by moonquakes. This discovery, published in the National Science Review, has significant implications for future lunar missions and the safety of establishing permanent human bases on the moon's surface. The findings underscore the need to assess geological hazards when planning for deep-space outposts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he is appointing Lindsey Halligan, one of his former defense attorneys from the classified documents case, to lead the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. The appointment is highly controversial as Halligan has no prosecutorial experience and follows the recent resignation of the previous office head, Erik Siebert. Siebert reportedly left amid pressure from the Trump administration to bring a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James, a political rival of the president.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed five new bills aimed at protecting residents from federal immigration enforcement operations directed by the Trump administration. The most prominent new law, the No Secret Police Act, will prohibit on-duty federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings and require them to be identifiable by name and badge. Other laws will restrict immigration agents' access to schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant and require schools to notify families of ICE presence on campus. These measures are being framed as a form of resistance against perceived federal overreach.</p>

          <p>The remaining dates of singer d4vd's world tour have been canceled as police investigate the death of a 15-year-old girl whose body was found in a car registered to him.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly stated his administration is in discussions to regain control of Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, a move that has drawn swift condemnation from both China and the Taliban. Trump justified the interest by highlighting the base's strategic location, noting it is approximately an hour away from where China manufactures its nuclear weapons. In response, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson emphasized respect for Afghanistan's sovereignty and warned against actions that could stir regional tension, asserting that Afghanistan's future should be determined by its own people.</p>

          <p>British singer Morrissey has canceled two of his U.S. shows after receiving what was described as a "credible threat" on his life. The threat was made ahead of a concert in Ottawa, Canada, where a 26-year-old man was arrested and later released on bail for allegedly threatening to kill the artist. Although the Ottawa performance proceeded as planned, subsequent shows in Massachusetts and Connecticut were canceled out of an abundance of caution for the safety of both Morrissey and his band. The venues confirmed the cancellations were due to the security risk.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent decision to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point did not translate into lower long-term borrowing costs for consumers, as rates for mortgages actually increased. While the stock market reacted positively, bond traders sold off long-term bonds, driving their yields higher. Analysts suggest this reaction indicates bond market concern that the Fed may be cutting rates too aggressively while inflation remains above its target, signaling a lack of confidence in the central bank's current monetary policy.

          <p>Despite general economic caution among consumers, sales of used electric vehicles have skyrocketed, with a reported 40% spike in July. This surge is largely attributed to the discovery that pre-owned EVs are often priced lower than comparable cars with internal combustion engines, even before factoring in savings on fuel and maintenance. The trend indicates a growing consumer appetite for electric cars, challenging the perception that they are prohibitively expensive. This shift is occurring even as the overall automotive industry faces headwinds from economic uncertainty and increased competition in the EV market.</p>

          <p>Sacramento police have arrested a 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandezsantana, in connection with a drive-by shooting at the ABC10 television station. The suspect allegedly fired at least three bullets into the building's occupied lobby on Friday afternoon before fleeing the scene; no injuries were reported. The motive for the attack is still under investigation, and it is unclear if it is connected to a protest held outside the station a day earlier regarding the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show. The shooting has been condemned by journalism organizations as an act of violence against the media.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle is strengthening in the central Atlantic and is forecast to become the second hurricane of the season, though it is expected to remain over open waters and not make landfall in the U.S. However, it will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast. Meanwhile, a separate weather system is bringing monsoonal moisture to the Southwest, elevating the threat of flash flooding in parts of California, Arizona, and New Mexico. This follows recent deadly floods in the region, with burn scar areas being particularly vulnerable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has reiterated his prediction that artificial intelligence and robotics will replace all human jobs by approximately 2030, leading to a future of "sustainable abundance." In his view, this technological shift will make a "universal high income" necessary, going beyond the concept of a basic safety net to provide everyone with the best food, housing, and healthcare. While Musk presents an optimistic, utopian vision of a post-work society, his forecast has prompted skepticism regarding the political and economic feasibility of funding such a massive overhaul of the social structure.</p>

          <p>Creatine, a supplement widely known for enhancing athletic performance and muscle mass, is now being investigated for its potential cognitive benefits. A growing but still limited body of research suggests that it could help improve short-term memory, mood, and focus. The article explores whether creatine could be effective in clearing "brain fog," a common symptom for women in perimenopause or those suffering from post-viral conditions. While experts find the research promising, they caution that more studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and note it may only be effective for individuals under certain kinds of stress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's decision to recognize a Palestinian state marks a significant shift in its foreign policy, driven by a confluence of domestic and international pressures. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government acted amid mounting calls from within the Labour Party, concerns over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and similar moves by allied nations like France and Canada. While the government insists the move is a meaningful step toward a two-state solution, critics have labeled it symbolic political posturing that rewards terrorism and puts the UK at odds with the United States.</p>

          <p>A memorial service for slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being held at a 63,000-seat stadium in Arizona, with President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and other prominent political figures scheduled to speak.

The shooting has reignited national concerns about political violence, and the memorial is expected to draw a massive crowd of supporters to honor the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has introduced new restrictions for journalists, requiring them to sign an agreement not to disclose unauthorized information or risk losing their press credentials for the building. These rules, implemented under the newly renamed Department of War, also limit reporters' movement within the facility. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth stated the press does not run the Pentagon and must follow the rules of a secure facility. The move follows several recent high-profile leaks and has raised concerns about a potential clampdown on press freedom and government transparency.</p>
