          <p>A significant drop in surgeries to remove foreign objects from children's airways and noses has been observed in England since 2012.  The shift to cashless payments is suggested as a contributing factor, alongside improved child-proofing and safety campaigns. However, concerns remain about the ingestion of button batteries and magnets, which pose severe health risks.</p>
