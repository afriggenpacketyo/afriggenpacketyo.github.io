          <p>President Trump announced the U.S. will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, reversing a recent pause in some shipments. The decision aims to help Ukraine defend itself against ongoing Russian aggression, a conflict that has resulted in significant casualties. This move comes after the White House had temporarily halted some transfers to review dwindling U.S. military stockpiles, and after Trump held calls with both the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. The Pentagon confirmed the directive, emphasizing the weapons are for defensive purposes while peace is sought.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Chinese students are choosing Singapore for higher education over the United States, citing cultural similarities and safety concerns. Difficulties in cultural adjustment and parental worries about security in the U.S. are prompting this shift. Singapore is seen as an attractive alternative due to its high economic and diplomatic openness, familiar cuisine, and warm climate. Industry experts predict this trend may lead to a short-term increase in applications to Singaporean universities from China.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 22:49:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report reveals that one in five vehicle accidents in the U.S. occurs in parking lots, resulting in over 500 deaths and 165 injuries daily. Cities like San Bernardino, California, have nearly half their downtown area dedicated to parking, often with poor design and safety features. The study identifies driver distraction as a major factor, with a high percentage of drivers admitting to using phones or engaging in other activities while in parking lots. Poor lighting, faded markings, and structural defects also contribute to the danger, leading to increased litigation.</p>

          <p>The death toll from severe flash floods in central Texas has tragically risen to over 100, with many individuals still missing. The disaster, which struck during the July Fourth holiday, heavily impacted Kerr County, where a summer camp for girls saw numerous fatalities. Search and rescue operations are ongoing amid threats of more rain, but hopes of finding more survivors are diminishing. The White House has defended the National Weather Service's response against claims that budget cuts may have hampered disaster warnings.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost their fourth consecutive game, falling 9-1 to the Milwaukee Brewers after a catastrophic first inning for pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Yamamoto gave up five runs in just two-thirds of an inning, the shortest start of his MLB career, marked by a three-run homer and compounded by poor defense. The 41-pitch collapse put the Dodgers in a hole from which their shorthanded lineup could not recover.

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved to permanently restrict landlords from evicting tenants for the purpose of substantial remodels, a practice known as "renoviction." The new amendment to the "just cause" ordinance will require landlords to obtain a government agency order to vacate a unit for renovations, typically issued for safety code violations. This measure aims to close a loophole that some landlords used to evict long-term tenants and subsequently raise rents for new occupants. The city is also developing rules for tenant relocation assistance and penalties for landlords who violate the ordinance.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas that killed over 100 people were caused by a confluence of factors, including flood-prone geography and a powerful weather system.

The massive rainfall occurred in the middle of a holiday night, catching many campers and residents asleep and unprepared. The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, leading to widespread devastation and raising questions about the adequacy of flood warning systems.</p>

          <p>An 83-year-old woman died in North Carolina after her vehicle was swept away by floodwaters caused by the remnants of Tropical Depression Chantal. The storm system brought flash flooding to numerous counties, prompting dozens of water rescues and a state of emergency declaration in Orange County. Residents in Chapel Hill were trapped in their apartments by rising waters that inundated homes and businesses. The storm system is now moving northeast over Virginia, with forecasters warning of continued heavy rainfall and a risk of flash flooding across several mid-Atlantic states.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has canceled its plan to lay off tens of thousands of employees, stating that a large-scale reduction-in-force is no longer necessary. The agency is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a hiring freeze, which it claims has eliminated the need for the previously considered RIF. VA Secretary Doug Collins stated the department is "headed in the right direction" and that a department-wide RIF is "off the table." However, some lawmakers criticized the announcement, suggesting the high attrition rate is due to a "toxic work environment."</p>

          <p>China has activated another branch of the M503 flight path in the Taiwan Strait without consulting Taipei, a move that has raised alarms in Taiwan. The new route, W121, is one of several offshoots of the main north-south path and at its closest point lies just 4.2 nautical miles from the strait's unofficial median line. Beijing's Civil Aviation Administration claimed the adjustment was a technical measure to relieve air traffic pressure and improve safety. However, Taipei views such unilateral actions as a potential security risk and a change to the status quo in the sensitive region.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that there was no "client list" or evidence of blackmail against prominent figures in the Jeffrey Epstein case. The review, detailed in a public memo, also reaffirmed the official finding that Epstein died by suicide in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019. Investigators stated they found no credible evidence to pursue charges against uncharged third parties and that perpetuating unfounded theories serves no public interest. The memo aims to dispel widespread conspiracy theories that the government was concealing information to protect powerful individuals.</p>

          <p>South Korea has aborted a planned $2.2 billion purchase of 36 additional AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, a decision influenced by the weapon's perceived vulnerability in modern warfare. A South Korean lawmaker stated that the effectiveness of drones and advanced air defense systems, as demonstrated in the war in Ukraine, prompted the move. Instead of investing in expensive legacy platforms, the country will redirect funds toward developing drones and other smart systems better suited for the future battlefield. This decision reflects a growing global debate about the survivability and relevance of traditional attack helicopters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has delayed the imposition of widespread tariff hikes but has detailed new rates for 14 countries, including a 25% tax on goods from Japan and South Korea, effective August 1. The move comes as a 90-day pause on aggressive import taxes was set to expire. The White House also issued letters outlining new tariff rates for other nations, such as a 40% tariff on Myanmar and Laos and a 36% tariff on Thailand and Cambodia. The administration argues the tariffs protect U.S. businesses, but economists warn they could raise consumer prices and reduce trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in central Texas has raised serious questions about the adequacy of the region's emergency alert systems and whether federal budget cuts affected weather warnings. Despite numerous alerts from the National Weather Service, some residents received no warnings, and local officials did not initiate mobile alerts through the IPAWS system. Kerr County, the hardest-hit area, lacks a siren-based flood warning system due to cost concerns. While the White House defended the NWS forecasts, critics and union officials point to staffing shortages and suspended programs as potential factors that hampered the disaster response.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadly flash floods in Texas serve as a stark reminder of the similar catastrophic risks faced by California, where extreme weather could also cause devastating inundations. Experts note that California's hilly topography and river systems make it vulnerable to flash floods, particularly from intense atmospheric river storms, which are projected to worsen with climate change. While California may have stronger building regulations that limit construction in high-risk floodways, many campgrounds and homeless encampments remain exposed. The Texas disaster underscores the critical need for risk awareness and robust emergency preparedness in flood-prone areas.</p>
