          <h2>Japan Mandates Carbon Emissions Trading for Major Firms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 00:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has enacted a revised law that requires 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in fiscal year 2026, aiming to advance the country's green transformation and decarbonization efforts. The law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually, covering industries like steel and car production, which account for approximately 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Under the trading system, companies receive a maximum emission allowance, and those exceeding this threshold must purchase carbon credits from companies with a surplus, incentivizing emissions reduction. While intended to lower emissions, the new system may lead to price increases for consumers as companies pass on the costs of decarbonization. Optimism score must be a multiple of 5 between 0 and 100.</p>

          <p>U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger is retiring after leading the department through a period of rebuilding following the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Manger addressed intelligence, communication, equipment, training, and leadership failures after the prior leadership lost confidence in the department. He successfully advocated for increased funding to improve hiring, equipment, and operations, and he claims the department now has a world-class intelligence operation. Manger has requested nearly $1 billion in funding for 2026 due to elevated threats against members of Congress, while a union representative noted that manpower remains an issue affecting morale.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A British think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), warns that a People's Liberation Army (PLA) attack on Taiwan is "unlikely in the near future" but "not impossible," particularly given the risks of misperception and miscommunication with the US under President Donald Trump. The IISS report highlights strained US-China relations, characterized by "deep mutual distrust and a lack of dialogue mechanisms," setting the tone for potential conflict. While tactical improvements occurred during the Biden administration, the report cautions these are unlikely to significantly alter the strategic direction during Trump's second term. The report underscores the need for careful management of US-China relations to avoid escalation.</p>

          <p>The trial of healthcare workers involved in the death of Argentine football legend Diego Maradona is in doubt after a judge, Julieta Makintach, recused herself due to her participation in a documentary about the case, which could violate impartiality laws. Makintach's involvement in the "Divine Justice" miniseries, which allegedly includes recordings from inside the courtroom, led to accusations of behaving like an actress rather than a judge. The remaining judges will decide whether to proceed with the trial or order a new one, as seven members of Maradona's medical team face charges of negligent homicide related to his 2020 death. The trial began on March 11 and was expected to last until July.</p>

Despite US-China tensions, Whale emphasizes a global opportunity, with clients like Procter & Gamble and Watsons, and the company has raised $60 million in Series C funding. Ye believes the largest AI markets remain the US and China, with Southeast Asia likely to adopt scenarios from these regions, and he dismisses concerns about a shortage of AI computing power in China. Whale uses AI to enhance the customer experience at Starbucks, ensuring coffee orders are delivered within five minutes 98% of the time, and the company reported revenue of 230 million yuan last year, expecting 400 million yuan this year.</p>

          <p>Marc LeBlanc and Laura Robinson, hospitality professionals with experience in destinations like the Maldives and Bali, reveal the differences between living and working in paradise compared to vacationing there. LeBlanc notes that resort employees are often "locked" on islands, living in staff villages resembling summer camps, which can present challenges in managing a multicultural workforce. Robinson emphasizes the importance of ensuring employee happiness alongside guest satisfaction and highlights the maintenance issues caused by saltwater in island environments and humidity in the Cambodian forest, where they currently manage a luxury resort. The couple also face the challenge of living far from their families but have found success in working together for nearly two decades.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's upcoming IPO is notable not only as one of the first major cryptocurrency companies to go public in the U.S., but also for its peculiar share distribution. The company plans to sell 9.6 million shares, while existing shareholders will sell 14.4 million shares, with the latter accounting for 60% of the total, which is rare in tech IPOs, save for Facebook's 2012 IPO. This move likely reflects the extended period of poor returns for venture capital firms, who are eager to gain liquidity after the market peaked in 2021. Circle, profitable with $64.8 million in net income in the latest quarter, expects to raise $240 million in the IPO.</p>

Despite the White House's insistence that the tax cuts will boost government revenue, Musk's criticism highlights concerns about the bill's impact on the national debt.

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, reached space but lost control during reentry, marking another mixed result for the spacecraft's development. The upper-stage vehicle experienced a propellant leak, causing it to spin out of control and break up as it re-entered the atmosphere, with debris falling into the Indian Ocean. While the company fixed ascent problems from previous flights, the loss of control prevented planned tests of heat shield variations, which are crucial for the spacecraft's reusability. Despite the setback, the mission demonstrated progress, including the successful reuse of a Super Heavy booster, though it was ultimately lost during a simulated landing.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship rocket made an uncontrolled reentry after losing contact with mission control during its ninth uncrewed test flight. The rocket leaked fuel, spun out of control, and reentered the Earth's atmosphere, likely disintegrating over the Indian Ocean, according to SpaceX. The company confirmed that Starship suffered from "a rapid unscheduled disassembly," and the likeliest cause of the loss of attitude control "appears to be a propellant leak or engine failure in the upper stage, leading to a spin during reentry." SpaceX emphasized that the test will help improve Starship's reliability as it seeks to make life multiplanetary, and the previous two attempts ended in explosions.</p>

Black and grey smoke is still rising from the facility as emergency services continue to tend to the site, and local officials have not yet released air quality test results. The blast occurred at a plant operated by Shandong Youdao Chemical, sending debris more than a kilometer away, injuring nineteen people, and leaving six missing. One resident, Yu Qianming, reported damage to his home but said he and his wife felt safe as long as the wind continued to blow north, though they moved their grandchild elsewhere as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty finding employment, with unemployed grads accounting for 12% of the national unemployment rate increase since mid-2023, according to a report from Oxford Economics. The unemployment rate among workers aged 22-27 with recent college degrees is nearing 6%, surpassing the national unemployment rate of 4.2%. The rise is attributed to a mismatch between an oversupply of recent graduates in fields with waning business demand, particularly in the tech industry, with advances in AI also impacting lower-level computer science positions. Economic uncertainty driven by tariff policies is also contributing to hiring slowdowns, potentially causing the unemployment rate among recent college graduates to rise further.</p>

However, engineers at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) say they have found a way to slash turbulence intensity by nearly half, reducing "extremely severe bumps" to levels that are "pronounced, but not unpleasant".
