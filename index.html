          <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton shared his insights on President Trump's second term, characterizing it as incoherent and driven by Trump's desire for attention. Bolton, who has been critical of Trump since leaving his administration, noted that while the first 100 days saw significant activity, follow-up remains uncertain. Despite concerns about constitutional infringements, Bolton believes that American institutions are strong enough to withstand Trump's actions. He suggests that many of Trump's efforts will ultimately fail due to checks and balances, particularly within the judicial system.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and its unionized baristas are locked in a wage dispute, with the union rejecting the company's latest proposal for annual raises. The union contends that the proposal lacks immediate pay raises, benefit increases, and guaranteed work hours, failing to meet the economic needs of workers. Starbucks maintains that it offers competitive pay and benefits, with average hourly pay exceeding $19. The two sides have been negotiating for over two years, with federal mediators now involved in resolving the dispute.</p>

          <p>As tariffs disrupt trade at Los Angeles-area ports, the demand for bonded warehouses is surging. These warehouses allow importers to store goods without paying tariffs until they are removed, providing a temporary buffer against rising costs. However, only a small fraction of industrial properties in the region are bonded, creating a shortage of available space. While some importers are canceling orders, others are paying to bring goods ashore, hoping for a resolution to the tariff war. Overall warehouse demand is expected to fall as tariffs take effect, impacting the region's industrial real estate market.</p>
