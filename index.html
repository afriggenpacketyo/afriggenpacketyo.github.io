        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods announced its intent to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, aiming to broaden its international footprint and attract a more diverse customer base, particularly in urban and lower-to-middle-income demographics. Foot Locker CEO Mary Dillon views the merger as beneficial for expanding sneaker culture and enhancing the omnichannel experience. Dick's expects to operate Foot Locker as a separate business unit and anticipates the deal will boost earnings within the first fiscal year, projecting $100 million to $125 million in cost synergies. However, analysts at TD Cowen have expressed skepticism, downgrading Dick's shares due to concerns about integration risks and potential low returns on capital. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, indicated that consumers could start seeing price increases later this month due to tariffs, even with recent agreements to lower duties on imports from China. Despite surpassing quarterly earnings expectations and maintaining its full-year forecast, Walmart's shares experienced a slight dip as the company remains cautious about fluctuating U.S. tariff policies. The retailer reported its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business, driven by growth in online advertising and its third-party marketplace. Walmart expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter but declined to provide guidance for earnings per share or operating income growth due to tariff uncertainty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing the legality of President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants. Trump's administration argues that the 14th Amendment's jurisdiction clause does not apply to these children, a claim challenged by many legal experts. Lower courts have blocked the order, leading the administration to argue that these courts overstepped their authority by issuing nationwide injunctions. A ruling in favor of Trump could significantly impact immigration policy and expand presidential power through executive orders, potentially affecting tens of thousands of children and raising concerns about statelessness.</p>

With the stock now trading near $330, the trust is reducing its weighting in Eaton and downgrading its rating to a hold-equivalent 2.

          <p>The UK economy demonstrated unexpected strength in the first three months of the year, surpassing gloomy predictions with a growth rate of 0.7%. While trade war factors and a bounceback from previous stagnation contributed, the resilience may extend beyond temporary factors. Real incomes are up, and many businesses outside retail and hospitality have adapted to rising National Insurance contributions. Interest rate cuts and relative political and economic stability could be more significant factors than initially anticipated, suggesting a more robust consumer base and a shift in thinking about the British economy.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the National Association of Realtors reveals a growing shortage of affordable homes for middle-income families, with only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March being affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing homes out of reach for many, exacerbating an affordability gap rooted in the housing crisis of 2006. Cities with restrictive zoning and permitting regulations are experiencing the worst affordability gaps, while areas with increased construction are showing improvements. The lack of affordable homes is driving up prices further, shutting out more middle-income families from the housing market.</p>
