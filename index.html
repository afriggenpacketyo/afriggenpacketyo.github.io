          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, fulfilling predictions from football analysts. Ward becomes the third consecutive quarterback to be chosen as the top pick, following Caleb Williams and Bryce Young in previous years, signifying the importance of the quarterback position in the league. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Travis Hunter, a two-way player from Colorado, highlighting the draft's unpredictability, which is being held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, this year. The draft continues with rounds two and three on Friday, and rounds four through seven on Saturday.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering a proposal that would recognize Russian control over Crimea as part of a peace deal with Ukraine, reversing a decade of U.S. policy. During his first term, Trump had hinted at accepting Russia's annexation of the peninsula, but his administration later doubled down against Moscow, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pledging to maintain nonrecognition until Ukraine's territorial integrity is restored. This potential shift signifies a departure from the long-standing American stance on the issue, raising concerns among allies and potentially altering the dynamics of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is facing scrutiny on multiple fronts, including renewed attacks from political opponents and fallout from the "Signalgate" controversy involving leaked military information. The attacks are not about Hegseth himself, but rather an attempt to undermine the Trump administration's foreign policy, particularly regarding Iran. Hegseth has also been caught in the crosshairs of last month’s “Signalgate” group chat controversy, which saw sensitive military information about the United States’ attack plans on the Yemen-based Houthi terrorists inexplicably delivered to the editor in chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg. The situation highlights internal divisions within the administration and ongoing debates over U.S. policy in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's efforts to cut bureaucratic fat in the federal government, under the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), are likely to save taxpayers only $150 billion, falling far short of the originally promised savings. The errors and obfuscations underlying DOGE’s claims of savings are well documented. The costs incurred by taking what Mr. Trump called a “hatchet” to government and the resulting firings, agency lockouts and building seizures that mostly wound up in court have largely offset the savings. Firings, re-hirings, lost productivity and paid leave of thousands of workers will cost upward of $135 billion this fiscal year.</p>

Zelenskyy responded by cutting short his trip to South Africa and reiterating that recognizing occupied territory as Russian is a red line for his country. The EU's foreign policy chief condemned the attack, stating that it underscored Russia as the main obstacle to ending the war.</p>
