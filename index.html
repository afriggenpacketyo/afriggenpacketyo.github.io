          <p>President Trump downplayed concerns about the impact of new tariffs on U.S. consumers, suggesting that American children could be content with fewer toys. He stated that a young girl does not need an excessive number of dolls or pencils, sparking criticism from figures like Senator Bernie Sanders, who accused Trump of being out of touch with working-class families. Republican strategist Karl Rove also criticized Trump's remarks, comparing him to "Mr. Scrooge," prompting a rebuttal from the former president on Truth Social. Trump's comments follow earlier acknowledgments that the tariffs could lead to emptier shelves in American stores.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on films made outside the United States, citing a desire to revitalize the American film industry. He attributed the industry's decline to foreign countries offering incentives to attract filmmakers, which he views as a national security threat. The announcement has raised questions about the scope of the tariffs, including whether they would apply to American production companies filming abroad and to streaming services. The UK media union Bectu warned that the tariffs could severely harm the UK film industry, potentially costing thousands of freelancers their jobs.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA following ongoing delays and cancellations at Newark Liberty International Airport. Schumer attributes the disruptions to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, DOGE-related cuts to the FAA, and outdated technology. He criticized the FAA's distribution of retention bonuses, noting that Newark was not included despite its critical need. United Airlines is reducing flights at Newark, and the FAA has implemented a "flow constrained area," typically used in Florida during peak seasons, highlighting the severity of the situation.</p>

          <p>Hawaii lawmakers have approved a first-of-its-kind bill that increases the stateâ€™s lodging tax to fund environmental protection and natural disaster defenses. The bill adds a 0.75% levy to existing taxes on short-term accommodations and imposes an 11% tax on cruise ship bills. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually, which will be used for projects such as beach replenishment and wildfire prevention.

The Menendez brothers' attorney, Mark Geragos, cited a conflict of interest, claiming that Hochman holds a different view on resentencing and that a recently hired attorney in Hochman's office is biased against them.

The second dinner offers access to Trump's inner circle to holders of the $TRUMP meme token, with entry based on the number of tokens held. The crypto community has praised Trump's appointees for a shift in policy that has resulted in regulatory wins across federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Small business owners are expressing concerns that President Trump's tariffs could jeopardize their survival, as uncertainty around the tariffs is already impacting their operations. Rising prices due to tariffs are making it difficult for small businesses to compete without driving customers away. Some owners have reported significant price increases on imported goods, forcing them to raise prices or face potential closure. Employment at small businesses has declined since Trump took office, with owners struggling to absorb the costs of new duties on imports.</p>

          <p>Homeowners seeking to borrow money may find HELOCs (home equity lines of credit) an attractive option, but qualifying can be challenging. Lenders typically require sufficient home equity (at least 15-20%), a strong credit score (620 or higher, preferably 680+), a low debt-to-income ratio (ideally below 36%), and stable income and employment. Improving chances of approval involves checking credit reports, lowering the DTI ratio, shopping around for lenders, and potentially adding a co-applicant. Homeowners should prepare and understand lender criteria before applying.</p>

While Harvard President Alan Garber has initiated reforms, the roots of the problem are deeply embedded in identity-driven politics and craven behavior at the top. The Trump administration's approach is criticized as vandalism, not reform. The university must make its disciplinary system stick.
