          <p>Former President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded a nearly three-hour summit in Alaska, with both leaders indicating progress but stopping short of announcing a definitive deal. Putin mentioned an "agreement" without providing specifics, while Trump described the negotiations as "extremely productive," noting that several points were agreed upon but a final deal remains elusive. A key objective for the summit, a ceasefire in Ukraine, was not announced, and Trump stated he would consult with NATO and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy following the talks. Both leaders departed without taking questions from the press.</p>

          <p>Following Taylor Swift's announcement of her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," numerous major corporations have launched marketing campaigns centered around the color orange. The trend was sparked by Swift's frequent use of the color and her discussion of its personal significance on a recent podcast with Travis and Jason Kelce. Companies from United Airlines to Netflix have posted orange-themed content on social media, seeking to align their brands with the singer's immense economic influence. The phenomenon highlights the significant impact Swift's cultural presence has on consumer markets and corporate branding strategies.</p>

          <p>A Georgia court has ordered singer Teyana Taylor to pay $70,000 to cover the attorney fees of her ex-husband, former NBA player Iman Shumpert. The ruling came after Taylor was found in contempt of court for violating their 2024 divorce agreement by allegedly leaking settlement details to blogs. Both parties had accused each other of the violation, but the court found Taylor responsible for the disclosure. The judge determined she had the financial means to cover the costs, citing her recent film roles and upcoming television projects.</p>

          <p>Young adults across England are reporting significant financial hardship due to expensive bus fares, which they say impact their ability to afford food, socialize, and pay rent. A recent report by MPs recommended extending free bus travel to everyone under 22, similar to a policy in Scotland, to ease these burdens. The article shares personal accounts from individuals aged 18 to 22 who spend substantial portions of their income on daily commutes for work and college. They argue that free or subsidized travel would provide much-needed financial relief and greater personal independence.</p>

Originally from British India, Abbas served as a combat cameraman with the British 14th Army in the Burma campaign, documenting key battles like Kohima and Mandalay. In a recent interview, he reflected on the horrors of war and lamented that humanity seems to have learned little from past conflicts.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the reintroduction of standalone physical stores on the UK High Street, years after its previous owner, Arcadia, collapsed. The brand, now owned by Asos, is also hosting its first catwalk show in seven years to signal its return and aims to recapture its former "cool" status. Industry experts note that while nostalgia may attract its original millennial and Gen-Z customer base, the brand faces challenges in appealing to new, younger shoppers and competing with fast-fashion prices. Topshop's leadership expressed confidence in finding a market for its distinct aesthetic.</p>

          <p>Liverpool won their opening Premier League match 4-2 against Bournemouth in a dramatic game at Anfield, but the performance revealed significant defensive weaknesses. New signing Hugo Ekitike was a standout, scoring one goal and assisting another, making a strong case for his place in the team. However, the team's defensive frailties were exposed, particularly when Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo scored an equalizer that highlighted gaps in Liverpool's midfield and defense. Late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah ultimately secured the win for the reigning champions in an emotionally charged match.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and state Democrats are advancing a plan to redraw the state's congressional district boundaries, a move aimed at countering similar Republican-led efforts in other states and influencing control of the U.S. House.

This strategic maneuver is seen as a direct response to former President Trump's encouragement of GOP states to gerrymander mid-decade, potentially setting off a nationwide redistricting battle.</p>

          <p>A new working paper from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals a significant decline in the number of young adults aged 25 to 34 achieving traditional life milestones. Compared to 1975, when nearly half of young adults had moved out, secured a job, married, and had a child, less than a quarter have done so today. Researchers attribute this shift to increased economic barriers, such as the rising cost of living, and changing societal attitudes toward family formation. The report notes that economic achievements are now seen as more critical markers of adulthood than marriage.</p>

          <p>Environmental organizations have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging it is attempting to improperly rewrite climate science. The lawsuit targets a recent Department of Energy report, commissioned in secret and authored by five scientists known for their contrarian views on climate change. Critics claim the report is filled with inaccuracies and misrepresents peer-reviewed research to downplay the risks of carbon emissions. The environmental groups argue this report is being used to provide a false scientific basis for the EPA's efforts to revoke the 2009 Endangerment Finding.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, for high-stakes talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. The summit follows Trump's previous unsuccessful efforts to broker a peace deal and a deadline he set for a ceasefire. The White House has framed the meeting as a "listening exercise," and Trump himself has acknowledged a low probability of immediate success. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy is not attending but has welcomed the talks, while insisting that any agreement made without Ukrainian input would be a "dead decision."</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a former Republican candidate for the New Mexico state legislature, has been sentenced to 80 years in federal prison for orchestrating a series of drive-by shootings at the homes of four Democratic officials. The attacks occurred after Peña lost his 2022 election by a wide margin, which he baselessly claimed was "rigged." Prosecutors argued that Peña sought to intimidate political opponents and cause fear, highlighting the case as an example of rising political violence. No one was injured in the shootings, though bullets entered the home of a state senator.</p>

          <p>A federal program designed to help public service workers achieve student loan forgiveness more quickly is currently overwhelmed, with a backlog of 72,730 applications as of July. The PSLF Buyback program allows borrowers with 120 months of qualifying employment to retroactively make payments for periods of forbearance to reach the forgiveness threshold sooner. However, applicants report waiting six months or more for the Department of Education to process their requests. The delays have worsened under the Trump administration, causing uncertainty for borrowers trying to manage their debt.</p>

          <p>Carrie Wheeler has resigned as CEO of the online real estate company Opendoor, following a period of intense pressure from investors. The company's stock has seen a recent surge driven by retail interest but has struggled since its 2020 IPO, with its value plummeting due to rising interest rates. Activist investors, including hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois, publicly called for Wheeler's departure, criticizing the company's direction. Opendoor has named its technology chief as interim leader while it begins a search for a new CEO.</p>

Playboy plans to establish its new base in a luxury office complex and intends to open a new Playboy Club in the area. The relocation marks a strategic return for the brand to South Florida, where it had a significant presence in the past.</p>

          <p>As President Trump greeted Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska for their summit, a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber and several F-35 and F-22 fighter jets performed a flyover at the military base. The B-2 bomber is a potent symbol of U.S. military power, capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons and known for its role in long-range strikes. While it was not confirmed if Trump personally ordered the display, it served as a powerful show of force ahead of the critical diplomatic discussions concerning the war in Ukraine.</p>

The Department of Transportation has released new guidance to allow the funds to flow again, but it has removed several Biden-era requirements related to community engagement and labor standards. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that while he disagrees with subsidizing green energy, the administration will respect Congress's decision, framing the new rules as a way to cut red tape.</p>
