          <p>An explosion at a construction site in Tokyo injured ten people after a maintenance vehicle caught fire. Police suspect a gas leak from a damaged pipe during foundation work may have triggered the blast. The victims, ranging in age from their 20s to 70s, included construction workers and nearby residents, some of whom suffered from smoke inhalation. The explosion caused damage to windows and shutters of adjacent buildings, and an emergency call was received around 9:35 a.m. local time, with one local resident describing the sound as similar to thunder and observing black smoke rising from the scene.</p>

          <p>Wealthy individuals are increasingly storing their gold in Singapore due to growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty. A facility called "The Reserve" has seen an 88% increase in orders to store gold and silver from the start of the year to April, compared to the same period in 2024, with sales for precious metals bars skyrocketing 200% year on year in that time. Singapore is viewed as a safe jurisdiction with political and economic stability, leading to its reputation as the 'Geneva of the East.' Clients are opting for physical gold bars over paper gold to mitigate counterparty and geopolitical risks, with concerns about the health of the global financial system also driving this trend.

Lenton Vanburen was detained in Baton Rouge, while Leo Tate and Jermaine Donald were arrested in Walker County, Texas, by the Texas Department of Public Safety. The three men will face additional charges related to the escape, and at least 13 people have been arrested in connection with the incident. The escape went unnoticed for several hours, and surveillance video showed the inmates forcing open a cell door and breaching a wall behind the toilet, and fleeing through a loading dock.</p>

He swam in frigid 47-degree water, enduring challenging weather conditions, including a nor'easter, making it one of his most difficult swims. Pugh, a United Nations Patron of the Oceans, emphasizes the critical need to protect sharks, highlighting that approximately 100 million sharks are killed each year, calling it an "ecocide."</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were fake, more than double the number detected in 2022. The company's policies on fake reviews have become more aggressive, particularly against "incentivized reviews." Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged approach involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews. Most paid reviews originate in Asia, and rooting out these reviews is a constant "cat and mouse" game, but Tripadvisor is improving its detection methods every year, relying less on review content and more on posting behavior.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese automakers experienced a second day of decline due to fears of a price war and increased scrutiny from regulators. BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares fell after announcing price cuts on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models, leading investors to turn cautious about stiffer competition in the sector. China's commerce ministry is reportedly meeting with industry bodies and automakers regarding the practice of marking cars as sold to meet sales targets. An analyst expects BYD's vehicle margin to be under pressure in the short term due to the need to hit sales targets, and regardless of whether its sales campaign is extended beyond its current deadline of June, the company will offset the impact via larger sales scale and battery cost staying low.</p>

Approximately 14 million cubic meters of removed soil and waste are currently stored at an interim facility near the nuclear complex, and government guidelines prohibit soil with more than 8,000 becquerels per kilogram of radioactive cesium from being used in public works projects.</p>

          <p>A plan to add 153 new homes to the village of Maids Moreton in England is facing opposition due to the local sewage works already operating over capacity. Residents fear that connecting the new homes will increase sewage pollution in the nearby river, the Great Ouse. The Environment Agency has objected to new developments in other areas due to similar concerns, leading to potential housing delays. The charity Wildfish has been granted permission for a judicial review, challenging the planning permission and highlighting the gap between housing plans and sewage infrastructure capacity.

Ms. Packer had taken abortion medication she received through a pills-by-post system during the pandemic, and a midwife called the police after Ms. Packer told her about taking the medication.</p>

          <p>Mainland Chinese authorities have accused a hacker group allegedly backed by Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of orchestrating cyberattacks on up to 1,000 sensitive mainland networks. The targets included military, energy, and government systems, with the attacks described as "malicious sabotage" aimed at disrupting mainland security. The group reportedly used "rudimentary and crude" methods, including phishing emails and exploiting public vulnerabilities. The attackers attempted to mask their origin by routing attacks through virtual private networks (VPNs), foreign cloud servers, and “zombie machines” to hide behind IP addresses from multiple countries.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits rose for a second consecutive month in April, with growth improving despite U.S. tariffs and persistent deflationary pressures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms climbed 3% compared to a year earlier, accelerating from a 2.6% growth in March. The boost in industrial firms' profits was largely owed to Beijing's efforts targeted at supporting the private sector, offsetting some of the negative impacts from the U.S. tariffs. Profits in the high-tech manufacturing industry climbed 9% from a year earlier, with notable improvement in the biopharmaceutical products and aircraft manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese-owned Volvo Cars will cut around 3,000 jobs as part of its cost-cutting measures, mainly impacting office-based positions in Sweden. The move is attributed to the challenging period faced by the global motor industry, including U.S. tariffs, higher material costs, and slower sales in Europe. Volvo scaled back its ambition to go all-electric by 2030 due to issues including additional uncertainties created by recent tariffs on EVs. Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD recently announced price cuts on more than 20 of its models, leading other Chinese carmakers to follow suit.</p>

If U.S. tariffs stay at current levels, exports to the United States would fall by half, resulting in a loss of up to six million manufacturing jobs.
