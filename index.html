          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to at least 22 others. The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly lost power before the crash, causing its masts to strike the underside of the bridge. Emergency services responded to the scene, transporting injured crew members to local hospitals, while authorities assessed the bridge for structural damage. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident, which briefly closed all lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is increasingly promoting public-private partnerships (PPPs) to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This new approach aims to address African governments' debt concerns by granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing. Several high-profile projects, including Nairobi’s mega-highway, the stalled Kenyan railway, and Zambia’s Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway, are being considered under the PPP model, with Chinese infrastructure financiers potentially contributing up to 40% of project costs in exchange for exclusive construction and operation rights for a minimum of 25 years.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a presidential election rerun after the previous vote in November was annulled by the constitutional court due to irregularities in campaign financing and organization. The annulled election saw far-right, pro-Russian candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly win the first round. Alleged electoral violations included the use of fake social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messages as part of a Russian hybrid attack, which Moscow denies. Georgescu has been barred from participating in the rerun, and Romanian public prosecutors opened an investigation into him in February.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to delay the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and introduce a monthly fee for current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" due to budget deficits. The changes, part of Newsom's May revision, aim to address a $12 billion state budget shortfall attributed to factors such as President Trump's tariffs and rising healthcare costs. The plan would suspend access to comprehensive Medi-Cal services for undocumented adults over 19 starting January 1, while those with "unsatisfactory" status would face a $100 monthly fee from January 1, 2027, with the expectation that these policies will save California $5.4 billion by the 2028-29 fiscal year.</p>

          <p>The discovery of bloody, bare footprints at the scene of Jeanie Childs' murder in Minneapolis in 1993 launched a decades-long investigation. Childs, a 35-year-old woman, was found stabbed to death in her apartment, with the footprints belonging to her killer due to her wearing socks. Despite collecting DNA and comparing footprints to multiple suspects, the case remained unsolved until 2015, when investigative genetic genealogy linked the DNA to Jerry Westrom. Westrom, a married father of three, was eventually convicted of Childs' murder in 2022, with the bloody footprints playing a crucial role in the trial.</p>

The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly lost power before colliding with the bridge, and authorities have found no signs of structural damage to the bridge. The Mexican ambassador to the U.S. noted that the ship had been sailing for approximately 20 years and was en route from Cozumel, Mexico, to Iceland. The incident prompted a temporary shutdown of the bridge, and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the mechanical failure.</p>

          <p>India's recent military engagement with Pakistan, triggered by a terrorist attack, highlights the country's ongoing struggle to manage its relationship with its neighbor. While India possesses greater economic and diplomatic power, the conflict with Pakistan diverts resources and attention, hindering its ascent as a global power. The risk of escalation, coupled with religious nationalism and hardened views on both sides, makes finding a peaceful resolution increasingly difficult. Despite efforts to isolate Pakistan diplomatically and militarily, India faces the challenge of managing a troubled neighbor with nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw made his season debut for the Dodgers, pitching four uneven innings in an 11-9 loss to the Angels. Despite the loss, Kershaw's return provided a boost to the Dodgers, who are currently missing three starting pitchers due to injuries. Kershaw's performance included glimpses of his former skill, but his command was inconsistent, which he needs to improve going forward. The Angels won the game thanks to a career-high five RBIs from catcher Logan O'Hoppe, securing a series win against the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>Casey Michel argues that while President Trump's foreign dealings and family's profiteering are blatant examples of corruption, they are not unique in American politics. The author contends that both Democratic and Republican politicians have engaged in similar behavior, citing Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings and the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of funds from questionable regimes. The article calls for Congress to take action to prevent former politicians from serving as foreign lobbyists and to target the family members of high-ranking officials to curb foreign influence.</p>

He argues that while Europe is investing in efficient and environmentally friendly rail travel, the United States remains overly reliant on cars and is distracted by futuristic but impractical transportation projects. The author advocates for greater investment in American railways to improve connectivity, reduce environmental impact, and foster a sense of community among travelers.</p>
