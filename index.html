          <p>McDonald's and Krispy Kreme are terminating their partnership, with Krispy Kreme doughnuts no longer being sold at McDonald's locations after July 2nd. McDonald's indicated that while the collaboration was beneficial for them, it was not sustainable for Krispy Kreme's business model. Krispy Kreme's CEO cited unsuccessful efforts to align costs with unit demand as the reason for ending the partnership. Krispy Kreme will now concentrate on expanding through high-volume retail distribution points and international franchise growth, and the agreement was considered a minor aspect of McDonald's breakfast offerings. Optimism remains moderate as both companies refocus on their core strategies.</p>

          <p>Many maritime insurance underwriters are avoiding providing coverage to vessels perceived to have links to the U.S., Israel, or the U.K. due to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Insurance rates for vessels that are being covered have risen significantly, ranging from 0.25% to 0.5% of the ship's value, with even higher rates for U.S.-affiliated ships. The notification period required by underwriters has also been reduced from 48 to 24 hours due to market volatility. Concerns include the potential for Iran to block ships and the level of involvement from China, a major consumer of Iranian oil, in the region's maritime activities.</p>

          <p>A gay anti-bullying PSA from the late 2000s, featuring Hilary Duff, has become a cult classic, remembered for its humorous and over-the-top approach to combating anti-LGBTQ+ language. The "Think B4 You Speak" campaign, spearheaded by GLSEN, aimed to discourage the use of the word "gay" as an insult. The ad's success is attributed to Duff's popularity among youth and the Advertising Council's support. While the media landscape has changed, the ad's impact is still felt, with many crediting it for raising awareness and reducing bullying rates.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, Tehran faces limited and unfavorable options, including military escalation or diplomatic concessions. A military response could involve attacks on U.S. forces or allies, while diplomatic options require accepting stringent demands for nuclear disarmament and regional limitations. Regardless of Iran's choice, the situation presents an opportunity for a positive transformation of the Middle East, potentially strengthening a regional coalition against Iran and reducing proliferation risks. The U.S. has also bolstered its global standing compared to Russia and China, and an Israel without an existential threat from Iran could make progress on the Palestinian issue.</p>

          <h2>Concerns Arise Over Funding Cuts Despite HIV Drug Approval</h2>

          <p>The approval of lenacapavir, a promising HIV prevention drug, is overshadowed by concerns over funding cuts to major global aid programs by the United States. Experts worry that these cuts could undermine efforts to end the HIV epidemic, particularly among vulnerable groups. Lencapavir, dubbed a "miracle" drug, offers six months of protection against HIV infection, but its potential impact may be limited by the defunding of public health agencies. The loss of funding could disproportionately affect low-income individuals, gay and bisexual men, and sex workers, hindering their access to this unprecedented protection.</p>

          <p>Maggie Gram's book, *The Invention of Design*, explores the evolution of design from commercial art to a broader discipline addressing societal issues. The field has shifted from beautifying objects to solving complex problems, but design thinking's utopian projects often fall short. Social scientists in tech companies promoted a "human-centered" approach, but profit often took priority. While design can contribute to positive change, it requires political consensus and participatory methods to address "wicked problems" effectively, as exemplified by Sylvia Harris's work on the U.S. census.</p>
