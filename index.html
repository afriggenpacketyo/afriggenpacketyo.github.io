          <p>Liverpool has officially completed the signing of 18-year-old defender Giovanni Leoni from the Italian club Parma for a reported fee of £26 million plus add-ons. The highly-rated Italy Under-19 international has signed a long-term contract with the club that extends until 2031. This acquisition addresses Liverpool's need for defensive reinforcements following the recent departure of Jarell Quansah. Leoni's move to Anfield comes after a successful debut season in Serie A, where he attracted interest from several other top European clubs before choosing to join the Premier League side.</p>

          <p>The city of Washington, D.C., has filed a lawsuit against the federal government following an order from the U.S. Attorney General to place the Drug Enforcement Administration's head in charge of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). D.C. officials argue this move is an illegal overreach and an abuse of authority under the Home Rule Act, creating a dangerous and confusing command structure. The lawsuit seeks to void the order and prevent the federal appointee from assuming command, asserting that it endangers public safety. This legal challenge marks a significant escalation in the conflict over local versus federal control of law enforcement in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Following Taylor Swift's announcement of her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," and her discussion of the color orange on a podcast with Travis Kelce, numerous major brands have launched orange-themed social media campaigns. Companies from United Airlines to Netflix quickly adopted the color in their marketing, aiming to capitalize on the immense economic and cultural influence Swift commands. This phenomenon highlights the singer's significant impact, where even a casual mention can trigger a widespread commercial response. Her Eras Tour previously demonstrated this effect by providing substantial economic boosts to host cities.</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials dropped significantly after the company issued a weaker-than-expected forecast for the upcoming quarter. Despite beating third-quarter earnings and revenue estimates, the company projected future earnings and revenue below analyst expectations, citing macroeconomic and policy uncertainties. CEO Gary Dickerson specifically noted that its business in China is being affected by this environment and that the company assumes pending U.S. export license applications will not be approved in the next quarter. The cautious outlook has raised concerns among investors about near-term growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erin has officially become the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasters predicting it will continue to intensify into a major hurricane over the weekend. Located east of the Leeward Islands, the storm is moving west-northwest with sustained winds of 75 mph. While not currently projected to make a direct impact on the United States, its path is being closely monitored, and residents in the Caribbean are warned of heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions. Forecast models suggest the hurricane will curve northward, remaining offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it potentially strengthens to a Category 4 storm early next week.</p>

In India-administered Kashmir, a remote village was hit particularly hard, resulting in at least 60 deaths and dozens more missing. Experts attribute the increasing frequency of intense rainfall, known as cloudbursts, to climate change, which exacerbates the impact of monsoon season in the region.</p>

          <p>Salford's Super League rugby match against Wakefield has been canceled due to significant welfare concerns for the club's players. The financially troubled team, which recently suffered an 80-6 defeat, has been forced to rely on inexperienced loanees after the departure of most senior professionals. A club statement revealed that of the 17 players available for the upcoming game, only two had recent Super League experience, and 11 others were unavailable due to injury. The Rugby Football League board will now determine the official outcome of the canceled fixture as the club struggles with its ongoing financial issues.</p>

          <p>A swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest reaching magnitude 4.0, has been recorded in Northern California's Geysers geothermal steam field. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such seismic activity is common in this area and is induced by the operations of the geothermal power facility located there. The process of withdrawing steam and injecting reclaimed water to generate electricity causes the surrounding rock to contract and shift, triggering these minor quakes. Officials emphasize that this activity is not linked to major fault lines like the San Andreas and does not pose a significant seismic hazard to the region.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected any ceasefire proposal that would require ceding territory.

The administration's appeal centers on the legal principle of how much authority courts have to impose broad, preventative restrictions on law enforcement tactics.

The 2-1 decision overturns a lower court's injunction that had blocked the workforce reduction. The majority opinion stated that the district court lacked jurisdiction, while the dissenting judge argued the move effectively allows the executive branch to unilaterally dismantle a congressionally created agency.

          <h2>Two Injured in Shooting Near Mosque in Orebro, Sweden</h2>

          <p>Swedish police have launched an attempted murder investigation after two people were injured in a shooting near a mosque in the city of Orebro. The incident occurred as Friday prayers were concluding, with local media reporting that one of the victims was shot while leaving the mosque. Authorities suspect the attack is connected to the country's ongoing struggle with armed criminal gangs rather than being ideologically motivated. This is the second major shooting in Orebro this year, following a deadly attack at an adult education center, and it highlights the persistent challenge of gang-related violence in Sweden.</p>

          <p>The FluMist nasal spray, the only non-injectable flu vaccine, is now available for self-administration at home through a new delivery service. Previously only administered by healthcare providers, the FDA has approved its use for individuals aged 2 to 49, with caregivers administering it to children. The service, called FluMist Home, will be available in 34 states for the upcoming flu season and is covered by most commercial insurance plans, though a shipping fee applies. This development aims to increase vaccination accessibility by providing a convenient option for those who prefer to avoid clinics or pharmacies.</p>

          <p>The NCAA has imposed one of its largest-ever financial penalties on the University of Michigan's football program for a sign-stealing scheme but will not ban the team from the playoffs. The university must forfeit over $20 million in postseason revenue and will face other sanctions, including scholarship reductions and recruiting restrictions. The investigation found that a former staffer, Connor Stalions, orchestrated an extensive in-person scouting operation to illegally decode opponents' signals. While classifying the violations as severe, the NCAA panel opted for financial penalties to avoid punishing current players for the actions of former staff and coaches.</p>

          <p>Author Jason Okundaye explains his decision to withdraw his book from the Polari first book prize longlist, an award celebrating LGBTQ+ literature. The withdrawal was a protest against the nomination of author John Boyne, who had recently published an article expressing trans-exclusionary views. Okundaye argues that the prize organizers' defense of the nomination on the grounds of artistic merit and tolerance for differing views contradicts the award's inclusive values. He joins several other authors and judges who have resigned in solidarity, stating the issue is not about censorship but about an institution accurately representing its principles to the community it claims to serve.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, who was convicted for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, is reportedly being persistently taunted by other inmates at a maximum-security prison. Sources indicate that prisoners have been yelling at him through air vents around the clock, affecting his ability to sleep. The Idaho Department of Correction has acknowledged Kohberger's complaints but characterized the interactions as common communication among inmates. Kohberger is housed in a restrictive unit for his own safety, confined to his cell for 23 hours a day. A forensic psychologist suggests the mockery is robbing him of the sense of control and infamy he may have sought.</p>

          <p>On Friday, the stock market experienced a rotation as investors moved away from momentum stocks and into the out-of-favor healthcare sector. This shift was highlighted by a significant surge in UnitedHealth's stock after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a major investment, boosting the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan's latest survey indicated a decline in consumer sentiment, with growing concerns about future inflation and unemployment. Analysts also weighed in on Cisco Systems following its earnings report, with some downgrading the stock due to concerns about its networking and security business segments.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.21 trillion, many consumers are struggling to manage their balances. For a typical $3,000 balance, the minimum monthly payment can range from $60 to $85, depending on the issuer's calculation method, which often combines a percentage of the balance with accrued interest. Simply making minimum payments is a costly strategy that can trap consumers in debt for years due to compounding interest. The article advises that paying more than the minimum is crucial, and explores alternative debt relief strategies such as balance transfers, consolidation loans, and credit counseling to help regain financial control.</p>

          <p>Human rights groups and legal experts are increasingly calling for the prosecution of starvation as a war crime, citing its use as a weapon in conflicts in Sudan, Gaza, and elsewhere. Although international law prohibits the intentional withholding of food from civilians, no perpetrator has ever been tried specifically for this crime. Legal challenges include proving intent and a lack of judicial precedent. However, recent developments, such as an ICC warrant mentioning starvation and a UN Security Council resolution condemning the practice, suggest a growing political and legal will to hold individuals accountable for using famine as a tool of war.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described the potential intervention as "essential" for U.S. national security. The argument is that government support is needed to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce American reliance on foreign manufacturers like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor for advanced chips. The news caused Intel's stock to climb over 4%. While government ownership of private companies is generally discouraged, the analyst contends that ensuring domestic production of critical technology is a matter of national security that justifies such a move.

The move comes as both brands have faced declining sales due to shifting consumer preferences toward specialty breads and lower-carbohydrate diets.
