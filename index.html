        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta AI users concerned about privacy can now adjust settings to prevent their prompts from being shared publicly on Facebook and Instagram. The company spokesperson emphasized that Meta AI chats are private by default, and public sharing requires a four-step process with a pre-post preview and the option to hide posts. To adjust privacy settings, users can navigate to the 'data and privacy' section in the app, then to the 'suggesting your prompts on other apps' tab to toggle sharing preferences for Facebook and Instagram. Users can also manage their information to make all public prompts visible only to themselves and delete their prompt history. The company has invested heavily in AI, including a $14 billion investment in startup Scale AI, to enhance its offerings and compete with other tech giants. The optimism score for this article is moderately high, reflecting the empowerment of users to control their privacy on Meta's platforms.</p>

          <p>International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Rafael Grossi reported to the United Nations Security Council that Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear sites have caused significant damage, including to the primary enrichment site at Natanz. The IAEA also stated that the site's electricity infrastructure and backup generators were destroyed, and while there was no direct attack on the underground cascade, the loss of power may have damaged the centrifuges. Radioactivity levels surrounding the site were normal, but the IAEA noted radiological and chemical contamination inside the facilities at Natanz, calling it manageable with radiation protection measures. Grossi reiterated that nuclear facilities must never be attacked, emphasizing the serious implications for nuclear security, safety, and international peace. The situation is tense and carries considerable risk, hence the optimism score is relatively low.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant, pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee after being brought back from detention in El Salvador. Federal prosecutors allege that Garcia was involved in a conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants, including minors, from Mexico and Central America within the U.S. for thousands of dollars. The government's case relies on a 2022 traffic stop where Garcia was pulled over with eight passengers, and testimony from alleged co-conspirators, some of whom received deals in exchange for their testimony. Garcia's attorneys argue that the government's evidence is weak and that Garcia is not a flight risk, citing a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution. Given the serious nature of the charges and the legal complexities, the optimism score is moderate.</p>

          <p>King Charles has requested that the Royal Family wear black armbands at the Trooping the Colour ceremony to honor the victims of the Air India plane crash. The King, who expressed being "desperately shocked" by the tragedy, also requested a minute's silence after his inspection of the parade. Flags at royal residences have been lowered to half-mast, and coachmen and women on carriages are also likely to wear black armbands. The Trooping the Colour ceremony marks the King's birthday and involves 1,350 troops in an annual parade, which will culminate in a Red Arrows flypast over Buckingham Palace. The event serves as a tribute to the lives lost and the communities affected by the air crash, thus the optimism score is moderate.</p>

          <p>Iran launched dozens of ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists, and military commanders. Israel's Iron Dome defense system intercepted most of the missiles, but some hits on structures caused injuries and damage. The United States helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles, and U.S. troops at bases in the Middle East were ordered into bunkers. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the IDF had begun "Operation Rising Lion," with airstrikes against Iranian nuclear sites, military commanders, and research scientists, with the goal to "roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival." Considering the ongoing conflict and potential for further escalation, the optimism score is quite low.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott stated that his primary focus is winning a Super Bowl, rather than securing his personal legacy. Entering his 10th season with the Cowboys, Prescott acknowledges the past decade has gone by quickly and expresses gratitude for the opportunity to play the game he loves. With changes to the team's roster and coaching staff, including the addition of wide receiver George Pickens and the promotion of Brian Schottenheimer to head coach, Prescott is determined to improve upon the team's previous season's record. Prescott missed nine games last season due to a hamstring injury, and the Cowboys failed to reach the playoffs. His commitment to winning a championship for his personal well-being and the team contributes to a moderately high optimism score.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli airstrikes on Iran, maps detail the confirmed locations of the attacks, including multiple sites in Tehran and Natanz, a key uranium enrichment site. The IDF said it struck Iran's uranium enrichment site in the Isfahan area, dismantling a facility for producing metallic uranium, infrastructure for reconverting enriched uranium, laboratories, and additional infrastructure. The underground area of the Natanz site was damaged, which contains a multi-story enrichment hall with centrifuges, electrical rooms, and supporting infrastructure. Israel's strikes also killed nuclear scientists and military leaders, including Iranian Armed Forces Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, Commander in Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Hossein Salami, and others. The maps provide a visual representation of the targeted locations and the extent of the Israeli operation, which lowers the optimism score.</p>

          <p>Shares of Brazilian meat giant JBS experienced a rise during their U.S. public market debut on Friday, valuing the company at roughly $30 billion. JBS operates a sprawling business worldwide, with significant divisions in Brazil, the U.S., and Australia, and owns more than 80% of Pilgrim's Pride, the U.S. poultry giant. The company's history of corruption and bribery allegations has faced opposition from lawmakers, including a $3.2 billion fine in 2017 for bribery charges. The SEC approved JBS's request to list on the New York Stock Exchange in April, and shareholders approved the move by a narrow margin the following month. The rise in shares indicates investor confidence despite the company's controversial past, contributing to a moderate optimism score.</p>

However, the proposed changes, which emphasize work requirements, may reduce aid for children in low-income families when it comes to certain tax credits, health coverage, and food assistance. Households in the bottom 10% of income distribution would lose about $1,600 per year from 2026 through 2034, mainly due to reductions in Medicaid and SNAP.

          <p>Cmdr. Emily Shilling, a transgender Navy pilot, reflected on patriotism as the U.S. military prepared for a parade, noting that military might does not equal patriotism. Shilling, who is the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's ban on transgender service members, chose to voluntarily separate from the military after the Pentagon's new ban went into effect. Shilling expressed heartbreak over the decision to leave, but emphasized the importance of continuing to fight for an America that values service and dedication. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the resilience and determination of transgender service members despite facing adversity.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes Israel's strategy to counter Iran, highlighting both its successes and failures. It argues that Israel's focus on Iran and its proxies led to the disaster of October 7, but also enabled the neutralization of Hezbollah and strikes against Iranian targets. Israel's attacks on Iran demonstrate its clandestine capabilities and willingness to take preemptive action. However, the article acknowledges the risks of a protracted and destructive conflict, noting that preparation is no insulation from devastation.

          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley stated that a rare earth minerals shortage has negatively impacted production, leading to a temporary shutdown of one of its plants last month. About 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth minerals come from China, which has leveraged its grip on rare earths amid trade tensions with the U.S. Following discussions, the U.S. and China reached an agreement under which Beijing would resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S. Farley expressed optimism about the developments in trade talks and hopes that rare earth supply constraints will ease soon.

Prosecutors suggested May could spend more than a decade in prison if found guilty. The allegations against May are deeply disturbing, resulting in an extremely low optimism score.</p>
