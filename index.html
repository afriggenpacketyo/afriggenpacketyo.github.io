          <p>The Pentagon's review of the Aukus security pact has raised questions about the future of the agreement and the U.S.'s broader Indo-Pacific strategy. While some see this as a potential shift away from the agreement, analysts suggest that the U.S.'s focus on countering China is unlikely to change significantly. The review is seen as a potential adjustment to the U.S.'s approach in the region, rather than a complete abandonment of the pact.</p>
