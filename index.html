          <p>Several Waymo autonomous vehicles were set on fire in downtown Los Angeles during protests against President Trump's immigration policies.

          <p>Asian needle ants, an invasive species with a potentially deadly sting, are spreading across the U.S., primarily in the Southeast. These ants inject venom that can cause anaphylactic shock, posing a significant threat to individuals with allergies to bee and ant stings. Experts urge vigilance, particularly as ant populations peak in the summer, and advise those with anaphylaxis to carry an EpiPen. The ants, originally from Asia, outcompete native ant species, disrupting seed dispersal and negatively impacting forest ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has initiated discussions with Brentford regarding their head coach, Thomas Frank, as a potential replacement for the recently dismissed Ange Postecoglou. Brentford would be entitled to compensation for Frank, with estimates suggesting it could cost Tottenham over Â£10 million to secure his release from his contract, which extends until 2027. Frank took over at Brentford in 2018 and guided them into the Premier League, winning the Championship play-off final at Wembley in 2021 and establishing them as a top-flight club on a small budget.</p>
