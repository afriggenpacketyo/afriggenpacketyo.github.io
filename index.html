            <p>The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have approved Capital One's $35.3 billion acquisition of Discover Financial Services, a deal initially announced in February 2024. The merger, structured as an all-stock transaction, will see Discover shareholders receive 1.0192 Capital One shares for each Discover share, representing a 26% premium at the time of announcement. Capital One will also indirectly acquire Discover Bank as part of the transaction, and the combined entity will have Capital One shareholders owning 60% and Discover shareholders owning 40%. The deal is expected to close on May 18, expanding Capital One's deposit base and credit card offerings while requiring compliance with the Fed's action against Discover for past interchange fee overcharges.

            <p>Adam Erkan, an Illinois man, faces multiple felony charges, including hate crime and aggravated battery, for allegedly attacking two Jewish students peacefully advocating for Israel at DePaul University in November 2024. Erkan, who is not a student at the university, reportedly approached the students making antisemitic slurs before physically assaulting them, causing significant injuries. The attack has sparked outrage and renewed concerns about antisemitism on college campuses, with the victims also filing a lawsuit against DePaul University alleging a failure to address antisemitic rhetoric. Erkan is being held without bail, and authorities are still searching for a second suspect involved in the incident.</p>

This action follows accusations from President Zelensky that China is supplying weapons to Russia, which China denies, maintaining a stance of neutrality while retaining close economic ties with Moscow. The sanctioned companies, involved in aerospace technology, machinery, and carbon fiber production, are now barred from doing business with Ukraine, and their assets within the country will be frozen, as Russia continues to use Iskander missiles in the conflict, including recent strikes on Kharkiv.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction preventing the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens to countries other than their origin without allowing them to raise safety concerns. The ruling blocks the administration's policy of removing individuals to countries like El Salvador or Honduras without a removal order to those specific nations. The judge emphasized that noncitizens must be given written notice and a chance to challenge their removal, including 15 days to reopen immigration proceedings, preventing them from being sent to countries where they might face persecution, torture, or death without due process.</p>

            <p>The United States is experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with cases reaching their highest level since 2019, primarily driven by an outbreak in West Texas that has resulted in multiple deaths. The CDC reports that the number of cases nationwide has climbed to 800, with infections confirmed in at least 24 states. Health officials attribute the rise in cases to declining vaccination rates, highlighting that about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year, down from 95.2% in the 2019-2020 school year, which is the critical threshold to keep people safe.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has announced new fees on Chinese-built vessels docking at U.S. ports, responding to a U.S. Trade Representative investigation that found China's shipbuilding practices unreasonable and restrictive to U.S. commerce. These fees, initially proposed under the Biden administration, aim to counter China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry. The fees will be implemented in phases, starting at $0 per net ton and gradually increasing to $140 per net ton by 2028, charged up to five times per year per vessel, and vessel owners could be eligible for a remission of the fees if they can provide proof of a U.S. shipbuilding order.

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering revoking Harvard University's tax-exempt status, prompting debate about the use of the IRS's authority to regulate educational institutions based on political or ideological grounds. The administration's potential action is based on the argument that Harvard's policies and practices are contrary to "settled public policy," drawing on the Supreme Court's decision in Bob Jones University v. United States. However, conservatives should be wary of expanding administrative authority to determine what constitutes "settled public policy," as it could lead to tit-for-tat reprisals and undermine principles of free association and religious liberty.</p>

The blackout is the latest in a series of major outages in recent years, raising concerns about the reliability of the island's power grid, which has been deteriorating due to a lack of maintenance and investment since Hurricane Maria in 2017.</p>

            <p>Approximately 10,000 pages of previously unreleased documents related to the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 have been made public. The release, initiated under the Trump administration, aims to shed light on the circumstances surrounding Kennedy's death, which has been subject to speculation and conspiracy theories. RFK's son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has expressed his belief that multiple gunmen were involved, contradicting the official account that Sirhan Sirhan acted alone.

            <h2>FDA Considering Outsourcing Routine Food Safety Inspections to State and Local Authorities</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-18 11:55:23 EDT</div>

            <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reportedly developing plans to end most of its routine food safety inspections, potentially outsourcing this responsibility to state and local authorities. The plans, which are not yet finalized and may require congressional approval, aim to free up FDA resources to focus on higher-priority and foreign inspections. While the FDA already contracts with some states for routine inspections, the proposed shift could significantly alter the agency's oversight of the U.S. food supply, raising concerns about consistency and effectiveness.</p>

The release includes approximately 10,000 pages of previously classified records, with more files expected to be released as searches continue for additional documents related to the assassination.</p>

            <p>A batch of lercanidipine, a common drug for high blood pressure, is being recalled due to incorrect dosage labeling on the packaging. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) reports that some packs of the medication, manufactured by Recordati Pharmaceuticals, are labeled as containing 10mg tablets when they actually contain 20mg tablets. Patients with the wrongly-labeled medication are urged to contact their GP or pharmacist for guidance, as taking too high a dose of lercanidipine can cause dizziness and sleepiness.</p>

The report urges the government to reassess the rules and consider implementing regular visual checks to prevent future tragedies caused by drivers with failing eyesight.</p>
