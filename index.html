        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the August 12 tariff deadline with China will likely be extended following upcoming negotiations in Stockholm. The talks aim to build on a recent truce that lowered punitive tariffs from both nations, fostering a more constructive relationship. Bessent hopes to address broader economic issues, such as China's manufacturing surplus and its purchase of sanctioned oil from Russia and Iran. The goal is to move beyond trade disputes toward more comprehensive economic cooperation between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>A passenger on a SkyWest flight described the terrifying moment the aircraft made an "aggressive" and abrupt turn to avoid a B-52 bomber near Minot, North Dakota. The commercial flight, with 80 people on board, was not informed by air traffic control about the bomber, which was conducting a pre-approved flyover for the state fair. In a post-landing announcement, the pilot calmly explained that he made a split-second decision to turn behind the much faster military jet to ensure safety. The FAA is now investigating the incident to determine how the near-miss occurred.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have placed an exit ban on a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office employee and confirmed a similar restriction on a U.S. citizen working for Wells Fargo. The State Department is actively engaged in resolving the case of the government employee, who has been barred from leaving since April. China's Foreign Ministry stated the banker is involved in an ongoing criminal investigation, highlighting the risks for U.S. citizens in the country.

          <p>President Trump's nomination of his former lawyer, Emil Bove, to a federal appeals court is facing bipartisan opposition, including from some conservative legal figures. Critics express concern over Bove's temperament and his history of prioritizing personal loyalty to Trump over established conservative legal principles. While conventionally qualified, Bove is accused of unprofessional conduct and pushing the DOJ to take legally questionable actions, such as dismissing charges against a political figure. This nomination signals a potential return to cronyism, worrying conservatives who fear he may not be a reliable ally on key ideological issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A licensed psychotherapist and author argues that the common advice to "just be yourself" is flawed and can be counterproductive. The article explains that humans have multiple "selves" that vary depending on context and emotional state, and using authenticity as an excuse for poor behavior can damage relationships. Instead of raw self-expression, the author advocates for "self-leadership," which involves mindfully choosing which part of yourself to present in a given situation. This approach emphasizes self-awareness and responsibility, allowing for more aligned and less reactive behavior in both personal and professional life.</p>

While exports to the United States fell by 16%, this was a significant improvement from the 34.5% drop in May, indicating a short-term reprieve. Despite the ongoing trade war, China's overall global trade reached a record high in the first half of the year, driven by diversification to markets in Southeast Asia and Europe.

          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, even as it absorbed a $1.1 billion impact from President Trump's auto tariffs. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance but acknowledged that the second half of the year will face greater tariff exposure. CEO Mary Barra stated that GM is actively working to mitigate these costs through manufacturing adjustments and is positioning the business for long-term profitability amid new trade policies. Despite beating profit forecasts, the company's revenue and net income were down compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant new deal has been reached in the UK music industry to increase pay for songwriters and session musicians, addressing long-standing complaints about low remuneration in the streaming era. For the first time, songwriters will receive a daily payment of £75 plus expenses for attending writing sessions, a practice for which they were previously unpaid. The agreement, supported by major record labels and the government, also includes a pay increase of up to 40% for session musicians. This marks a crucial step toward fairer compensation for creators in an industry transformed by digital streaming.</p>

          <p>Despite official bans on manual scavenging, the hazardous job of cleaning sewers and septic tanks in India is overwhelmingly performed by members of the Dalit community, the lowest level of the caste hierarchy. Government data shows 77% of these workers are Dalits, who activists say are effectively trapped in these roles and denied other municipal jobs. Critics argue that government initiatives to mechanize sanitation work fail to address the deep-rooted social discrimination that perpetuates this cycle. The persistence of this practice highlights how the centuries-old caste system continues to define labor and social exclusion in modern India.</p>

CEO James Quincey noted that while some challenged markets like the U.S. improved sequentially from the first quarter, economic and geopolitical uncertainty continues to weigh on consumer confidence.

While England's captain Ben Stokes acknowledged the third evening "sparked everyone off," he maintained that neither side crossed the line into unacceptable behavior.

This move follows a social media post by President Trump advocating for the change and comes as "Mexican Coke," which uses cane sugar, has grown in popularity. The company currently uses high-fructose corn syrup for its U.S. products, a practice adopted in the 1980s largely due to the lower cost of corn syrup compared to sugar.

Clooney was one of the first major Democratic figures to call for a new nominee after a poor debate performance by the elder Biden. Hunter Biden suggested Clooney's motives were tied to disagreements over U.S. policy toward Israel.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," effective when his contract ends in 2026, citing purely financial reasons. However, this article suggests the decision may be politically motivated, coming shortly after Colbert criticized CBS for a large settlement with Donald Trump. The move is seen as symbolic of both the network's potential appeasement of Trump amid a major corporate merger and the decline of the politically charged, host-driven late-night comedy genre that Colbert helped pioneer. Critics argue the cancellation reflects a broader "fear and pre-compliance" gripping American institutions.</p>

          <p>Lenders are increasingly offering promotional rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) to attract borrowers amid high interest rates. While these low introductory rates can offer initial savings, financial experts urge homeowners to be cautious. It is crucial to read the fine print, as the rate can jump significantly after the promotional period ends, and there may be hidden fees or prepayment penalties. Borrowers should understand the fully indexed rate, not just the teaser rate, and ensure the loan aligns with their long-term financial goals before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

The article delves into how le Carré's own life, particularly his relationship with his con-man father, Ronnie, deeply influenced his fiction, blurring the lines between espionage, betrayal, and personal history. The author reflects on le Carré's use of travel, secrecy, and infidelity as escapes, creating a double life that mirrored the clandestine world of his characters. Corfu itself, with its layered history of foreign powers, serves as a metaphor for the fragmented identities he explored.</p>

This move follows a pattern of the administration pulling out of international bodies, including the WHO.

          <p>Following Coca-Cola's announcement to offer a cane sugar soda, health experts are clarifying the nutritional differences between it and high-fructose corn syrup. While cane sugar is about 50% fructose and corn syrup is about 55% fructose, experts state that when consumed in excess, both have similar negative health impacts. They are both considered "empty calories" and contribute to conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The American Heart Association recommends limiting all added sugars, regardless of the source. Ultimately, moderation is the key factor for health, not the specific type of sugar used in sweetened beverages.</p>
