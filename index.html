          <p>A REACH medical helicopter crashed on Highway 50 in Sacramento, leaving three crew members with critical injuries. The pilot, a nurse, and a paramedic were on board, but no patient was present at the time of the incident. Bystanders, along with a fire captain, heroically lifted the aircraft to free one of the crew members who was trapped underneath the wreckage. The National Transportation Safety Board is set to investigate the cause of the crash, which did not involve any other vehicles on the freeway.</p>

          <p>China has launched the world's first commercial underwater data center off the coast of Hainan province, a project designed to enhance energy efficiency. The facility, which weighs 1,300 tonnes, uses seawater for natural cooling, significantly reducing the energy consumption and operational costs associated with traditional land-based data centers. This initial phase is part of a larger plan to build a subsea data center with 100 cabins, positioning it as a key component of Hainan's strategy to develop new technologies for the blue economy.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu was forced to retire from her first-round match against Ann Li at the Wuhan Open in China. Raducanu appeared to be struggling with the hot and humid conditions, looking fatigued and devoid of energy while trailing 6-1, 4-1. After a medical timeout where her blood pressure and temperature were checked, she made the decision to withdraw from the tournament. The retirement is a setback for her chances of being seeded in the upcoming Australian Open.</p>

          <p>European stock markets experienced a slight downturn, largely influenced by the political crisis unfolding in France following the resignation of Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu. France's CAC 40 index saw notable declines, particularly affecting major banks like Societe Generale and BNP Paribas, which dropped over 3%. The uncertainty in Paris has rattled investors, overshadowing other market news, such as disappointing German factory order data and a positive trading update from British oil giant Shell. The situation highlights the significant impact of political stability on European financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Gaza war, the possibility of reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians appears increasingly remote, with surveys revealing a profound loss of mutual trust and empathy. Polls show a majority of Israelis believe there are no innocent people in Gaza, a sentiment that experts find deeply concerning. While political solutions like a two-state model are discussed, researchers note that the immediate challenge is overcoming the "almost complete dehumanization" that has taken root on both sides, making any potential peace process exceptionally difficult.</p>

          <p>Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick has defended his remarks describing the Handsworth area of Birmingham as "one of the worst-integrated places" he had visited, where he claimed not to have seen "another white face." The comments, made in a leaked recording, drew sharp criticism from Labour and Handsworth's MP, who called them irresponsible and false. Despite the backlash, Jenrick stood by his statements, arguing for the need for a frank conversation about "parallel communities" to foster a more united country.</p>

          <p>An art exhibition is creating a unique dialogue by placing artifacts from a Tang dynasty shipwreck and a replica ancient Chinese sailboat alongside Western art, including a Monet painting. The curator was inspired by the idea that maritime culture, like art, transcends borders, carrying goods and ideas across the globe. The exhibition aims to show how these historical objects, much like Impressionist paintings capturing moments in time, can travel through different cultures and share their stories, highlighting the enduring and universal nature of artistic expression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The abrupt resignation of French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu after just 27 days has plunged the country into a deeper political crisis, leaving President Emmanuel Macron with few appealing options. The deadlock stems from the lack of a clear majority in parliament, making it impossible to form a stable government capable of passing a budget. Macron's main choices now include appointing a sixth prime minister in less than two years, potentially from an opposing party, or calling for another snap election, which risks strengthening Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party.</p>

Key areas of contention include the precise structure and timing for the release of all hostages, as Hamas's only leverage lies in holding them. Furthermore, the plan's requirement for Hamas to disarm, the future governance of Gaza without Hamas involvement, and the timeline for a full Israeli military withdrawal are all major unresolved issues that could derail the negotiations between the two sides.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France's latest political crisis, marked by Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu's resignation, is distinct from previous government collapses because it was triggered by President Macron's own allies rather than an opposition no-confidence vote. The center-right Les Republicains party, a key partner in the governing coalition, effectively withdrew its support, leaving Lecornu without a viable path forward. This move is seen as a strategic repositioning by political parties ahead of the 2027 presidential election, signaling that even Macron's partners are beginning to distance themselves from the unpopular president.</p>

China's export sector has remained resilient by shifting focus to Southeast Asia and Europe, but this support is also expected to fade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Minnesota-born Mexican restaurant chain Chi-Chi's has officially made its return, opening a new location in St. Louis Park nearly 20 years after the brand disappeared from the U.S. market. The original chain, founded in 1975, grew to over 200 locations before facing bankruptcy and a damaging hepatitis A outbreak that led to its closure in 2004. The revival, made possible through an agreement with Hormel Foods, which owns the trademark, was met with enthusiasm, as reservations for its opening day were fully booked by eager customers.</p>

          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration's plan to deploy National Guard troops to the city, labeling the move an "unconstitutional invasion." Despite the legal challenge, a judge declined to issue an immediate temporary restraining order, and it was revealed in court that troops from Texas are already on their way. State officials argue the deployment is a politically motivated power grab that will sow chaos and mistrust, while the administration claims it is necessary to protect federal property.</p>

          <p>In a surprising break from her party's stance, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has called for extending expiring Obamacare subsidies to prevent health insurance premiums from doubling. Citing the direct financial impact on her own adult children and constituents, Greene stated she would not "toe the party line," criticizing Republican leadership for not having a plan to address the issue. Her position aligns with a key Democratic demand during the ongoing government shutdown, adding a prominent MAGA voice to the call for extending the tax credits.</p>

          <p>According to preliminary federal data, unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border dropped to their lowest annual level since 1970 during the 2025 fiscal year. U.S. Border Patrol recorded approximately 238,000 apprehensions, a dramatic decrease from the record highs seen under the previous administration. The sharp decline is attributed to the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies, which include sealing the border, ending asylum processing, and increasing deportations, though these measures have faced significant legal challenges and criticism from human rights groups.</p>

The EU's comment aligns with the U.S. position that China is mischaracterizing the resolution to isolate Taiwan from the international community and reinforces that the document did not determine Taiwan's political status.</p>
