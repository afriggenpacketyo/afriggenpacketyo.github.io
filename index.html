          <h2>India's Action Against Jane Street Highlights Vague Line Between Arbitrage and Market Manipulation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:01:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's securities regulator has temporarily banned U.S. trading firm Jane Street, accusing it of manipulating the Nifty 50 index to profit from options bets. The case highlights the fine line between legal arbitrage, which exploits existing price differences, and illegal market manipulation, which involves creating artificial price movements. Experts note the distinction often depends on intent, or "mens rea," and whether a firm is distorting a less liquid market to profit in a more liquid one. Jane Street disputes the allegations, claiming its activities were standard index arbitrage, a practice generally seen as beneficial for market efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is introducing a new "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all non-immigrant visa applicants, effective from the 2025 fiscal year. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and will be paid upon visa issuance, not if an application is denied. The provision includes a reimbursement mechanism for travelers who comply with their visa conditions, such as not overstaying. However, significant questions remain about the implementation process for collection and reimbursement, with the Congressional Budget Office expecting few people to seek their money back.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Develop Advanced Infrared Technology Inspired by Fire Beetles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new infrared sensing technology developed in China, reportedly 20,000 times faster than conventional methods, was inspired by the fire beetle. This insect possesses a unique pit organ that allows it to detect the faint infrared radiation from distant forest fires, even while in flight. The technology is crucial for military and industrial applications as it can penetrate obstacles like smoke and dust for clear imaging and detection. This development exemplifies the growing field of biomimicry, where biological systems with efficient perception capabilities inspire new optoelectronic device designs.</p>

          <p>Israel's stock market has demonstrated significant resilience, outperforming its Middle East counterparts and reaching record highs despite the country being engaged in multi-front wars. After an initial drop following the October 2023 attacks, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange rebounded, driven by strong foreign investment and renewed investor confidence. The nation's robust tech sector, which constitutes 20% of its GDP and over half of its exports, is a primary driver of this economic buoyancy. Analysts credit the performance to perceptions of reduced long-term security risks and the fundamental dynamism of the Israeli economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite facing elimination multiple times during the shootout, England ultimately prevailed 3-2 on penalties. The victory was attributed to the team's resilience, strategic substitutions by manager Sarina Wiegman, and a crucial winning penalty from veteran player Lucy Bronze.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in federal funding, sending the measure to President Trump for his signature. The package, approved in a narrow 216-213 vote, primarily targets approximately $8 billion in foreign assistance programs and $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The vote was delayed for hours due to procedural debates related to releasing files on Jeffrey Epstein.

The admission follows a $787-million defamation lawsuit filed by Newsom, who alleged the show falsely claimed he had lied about the timeline of his conversation with the president regarding immigration raids. Watters stated he misunderstood a social media post from the governor, saying, "I'm sorry, he wasn't lying. He was just confusing and unclear." Despite the partial retraction, Newsom's office indicated the lawsuit will proceed.</p>

          <p>Veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott has been suspended from the party pending an investigation into comments she made about racism. The suspension came after a BBC interview where she reiterated her view that racism against Black people is distinct from prejudice faced by other groups like Jewish people or Travellers, because it is based on visible skin colour. This stance echoes remarks that led to a previous year-long suspension in 2023. Abbott, who will now sit as an independent MP, stated that her comments were "factually correct" and that it is "obvious this Labour leadership wants me out."</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated that Europe has been a "free-rider" on U.S. defense and security in the past, acknowledging American criticism that European nations were not contributing enough. In an interview, Merz affirmed that Germany and its allies now understand they must do more for their own security, a shift prompted by Russia's war in Ukraine and pressure from the Trump administration. He emphasized that Germany is now significantly increasing its defense spending to strengthen its military. Merz also highlighted close coordination with the U.S. and other European leaders on both the war and trade issues.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people across all 50 U.S. states participated in marches and rallies to protest the Trump administration and honor the legacy of civil rights icon John Lewis. The "Good Trouble Lives On" day of action, held on the fifth anniversary of Lewis's death, involved over 1,500 events. Organizers and participants demanded an end to what they describe as the administration's crackdowns on civil rights, voting rights, and social programs. The protests, inspired by Lewis's call to make "good trouble, necessary trouble," included rallies, vigils, and voter registration drives to show widespread opposition to current policies.</p>

          <p>Cristosal, El Salvador's most prominent human rights organization, has announced it is shutting down its operations in the country and moving its work into exile due to escalating threats from President Nayib Bukele's government.

The decision follows the recent arrest of one of its program leaders and comes amid a broader exodus of journalists and activists from the country. Cristosal has been an outspoken critic of Bukele's heavy-handed security crackdown and mass incarcerations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has implemented new export restrictions on technologies essential for manufacturing electric vehicle (EV) batteries, a move aimed at solidifying its global dominance in the sector. The controls cover technologies for producing popular LFP batteries and for processing lithium, a critical raw material. Companies wishing to transfer these technologies overseas will now require a government license. This action mirrors recent restrictions on rare earth elements and could complicate the overseas expansion plans of Chinese battery and EV makers, while potentially accelerating efforts by the U.S. and E.U. to develop their own localized supply chains.</p>

It is not yet clear whether he was the intended target of the strike. The White House and the Israeli government have not commented on the report, which emerged after the conclusion of a 12-day conflict between the two nations.</p>

          <p>House Republicans' plan to vote on a $9 billion spending cuts package has been complicated by internal party tensions regarding the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The controversy, fueled by demands for transparency from some GOP members and the public, delayed the legislative process as Democrats seized on the division. They attempted to attach amendments forcing the release of the Epstein documents to the bill. The situation highlights a growing crisis for the GOP, caught between a base that believes in a cover-up and a Trump administration that has dismissed the issue as a hoax.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), similar to a rocket. Developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the unnamed drone launches with its nose pointing up before transitioning to horizontal flight. This design eliminates the need for a runway, offering significant deployment flexibility in remote or rugged terrains, and allows it to fly much faster than conventional quadcopter drones. The drone's debut included a demonstration of its reconnaissance capabilities and its intelligent control system, which enables autonomous functions like route planning and threat avoidance.</p>

          <p>Netflix has used visual effects created by generative artificial intelligence in one of its shows for the first time, according to co-CEO Ted Sarandos. The technology was employed to create a building collapse scene in the Argentine sci-fi series "The Eternauts." Sarandos praised AI as an opportunity to make productions "better, not just cheaper," noting it allowed the team to complete the sequence ten times faster and at a feasible cost. The use of generative AI remains a controversial topic in Hollywood, having been a key concern during the 2023 actors' strike over fears it could replace human workers.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after he experienced mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described CVI as a benign and common condition where leg veins have difficulty sending blood back to the heart. The announcement, accompanied by a letter from the presidential physician affirming Trump's "excellent health," aims to address public speculation about images showing the president with swollen legs and a bruised hand. The White House attributed the bruised hand to frequent handshaking and aspirin use.</p>

          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for canceling $4 billion in federal funding for its high-speed rail project. The suit, filed by the state's attorney general, challenges the Federal Railroad Administration's decision as "arbitrary and capricious" and politically motivated. Governor Gavin Newsom called the move a "heartless attack on the Central Valley" that will jeopardize jobs. The administration's review cited significant project failures, budget shortfalls, and missed deadlines as the basis for pulling the funds from America's only high-speed rail line currently under construction.</p>
