          <p>Authorities have confirmed the discovery of human remains days after a powerful explosion and fire destroyed a fireworks facility in Esparto, California. The blast, which occurred on Tuesday night, injured two people and left seven others missing, prompting a careful and prolonged recovery operation. Investigators from the Yolo County Coroner’s Division were able to re-enter the site on Friday to begin the search. The identities of the deceased have not yet been released pending formal identification and notification of next of kin, and the cause of the explosion remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>Merit Street Media, the media company launched by television personality Dr. Phil McGraw, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection less than two years after its debut. The filing in a Texas court reports assets and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million and follows two rounds of significant layoffs. The network, which aimed to combat 'woke' culture, was a partnership with Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), which Merit Street is now suing for allegedly failing to provide agreed-upon national distribution. Despite the bankruptcy, the network's content remains available on its website.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed a controversial and massive tax-and-spending legislative package into law during the White House's Fourth of July celebrations. The bill makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts while also enacting deep spending reductions for social programs like Medicaid, which will now include work requirements. The legislation also increases funding for immigration enforcement, a key administration priority. While the president celebrated the bill as a historic achievement, Democrats strongly criticized the cuts to services for low-income Americans, warning it could leave millions uninsured.</p>

          <p>A man was fatally shot in an unincorporated area of East Los Angeles early Friday morning after an exchange of gunfire with Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies. Authorities responded to a call about a man firing a weapon into the air and, upon locating the suspect, he allegedly began shooting at them. The deputies returned fire, and the suspect was pronounced dead at the scene after paramedics rendered aid. No deputies were injured in the incident, and multiple investigations are now underway, including by the Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau and the Office of the Inspector General.</p>

          <p>The UK government has officially proscribed Palestine Action as a terrorist organization after a High Court judge and the Court of Appeal rejected the group's last-minute legal challenges to block the ban. The decision makes supporting the group, known for its direct-action tactics against companies involved with Israel's arms trade, a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government's move follows an incident where the group caused an estimated £7 million in damage to aircraft at RAF Brize Norton.

          <p>An analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that the new Republican tax and spending law will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans, with the largest cuts going to the top 1% in states with no personal income tax. Households in Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas are projected to see their annual tax bills fall by over $100,000 on average. The legislation extends the 2017 tax cuts, lowers income tax rates, and increases the estate tax exemption, all of which favor high-income earners. Conversely, high-tax states like California and New Jersey will see smaller average cuts for their wealthiest residents. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Partey, a 32-year-old Ghanaian international and former Arsenal footballer, has been formally charged with five counts of sexual assault and one count of sexual assault involving three different women. The alleged offenses occurred between 2021 and 2022, with the investigation beginning after an initial report was made to the Metropolitan Police in February 2022. Partey, whose contract with Arsenal concluded at the end of June, denies all charges and is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in August.</p>

          <p>In an extensive interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns describes the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ because it created the new concept of a 'citizen.' He argues that the nation is held together by the ideas and words of the Declaration of Independence, which distilled a century of Enlightenment thinking. Burns emphasizes that the U.S. has always been divided, but understanding the nation's complex and often violent origins can provide perspective and inspiration for today's challenges. He advocates for embracing the founders' flaws to see them as real people and make their lessons more accessible.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is currently withholding $715 million in federal grant funding designated for adult education programs across the United States. This move has placed numerous programs, which collectively serve over a million students annually, in a state of uncertainty. The organizations rely on this funding to provide essential services like literacy, high school equivalency, and job training programs. The lack of funds has left these vital educational providers scrambling for answers and concerned about their ability to continue operations, impacting some of the nation's most vulnerable learners.</p>

Since his debut a year ago, Smith has shown immense power and talent, quickly adapting to the international stage.

          <p>Advocates and healthcare experts are warning that the wide variety of names for Medicaid programs across different states could lead to significant confusion for beneficiaries. Because many states do not use the term "Medicaid" in their program branding, individuals may not realize that warnings about changes or disenrollment from "Medicaid" apply to their specific state-run health plan. This lack of clear and consistent branding risks causing eligible people to inadvertently lose their health coverage because they do not recognize that the notices they receive are relevant to them.</p>

A senior Hamas official told NPR the group responded positively but wants guarantees for a permanent end to the war, which Israel has previously rejected.

The men, who have been held at a U.S. base in Djibouti, were scheduled to be flown to the war-torn country with which most have no connection. A district judge in Washington D.C. issued a brief stay, concluding that new claims from the immigrants' lawyers deserved a hearing.

The Anti-Defamation League called the president's use of the word "troubling and irresponsible," explaining that it evokes dangerous, centuries-old stereotypes about Jewish people and greed.

The deduction, which expires in 2028, will not benefit the lowest-earning tipped workers who already have no federal income tax liability.
