          <p>Senator Rand Paul stated that the motive behind the attempted assassination of President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, remains unknown, despite a Senate committee report detailing Secret Service failures. Paul, who chairs the committee, believes authorities have genuinely tried to uncover the motive but found no clear answer. The report criticized the Secret Service for "inexcusable negligence" and communication breakdowns, allowing the gunman to approach undetected. This article highlights the ongoing questions surrounding the incident and the agency's accountability.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against calls for her resignation regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case files. Critics, including prominent conservative figures, are frustrated that a recent memo from Bondi's Justice Department found no incriminating client list or blackmail evidence, contradicting earlier expectations. The controversy highlights a growing division between the FBI and the Justice Department on the matter. Trump urged supporters to focus elsewhere, while some allies criticize the administration's handling of the ongoing Epstein scandal.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that the Trump administration is "looking into" whether the President has the authority to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for "cause" before his term expires. Hassett linked this possibility to alleged cost overruns in the Fed's Washington headquarters renovation, which he claims are $700 million over budget. This article suggests the administration may be laying groundwork for Powell's removal, despite the Fed being self-funded. (not investment advice)</p>
