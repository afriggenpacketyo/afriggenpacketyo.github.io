          <p>Following Karen Read's acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges in the death of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, her parents, Bill and Janet Read, have spoken out, expressing their relief and focus on returning to normalcy after two years of a life-changing ordeal. They credited their daughter's strength and determination, referring to her as the "fifth lawyer" in the case, for helping them navigate the difficult period. The Reads acknowledged the hurtful and misogynistic comments directed at Karen during the trial and emphasized their commitment to speaking out and helping others in need moving forward. The family recognizes that the question of who is responsible for O'Keefe's death remains unanswered, a truth they hope will be revealed someday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the Meiji Yasuda Research Institute reveals that visits by foreign tourists to locations associated with anime and manga in Japan have significantly benefited local economies. In 2024, approximately 3 million foreign tourists, representing 8.1% of inbound visitors, explored these anime-related sites, marking an increase from 4.8% in 2016. Purchases of anime and manga goods totaled an estimated 54.3 billion yen last year, a 53% increase from 2016, highlighting the economic impact of "seichi junrei" or "holy pilgrimage." While the trend offers substantial economic advantages, the report also underscores the need for local governments to address overtourism issues and provide multilingual support to accommodate the growing number of international visitors.</p>

          <p>Newly unsealed court documents provide insight into the mindset and actions of Vance Boelter, the suspect charged in connection with the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses. According to an FBI affidavit, Boelter's wife told investigators they were "preppers" and that he had given her a "bailout plan" prior to the shootings. The affidavit also details the discovery of empty rifle cases and gun-cleaning supplies in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffman family released a statement recounting the attack and expressing concern over the risks associated with public service in the current political climate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with surging rice prices, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative for consumers. Antworks Co., which operates pork rice bowl eateries, recently opened its first ramen noodle restaurant and plans to expand its noodle business due to the high cost of rice. Similarly, Yoshinoya Holdings Co. is bolstering its ramen noodle offerings, citing saturation in the beef bowl market and the need to balance ingredient costs. As rice prices have doubled year-over-year, supermarkets are also seeing increased sales of frozen udon noodles and other alternatives, reflecting a shift in consumer preferences.</p>

          <p>A mysterious human skull, discovered in the 1930s and known as "dragon man," has been identified as belonging to the Denisovan species. Researchers used dental calculus to extract DNA from the 146,000-year-old skull after previous attempts to extract DNA from a tooth failed. Comparison of the genetic material revealed that the "dragon man" was not a new species but rather the first intact Denisovan specimen to date. Denisovans are known to have coexisted with modern-day humans and are closely related to Neanderthals, adding to our understanding of human evolution.</p>

          <p>A recent border skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia has presented a challenge to China's neighborhood diplomacy, as Beijing seeks to maintain stability in a region critical to its strategic interests. Analysts suggest that China will likely monitor the situation closely but avoid direct mediation, possibly working with ASEAN to prevent future confrontations. The clash, which resulted in one Cambodian soldier's death, highlights long-standing border disputes in the Indochina peninsula, an important trade gateway for China. While the risk of wider escalation is considered low, the incident may impact China's efforts to foster closer regional ties amid its rivalry with the United States.</p>

          <p>The United States' recent failure to reach a tariff deal with Japan, coupled with threats to impose new duties on imports, may embolden China in trade negotiations with Washington. Analysts suggest that these developments indicate a weakened U.S. position, potentially prompting China to adopt a firmer stance. The US President Donald Trump had raised duties on Chinese imports to more than 100 per cent but those on China were paused for 90 days, until August 12, following talks in Switzerland in early May. Chen Zhiwu, a finance professor at the University of Hong Kong, believes the US's apparent desperation could benefit Chinese negotiators.</p>

          <p>Friday saw a series of environmental setbacks in the U.S. following decisions by the Trump administration and the Supreme Court. The Department of Energy ordered the JH Campbell coal plant to remain open, and the administration is expected to prolong the life of the Monroe power plant, despite their significant greenhouse gas emissions. Opponents argue the move lacks support and is ideologically driven. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court handed a win to fossil fuel firms in an emissions case, marking a challenging day for environmental advocates.</p>

Lime says it is working with authorities to address the issue, but the Canal and River Trust claims the company has been unresponsive. The dumped bikes are often stolen and used without payment, leading to calls for Lime to implement docking bays to prevent theft.</p>
