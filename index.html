          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 09:28:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is set to consider a case involving Maryland parents challenging a school board's policy that prevents them from opting their children out of instruction involving storybooks on gender identity and sexual orientation. The parents, who are Muslim, Roman Catholic, and Ukrainian Orthodox, argue that this policy infringes upon their First Amendment right to direct the religious upbringing of their children, while the school board maintains that the opt-out policy became unworkable. The Trump administration supports the parents, arguing that the board's policy forces them to choose between their religious beliefs and public education, and a decision from the Supreme Court is expected by early July. </p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund has significantly slashed its 2025 U.S. growth forecast to 1.8% from 2.7%, citing the negative impact of President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs and subsequent countermeasures from other trading partners. The IMF now views recession odds at 40%, up from 25% in October, and has also reduced its global growth forecast. The report notes that tariffs act as a negative supply shock, leading to higher inflation forecasts for advanced economies, including the U.S., and the IMF revised the U.S. inflation outlook higher by 1 percentage point from January.

          <p>Gold prices have soared above $3,500 an ounce as President Donald Trump's repeated attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence and demands for lower interest rates unsettle investors, bolstering the appeal of safe-haven assets. The price of gold has rallied significantly since the start of the year, particularly after Trump announced sweeping tariffs, with central banks also adding to their gold reserves. Analysts suggest that gold continues to serve as an effective hedge against ongoing trade uncertainty, and they anticipate further upside potential due to strong investment demand and a volatile macroeconomic environment.
