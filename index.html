          <p>In California, gardeners are increasingly planting native species in parks as a proactive measure to prevent the spread of wildfires, especially in the Los Angeles area. These efforts are also providing a sense of purpose for individuals seeking new directions, particularly those leaving struggling industries like film and TV. The focus on care and stewardship through gardening allows people to channel their energy into tangible environmental benefits, contributing to community resilience against natural disasters. The Elysian Test Plot showcases the beauty and functionality of these native plants, such as lacy phacelia and elegant clarkias, in mitigating wildfire risks.</p>

          <p>Japan is set to allocate 900 billion yen to combat the negative impacts of U.S. tariffs, marking its first fiscal response to President Trump's trade policies, and the overall relief package could reach 2.8 trillion yen with local government spending. In response to soaring rice prices, the government has started selling rice stockpiles directly to retailers, aiming to reduce prices to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. Other measures include Japan Post introducing online 7-digit codes as digital addresses and the Osaka expo reversing its no-smoking policy to set up two smoking areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed its eruption, sending lava hundreds of feet into the air and releasing plumes of ash and volcanic debris. The activity, which began on Sunday afternoon, featured lava fountains reaching heights of over 1,000 feet from the north vent and 800 feet from the south vent. While lava flows remained within Kilauea's summit caldera, an eruptive plume containing ash, volcanic rock, and Pele's hair was released, posing potential hazards to nearby residents and visitors. The U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory is monitoring the activity and providing updates, with tourists flocking to witness the spectacle.</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed increasing frustration with Vladimir Putin's escalation of attacks on Ukraine, labeling Putin's actions as "absolutely crazy" amid Russia's intensified drone and missile strikes. Trump warned that Putin's pursuit of conquering all of Ukraine could lead to Russia's downfall, while also criticizing Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his statements. Despite the criticism, the Kremlin downplayed Trump's remarks, attributing them to emotional reactions, while European leaders hoped the change in tone would translate into action, with some lifting restrictions on military aid to Ukraine for strikes inside Russia.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions and statements suggest a potential vision of a world divided into spheres of influence dominated by the United States, China, and Russia, according to some foreign policy analysts. This approach involves normalizing commerce with Russia, seeking deals with China, and potentially formalizing Russian control over parts of Ukraine. While some caution against interpreting Trump's actions as strategic, his desire to expand American influence in the Western Hemisphere and his praise for leaders like Putin and Xi indicate a possible shift towards a 19th-century style of imperial rule.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has initiated a revised rice sales system, directly contracting with major retailers to sell government rice stockpiles at reduced prices in an effort to lower consumer costs. The move, led by the newly appointed farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi, aims to bring rice prices down to around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This action bypasses the auction system, which was seen as contributing to rising prices, and includes the establishment of a special response team to address high rice price issues and prevent consumer disaffection. The public appears receptive to the new measures, with a recent poll indicating optimism that Koizumi can effectively lower rice prices.</p>

          <p>Sexual orientation is diverse and develops during puberty through a combination of biological and psychosocial factors, with no single cause determining a person's attraction. Research suggests that genetics, hormones, and social influences play a role, but sexual orientation is not hereditary and remains stable after adolescence. Despite growing acceptance, homosexuality is still criminalized in many countries, highlighting the importance of unbiased discussions about sexual diversity. No sexual orientation is a disease, and rejection from family can negatively impact a child's self-esteem and mental health.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent remarks on the Gaza conflict signal a shift in tone from Israel's allies, reflecting growing impatience with Prime Minister Netanyahu's policies. Britain, Canada, and France have also increased pressure on Israel, with Britain suspending trade negotiations and France organizing a conference to discuss a Palestinian state. Despite these actions, the United States continues to provide military aid to Israel, and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem recently visited the country to reaffirm support. Within Israel, these moves are perceived as a step toward diplomatic isolation.</p>

          <p>A German high school faced scandal after Nazi slogans were proposed as graduation mottos, prompting investigations and calls for mandatory concentration camp memorial visits for students. The incident reflects a broader trend of increasing right-wing extremism and antisemitism in schools, with reports of swastikas, Hitler salutes, and racist songs. Experts emphasize the importance of addressing such incidents to prevent normalization and support those who stand up for democratic values. The rise in these incidents is attributed to a growing disconnect from the Holocaust and the increasing acceptance of far-right ideologies in society.</p>

          <p>As diplomatic efforts falter and U.S. support wanes, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukrainian cities, launching massive aerial bombardments and missile strikes. President Trump has criticized Putin's actions but has not committed to providing additional military assistance to Ukraine. Military analysts warn that the lack of U.S. support and dwindling interceptor missiles will make Ukraine more vulnerable to Russian attacks, with Moscow leveraging its numerical advantage to gain ground in the eastern Donbas region.</p>

          <h2>Legalistic Noncompliance: How the Executive Branch Undermines Court Orders</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The executive branch is increasingly using the language of the law to justify noncompliance with court orders, a strategy termed "legalistic noncompliance." This involves presenting specious legal arguments to conceal pervasive defiance of judicial oversight, undermining the integrity of the legal system. The administration advances outlandish arguments in various cases, hoping to wear down the courts, and some indications suggest that the Supreme Court has already legalized partial noncompliance. However, increased public scrutiny and continued focus on specific cases may push the administration to comply with court orders more effectively.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes in Gaza have resulted in numerous casualties, including at least 52 deaths, with a significant number occurring at a school-turned-shelter. The Israeli military claims to have targeted militants operating from the school, while local health officials report that many of the dead were women and children. The attacks occur amid growing concerns over food shortages and the effectiveness of humanitarian aid efforts in Gaza, with aid groups citing the need for more supplies and expressing reservations about a new aid distribution system.</p>
