          <p>Top White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has predicted the ongoing government shutdown is likely to conclude this week, suggesting moderate Democrats may soon vote to reopen the government. Hassett stated that if a resolution is not reached, the Trump administration might consider "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. The shutdown stems from a partisan conflict over federal funding, with Democrats demanding the inclusion of extended Affordable Care Act tax credits in any stopgap bill. This article highlights the administration's perspective on the political dynamics and potential paths to ending the funding lapse.</p>

          <p>Executive coach and author Melody Wilding provides five key strategies for employees dealing with a "control freak" boss to conserve energy and improve workplace dynamics. The advice includes presenting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with deferential language, and oversharing information to satisfy their need for oversight. Other tactics involve preempting criticism by asking for initial thoughts and explicitly requesting positive feedback to foster a more balanced professional relationship. The article aims to empower employees to navigate challenging managerial styles without becoming frustrated or exhausted.</p>

          <p>Steel producer Cleveland-Cliffs announced it is investigating the possibility of entering the rare earths mining business, causing its shares to surge by approximately 17%. CEO Lourenco Goncalves noted that geological surveys at two company sites in Michigan and Minnesota show potential for these critical minerals. This strategic move aligns with the national goal of achieving material independence from China, which currently dominates the global rare earth supply chain. The minerals are vital for manufacturing magnets used in electric vehicles, defense systems, and semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>

The monarch expressed his sadness over the incident and spoke with three individuals who were injured, including a volunteer security guard and another man mistakenly shot by police. The visit was seen by the local Jewish community as a significant gesture of support from the highest level of the country. One survivor commented that while the attack showed the worst of humanity, the subsequent support has shown the best.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicles generally depreciate at a faster rate than their internal combustion engine counterparts, losing about 13% more value over a five-year period. Key factors contributing to this trend include higher initial government and manufacturer incentives, which lower the baseline for resale values. Additionally, the rapid advancement of EV technology, particularly in battery range, makes older models less desirable to value-oriented used car buyers. However, the market is expected to change as a wider variety of more affordable EV models become available, potentially stabilizing their long-term value.</p>

          <p>Filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which can wipe out most unsecured debts, is not automatically available to everyone and involves a specific approval process. The primary obstacle is the "means test," which compares an individual's household income to their state's median income. Those with income below the median typically qualify easily, while those above must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income after expenses. The article also outlines other requirements, such as recent filing history and mandatory credit counseling, and discusses alternatives like Chapter 13 bankruptcy or debt settlement if an application is denied.</p>

          <p>An hourslong disruption of Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday impacted the websites of major carriers like Delta and United Airlines, preventing some customers from accessing reservations and checking in for flights. The outage, centered in AWS's major US-EAST-1 region, affected numerous online services globally. United Airlines confirmed that some of its internal systems were temporarily affected but that backup systems were used to mitigate the disruption. The incident highlights the vulnerability of critical infrastructure, including the airline industry, to technical issues within the handful of companies that dominate cloud computing services.</p>

          <p>In his first year as Indonesia's president, former general Prabowo Subianto has taken a highly active role in international diplomacy, making numerous diplomatic visits and engaging in major global issues. He has offered to send peacekeepers to Gaza and supported a U.S.-led peace plan, strengthening ties with the Trump administration. Domestically, his administration successfully concluded a long-negotiated economic partnership agreement with the European Union to boost trade and investment. However, some analysts describe his approach as overly personal and reactive, raising concerns about long-term strategic coordination within his government.</p>

          <p>Jose Rodolfo Villareal-Hernandez, a Mexican cartel leader known as "El Gato" and a former FBI top ten fugitive, is facing a new federal charge of continuing a criminal enterprise. This charge, added to existing ones for murder-for-hire and interstate stalking, makes him eligible for the death penalty if convicted. Villareal-Hernandez is accused of orchestrating the 2013 murder of a man in a Southlake, Texas, shopping center as an act of revenge against a rival cartel. After years on the run, he was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the U.S. earlier this year.</p>

The stolen items include the historic Pearl and Diamond Tiara commissioned by Napoleon III, along with several valuable necklaces, brooches, and earrings. In their escape, the robbers, described as professionals, dropped one significant item: the crown of Empress Eugenie, which was recovered outside the museum.

          <p>China's Communist Party is convening to finalize its next five-year economic plan amid significant structural challenges and geopolitical pressures. Policymakers are balancing the urgent need to stimulate weak domestic consumption against the strategic priority of investing in high-tech industries, such as semiconductors, to achieve self-sufficiency and counter U.S. restrictions. For decades, China's economy has relied on exports and infrastructure, but with those engines slowing, boosting household spending has become critical. However, analysts believe that given the intense competition with the U.S., industrial policy will likely receive the bulk of government resources.</p>

          <p>Despite Prince Andrew giving up his royal titles, including the Duke of York, scrutiny over his connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein persists. There are ongoing calls for his titles to be formally removed by law, and the Metropolitan Police are investigating claims related to Virginia Giuffre, who accused the prince of sexual abuse. A posthumously published memoir by Ms. Giuffre has added to the pressure on the prince, who has consistently denied the allegations. Royal sources indicate the family is treating the claims with great concern, focusing on the victims of Epstein's network.</p>

While acknowledging the high cost of these medications, the author contends that the budgetary concerns are overstated, as costs will be partially offset by long-term healthcare savings and will decrease as more competitors enter the market. The author criticizes the current system, where only 13 states cover these drugs for obesity under Medicaid, as a form of health inequality that denies life-saving treatment to those in poverty.</p>

These rates are considerably lower than those for personal loans or credit cards.

Most employees of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA), including air traffic controllers and screeners, are deemed essential and must work without pay. However, past extended shutdowns have led to increased sick calls from unpaid workers, resulting in longer security lines and potential flight delays. A shutdown also halts the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, worsening an existing shortage and potentially costing the travel economy billions per week.</p>

The USDA, however, will halt the issuance of new home loans entirely during a shutdown. Another potential issue is the verification of tax transcripts by the IRS, which could create bottlenecks for government-sponsored entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, affecting their ability to finalize loan approvals.</p>
