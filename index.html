Tammy Duckworth, Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova, and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. Discussions cover President Trump's economic policies, national security apparatus reshuffling, defense spending, and the administration's stance on public broadcasting. Senator Duckworth critiques Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's competence and handling of classified information, while Ambassador Markarova emphasizes the importance of U.S.-Ukraine partnership and economic agreements. The interviewees offer diverse perspectives on the administration's goals, challenges, and potential impacts on domestic and foreign affairs. Optimism surrounding the US's stability is tempered by concerns over executive overreach and funding cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence is set to receive the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for upholding the constitutional transfer of power by refusing to overturn the 2020 election results. Pence resisted pressure from then-President Trump to reject electoral votes cast for Joe Biden during the January 6, 2021, Congressional session. The award recognizes Pence's decision to prioritize his oath of office and the Constitution over party loyalty, despite facing criticism and threats from Trump's supporters. This article notes that since leaving office, Pence has faced some degree of ostracization within the Republican Party.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times guest essay argues that President Trump's enlargement of executive power goes beyond traditional conservative legal theories, drawing instead from a tradition of right-wing thought that favors monarchical and dictatorial rule. The author, Damon Linker, traces the intellectual roots of this approach to figures like Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss, and Adrian Vermeule. He contends that Trump's administration has been experimenting with these radical ideas, posing a threat to American democracy. The essay highlights concerns about the erosion of checks and balances and the potential for abuse of power, while noting that the president's views have been influenced by Russell Vought.</p>

The incident occurred while the deputy was directing traffic outside the University of Cincinnati graduation. The Hinton family's lawyer stated that Rodney Hinton Jr. became distraught after viewing the bodycam footage, which showed an officer yelling "gun" before shooting his son.</p>

The article suggests that many of Canelo's opponents focus on survival rather than engaging in a competitive fight. Crawford, despite being a highly skilled boxer, will have to move up two weight divisions to challenge Canelo, making it a potentially unequal contest.

          <p>California's high-speed rail project, approved in 2008, faces significant delays and tripled costs, leading to questions about whether the country can still build big things. The project, originally intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, is now aiming to have trains running between Bakersfield and Merced by 2033. Governor Newsom and the California High-Speed Rail Authority blame eminent domain acquisitions for the delays. However, eminent domain lawyer Mark Wasser, representing landowners, argues that the blame is misplaced, stating that other factors are contributing to the problems.</p>
