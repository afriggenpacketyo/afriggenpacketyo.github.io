          <p>Friedrich Merz was elected as Germany's next chancellor after an initial defeat in parliament, marking an unprecedented event in post-war German history. Merz initially fell short of the required majority, causing confusion and uncertainty. A second vote was held where he secured a majority of nine votes, averting a potential crisis for his Christian Democrats and their coalition with the Social Democrats. Merz will be sworn in by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, assuming office with his team of 17 ministers. The article highlights the political tensions and the importance of a strong Germany for Europe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's suggestion to convert Alcatraz back into a federal prison has been met with disbelief and skepticism by tourists visiting the island. Visitors questioned the practicality of the idea, citing the deteriorated state of the prison and the high costs associated with running a facility on an island. Despite Trump's assertion that Alcatraz would serve as a symbol of law, order, and justice, many view the proposal as absurd and not a serious consideration, while local officials emphasized the importance of tourism to San Francisco's economy.</p>

          <p>An Israeli official stated that Israel's victory in Gaza would involve the territory's complete destruction and the displacement of its inhabitants to other countries. This plan includes moving the population south into a humanitarian zone free of Hamas. However, Gaza residents express skepticism that the new offensive will improve their already dire situation, with many facing famine due to the ongoing Israeli blockade. The United Nations reports that a significant portion of Gaza is now either part of Israeli buffer zones or subject to evacuation orders.</p>

          <p>Proposed budget cuts to NASA by the Trump administration are raising concerns among international partners, including the European Space Agency (ESA). The cuts, which could amount to a 24% reduction in NASA's current budget, threaten major science projects and the work of researchers worldwide. While the cuts would avoid NASA's human exploration portfolio, they signal a shift in priorities away from the moon toward Mars, potentially impacting international collaborations like the Artemis moon program.

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge, fueled by speculation that Washington was pressuring Taiwan to strengthen its currency. Despite the recent weakness, the Taiwan dollar is still up over 8% against the U.S. dollar this year. Experts attribute the dramatic swings to exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their U.S. dollar debt holdings. While Taiwan's central bank denies that exchange rates were part of trade negotiations with the U.S., analysts remain skeptical.</p>

          <p>Missing payments on a HELOC can lead to late fees, a damaged credit score, and even foreclosure. Late fees can range from $25 to $50, and a single missed payment can significantly drop your FICO score. Repeated late payments may result in default, where the lender demands the full balance immediately. In severe cases, lenders may initiate foreclosure proceedings. Experts recommend contacting your lender immediately if you're having trouble with payments to explore options like forbearance or payment plans. (not investment advice)</p>

The protective effect was particularly noticeable in men, people under 60, and those with unhealthy lifestyles.

          <p>Co-op stores are experiencing empty shelves and payment problems following a major cyber attack. The retailer has confirmed that customer data was stolen in the attack, impacting deliveries to its stores. Some stores are unable to accept contactless payments, operating on a cash-only basis. The cyber criminals claim to have the private information of 20 million Co-op members, though the firm has not confirmed that number. The company believes only members' personal data, not bank details or passwords, have been extracted.</p>

          <p>Palantir shares experienced a significant drop of more than 10% despite the company reporting ongoing revenue growth acceleration. Analysts cited concerns over modest full-year revenue guidance, a sequential margin decline, and a year-over-year decline in international commercial revenue. While Palantir topped revenue expectations and lifted its revenue guidance for the year, the market reacted negatively to the company's international performance. CEO Alex Karp maintained a positive outlook, stating that "Palantir is on fire."</p>

          <p>Experts and advocacy groups are warning that Americans' health is at risk due to new cuts announced by the Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA plans to reduce staffing to 1980s levels and significantly cut its scientific research arm. Critics argue that dissolving the research unit will undermine scientific independence, turning the EPA into a purely political agency. The EPA is also dissolving its office of science and technology, which helps develop scientific research and guidelines for water policy.</p>

The attacks are part of a longer history of rightwing backlash that follows each time college becomes more democratic. Reactionary backlash is a feature of two main milestones in the academy’s history: the democratization of admissions and the diversification of curriculum. Today’s international rightwing leaders want to control higher education, just as they want dominion over all other social, cultural and political institutions.</p>

These taxes inflate the state’s Medicaid spending, allowing it to collect more matching funds from the federal government, but have been criticized as gimmicks and scams.</p>
