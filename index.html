          <p>This article explores the historical and biblical basis for the seven-day week, contrasting it with attempts to alter work schedules. It highlights the importance of both work and rest, referencing the biblical figure of Joseph as an example of success through meaningful work. Modern research supports the idea of a 'productivity ceiling,' suggesting that excessive work hours beyond 55 hours a week do not increase output. The article concludes that balancing work with a dedicated day for rest and reflection, as suggested by the Bible, is essential for a fulfilling and productive life.</p>

          <p>President Trump spoke at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, addressing graduates amid the administration's crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Shortly after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confirmation, West Point disbanded several student clubs, including the National Society of Black Engineers and the Society of Women Engineers. Trump has also dismissed the boards of visitors of military academies, claiming without evidence that the schools were infiltrated by "Woke Leftist Ideologues." Former West Point teachers have criticized these changes, arguing that DEI programs did not inhibit the values, training, and education of the academies.</p>

          <p>Publix has recalled its 4-ounce Greenwise Pear, Kiwi, Spinach & Pea Baby Food pouches in eight states after testing revealed elevated lead levels. The potential contamination was initially flagged by officials in North Carolina, prompting the supermarket chain to remove the affected products from store shelves. This recall follows a similar incident in March when Target recalled its store-brand Good & Gather Baby Pea, Zucchini, Kale & Thyme Vegetable Puree for the same reason. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's childhood lead poisoning program, which previously investigated a large-scale outbreak in 2023, was eliminated due to recent federal funding cuts.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered a key component of a mysterious artifact at Sutton Hoo, England: the base of a sixth-century Byzantine bucket. The bucket, known as the Bromeswell bucket, was accidentally unearthed in 1986 and depicts a North African hunting scene. Excavations revealed that the bucket contained cremated animal and human remains, along with an intact comb, potentially shedding light on the burial's significance. Researchers believe the bucket, originally from the Byzantine Empire, was repurposed as a cremation vessel, signaling the high status and connections of the interred individual.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis is still grappling with calls for police reform, with Police Chief Brian O'Hara implementing changes from within. While police data shows shootings trending down, Minneapolis remains one of the few major cities where violent crime has not improved significantly since 2020. O'Hara is focused on reducing crime and earning community trust, adjusting arrest tactics, and improving community engagement and officer training. The Justice Department recently ended investigations of six police agencies, but O'Hara stated that reform efforts will continue in Minneapolis.</p>

          <p>A major power outage affected the Cannes region during the final day of the film festival, impacting 160,000 homes.

          <p>The Catholic archbishop of New Orleans, Gregory Aymond, made a rare court appearance during a contentious clergy sexual assault bankruptcy case, shortly after announcing a potential agreement to settle claims with hundreds of survivors. Aymond stated his concern for the survivors and the need to expedite the process. However, the settlement plan has faced opposition, with some attorneys representing abuse claimants criticizing the proposed deal. The settlement would provide $130 million in cash and up to $110 million from insurance carriers and potential church property sales, but still requires a vote of approval by two-thirds of the claimants.</p>

General David Allvin, chief of staff of the US Air Force, showcased the YFQ-42A unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and lethality. The UCAV is part of the air force's collaborative combat aircraft program (CCA), designed to augment crewed fighter aircraft in air-to-air missions.
