          <p>Virginia Giuffre, known for accusing Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein of sexual assault, died by suicide at age 41, according to her family. Giuffre was a prominent voice against convicted sex offenders Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, alleging they trafficked her to Prince Andrew when she was 17, accusations he strongly denied. Her family described her as a "fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse," stating that the "toll of abuse... became unbearable."

          <p>England's upcoming Women's Six Nations match against France will heavily rely on tactical kicking, according to coach Mitchell. France's attacking prowess, especially through scrum-half Pauline Bourdon Sansus, necessitates accurate kicking to win the territorial battle and limit their opportunities. Fly-half Carla Arbez's kicking game is a focal point for France, a tactic they've recently embraced. England's Zoe Harrison, known for her tactical kicking, is favored over Holly Aitchison's running game to exploit space behind France's defense, potentially securing her spot for the upcoming Rugby World Cup.</p>

          <p>A Kyiv resident recounts a harrowing night of Russian bombings, describing the sounds of explosions and the fear experienced while sheltering in a bathroom.

The author emphasizes the need for continued resistance and the importance of freedom and will in the face of ongoing aggression.</p>
