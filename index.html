            <p>Saturday's newspapers cover a range of topics, including a surge in misogyny and racism in UK schools, attributed to students emulating figures like Donald Trump and Andrew Tate. The government's plan to send rejected asylum seekers to "return hubs" in the Balkans has received UN endorsement. Other stories include potential mortgage price wars, and scientists' claim of discovering a new color called Olo through laser manipulation of the retina. Prime Minister Starmer's announcement of extended pub hours for VE Day celebrations also makes headlines.</p>

            <p>Chinese museums are being directed to promote ethnic unity and counter "wrong historical views" by avoiding confrontational portrayals of the Han ethnicity with minorities. Pan Yue, director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission, emphasized that museums should tell the "China story" using archaeological findings and represent the country as diverse but unified. This initiative aims to cultivate a sense of community and place every cultural relic within the context of China's overall development. The Sanxingdui Museum has already implemented a course titled “Viewing Chinese Civilisation from Sanxingdui”.</p>

            <p>US airstrikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal in Yemen, controlled by Houthi rebels, have reportedly killed dozens and wounded many more, according to Houthi-run sources. The US military claims the strikes targeted a key economic resource for the Houthis, who have been attacking Red Sea shipping. The Houthis have condemned the attack as a war crime, stating the facility was civilian, and thousands of Houthi supporters rallied in Sanaa to protest the strikes. Iran has also strongly condemned the attacks as "barbaric".</p>

            <p>After Harvard University publicly rejected a series of demands from the Trump administration, a General Services Administration lawyer reportedly contacted the university claiming the letter was sent in error. The demands included discontinuing diversity efforts and limiting student protests, which Harvard President Alan Garber condemned as an infringement on academic freedom. Despite the alleged retraction attempt, the Trump administration proceeded to freeze Harvard's public funding and ordered the IRS to revoke the school's tax-exempt status, escalating the conflict.</p>

The ACLU argues that the Trump administration is rapidly deporting these individuals to El Salvador without due process. The move follows earlier deportations of Venezuelans to a mega-prison in El Salvador, prompting legal challenges over the administration's deportation plans and power. A Supreme Court ruling allowed the deportations to resume, but with the requirement of proper notice and opportunity to challenge the cases.</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation. Bin, a former gang member convicted of shooting at a rival's home, became a minister in prison and demonstrated good behavior, leading to a reduced sentence. Newsom's pardon aims to prevent Bin's deportation to Cambodia, a country he left as a toddler. The governor also granted a posthumous pardon to Sgt. Richard Allen Penry, a Vietnam War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient.</p>

            <p>A divided panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused an effort by District Court Judge James Boasberg to further investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by refusing to turn around two flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members who were sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador last month. The order does not rule in either way on the merits of Boasberg’s inquiry, however, and merely gives the petitioners in the case a deadline of April 23 by 5 p.m. to file their reply to the government. The government is then required to file their own reply by noon on April 25.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely watching the US bond market amid uncertainty over the impact of trade tariffs on the US economy. Recently, the rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell, suggesting investors were losing confidence. This volatility can affect budgets, public spending, and even household expenses like mortgages and car loans. The bond market reaction has drawn comparisons to Liz Truss's mini-Budget in the UK, highlighting potential risks to economic stability (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>A new study reveals that major rice-producing countries in South and Southeast Asia are suffering from severe cadmium contamination in their soil. The research, led by Chinese scientists, analyzed soil samples and found that up to 1.4 billion people worldwide are affected by toxic heavy metal pollution. The findings raise concerns about global food safety, as cadmium is a carcinogen linked to kidney damage, bone disorders, and respiratory diseases. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, and Thailand are identified as major rice-producing regions with high levels of cadmium.</p>

            <p>The UK Supreme Court has ruled that the term "woman" legally refers to a biological woman, providing clarity after years of contentious debate. The ruling states that the Equality Act must consistently define "woman" as a biological female, excluding biological males even with gender recognition certificates. This decision impacts women-only spaces, such as changing rooms and refuges. While some celebrate the ruling as a victory for common sense, others, particularly trans rights groups, view it as devastating and exclusionary.</p>

Rubio spoke in Paris after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials produced outlines for steps toward peace and appeared to make some long-awaited progress.</p>
