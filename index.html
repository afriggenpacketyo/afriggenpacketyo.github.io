          <p>China has successfully completed a crucial test of its Long March-10 rocket engines, a significant step toward its goal of landing astronauts on the moon by 2030. The test confirmed that the 21 YF-100K engines can operate in sync, providing the necessary thrust for the superheavy launcher. Standing 92 meters tall, the Long March-10 is designed to deliver a 27-tonne payload to a trans-lunar orbit. The mission plan involves two separate launches to send the Mengzhou crewed spacecraft and the Lanyue lander to rendezvous in lunar orbit.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a definitive breakthrough on the war in Ukraine. Trump described the talks as "productive" but stated, "There's no deal until there's a deal," while Putin called the summit a "starting point" for improving strained relations. The discussions, which did not include Ukrainian representatives, focused on ending the conflict, with both leaders acknowledging progress but admitting significant issues remain unresolved. Following the summit, Trump indicated he would update NATO and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy on the talks.</p>

          <p>A Guardian analysis of the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin portrays the meeting as a significant diplomatic victory for the Russian leader, who was welcomed back onto the world stage. The article highlights moments of apparent deference from Trump, including giving Putin a ride in the presidential limousine and allowing him to speak first at the press conference. It notes that Putin effectively used the platform to reinforce Trump's claims of a rigged 2020 election, framing the interaction as one where the Russian president successfully manipulated the dialogue to his advantage.</p>

          <p>The meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska yielded several key outcomes despite not producing a ceasefire deal for Ukraine. The summit marked a significant moment for Putin, who received a red-carpet welcome that effectively ended his status as a pariah among Western leaders. The article notes the vagueness of the leaders' post-summit statements, with Trump not mentioning Ukraine and Putin reiterating maximalist demands for peace. Ultimately, the talks generated more questions than answers, concluding with an invitation for a future meeting in Moscow.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's government is advancing a new policy that tightens residency requirements for spouses from mainland China, a move critics have labeled an "attack." The proposed amendment, part of a broader strategy to counter threats from Beijing, requires applicants to provide notarized proof of having relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. President Lai Ching-te's administration argues the change is necessary to eliminate dual-status ambiguities that could pose national security risks amid escalating cross-strait tensions.</p>

The move is framed as a direct response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas and is intended to help Democrats win back control of Congress. The plan would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval in a special election, setting up a major political battle over partisan gerrymandering.

The analysis suggests the summit was a strategic victory for Putin, who was welcomed on U.S. soil and given a platform without making any concessions.

          <p>Two new clinical trials in India are challenging the common belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes, a beloved fruit in the country. The research found that consuming mangoes in moderation, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like bread, produced a lower glycemic response and led to improvements in key metabolic health markers. One study showed that post-meal sugar fluctuations were smaller after eating mangoes compared to white bread. Researchers emphasize that the key is portion control and that the findings are not a license for unlimited consumption.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have suffered a significant blow with third baseman Max Muncy being placed on the 10-day injured list due to a Grade 1 right oblique strain. The injury is expected to keep him out for at least several weeks, creating a major gap in the team's lineup ahead of a crucial series against the San Diego Padres. Muncy's absence is a serious concern, as the team's offense struggled significantly during a previous injury stint earlier in the season. The injury further depletes the team's depth at the third base position.</p>
