          <p>Following Europe's 15-13 Ryder Cup victory, US captain Keegan Bradley has strongly advocated for changing the tournament's "envelope rule." This rule mandates that if one team's player withdraws due to injury, the opposing captain must also bench a player, resulting in a half-point for both sides. Bradley argues the rule, which impacted the US team when Viktor Hovland withdrew, is unfair and needs reform before the 2027 contest in Ireland. European captain Luke Donald, however, defended the long-standing rule.</p>

          <p>England's Women's Rugby team, the Red Roses, are strategically planning to leverage their World Cup victory to build a lasting legacy for the sport. Post-win events, a front-loaded domestic season, and increased media coverage are designed to convert new fans into active participants. The Rugby Football Union's "Impact 25" program, a £14.5m investment, aims to boost grassroots participation, especially among women and girls. Challenges remain, including managing the influx of international talent in the domestic league, but the sport is poised for significant growth.</p>

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized the strategic importance of their relationship, while North Korea's Choe Son Gui expressed willingness to cooperate in multilateral affairs to promote a fairer world order. Both nations view the US as an adversary, with China and Washington being economic rivals, and Pyongyang opposing US demands regarding its nuclear program.

          <p>Rory McIlroy criticized the "unacceptable and abusive behaviour" at the Ryder Cup after his wife, Erica, was hit by a drink thrown by an American fan. The incident occurred on the 17th tee during a Saturday match. McIlroy, usually popular with US fans, bore the brunt of hostile crowd taunts throughout the week, eventually snapping back at a spectator. He emphasized that golf should uphold higher standards of etiquette and respect, vowing to ensure such incidents do not mar the next Ryder Cup in Ireland in 2027.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, is set for a decisive victory and a new parliamentary majority. This election was crucial for the country's EU path, with Sandu having warned of "massive Russian interference." The PAS secured 50% of the vote, significantly ahead of the pro-Russian bloc. Bomb scares and arrests for plotting unrest underscored the tense atmosphere, which Moldovan officials attributed to Moscow-backed criminal groups. The outcome reinforces Moldova's commitment to a European future despite external pressures.</p>

          <p>China's stock market has experienced a significant rally this year, fueled by advancements in AI, efforts towards chip self-sufficiency, and government campaigns against price wars. However, experts like Raymond Cheng and Hao Hong are questioning whether this surge, largely driven by retail investors shifting bank deposits, indicates a boom or a potential bubble. Despite over $3 trillion added to market capitalization, economic fundamentals show signs of slowing demand and production. While some sectors stabilize, technology valuations are seen as optimistic, leaving the market vulnerable to a pullback. (not investment advice)</p>
