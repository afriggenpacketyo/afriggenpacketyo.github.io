          <p>A public feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has drawn reactions from billionaires, politicians, and pundits, with the U.S. president threatening to pull back government contracts for Musk's companies and the Tesla CEO suggesting Trump could not have won the election without him. The conflict began after Musk criticized Trump's tax-cut and spending bill, escalating into an online exchange on Truth Social and X. Bill Ackman urged Trump and Musk to reconcile for the benefit of the country, while Steve Bannon suggested seizing SpaceX and suspending federal contracts to Musk's companies, and this article compiles the various perspectives on the high-profile dispute.</p>

          <p>Opposition to the Assisted Dying Bill is growing among Members of Parliament in England and Wales, with several MPs who previously supported or abstained now indicating they will vote against it. The bill, sponsored by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, would allow terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to receive medical assistance to die, and while it initially passed its first major vote with a majority, concerns about protecting vulnerable individuals are prompting some MPs to switch sides. Some MPs are worried that the bill lacks sufficient safeguards against coercion and may pressure individuals who feel like a burden to end their lives, and this article highlights the evolving debate and the concerns being raised as the bill faces further parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Ispace, a Tokyo-based company, experienced a setback when its private lunar lander crashed during an attempted touchdown on the moon, marking the second failed lunar mission for the company. Communication with the lander was lost less than two minutes before the scheduled landing, and a preliminary analysis suggests that the laser system for measuring altitude malfunctioned, causing the lander to descend too rapidly. The mission, named Resilience, carried a rover intended to gather lunar dirt and deploy a small artistic structure, but company officials remain committed to future lunar endeavors despite the repeated failures. This article details the mission's objectives, the technical issues encountered, and the broader context of private companies entering the lunar exploration arena.</p>

          <p>Lululemon's shares have dropped significantly after the company reduced its annual profit forecast, citing the impact of Trump's tariffs and concerns about a slowing U.S. economy. The athleisure brand is among a growing number of companies warning about the effects of U.S. trade policies, and Lululemon plans to strategically increase prices on a small portion of its products and cut costs. Other sportswear companies, such as Adidas and Nike, have also indicated they will raise prices due to the tariffs, and this article examines the financial implications of the trade policies on the retail sector.

          <p>A Japanese high court overturned a previous ruling that ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The Tokyo High Court's decision reverses a district court's order for the former executives to pay around 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) in compensation, and the focal point of the appeal trial was whether the management's decisions on tsunami countermeasures were appropriate, and this article details the court's decision and the ongoing legal battles related to the Fukushima disaster.</p>

          <p>Tensions between Donald Trump and Elon Musk have escalated, drawing attention to Senate Republicans who are considering the president's "Big, Beautiful Bill," which passed in the House with narrow Republican support.

While the Senate's Republican leaders have not indicated they share Musk's concerns, they are eyeing changes to some aspects of the measure that were the result of hard-fought negotiations in the House, and could throw its prospects into jeopardy.</p>

          <p>Concerns surrounding ultra-processed foods are prompting retailers and food brands to offer more products with fewer ingredients, driven by the growing popularity of books and documentaries on the subject. Plant-based brand THIS has launched a Super Superfoods range in response to consumer hesitation about processed meat alternatives, but nutritionists warn against assuming all ultra-processed foods are unhealthy and that simply reducing ingredients can lead to the omission of fortified nutrients. Experts suggest that food manufacturers can simplify formulas and use novel processing technologies to create less processed products while maintaining nutritional value, and this article explores the debate surrounding ultra-processed foods and the trend toward simpler ingredient lists.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention centers, unlike adults who receive credit for time served awaiting trial. In many states, this means that the time kids spend in detention doesn't count toward any incarceration they may face, adding months to their confinement, and policy experts argue that this practice is a waste of time and resources, with negative impacts on young people. The juvenile justice system is supposed to be rehabilitative, but this disparity in time credit raises questions about fairness and due process for young offenders.</p>
