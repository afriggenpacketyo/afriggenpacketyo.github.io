          <h2>US Transportation Secretary Announces Flight Reductions at Newark Airport Due to Controller Shortage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 10:37:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to reduce flights at Newark Liberty International Airport due to radar outages and a shortage of air traffic controllers, aiming to ensure that booked flights will reliably fly. Duffy intends to meet with airlines to determine the reduction, which will be larger in the afternoons when international flights increase traffic. The FAA experienced a 90-second radar outage at the facility, and a separate equipment outage caused a ground stop for Newark flights. Duffy also plans to raise the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers from 56 to 61 and offer a 20% bonus for those who stay on the job, as the Trump administration plans a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from ICE detention in Louisiana after a federal judge ruled her due process and First Amendment rights were likely violated. Ozturk was detained for six weeks after co-authoring an op-ed about Israel's war with Hamas in the Tufts student newspaper, leading to the revocation of her student visa by the Trump administration. Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley welcomed Ozturk back to Massachusetts, emphasizing the importance of protecting due process and free speech rights. Ozturk's lawyers argued her detention was based solely on the expression of her opinion, and her asthma worsened during her time in detention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the 10% baseline tariff on imports is expected to remain in place for the foreseeable future, aligning with President Trump's previous statements. Lutnick dismissed concerns that consumers would bear the increased costs from these tariffs, arguing that businesses and foreign countries would absorb them instead. However, recent data indicates that businesses are already attempting to pass these costs on to consumers, leading to a decline in consumer confidence. Despite the Commerce Secretary's claim, economic analysts suggest that the tariffs will cause prices of household goods to increase.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have seemingly de-escalated after a harrowing four-day conflict marked by new military technology and entrenched religious nationalism. The clash involved airstrikes, antiaircraft volleys, and weaponized drones striking deep into each country's territory, prompting high military alert levels. International diplomacy played a crucial role in halting the escalation, but underlying political realities in both countries, driven by religious nationalism, remain unchanged. Despite a cease-fire, diplomatic relations remain frosty, and India has not backed away from its declaration to no longer comply with a river treaty, a critical factor for Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Small business owners are expressing concerns about the damaging effects of President Trump's tariffs on their businesses, with some facing potential closure. Beth Benike, owner of Busy Baby, a company that sells baby products made in China, is struggling to afford the 145% tax on Chinese imports, potentially leading to the loss of her business and her house. Another business owner, Marissa Held-Nordling, is allowing customers to stockpile baby registry gifts due to uncertainty about product availability. Economists warn that tariffs could add nearly $5,000 a year to families' expenses, while some argue that the tariffs are unnecessary and create an unfavorable economic environment.</p>

          <p>Despite the hype around artificial intelligence, experts suggest that AI is not yet capable of replacing human workers in most industries. A recent survey found that many businesses that laid off employees expecting AI to take over their roles now regret that decision. The current AI platforms are more like enhanced search engines and are not reliable enough to handle core business operations without human oversight. The cost and complexity of building AI systems, along with concerns about data privacy, further limit their adoption by smaller companies.</p>

          <h2>UK to End Overseas Recruitment for Care Workers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, announced that the country will end the recruitment of care workers from abroad to reduce reliance on lower-skilled visas. The new rules will require care firms to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas for overseas workers already in the country. The government expects these changes to reduce lower-skilled visas by up to 50,000 over the next year. This policy shift is part of a broader effort to curb net migration and promote domestic employment.</p>
