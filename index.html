          <p>New York Mets outfielder Brandon Nimmo has publicly criticized Major League Baseball's All-Star selection process, calling it "broken." He specifically objects to the rule requiring every team to have at least one representative, arguing it compromises the integrity of what should be a showcase of the league's best players. Nimmo's comments come after both he and teammate Juan Soto, despite having strong seasons, were not selected for the game, highlighting a long-standing debate over fairness versus representation in the event.</p>

          <p>A decade after its quiet release, Lord Huron's song "The Night We Met" has achieved remarkable global success, outperforming many contemporary hits on streaming charts. The song's resurgence began after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" and has since been amplified by its immense popularity on TikTok. Now boasting over three billion Spotify streams, the track's enduring, wistful appeal has made it a cultural sleeper hit, demonstrating a rare and sustained trajectory of growth long after its initial release.</p>

          <p>The popular British soft toy company Jellycat has abruptly terminated its supply agreements with approximately 100 independent shops across the UK, leaving many small business owners devastated. The company cited a "brand elevation strategy" for the move and stated the decision was final, offering no specific reasons to the affected retailers. These small shops, many of which supported the brand for decades and relied on it for significant income, now feel abandoned as Jellycat focuses on larger, more theatrical retail partnerships.</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other key members of his team, in a significant move in the competitive AI talent market. This is not a full acquisition of the company, but Google will gain a nonexclusive license to some of Windsurf's technology. The deal underscores the intense rivalry for top AI expertise, as it was reported that Windsurf had previously been in acquisition talks with competitor OpenAI for a potential $3 billion deal.</p>

          <p>A satirical opinion piece in The Atlantic uses humor to critique the current state of NASA under the Trump administration. The article ironically suggests that space travel is no longer necessary, pointing to massive layoffs, severe budget cuts, and the appointment of a former reality TV star as the agency's interim head. By framing these developments as a reason to abandon space exploration and leave it to billionaires, the piece offers a sharp commentary on a perceived decline in American scientific ambition and competence.</p>
