          <p>China has expressed deep concern over the escalating military conflict between India and Pakistan, urging both nations to prioritize regional peace and stability. The Chinese foreign ministry released a statement calling for calm and restraint, advocating for a return to peaceful political settlements. This follows a period of heightened tensions triggered by a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. The statement underscores Beijing's worry about a potential full-scale confrontation between the two nuclear-armed neighbors and their impact on the region's stability. The article notes that the United States mediated a ceasefire deal shortly after the statement, potentially impacting China's role as a peace broker.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire deal following mediation talks led by the U.S. after weeks of escalating conflict. President Trump announced the agreement, emphasizing the use of "Common Sense and Great Intelligence" by both countries. The ceasefire aims to halt clashes triggered by a deadly attack on tourists, which India blamed on Pakistan, and follows recent strikes by both nations. The agreement comes after Secretary of State Rubio urged de-escalation and offered U.S. assistance for constructive talks, highlighting the ongoing tensions and the need for a measured and responsible approach from both sides. India denied claims of destroying an Indian S-400 Air Defense System and Air Force Stations in Sirsa and Surat.</p>

          <p>Sir Tom Farmer, the Edinburgh-born founder of the Kwik Fit garage chain, has died peacefully at his home at the age of 84. He built Kwik Fit into the world's largest independent tyre and automotive chain, eventually operating in over 2,000 locations across 18 countries, before selling it to Ford for £1 billion in 1999. Beyond his automotive empire, Sir Tom also held a majority stake in Hibernian FC for 28 years. Knighted in 1997 for his contributions to the automotive industry, he was also recognized for his extensive charitable work with the Carnegie Medal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that declining birth rates are a serious issue that progressives should address, despite the politicization of pronatalism. The author asserts that an aging and shrinking population will lead to a decrease in the quality of life, with fewer people to support the elderly and contribute to society. It refutes the idea that fewer people would be better for the environment, arguing that richer societies are better equipped to combat climate change. The author suggests that policies like less expensive housing, universal pre-K, and affordable healthcare could help people have more children if they want them, while also aligning with progressive values.</p>

Cardinal Nichols noted the absence of politicking or rancor during the proceedings, emphasizing the calmness and prayerfulness of the process. He added that the experience allowed him time for reflection and patience, free from the distractions of his mobile phone, following the death of Pope Francis on April 21st.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration officials, in collaboration with the Tennessee Highway Patrol, have arrested over 100 people in Tennessee as part of an operation supporting President Trump's deportation plan. The operation, which has sparked concern within Nashville's immigrant community, involved 588 traffic stops and resulted in the seizure of illegal drugs and firearms. While authorities claim stops are based solely on driver behavior, immigrant rights supporters allege racial profiling, citing that patrols are concentrated in predominantly minority areas. Concerns have been raised that some detainees may be deported without adequate legal representation.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how federal efforts to control silicosis, a deadly lung disease, have been undermined by recent actions. It highlights the progress made in the past, including the establishment of OSHA and NIOSH, and the implementation of stricter silica-exposure standards. However, recent actions, such as the firing of the CWHSP team and the pausing of enforcement of MSHA's new silica standard, threaten to reverse this progress. The article also points out the resurgence of silicosis in the artificial-stone countertop industry, where many workers are exposed to high levels of silica dust.</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to pass cryptocurrency legislation are facing resistance due to concerns over his personal financial interests in the crypto market. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, a bill meant to establish federal rules for stablecoins, citing conflicts of interest arising from Trump's meme coin, $TRUMP, and other crypto ventures. Critics argue that the president's involvement in these ventures creates opportunities for individuals to enrich him personally, endangering national security and eroding public trust. The failure of the GENIUS bill highlights the challenges Trump faces in advancing his agenda amid growing scrutiny of his financial entanglements.</p>

          <p>An order confining approximately 160,000 people to their homes in Spain's northeastern Catalonia region was lifted after a fire at an industrial estate caused a toxic cloud of chlorine.

Fire services stabilized the fire, reporting no casualties and monitoring the area for toxic levels. The warehouse owner suggested a lithium battery may have caused the blaze, and authorities lifted the emergency measure once the toxic cloud began to dissipate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores how part-time jobs have become a trap for many American workers, with employers increasingly relying on part-time labor to avoid paying benefits and circumvent labor laws. The rise of just-in-time scheduling exacerbates the problem, leaving workers with inconsistent schedules and fluctuating hours, making it difficult to secure loans, rent apartments, or access social safety nets. While employers argue that part-time work offers flexibility, the evidence suggests that most part-time workers would prefer stable full-time employment. The author proposes policy changes, such as requiring employers to set schedules in advance and removing incentives for hiring part-time workers, to address the issue of underwork.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes Xi Jinping's long-term strategy to make the world dependent on China's exports and know-how, aiming to counter foreign pressure. Xi has directed state-controlled banks to lend trillions to industrial borrowers and has introduced export controls and blacklists as economic weapons. While this strategy has strengthened China's position in some sectors, it has also worsened relations with trading partners and imposed costs on Chinese households. The article questions whether this approach will ultimately make China strong enough to overtake the United States as a superpower, noting the potential for overreach and the importance of domestic consumption.</p>

          <p>The United States and China commenced high-level talks in Geneva, Switzerland, aimed at de-escalating trade tensions, marking the first in-person contact between the two largest economies since President Trump imposed significant tariffs. The negotiations involved U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. Trump has indicated a potential reduction in tariffs, suggesting an 80% rate, while China urges sincerity and the lifting of unilateral tariffs. The trade war has already impacted trade, with Chinese exports to the U.S. dropping 21% in April.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes how President Trump's reduced support for Ukraine has strained European allies' ability to supply Ukraine with necessary weapons. With the U.S. shifting its focus, European nations are struggling to meet Ukraine's needs for long-range missiles, artillery, and air-defense systems. While European leaders are willing to invest in weapons production, it will take time to ramp up production, leaving Ukraine reliant on American arms. As allies fear that Mr. Trump will pull Russian deterrents, like U.S. troops and the American nuclear umbrella, out of Europe. Focusing on their own protection eats into what other European countries might have given to Ukraine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recently introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other schedule I substances in the United States. The bill would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that forbid federal funds from going towards research of schedule I substances. Proponents argue this would allow research to catch up with increasing cannabis consumption and enable policymakers to craft effective legislation, while potentially allowing more clinical research on medical cannabis. However, some experts are skeptical of its chances of passing due to the current political climate.</p>
