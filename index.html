        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom is set to significantly increase its defense spending, signaling a commitment to modernize its armed forces and address growing global threats. Prime Minister Keir Starmer outlined plans for new nuclear-powered attack submarines, enhanced weapon production, and a strengthened cyber command. This initiative is intended to send a strong message to Russia and reassure NATO allies of Britain's dedication to collective security. The government aims to reach 2.5% of national income by 2027 and an ambition of 3% before 2034, although funding sources remain unclear, as the focus is on deterring Russia while investing in domestic manufacturing jobs.</p>

          <p>Young voters in South Korea are reportedly disillusioned with their choices in the upcoming presidential election. These voters, some of whom participated in demonstrations following President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law, feel uninspired by the available candidates. This sentiment highlights a broader trend of political apathy among the younger generation in South Korea, who are seeking leaders that address their specific concerns and aspirations. The lack of enthusiasm could impact voter turnout and potentially influence the election's outcome, leaving a lasting mark on the nation's political landscape.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the New York Mets in 10 innings, with closer Tanner Scott surrendering crucial runs in the top of the 10th.

The Dodgers went two for 11 with runners in scoring position, stranding 11 men on base, ultimately squandering a strong start from Dustin May.

          <p>Taiwan is preparing to test a domestically produced kamikaze sea drone later this month, aiming to strengthen its naval defenses against increasing pressure from mainland China. Developed by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, the drone will undergo combat capability evaluations before further testing later this year.

          <p>Poland's recent presidential election saw a nationalist candidate, Karol Nawrocki, narrowly defeat the liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafal Trzaskowski, signaling the resilience of populism in the country. This outcome comes shortly after other nations rejected Trumpist candidates, highlighting Poland's divergence from this trend. The election results serve as a reminder that liberal democracy faces ongoing challenges in overcoming populism, even after the election of a centrist government in 2023. The new administration will have to navigate a deeply polarized political landscape and address unfulfilled promises, including liberalizing abortion laws.</p>

          <p>MI5 is under increased scrutiny after a High Court judge expressed "no confidence" in the Security Service's account of how a senior officer provided false evidence in the case of a violent neo-Nazi agent. The judge ordered MI5 to release secret documents related to the case, raising concerns about the "correctness" of new evidence from a senior MI5 officer. The case involves an agent known as X, who used his MI5 role to terrorize his girlfriend, and MI5's subsequent attempts to conceal his identity.

          <p>The upcoming Tokyo metropolitan assembly election is being closely watched as a critical indicator of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's long-term political prospects. The outcome of this local race could significantly influence national politics and potentially lead to Ishiba's resignation, particularly due to waning popularity stemming from economic policies and rising prices. Historically, the Tokyo assembly election has served as a bellwether for national sentiment, often triggering major political shifts. Analysts suggest Ishiba faces a "dead end" as his Cabinet's approval ratings have plummeted, making this election a crucial test of his leadership.</p>

          <p>Due to rising prices from tariffs, restaurants in China are having to adjust their menus, such as one restaurant in Beijing that had to remove salt-baked chicken feet imported from America. The owner of Kunyuan restaurant stated that American chicken feet are superior in taste and texture, but prices have increased by 30% since March. While alternative sources from Brazil and Russia exist, they do not meet the same quality standards, and the owner hopes to reintroduce American chicken feet once prices decrease, contingent on global political stability.

          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by her recent remarks about potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst responded to constituents' concerns about Republican Medicaid cuts by stating, "Well, we're all going to die," which Scholten criticized as lacking leadership. Scholten, a former baseball player who has previously run for higher office, aims to make the race a referendum on President Donald Trump's trade policy, particularly its impact on Iowa soybean farmers. While Iowa's House seats may be competitive, Democrats have not won a Senate race in the state since 2008.</p>

          <p>Mongolian Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene has resigned after failing to secure enough support in a parliamentary confidence vote, following weeks of public protests against allegations of corruption. Oyun-Erdene received only 44 votes, far short of the 64 needed to remain in office, and will serve in a caretaker role until a successor is appointed. Prior to the vote, he warned that the motion could destabilize the country's democracy, with protests fueled by reports of lavish spending by his son and a decline in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index.

          <p>Acting FEMA Director David Richardson reportedly expressed a lack of awareness regarding the start of hurricane season during a staff meeting, leading to confusion and concern among agency personnel. While a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson claimed it was a joke, the comment sparked criticism amid existing low morale within FEMA. Richardson stated that he plans to maintain the existing plan for addressing hurricane season and will not interfere with the FEMA advisory council.
