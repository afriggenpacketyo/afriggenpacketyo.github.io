          <p>In a lighthearted incident at Wildwood Devon, two five-year-old European brown bears named Mish and Lucy escaped their enclosure. The park initiated safety protocols, moving visitors to a secure building, while the bears were not considered a public threat. The duo was later found in a food storage area, having consumed a week's supply of honey and other snacks before being safely returned. An internal investigation is underway to determine the cause of the operational error that allowed the escape.</p>

The move follows a recent, widely circulated video of a violent arrest by ICE agents in Valinda that left a man bloodied. The proposed motion cites concerns that aggressive tactics and raids are terrorizing communities, violating civil rights, and negatively impacting the local economy and public welfare. Federal officials maintain their agents are targeting criminals and sometimes defending themselves from hostile crowds.</p>

          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers losing 9-5 to the Kansas City Royals, Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season. In a limited two-inning start as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, Ohtani showed formidable power, throwing a fastball that reached 101.7 mph, the fastest of his MLB career. He allowed only one hit and a walk over 27 pitches, demonstrating the dominant potential of his arm. The promising outing was a significant positive for the Dodgers, even as the team's bullpen and defense struggled later in the game.</p>

          <p>According to renowned computer scientist Harry Shum, the former head of AI at Microsoft, China is rapidly catching up to the United States in the field of artificial intelligence algorithms, despite a significant gap in chip technology. Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that while the U.S. maintains a clear lead in AI chips, Chinese companies are making major strides in algorithm engineering. He highlighted the Chinese startup DeepSeek, which has achieved results comparable to top U.S. models like those from OpenAI using far less computing power, as a key example of this progress.</p>

This indicates that women likely remained in their family homes after marriage while men moved to join their wives' households.
