          <p>England's national rugby team defeated the United States with a decisive 40-5 score in a match held in Washington, D.C. The game experienced nearly two hours of delays due to lightning in the area, forcing players off the field and spectators to seek shelter. Despite the interruptions, England scored six tries, concluding their tour of the Americas with a perfect three-win record. Several players also made their England debuts during the heavily rotated match.</p>

          <p>Richard Jefferson, a former teammate of LeBron James on the Cleveland Cavaliers, recently described the intense challenges of playing alongside the basketball superstar. Speaking on a podcast, Jefferson explained that James's extreme competitiveness and demand for excellence could make the experience difficult, comparing it to the high standards of other legends like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. However, he clarified that these "cons" were a natural part of striving for championships at the highest level of the sport.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new criminal offense to target individuals preparing for mass casualty attacks, even if they lack a specific ideological motive. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects who research targets or plan violence, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws. This initiative follows the Southport attack, where the perpetrator's lack of a clear ideology prevented earlier intervention despite his preparatory actions.</p>

          <p>Paul Biya, the 92-year-old president of Cameroon, has significantly increased his social media activity in an attempt to connect with the nation's youth ahead of the upcoming election. However, analysts suggest the strategy is largely ineffective, as the content is seen as top-down, inauthentic, and fails to address key issues like unemployment and corruption. With over 60% of the population under 25, young voters are a crucial demographic, but many view the online campaign as a cosmetic effort rather than a genuine attempt at engagement.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gave superstar Mookie Betts an unplanned day off, citing the need for a mental and mechanical reset. Betts has been struggling through a career-worst slump, with his batting average falling significantly below his usual standards. The decision was made after just one game following the All-Star break, signaling the team's urgency in helping their key player rediscover his form. Roberts hopes that watching a game from the dugout will provide a beneficial change of perspective.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are seriously evaluating the possibility of signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, 40, previously played for the Clippers for six seasons and would add significant playmaking depth and veteran leadership to the roster. The potential signing aligns with the team's strategy to enhance its ball-handling capabilities and provide support for current star James Harden, with whom Paul has played before.</p>

          <p>Germany defeated France in a dramatic Euro 2025 quarterfinal, winning 6-5 in a penalty shootout after the match ended 1-1. German goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger was the hero, saving the decisive penalty after having scored one herself moments earlier. Germany played with only ten players for over 100 minutes after an early red card, but managed to equalize and hold on through extra time. Berger's performance was a redemption after she faced criticism following a loss in the group stage.</p>

          <p>After being widely promoted as the language of the future, Mandarin is seeing a decline in popularity among learners in several Western countries. University enrollments for Chinese language studies have dropped in the United States and Britain from their peaks within the last decade. Data from New Zealand also shows a decrease in Mandarin learners at the secondary school level. This shift suggests a waning appeal for the language in the West, reversing a previous trend of rapid growth.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and is threatening to terminate the partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico. The move is a response to the Mexican government's actions that forced airlines to relocate from Mexico City's main airport, which the U.S. claims violates a bilateral aviation agreement. Mexican airlines will now need U.S. government approval for their flight schedules, escalating a trade dispute that could impact the millions of passengers who travel between the countries.

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy to focus on closer cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a new "E3" alliance. This strategic shift is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty about the future of U.S. security commitments to Europe under a Trump presidency. The new dynamic was highlighted by a joint trip to Kyiv by the leaders of the three nations and a new bilateral treaty between Germany and the UK focused on security and defense, signaling a move toward greater European self-reliance.</p>
