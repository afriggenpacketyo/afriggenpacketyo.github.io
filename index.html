          <p>Wildfires in Canada have led to the evacuation of over 33,400 people across Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, with states of emergency declared in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

          <p>The Trump administration has increased tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, a move that could increase the costs of various consumer products, including cars, sports equipment, and canned goods. Experts suggest that businesses will likely pass these costs onto consumers through higher prices, potentially impacting industries reliant on these metals. While some steel manufacturers may benefit, economists warn of potential harm to industries and consumers due to increased manufacturing expenses. The tariffs are intended to reduce America's reliance on foreign nations, but the effects could ripple through various sectors.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates following a weaker-than-expected ADP jobs report. Trump criticized Powell's handling of monetary policy, suggesting that the Fed's reluctance to cut rates puts the U.S. at an economic disadvantage compared to countries like China. The ADP report showed the lowest monthly private sector jobs number in years, intensifying Trump's pressure on Powell, whom he has repeatedly criticized and threatened to remove from his position.</p>

The bomber, Guy Edward Bartkus, died in the explosion, and authorities believe he acted as part of the anti-natalist movement. Park was apprehended at John F.

          <p>Vietnam has officially ended its two-child policy, allowing families to decide how many children they wish to have, in response to a declining birth rate and a shrinking working-age population. The policy, which had been in place since 2009, restricted families to one or two children, with stricter enforcement for government officials and Communist Party members. The decision reflects concerns that the country's fertility rate has dropped below the replacement level, potentially leading to an end of the "golden population" period within 15 years, and lawmakers are also addressing sex imbalances caused by prenatal gender selection.</p>

          <p>While making on-time debt payments is important for credit scores, it is not the only factor determining a high score, as not all debt payments are factored into credit scores, and your credit utilization ratio also plays a significant role. Many Americans incorrectly assume that paying bills on time ensures a high credit score, but payments such as rent-to-own, private school tuition, and utilities may not be reported to credit bureaus. Experts advise checking credit reports to understand which payments are influencing credit scores and suggest aiming for low credit usage to improve your overall score. (not investment advice)</p>
