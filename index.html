            <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller anticipates that President Trump's tariffs will have a 'transitory' impact on inflation, drawing comparisons to the 'Tush Push' football play. Waller outlined two scenarios: larger tariffs leading to a higher inflation spike followed by a slowdown, and smaller tariffs resulting in a more moderate inflation increase. In both cases, he expects the Fed to cut interest rates, though the timing would depend on the magnitude of the tariffs. Waller emphasized the need for flexibility in policymaking due to the uncertainty caused by the tariffs.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to lead to a significant reshoring of manufacturing to the United States. The survey reveals that most companies believe it would be more cost-effective to relocate supply chains to lower-tariff countries. Cost and the challenge of finding skilled labor are cited as the primary reasons for not reshoring. Respondents also expressed concerns about the current administration's inconsistent strategy and feel that the Trump Administration is bullying corporate America.</p>

Despite Trump's temporary rollback of tariffs on countries outside China, Solomon emphasized that markets will remain volatile as the future of trade policy remains uncertain.

            <p>During a meeting with President Trump, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele indicated that he would not return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man wrongfully deported from Maryland. Bukele, referring to Abrego Garcia as a terrorist, stated that he lacked the authority to return him to the U.S. The Trump administration has maintained that Abrego Garcia's fate is up to El Salvador, despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate his return. The situation highlights the complex dynamics between the two countries regarding deportations and security concerns.</p>

The Israeli military claims it targeted a Hamas command center, but the incident highlights the ongoing challenges to healthcare access and safety in the region.</p>

These shifting policies are causing uncertainty for businesses and raising questions about the credibility of Trump's trade policy. </p>
