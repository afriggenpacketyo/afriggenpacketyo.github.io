          <p>Tech billionaire Peter Thiel's venture capital firm, Founders Fund, has disclosed a 9% stake in the ether treasury company Bitmine Immersion Technologies, causing its shares to surge. This investment has also lifted the stock of similar companies focused on Ethereum. The move comes amid a broader wave of interest in Ethereum, fueled by new stock trading options in Europe and renewed optimism about the potential passage of a U.S. stablecoin bill, which has also contributed to a rally in the price of ether itself.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, told business leaders he will no longer use the controversial phrase “globalize the intifada” and will discourage its use by others. The commitment came during a private meeting amid backlash from those who view the slogan as a call to violence against Jews. Mamdani explained that while he views the term as a call for protest against Israeli occupation, he is willing to moderate his language to address these concerns.</p>

          <p>The UK government is under fire after it was revealed that a major data breach in 2022 exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had assisted British forces. The previous Conservative government obtained a super-injunction to block reporting of the leak, which was only recently lifted. The current prime minister stated that former ministers have "serious questions to answer" over the failings, which included a secret and costly resettlement route for those affected.</p>

The call comes amid growing pressure from conservatives who are dissatisfied with the administration's handling of the case after the DOJ announced Epstein's death was a suicide and no client list would be released. Trump has dismissed the issue, urging followers not to "waste Time and Energy" on the matter.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that U.S. inflation rose to a 2.7% annual rate in June, the highest level since February. On a monthly basis, the index increased by 0.3%, driven by rising costs for food and energy. The data suggests that President Trump's tariffs may be starting to impact consumer prices, and the uptick in inflation makes it highly unlikely that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting.
