        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, successfully restoring sight in blind mice and a monkey, while also granting them the ability to see infrared light. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, possesses excellent photoelectric properties, converting light into electrical energy. The nanowire implants made from tellurium act as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina, sending electrical signals to the brain, and this breakthrough holds significant promise for treating human blindness, offering a potential path to restore vision and even enhance it beyond normal human capabilities. The results of the study indicate a promising avenue for treating blindness in humans.</p>

          <p>President Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles following clashes between residents and ICE agents during immigration raids, leading to numerous arrests and condemnation from California Governor Gavin Newsom who called the raids cruel and inflammatory. The White House cited attacks on ICE officers as the reason for the deployment, while Newsom criticized the federal government's takeover of the National Guard. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass accused ICE of sowing terror, and the FBI warned against endangering federal agents, leading to escalating tensions between federal and local authorities as the situation remains tense in the predominantly Latino district of Paramount. The deployment raises legal questions about the use of federal power within states. Optimism that the situation will de-escalate is low.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal scholars are raising concerns about President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles without the governor's request, citing potential misuse of Title 10 powers. The action is viewed by some as a chilling use of the military to suppress dissent, while others point to the Insurrection Act of 1807, which allows federal intervention in extreme circumstances. The ACLU has warned against the dangerous implications of using the military domestically, and critics fear the administration is sending a message to protesters through this deployment, creating concerns about the erosion of states' rights and the potential for escalating tensions. The situation is being closely monitored for its constitutional implications.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China, which faces a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce. The study indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers, challenging traditional expectations that place the primary burden of childcare on women. China's fertility rate has fallen to an estimated 1.1 children per woman, far below the replacement level, threatening economic stability and the country's ability to achieve high-income status, thus, the proposal aims to promote gender equality and encourage shared parental responsibilities.</p>

          <p>Japan is grappling with the issue of "toilet panic" following the Noto Peninsula earthquake, where damaged sewage systems and lack of running water made public restrooms unusable, and despite Japan's reputation for disaster preparedness, many people lack knowledge on how to use portable toilets. To address this, educators are teaching elementary school students about portable toilets, emphasizing their importance in preventing the spread of infectious diseases during disasters. The government is urged to stockpile portable toilets and improve sanitation measures in evacuation centers, as maintaining sanitary conditions is crucial for saving lives and preventing health complications during emergencies.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are resisting pressure to adopt China's '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week, despite some venture capitalists advocating for it to compete globally. Founders argue that overwork leads to decreased retention and is often at odds with European values and regulations, and instead of increasing working hours, they emphasize the need for more funding and resources to foster innovation and sustainable growth. Europe's most successful companies have achieved dominance through innovation rather than overwork, and the younger generation prioritizes work-life balance, making it crucial for startups to offer a supportive and balanced environment.</p>

The final straw came when Trump rejected Musk's nomination for NASA administrator, leading to Musk's public criticism of the president and despite hopes for reconciliation, the relationship is unlikely to recover.</p>
