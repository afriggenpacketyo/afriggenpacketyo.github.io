          <h2>Former President Trump Denies Report He Was Dissuaded from Firing Fed Chair</h2>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has refuted a Wall Street Journal report that claimed he was persuaded against firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The article alleged that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had warned Trump of potential economic instability and market backlash from such an unprecedented move. In a social media post, Trump dismissed the story as untruthful, asserting his own superior knowledge of the market. The situation highlights ongoing tensions and the legal complexities surrounding the potential removal of a Fed chair.</p>

          <p>A protest in Epping, Essex, at a hotel used to house asylum seekers, escalated as demonstrators threw bottles and smoke flares toward police vehicles. Over a thousand people gathered, chanting slogans like "send them home," following the recent arrest of an asylum seeker on suspicion of sexual assault. Police, who had an order in place requiring the removal of face coverings due to previous unrest, made one arrest as they worked to manage the volatile situation and prevent further disorder.</p>

          <p>Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut sharply criticized the Trump administration's economic policies, labeling Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick a "con man" for his optimistic tariff predictions. Himes refuted the claim that foreign countries pay tariffs, asserting the cost falls on American consumers and businesses. He also defended the Federal Reserve's independence, explaining that interest rates are set by a committee, not unilaterally by Chair Jerome Powell, and warned of severe market reactions if the president attempts to fire him.

          <p>A recent CBS poll indicates President Trump's approval rating has dropped to 42%, down from a majority in February. The decline is linked to public perception of his key policies, with a majority believing his administration's deportation efforts have become too broad and are no longer focused solely on dangerous criminals. Additionally, his signature tax and spending bill faces majority disapproval, as most Americans feel it primarily benefits the wealthy while the administration neglects to focus on lowering consumer prices.
