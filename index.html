        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China and India are at a critical juncture to reset their bilateral relationship. Recent high-level diplomatic exchanges and overtures, such as restarting talks on direct air services, signal a potential thaw after years of rivalry and border tensions. The author suggests that Beijing should view New Delhi as a partner in reforming the global order, especially amid shifting geopolitical dynamics and US trade policies. A pragmatic approach focused on common interests, like economic cooperation, is presented as essential for constructive collaboration.</p>

          <p>The largest-ever contingent of Taiwanese soldiers, numbering over 500, has participated in the US National Guard's "Northern Strike" military exercises in Michigan. This development, revealed by Pentagon-linked media, marks a significant deepening of defense ties between Washington and Taipei. The public acknowledgment of Taiwan's participation breaks from a long-standing policy of ambiguity regarding such military cooperation. This move highlights a strengthening partnership despite the transactional nature of the current US administration's foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The government in England and Wales is planning a significant overhaul of sentencing rules, allowing courts to impose wider restrictions on offenders serving community sentences. These new powers could include banning convicted individuals from pubs, concerts, and sporting events, as well as imposing driving and travel bans, even if the restrictions are unrelated to their specific crime. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the goal is to restrict criminals' freedom, but hospitality industry leaders and legal experts have raised concerns about the practical implementation and necessary funding for such measures.</p>

          <p>Shane Gorman, whose father David died in the 1988 Piper Alpha oil platform disaster, shares his personal story of seeking to understand the tragedy that claimed 167 lives. Inspired by his father's role as a safety officer, Gorman pursued a career in offshore safety to investigate the "catalogue of things" that led to the world's worst offshore accident. The article recounts the harrowing events of the explosion and the subsequent Cullen inquiry, which exposed systemic safety failures. Gorman emphasizes that the disaster serves as a crucial lesson against complacency and prioritizing profit over people.</p>

          <p>Russia has accused Ukraine of conducting drone attacks that caused a fire at the Kursk nuclear power plant in its western region, though the fire was quickly extinguished with no reported injuries or changes in radiation levels. The alleged attacks on Russian energy facilities occurred as Ukraine celebrated its Independence Day, marking its 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. The day was also marked by visits from international leaders like Canada's Prime Minister and messages of support, including from King Charles, reaffirming global solidarity with Kyiv.</p>

          <p>A new national memorial honoring the victims of communist dictatorship in Germany is set to be built in central Berlin, a project that victims' associations describe as "long overdue." The memorial will commemorate those who suffered under the authoritarian regime of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) from 1949 to 1989, including the hundreds who died trying to flee to the West. With funding expected in the 2026 federal budget, the project aims to provide recognition for survivors and serve as an educational site about the differences between dictatorship and democracy.</p>

          <p>The 2026 Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) may present a difficult situation for retirees, as the benefit increase is projected to lag behind actual inflation. The article explains that the COLA calculation is based on third-quarter inflation data, meaning it arrives after recipients have already faced higher prices for months. This timing issue could be exacerbated by factors like new tariffs affecting consumer prices later in the year. The article suggests that retirees may need to find other income sources to bridge the gap, as relying solely on Social Security could be challenging. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned former President Donald Trump's plan to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, calling it an "abuse of power" and an attempt to "manufacture a crisis." Trump has framed the deployment, similar to one in Washington D.C., as a necessary crackdown on crime in major Democrat-run cities. Chicago's mayor also expressed "grave concerns," stating the move is uncoordinated and could inflame local tensions. The move is part of a broader administration effort that has seen troops armed in Washington D.C. despite local opposition.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma mother and stepfather, Cherie and Dustin Walker, are facing felony child neglect charges after their 11-year-old daughter gave birth to a full-term baby at home without medical assistance.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has supervised the test-firing of two new types of anti-aircraft missiles, according to state media. The tests were reported to be effective against aerial threats like drones and cruise missiles, showcasing the country's advancing military capabilities. This military activity coincides with ongoing joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang regularly condemns. The display of force also comes as North Korea continues to deepen its ties with Russia, raising concerns about potential technological cooperation between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the ocean southeast of Bermuda. The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm had maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour and was moving north-northeast. Forecasters predict Fernand will strengthen over the weekend, potentially becoming a hurricane by Monday, but is expected to remain over the open ocean and move well east of Bermuda. This follows an above-normal hurricane season forecast from NOAA, which predicted 13 to 18 named storms.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense continued its slump in a 5-1 loss to the San Diego Padres, a defeat that caused them to fall out of first place in the National League West. The team managed only two hits in the game, struggling to adjust to the pitching of Nestor Cortes. Manager Dave Roberts noted that while the team isn't lacking effort, it needs to adopt a better team-oriented approach at the plate rather than focusing on individual mechanics or home runs. The back-to-back losses have erased their division lead, increasing the pressure as the season enters its final stretch.</p>
