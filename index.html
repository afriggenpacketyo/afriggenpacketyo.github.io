          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has warned that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are severely harming businesses owned by Asian-Americans, potentially forcing some to close. At a press event, members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus shared stories of constituents facing skyrocketing import costs, such as a restaurant seeing spice costs double and a medicinal oil importer's shipping fees increasing from $500 to $13,000. The lawmakers described the tariffs as a "cruel betrayal," arguing that these small, family-run businesses are being treated as collateral damage in the ongoing trade dispute.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A columnist for the Los Angeles Times argues that the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel is not an isolated incident but part of a larger, concerning trend of silencing dissent and punishing those who speak out. The article suggests this action, along with other pressures on the city, represents a misuse of government power to target political enemies, creating a chilling effect on free speech.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A political violence expert argues that the public discourse following Charlie Kirk's assassination has focused excessively on the shooter's political affiliation rather than the underlying conditions that foster such acts. Professor Arie Perliger of UMass Lowell suggests that intense political polarization and a dysfunctional political system create an environment where individuals lose faith in democratic processes and resort to violence. He contends that the rush to assign blame to one political side is unproductive and distracts from addressing the broader societal issues that normalize extreme actions. The focus, he states, should be on the environment that facilitates such tragedies.</p>

          <p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is urgently seeking to lease hundreds of private office spaces across the country to support a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. According to GSA employees, an "ICE surge" team was created to accommodate the rapid expansion of enforcement officers conducting widespread raids. This rush for facilities follows recent downsizing at the GSA, which terminated many government leases, forcing the agency to now renegotiate with landlords at higher rates. The effort is part of a broader government-wide diversion of resources toward immigration enforcement, funded by a recent $75 billion allocation from Congress.</p>

However, an analysis suggests that while the personal connections were strong, Britain's ability to influence U.S. policy remains limited. Despite amicable discussions on issues like Gaza and Ukraine, Trump did not alter his fundamental positions. According to the president's chief of staff, the visit will not change U.S. policy on trade or international affairs. The key outcome for the UK appears to be maintaining a positive relationship, allowing for respectful disagreement without incurring diplomatic penalties.</p>

          <p>Transportation ministers from Germany's 16 federal states have unanimously agreed to raise the price of the popular 'Deutschlandticket' to €63 per month, effective January 2026. The ticket, which currently costs €58, allows for unlimited travel on all local and regional public transport across the country. This is the second price hike for the program, which was initially launched at €49. While officials called the increase a necessary compromise to ensure the program's continuation through 2030, mobility associations criticized the decision, warning it could undermine passenger trust and lead to widespread cancellations.</p>

          <p>The national nonprofit Baby2Baby is partnering with the state of New York to provide free newborn supply kits to families on Medicaid. The initiative is part of a $9 million state budget allocation designed to support maternal health and ease the financial burden on new parents. The kits will include essential items such as diapers, hygiene products, and breastfeeding supplies. Baby2Baby, which has developed a system to manufacture diapers at a significantly lower cost, aims to distribute 100,000 kits across the state next year, addressing the fact that one in two U.S. families struggles to afford diapers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts are raising alarms over the government's response to criticism following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, arguing it sets a dangerous precedent for the First Amendment. Actions such as the State Department revoking visas, Attorney General Pam Bondi vowing to prosecute "hate speech," and the FCC pressuring ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel are seen as potential government overreach. Scholars note that while private companies can fire employees for their speech, government coercion of those companies is illegal. They warn that these moves threaten to erode free speech protections, regardless of one's political views.</p>

          <p>Puerto Rican music superstar Bad Bunny stated he is not performing concert dates in the 50 U.S. states on his current world tour due to fears that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could target his fans. As a U.S. citizen, the artist is not personally at risk, but he expressed concern for his audience. In response, the Department of Homeland Security dismissed his claims as misinformation or an excuse for poor ticket sales. The situation highlights a broader climate of uncertainty for performers, as foreign artists also face increasing logistical and financial hurdles in securing U.S. work visas.</p>

          <p>A jury has acquitted a Los Angeles protester, Brayan Ramos-Brito, of misdemeanor assault charges against a U.S. border patrol agent. The verdict is a setback for federal prosecutors, as the case was the first to go to trial following a series of demonstrations against immigration raids. The defense successfully cast doubt on the credibility of the agents' testimony, particularly that of a senior border patrol chief who was the only witness to claim he saw the assault. Video evidence presented in court showed an agent forcefully shoving the defendant but did not capture the alleged assault, and discrepancies in official reports were highlighted during the trial.</p>

          <p>Ted Leonsis, owner of Washington's Capitals, Wizards, and Mystics, expressed his continued desire to acquire the city's MLB and MLS teams to integrate them into his Monumental Sports & Entertainment platform. Leonsis believes that by plugging the Nationals and D.C. United into his company's centralized system for ticketing, sponsorship, and media, the teams would become more competitive. Despite previous unsuccessful bids, he remains committed to building his sports empire exclusively within the D.C. area, arguing this regional focus creates efficiencies and value that would be lost by acquiring teams in other cities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer successfully navigated President Trump's state visit without major diplomatic incidents, maintaining a cordial tone despite policy differences on issues like Palestinian statehood. However, an analysis suggests that while the visit strengthened personal ties, it is unlikely Starmer changed Trump's thinking on key global issues such as the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. Trump remained firm in his positions, focusing on the release of hostages in Gaza and expressing disappointment in Vladimir Putin but offering no new strategy. The primary success for Starmer appears to be reinforcing the UK-U.S. relationship while avoiding open conflict.</p>

          <p>Following the recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has seen a modest decrease. A new $50,000 home equity loan with a 15-year term now has an average monthly payment of about $487, down slightly from approximately $493 at the start of 2025. While the savings are not dramatic, they can accumulate significantly over the life of the loan. With U.S. homeowners holding record levels of equity, these loans remain an affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American higher education has long been torn between three competing functions: providing cultural formation, preparing students for careers, and advancing academic research. This tension dates back to the late 19th century, when figures like Harvard President Charles W. Eliot pushed to modernize the traditional, classics-focused college curriculum to include more practical, career-oriented training. This shift was met with resistance from traditionalists who feared the loss of a liberal arts focus on "culture." The subsequent rise of the research university further oriented institutions around faculty scholarship, creating the complex, often contradictory system that exists today.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with prosecutors from seven states, has filed a lawsuit against Live Nation and its subsidiary Ticketmaster, accusing them of facilitating illegal ticket scalping. The complaint alleges that the companies enable brokers to buy large quantities of tickets, which are then resold at inflated prices, costing consumers billions. The suit also claims Ticketmaster engages in deceptive "bait-and-switch" pricing and privately benefits from the broker system it publicly condemns. This legal action follows a separate Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit filed in May that accused the companies of monopolizing the live entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>The first migrant has been deported from the UK to France under a new pilot agreement aimed at deterring small boat crossings of the English Channel. An Indian national was flown to Paris on Thursday as part of the "one in, one out" deal, where the UK can return one migrant for each one it accepts via a new legal route. The deportation proceeded despite ongoing legal challenges against the scheme, including a High Court case for another migrant scheduled for removal. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood called the flight an important first step in securing the UK's borders.</p>
