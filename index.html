          <p>This article examines popular health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting seven to nine hours of sleep, and exercising 150 minutes weekly. Experts offer varied perspectives, with some arguing that rigid adherence to numbers isn't always necessary, as the body has natural cues for needs like thirst. However, others emphasize the significant long-term health benefits of meeting targets for sleep and physical activity, suggesting that while flexibility is key, these guidelines provide a valuable framework for a healthy lifestyle. The consensus is to incorporate a holistic approach rather than fixating on achieving every single target.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on health topics unique to female athletes that were previously overlooked. Researchers are studying how breast biomechanics and proper sports bras can impact performance, potentially adding a mile to a marathon runner's time. The article also explores the complex, individualized effects of the menstrual cycle on athletic ability and the psychological burden it can create. Additionally, it examines why female athletes have a higher risk for certain injuries, like ACL tears, and how targeted training could mitigate these risks, moving away from treating them as "mini-men."</p>

          <p>A family has filed a lawsuit against two funeral homes after they were allegedly given their deceased son's brain in an unmarked cardboard box that subsequently leaked in their car. The parents, Lawrence and Abbey Butler, describe the horrific experience of discovering the box's contents, which they say has marred their memory of their son. The lawsuit accuses the funeral homes in Georgia and Pennsylvania of negligent mishandling of human remains and inflicting severe emotional distress.

          <p>Following his dismissal from "MasterChef," former host Gregg Wallace has publicly apologized to anyone he may have offended but denied more severe allegations, stating he is "not a groper, a sex pest or a flasher." The dismissal came after an independent inquiry upheld 45 claims against him, including inappropriate language and one instance of unwelcome physical contact. In an interview, Wallace attributed some of his behavior to his background and a recent autism diagnosis, while also defending his former co-host, John Torode, against accusations of racism.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has been cut short after President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, blamed Hamas for a lack of good faith, prompting the US and Israeli teams to return home for consultations. The talks have been deadlocked over Hamas's demand for a full Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war in exchange for releasing all hostages. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is deteriorating, with the UN and UNICEF reporting that children are starving to death and facing acute malnutrition at alarming rates, as aid delivery remains severely restricted.</p>

          <p>As the UN warns of a deepening starvation crisis in Gaza, BBC Verify has examined the contents of aid boxes distributed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The boxes primarily contain dried goods like pasta and lentils, which require scarce water and fuel to prepare, along with some ready-to-eat items. While the GHF claims a box can feed a family for several days, nutrition experts have raised serious concerns, stating the diet is deficient in key vitamins and minerals. They describe it as a "first aid" basket that, over time, could lead to "hidden hunger" and other serious health problems.</p>

The national debt currently stands at over $36 trillion, and while public donations have historically been a small drop in the bucket, the move to include Venmo offers a more accessible way for people to contribute.

          <p>A federal appeals judge has maintained a block on President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally or temporarily. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin ruled that the nationwide injunction he previously issued will stand, citing an exception to a recent Supreme Court decision that limited such broad injunctions. The Trump administration has argued that these children are not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the U.S. and thus not entitled to citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

          <p>A worldwide craze for matcha, the powdered Japanese green tea, is causing demand to skyrocket and leading to supply shortages and price increases. Fueled by social media trends and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, matcha is now a popular ingredient in everything from lattes to doughnuts globally. However, record heatwaves in Japan have damaged tea crops, and an aging farmer population exacerbates the supply issue. This has led retailers to limit purchases and has also prompted discussions about mindful consumption, encouraging the use of lower-grade matcha for cooking to preserve the high-grade product for traditional tea preparation.</p>

          <p>An app named Tea, which allows women to review men they have dated and warn others about negative experiences, has surpassed major apps like ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store. The platform functions as a large, centralized community forum for women to vet potential dates, offering features like background checks and verification to ensure users are women. While praised by some researchers for prioritizing safety in a market where it's often an afterthought, the app has also faced concerns about the potential for false information and recently experienced a data breach.</p>

          <p>Bill Essayli, the interim U.S. attorney for the Los Angeles region, has drawn criticism for what many see as a highly partisan tenure, aggressively advancing the Trump administration's agenda. The former Republican assemblyman has used his office to challenge California's sanctuary city and transgender athlete policies, and has pursued charges against pro-immigration protesters. His leadership has been marked by mass departures of career prosecutors, who cite a belligerent management style and pressure to file politically motivated cases. While supporters praise his zealousness, critics and some federal judges express concern over his partisanship and controversial legal tactics.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight bound for Las Vegas suddenly descended approximately 500 feet shortly after takeoff from Burbank, an evasive maneuver to avoid a potential collision with another aircraft. Passengers described moments of terror as the plane went into a brief "free fall," causing people to scream and feel themselves lift from their seats. Flight data shows the plane dropped to avoid a jet that was at a similar altitude and on an opposing flight path over the Angeles National Forest. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, which is the latest in a series of recent aviation safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese citizens are participating in a large-scale and controversial recall vote, known as the "dabamian," targeting over 30 opposition lawmakers accused of being overly sympathetic to China. The movement was initiated by civic groups following months of political deadlock, where the opposition-dominated legislature blocked bills from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Pro-recall activists believe the opposition Kuomintang party is being influenced by Beijing, a charge the party denies. The vote has the potential to shift the balance of power in the legislature and has deeply divided Taiwanese society.</p>

          <p>The troubled New Orleans jail, which saw ten inmates escape in May, has mistakenly released another detainee due to a clerical error. Authorities stated that deputies failed to properly verify an inmate's identity while processing a bond, releasing 30-year-old Khalil Bryan instead of the correct individual. The sheriff's office has taken full responsibility for the "unacceptable lapse," which occurred as it faces intense criticism for the recent mass jailbreak. The district attorney's office highlighted the incident as evidence of "ongoing systemic issues" at the facility, which has been under federal monitoring for years.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life for murdering her two children in Idaho, has been sentenced to two additional consecutive life sentences in Arizona. An Arizona judge found her guilty of conspiring with her late brother to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019, and of conspiring to kill her niece's ex-husband in a separate failed attempt. Prosecutors argued the motives were financial gain and her desire to be with her current husband, Chad Daybell, using "twisted" religious beliefs as justification. Before sentencing, victims' family members gave emotional statements detailing the devastation her actions caused.</p>

Recent legal rulings have entitled anyone who served as a retained firefighter between April 2000 and April 2006 to a pension for their entire career. The payments, which can range from thousands to over £100,000, require individuals to "buy back" their contributions, but this is often deducted from the final lump sum.
