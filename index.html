          <h2>Retired Police Dogs May Need Pensions to Cover Medical Costs, Advocates Say</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 01:12:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A charity is advocating for pensions for retired police dogs to assist with their often complicated and costly medical needs. Many of these dogs face chronic health issues and injuries resulting from their service, with annual costs averaging around £3,000 more than typical dogs. One dog owner spent an estimated £12,000 caring for three retired service animals, including vet bills and special care. Some fear that without financial support, potential adopters may be deterred, leading to ethical concerns such as euthanasia, but Nottinghamshire Police announced in 2013 it would start paying pensions to its retiring dogs. </p>

          <p>E-commerce giants Shein and Temu have experienced a significant decrease in U.S. demand, attributed to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the end of the 'de minimis' trade loophole. Temu's daily active users in the U.S. fell by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein's declined by 25%. These drops are also reflected in lower rankings on the Apple App Store for both platforms. The decline in user engagement coincides with a reduction in U.S. advertising spending by both companies following the tariff announcements, which ended the exemption for low-cost goods under $800.</p>

          <p>Automotive industry groups are expressing concerns over a potential rare earth shortage due to China's export restrictions on these materials. Several European auto supplier plants and production lines have already been shut down, with warnings of more outages as inventories deplete. China imposed these restrictions in response to U.S. President Trump's tariff increases on Beijing's products, affecting vital components for both combustion engines and electric vehicles. While some export license applications have been approved, it's not enough to ensure smooth production, leading to calls for German and EU lawmakers to address the issue with China.

          <p>Japanese police investigated a record number of stalking cases in 2024, with over 1,300 incidents, prompting increased coordination between local stations and prefectural headquarters. The rise follows the discovery of Asahi Okazaki's body, a 20-year-old who had reported abuse from her former partner, leading to added emphasis on stalking cases. In response, authorities issued a record 2,415 restraining orders and revised statistical methods to include all relevant cases, regardless of when consultation occurred. Under Japan's anti-stalking law, repeat offenders face imprisonment or fines, with stricter penalties for ignoring warnings or restraining orders.</p>

          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims from the Boeing 737 Max crashes has criticized the deal between Boeing and the US Justice Department as "morally repugnant." Boeing agreed to pay $1.1 billion to avoid prosecution over two fatal crashes that killed 346 people, including $444.5 million to the victims' families. The agreement allows Boeing to sidestep true criminal accountability, according to the lawyer, Sanjiv Singh. The crashes in 2018 and 2019 were linked to faulty flight control systems, and Boeing previously admitted deception over hiding information from safety officials.</p>

          <p>The rise of decentralized solar power, largely driven by cheap Chinese solar panels, is creating a disruption in Pakistan's energy market. A Pakistani think tank suggests that China should play a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition, setting an example for other countries in the Global South. The influx of Chinese solar panels is undercutting demand for power from coal-fired plants that China helped finance, leading to stranded assets. Pakistan has become the second-largest destination for Chinese solar panels due to its zero tax rate on imports, but a Chinese energy scholar questions whether this vision is too expensive.</p>

The memo alleges that Biden's aides abused the power of presidential signatures to effect radical policy shifts while shielding the public from his diminished mental state. Trump claims Biden suffered from serious cognitive decline and that advisors restricted his media appearances and scripted conversations to cover up his inability to discharge his duties.

For the past three decades, the Italian state has been tightening up its citizenship rules so that fewer and fewer are eligible. By relaxing the rules on naturalisation, Italians would be recognising the dignity and diversity of millions more of their should-be-compatriots, and enriching their own national story with new protagonists in the process. The government seems to be hoping that fewer than 50% of Italians will turn up to the polls, that the referendum will not reach quorum and that the organisers will be humiliated for their efforts.</p>

          <p>The Education Department has warned that Columbia University's accreditation is at risk due to alleged violations of federal antidiscrimination laws. The department's civil rights office notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education that Columbia was out of compliance, citing a failure to address antisemitism on campus after the October 7 attack against Israel by Hamas. The department accuses the university's leadership of acting with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students. Losing accreditation would mean Columbia would be ineligible to offer federal financial aid to students, and Columbia says they are committed to combating antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden’s actions as president, alleging top aides masked his predecessor’s “cognitive decline”. The investigation will build on a Republican-led campaign already under way to discredit the former president and overturn some of his executive actions, including pardons and federal rules issued towards the end of his term in office. The administration’s investigation will focus on “who ran the United States while President Biden was in office”, and Trump directed Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and David Warrington, the White House counsel, to handle the investigation. GOP lawmakers are seeking testimony from Biden’s top aides and advisors regarding his mental and physical faculties.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation banning travelers from 12 countries and partially restricting travelers from seven others, starting on Monday, June 9. The White House cited the need to protect the United States from terrorist attacks and other national security threats, stating that the affected countries lacked adequate screening and vetting capabilities. The full ban applies to foreign nationals from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The partial ban applies to people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.</p>
