          <p>At least seven people died and 31 were injured after a highway bridge collapsed onto railway tracks in the Bryansk region of Russia, near the Ukraine border, bringing down several heavy trucks onto a moving passenger train.

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a strategic defense review with plans to invest Â£6bn in national security, signaling Britain's readiness to combat potential threats from hostile states. The review is expected to highlight an increased danger from Russia and China, leading to the creation of new defense factories and 1,800 jobs across the UK. The investment will support the procurement of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons, addressing deficiencies highlighted by the war in Ukraine. The move aims to strengthen the armed forces and deter future conflicts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Simon Tisdall argues that Donald Trump's aggressive yet weak approach to China, characterized by punitive tariffs and a lack of commitment to defending Taiwan, increases the likelihood of conflict. Trump's actions, seen as attempts to undermine China's economic stability, could provoke President Xi Jinping to take drastic measures to unify Taiwan with the mainland. The author suggests that Trump's policies, driven by self-interest and fear, create a vulnerable situation in which China might test the U.S.'s resolve to defend Taiwan.</p>

She shares stories of patients who, facing death, realize the importance of reconciling the life they have with the one they longed for. Instead of outlandish bucket lists, people often seek to mend relationships, express love, and find meaning in ordinary moments.
