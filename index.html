          <p>A recent report from Brown Harris Stevens reveals that more than one-third of Manhattan condo resales between mid-2024 and mid-2025 were sold for a loss, with the median price per square foot remaining stagnant over the last decade. This trend, dubbed Manhattan's "lost decade," contrasts sharply with national home price increases and is exacerbated when considering inflation, transaction costs, and renovations. While the luxury market (sales over $10 million) has seen profits due to cash-heavy buyers and Wall Street performance, the broader market's weakness is attributed to factors like tax deduction caps.

Starting by flipping a single cell phone on eBay, Senko grew his operation by meticulously studying brands and market trends, eventually focusing on pre-owned clothing. In 2023, he pivoted from individual online sales to a wholesale model, selling bulk used clothing to other resellers, which generated over $6.5 million in revenue in 2024 with a significant profit margin.</p>

          <p>A certified child life specialist and licensed therapist advises parents on how to say "no" in ways that foster connection and teach valuable life skills rather than creating conflict. The article suggests turning "no" into a teachable moment by providing alternatives, explaining the reasoning behind safety and kindness-based rules, and offering choices to give children a sense of autonomy. Consistency in enforcing boundaries is crucial for building trust and predictability, and parents are encouraged to repair interactions after reacting emotionally, ensuring limits and connection coexist.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has informed a court of its intention to deport Salvadoran immigrant Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the West African nation of Liberia, following an agreement with that country. Abrego Garcia was previously mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite a court order barring his removal there, and his case has drawn significant attention. His attorneys have condemned the move as punitive and cruel, noting that Costa Rica has offered him refuge, while DHS maintains that Liberia is a safe and democratic partner.</p>

Liautaud, who sold his majority stake in 2016, emphasizes that success in entrepreneurship demands a "grinder" mentality, a perspective shared by other successful figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk in their early careers.</p>

The work captures Maar near the end of her tumultuous relationship with Picasso, and its vivid colors were a surprise to experts who had only seen it in a black-and-white photograph.</p>

Wambach believes that allowing children to engage with coaches and teammates independently fosters self-starting qualities, and advises that during games, parents should focus on praising acts of leadership and good sportsmanship rather than performance outcomes.</p>

          <p>An opinion article criticizes President Trump's sudden demolition of the historic 123-year-old East Wing of the White House to build a new $300 million ballroom, a project proceeding without initial permits or public input. The author suggests the move is driven by Trump's ego and a desire to leave a personal monument, noting that major corporations and defense contractors are reportedly among the private donors funding the project. The piece also speculates whether the large-scale construction project signals Trump's intention to challenge the 22nd amendment and seek a third term, urging vigilance against underestimating his ambitions.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant drop in the number of active serial killers in the U.S. since their peak in the 1970s, public fascination with them persists, fueled by true-crime entertainment and social media speculation. Recent rumors of serial killers in cities like Austin and Boston have been debunked by authorities, who point to non-criminal causes. Experts attribute the real-world decline in serial killings to factors like the disappearance of hitchhiking, advances in DNA technology, and widespread surveillance, which often lead to quicker captures. The article suggests that society's need for "monsters" helps define moral boundaries and serves as a canvas for projecting societal fears and anxieties.</p>

          <p>In her first UK interview since losing the 2024 election, former Vice President Kamala Harris told the BBC that she might run for president again, stating it is "possibly" in her future. Harris, who is promoting her book about the campaign, dismissed unfavorable polls and affirmed her commitment to public service, declaring, "I am not done." She also strongly criticized President Trump, labeling him a "tyrant" and asserting that her campaign warnings about his authoritarian tendencies and weaponization of federal agencies have been proven correct.</p>

          <p>Although recent AI advancements like OpenAI's Sora 2 video generator have caused panic in Hollywood over potential job losses and copyright infringement, the technology's actual integration into the industry has been slow and challenging. Major studios like Disney have invested heavily in AI but have yet to see significant cost savings or efficiencies, running into legal ambiguities over copyright and technical hurdles in integrating AI into established production workflows. While AI is being used for some tasks like dubbing and animation, it has not yet replaced creative roles or delivered on its promise to revolutionize filmmaking, remaining more of a curiosity than an existential threat for now.</p>

The article notes that drug companies spent nearly $900 million on sports programming ads last year, targeting a captive audience that may be susceptible to persuasion. A medical expert from Johns Hopkins cautions that while these ads are legally required to state risks, their primary purpose is persuasion, potentially driving patient behavior and prescriptions in ways that even doctors may not fully realize.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has taken a nearly 5% stake in engineering and construction company Fluor, aiming to unlock the value of its significant holding in NuScale Power, a small modular nuclear reactor firm. Fluor's 39% stake in NuScale is valued at approximately $4.3 billion, representing over 60% of Fluor's market capitalization, yet the market appears to heavily discount Fluor's core business. Starboard is urging Fluor to monetize this investment, possibly through a sale or a tax-free spinoff, which could lead to a significant rerating of Fluor's stock and provide substantial returns for shareholders.

          <p>Voters in Ivory Coast went to the polls on Saturday for a presidential election in which 83-year-old incumbent Alassane Ouattara is favored to win a fourth term. Ouattara, who has presided over a period of economic growth, faces four other candidates, none of whom have the backing of a major political party. The election follows a tense run-up in which two of Ouattara's main rivals, Tidjane Thiam and former president Laurent Gbagbo, were barred from running, leading to protests and arrests. Over 40,000 security personnel were deployed to prevent a repeat of past election-related violence.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found that far-left terrorist plots and attacks outnumbered those from the far right in the first half of 2025, a reversal of a long-standing trend. However, the study has generated significant debate among counterterrorism experts, who caution that the low number of incidents (five left-wing vs. one right-wing) is too small to draw firm conclusions. Critics also highlight the subjective nature of classifying domestic terrorism and argue the report's most striking finding may actually be the sharp decline in right-wing attacks, while the overall data remains complex and contested.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing trade tensions, China has tightened its control over the global supply of rare earth elements, which are critical for high-tech industries like defense, renewable energy, and electric vehicles. China controls nearly 70% of mining and 90% of the processing of these materials, creating significant supply chain vulnerabilities for the U.S. and E.U. Efforts by Western countries to reduce this dependency have made little headway due to the immense technical, financial, and environmental challenges associated with establishing new processing and refining facilities that can compete with China's established infrastructure.</p>
