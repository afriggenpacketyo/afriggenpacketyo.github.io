          <p>A new Senate committee report on the assassination attempt against Donald Trump details significant security lapses by the U.S. Secret Service. The report, led by Senator Rand Paul, highlights at least ten denied or unfulfilled requests for additional security resources, including counter-snipers, prior to the Butler, Pennsylvania rally. It also accuses the former Secret Service director of providing false testimony to Congress regarding these denials and points to a pattern of communication failures and negligence that contributed to the preventable tragedy.</p>

A 15-year-old boy's body was recovered from the River Kelvin in Glasgow after a rescue operation. In other incidents, a 63-year-old woman died in a fall near a waterfall, a 39-year-old man was found in the River Tyne, and a 50-year-old man died after being pulled from Loch Lomond.

Buhari's political career was notable for his transition from a military ruler in the 1980s to a democratically elected president in 2015, serving two terms until 2023. His 2015 election victory over incumbent Goodluck Jonathan was widely regarded as a landmark moment for Nigerian democracy.

          <p>A multi-day heatwave in the United Kingdom is drawing to a close, with cooler temperatures and rain expected to arrive on Monday. However, amber heat-health alerts, signifying a likely rise in deaths and health service demand, are still in effect for southern and central England. The period of intense heat has also led to hosepipe bans for millions and an "extreme" wildfire warning across most of Scotland, underscoring the severe impacts of the weather event.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a defense of Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is facing criticism from some of his own supporters over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The frustration stems from a recent Justice Department memo which stated there was no evidence of a blackmail or "client list," contrary to the expectations of some conservative figures. In a social media post, Trump urged his followers to let Bondi do her job, highlighting a growing and public division within his political base.</p>

          <p>Tensions between FIFA and Fifpro, the global players' union, have escalated over concerns about player welfare and an increasingly crowded fixture calendar. Although FIFA recently announced its support for mandatory rest periods, Fifpro executives were reportedly excluded from the decision-making process, fueling the dispute. The conflict is underscored by a lawsuit filed by the union against FIFA, accusing the governing body of expanding competitions like the Club World Cup without proper consultation, thereby risking player health.</p>

          <p>Reports citing official records indicate that many buildings at Camp Mystic, where 27 children died in recent floods, had been removed from official high-risk flood maps years earlier. The camp, located by the Guadalupe River, had successfully appealed its original high-risk designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 2011. This revelation has raised profound questions about the risk assessment process and whether the tragedy could have been mitigated had the original, more cautious flood designations remained in place.</p>

          <p>A political columnist for New York Magazine has put forth a contrarian argument that the U.S. might be in a better political position today if Donald Trump had won the 2020 election. The writer, Ed Kilgore, suggests a Trump victory would have averted the January 6 Capitol riot and allowed the Democratic Party a clean slate for 2024, unburdened by the challenges of the Biden presidency. This alternative scenario, he argues, could have prevented Trump's 2024 political comeback and the current state of political polarization.</p>
