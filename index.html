          <p>The House Oversight Committee has released 33,295 pages of records related to Jeffrey Epstein, obtained from the Department of Justice via subpoena. While the release aims for transparency, Democratic members argue that approximately 97% of the documents were already public. The new information reportedly includes less than 1,000 pages of flight logs for Epstein's plane from 2000-2014. The committee's chairman, James Comer, has indicated an intent to expand the investigation following meetings with Epstein's victims, even as some representatives push for a more complete release of all files.</p>

          <p>Retired UFC star Jon Jones has been exonerated after New Mexico prosecutors dropped charges related to a traffic incident in February. The case was dismissed after Jones's legal team presented cell phone records proving he was not at the scene of the crash, arguing the accusation was falsely made by an intoxicated driver to avoid a DWI charge. Jones's attorney stated they were "fully vindicated" and are now reviewing the conduct of the Albuquerque Police Department during the investigation. Despite his retirement, Jones has hinted at a possible return to fighting in 2026.</p>

          <p>A senior UK police chief has stated that protests concerning the use of hotels to house asylum seekers are placing forces under "chronic pressure." Chief Constable Gavin Stephens noted a significant increase in protests this summer compared to previous years, often requiring officers to be pulled from other duties to manage demonstrations. He called on public leaders to help reduce tensions rather than sow division, highlighting concerns about misinformation spreading on social media. Local councils are now appealing for restraint from protesters to ease the strain on communities and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled to reinstate Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat who was fired by President Donald Trump. In a 2-1 decision, the court affirmed that FTC commissioners can only be removed by a president for cause, citing nearly a century of legal precedent. The ruling allows Slaughter to immediately return to her role at the agency, which is responsible for enforcing consumer protection and antitrust laws.

          <p>A jury has cleared rapper Cardi B of all liability in a $24 million civil lawsuit brought by a security guard who alleged assault and battery. The plaintiff, Emani Ellis, claimed the rapper scratched and spat on her during a 2018 confrontation outside a doctor's office while Cardi B was pregnant. The rapper testified that while a heated verbal exchange occurred, she never physically touched the guard, a version of events supported by witnesses. After less than an hour of deliberation, the jury found in favor of the artist, who stated outside the courthouse that she would deny the charges "on my deathbed."</p>

Benioff attributed the layoffs to increased efficiencies from the company's "Agentforce" of AI customer service bots, which have decreased the number of support cases. This move comes after the company announced that AI is performing up to 50% of its work. While some analysts see this as a trend affecting multiple industries, others argue that tech companies are using AI as a justification for correcting over-hiring during the pandemic to appear more efficient to investors.</p>

Only hand-picked dignitaries and officials will attend, in what experts describe as a "stage-managed performance of total control" designed to project an image of perfection and power.

However, the NAO stated the MoD failed to provide sufficient evidence for this figure and did not properly track spending for the new scheme.

The U.S. Geological Survey noted that lava is emerging from multiple vents, driven by magma accumulating in a lower chamber.

          <p>Zack Polanski's landslide victory as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales signals a potential shift in UK left-wing politics. His blunt, digitally-savvy communication style presents a new challenge for the Labour Party, which is already facing pressure from other factions on the left. The analysis questions how Polanski's brash, left-wing approach will resonate with the party's more traditional, rural supporters who previously backed his rivals. There is also potential for conflict or collaboration with a new party being formed by Jeremy Corbyn, as both could be competing for the same voter base.</p>

          <p>Director Woody Allen is facing criticism after describing President Trump as "polite" and "a pleasure to work with" during an appearance on Bill Maher's "Club Random" podcast. Allen, who cast Trump in a 1998 film, praised his acting ability and professionalism on set, comments which Trump later shared on his social media platform. The article's author condemns both Allen and Maher for normalizing a president who, the author argues, operates like a dictator. Allen did clarify that he disagrees with Trump on nearly all political issues and voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.</p>

          <p>Walfredo de los Reyes Sr., an internationally acclaimed Cuban percussionist with a career spanning over six decades, has died at the age of 92. Known for his signature style of playing a drum kit and percussion instruments simultaneously, he was a pioneering figure who blended Cuban and American influences. Throughout his career, he performed alongside Latin music icons like Tito Puente and American stars such as Tony Bennett and Sammy Davis Jr. His sons, both professional drummers, remembered him not only as a musical mentor but also as a generous person who was a "Superman" to his family.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court of Brazil has started deliberations in the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of plotting a coup to retain power after his 2022 election defeat. Prosecutors allege that Bolsonaro and seven others participated in an "armed criminal association" that sought to "violently overthrow the democratic order," culminating in the January 8, 2023 storming of government buildings. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face over 40 years in prison. Presiding Justice Alexandre de Moraes described the plot as an attempt to establish a dictatorship, emphasizing that the court will remain inflexible in defending Brazil's democracy.</p>

          <p>This article examines President Trump's repeated claim that he has ended six or seven wars and deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. The White House identified seven conflicts, including those between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and India and Pakistan. Foreign policy experts interviewed for the article state that while the administration has helped broker ceasefires and normalize relations in some cases, many of the situations were not full-scale wars and several conflicts remain unresolved. Experts credit Trump with applying pressure that led to some agreements but describe the declaration of settled wars as premature.</p>

The after-tax value of the prize varies significantly by state, with winners in states like Florida and Texas taking home the most due to no state income tax on winnings. Conversely, a winner in New York would receive the lowest payout after taxes. The data also reveals the most and least frequently drawn numbers over the last 100 drawings, although lottery officials emphasize that each draw is a random event with odds of winning the jackpot at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan for allegedly "inciting violence" has intensified the debate over free speech in Europe. Linehan, a vocal critic of transgender activism, was arrested over social media posts, including one suggesting that if all else fails, a trans-identified male in a female-only space should be punched. The article argues that this action is symptomatic of a broader chill on speech, where illiberal hate-speech laws are selectively enforced by police. The author suggests such laws give authorities wide discretionary power and create a perception of "two-tier justice."</p>

The public spat has included visa revocations and sharp rhetoric from both sides. However, despite the governmental friction, some analysts and activists argue that it is largely "business as usual" behind the scenes. Pro-Palestinian groups point out that Australia continues to supply components for Israeli F-35 fighter jets and has not imposed stronger sanctions, suggesting the shift is more symbolic than substantive.</p>

This situation reflects the broader crisis in the downtown L.A. office market, which is struggling with high vacancy rates due to the rise of remote work and elevated interest rates.

He warns that placing soldiers in situations where they must interact with civilians in crisis risks an escalation that could erode the crucial trust between the military and the public.
