          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction preventing the Trump administration from using National Guard and military troops for domestic law enforcement activities in California. The ruling, which the administration can appeal, found that the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. Judge Charles Breyer's decision specifically cited actions like arrests and crowd control as unlawful uses of the military. The ruling comes amid President Trump's consideration of similar deployments in other U.S. cities to address crime.</p>

The court denied her bail, citing a flight risk, and she will remain in custody as negotiations for a potential plea bargain continue.

The cash value for a potential single winner of Wednesday's drawing is approximately $589 million before taxes. This marks the 41st consecutive drawing without a jackpot winner since the last grand prize was claimed in California on May 31.</p>

Many of the victims were people displaced by Sudan's ongoing civil war who had sought refuge in the mountainous area. The region, controlled by the neutral Sudan Liberation Movement-Army, had seen a population surge as civilians fled fighting and famine elsewhere. The disaster compounds an already severe humanitarian crisis, with aid delivery severely hampered by the conflict and seasonal rains.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, financial experts advise savers to consider locking in current Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates before they decline. They suggest strategies such as CD laddering, which involves opening multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates to balance returns with access to funds. Another recommendation is to explore no-penalty CDs, which offer more flexibility for withdrawals despite slightly lower rates. Experts also stress the importance of not locking up too much cash in long-term CDs and shopping around at different financial institutions for the best terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to pay 0% on long-term capital gains, thanks to new tax deductions in President Trump's latest bill. The 0% rate applies to investors below certain taxable income thresholds, which more people may now fall under. This allows for "tax-gain harvesting," a strategy of selling profitable assets without incurring taxes, which can be used to rebalance portfolios or reset an asset's cost basis for future tax savings. The higher standard deduction and other new tax breaks are key factors that could expand eligibility for this tax bracket in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

The company attributes this pullback to concerns over immigration policies and potential job losses, impacting a key demographic that accounts for about half of its beer sales.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields jumped as a federal court ruling deemed most of the Trump administration's tariffs illegal, raising the possibility that the government may have to refund billions of dollars. This prospect could worsen the U.S. fiscal situation, potentially requiring a surge in Treasury issuance to cover the cost. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose above 4.27%, while the 30-year bond yield surpassed 4.96%. The concern is that the loss of expected tariff revenue would significantly increase the federal budget deficit, putting pressure on government finances.</p>
