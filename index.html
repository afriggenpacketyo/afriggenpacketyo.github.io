          <p>Germany's parliament voted to exempt defense spending from its strict debt rules, enabling a substantial increase in defense and infrastructure investment. This significant shift in German policy is partly driven by concerns about potential shifts in US foreign policy and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
