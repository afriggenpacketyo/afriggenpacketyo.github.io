        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has approved the $8 billion merger between Skydance Media and Paramount Global, a major step toward finalizing the deal. This approval allows for the transfer of 28 CBS television station licenses to the new entity. The deal moved forward after Paramount settled a legal dispute with Donald Trump and Skydance committed to changes at CBS, including promises of unbiased journalism and ending diversity initiatives. The merger combines Skydance's modern studio with Paramount's historic media assets, including Paramount Pictures, CBS, and various cable networks.</p>

          <p>Following France's announcement of its intent to recognize Palestinian statehood, the German government stated it has no short-term plans to do the same. Berlin emphasized its commitment to a negotiated two-state solution, viewing formal recognition as a final step in that process. The government highlighted more urgent priorities, including a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages, and addressing the severe humanitarian crisis. The article also covers a Doctors Without Borders report accusing Israel of deliberately starving Palestinians and a USAID analysis finding no evidence of systematic aid theft by Hamas.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is undertaking a five-day trip to Scotland, where he will visit his golf resorts and meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. A key topic for discussion is the U.S.-U.K. trade agreement, with plans to refine the "Economic Prosperity Deal" signed in June. The visit also holds personal significance for Trump, whose mother was Scottish, and he is expected to visit a memorial at his Aberdeen resort. Police in Scotland have implemented significant security measures in anticipation of protests during his stay.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers in Maui have advanced a bill to phase out thousands of short-term vacation rentals to increase the supply of long-term housing for local residents. The measure aims to address a critical housing shortage that was severely worsened by the 2023 Lahaina wildfire. If passed, the bill would require many condo owners in apartment zones to rent their units for a minimum of 180 days. While supporters believe this will provide much-needed homes for locals, opponents argue it could harm the local economy and small businesses that service the tourism industry.</p>

The federal funds rate, currently between 4.25% and 4.5%, influences borrowing costs for consumers on products like credit cards and loans.

          <p>Finland's Lapland region is experiencing an unprecedented heatwave, with temperatures consistently hovering around 30°C (86°F), breaking historical records. The extreme heat is impacting local life, tourism, and wildlife, including the region's famed reindeer, which are fleeing to roads to escape mosquitoes thriving in the warm weather. Scientists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such heatwaves to climate change, noting the Arctic is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet.

The authors argue that such claims are often based on cherry-picked anecdotes and a tendency to over-attribute human-like intentions to AI behavior in contrived experimental settings. Drawing a parallel to flawed 1970s research on ape language, they call for more rigorous analysis to distinguish between an AI's *capability* to perform a malicious act and an inherent *propensity* to do so.

          <h2>California Democrats Consider Partisan Redistricting to Counter GOP Efforts in Texas</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democratic leaders in California, including Governor Gavin Newsom, are considering a move to abandon the state's independent redistricting commission in favor of partisan map-drawing. This potential "gerrymandering arms race" is a direct response to Republican efforts in Texas to redraw congressional districts to their advantage. The move would likely require a statewide ballot measure and could significantly reduce the number of Republican-held seats in California's congressional delegation. The proposal has sparked a debate about political retaliation versus upholding nonpartisan reforms designed to make elections fairer for voters.</p>

          <p>For undocumented communities in Southern California, the fear of immigration enforcement raids is compounding the dangers of extreme heat. Many individuals are avoiding breaks, working longer hours, or forgoing work entirely, increasing their risk of heat-related illness. Families are confining themselves to their homes to avoid detection, often without adequate air conditioning due to cost, and are avoiding public cooling centers. This isolation and fear are creating impossible choices between physical safety from the heat and the risk of deportation, highlighting a dangerous intersection of climate change and immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison has proposed a new program to directly compensate victims of the deadly Eaton fire, aiming to provide swift payments and avoid lengthy litigation. The plan has drawn skepticism from victims' lawyers, who warn it may lead to lower compensation and require waiving legal rights without the utility admitting fault. However, some state officials and consumer advocates see potential merit, as it could reduce legal fees and lessen the strain on the state's wildfire insurance fund. The utility has yet to release full details, leaving many victims with unanswered questions about the program's fairness.</p>

          <p>Despite a 2019 state law requiring cities to analyze their evacuation route capacity, the city of Los Angeles has not publicly reported such an analysis, raising concerns about its preparedness for a fast-moving wildfire. The law, passed after the deadly 2018 Camp fire, is meant to ensure roads can handle a mass exodus. Fire safety advocates criticize both the city and L.A. County for failing to meet the law's requirements, which could leave residents vulnerable in a worst-case scenario. The lack of transparent planning highlights a potential gap between legislative intent and local government implementation for critical public safety measures.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece posits that Donald Trump's engagement in seemingly trivial culture war battles, such as demanding Coca-Cola use cane sugar, is a calculated political strategy. The author argues that Trump taps into a powerful sense of nostalgia and loss among many Americans who feel their cultural touchstones have been taken away by progressivism. These small fights reinforce his bond with his base, making them feel seen and defended. This emotional connection, the article concludes, allows him to launch more serious attacks on democratic norms and institutions while retaining their support.</p>

          <p>Six months after the devastating Eaton fire in Altadena, California, officials have confirmed the discovery of human remains in a previously uncleared lot, bringing the fire's death toll to 19. The remains are believed to be those of 74-year-old Juan Francisco Espinoza, who lived alone and was reported missing by neighbors. The discovery has renewed scrutiny of the delayed evacuation orders for that part of west Altadena, which residents received nearly 12 hours after the fire started. The slow process of searching the debris highlights the long-lasting and tragic aftermath of the disaster.</p>

          <p>A recent study from the University of Chicago explored human reactions to robots with different personalities, finding that people generally enjoy interacting with extroverted robots the most. However, the experiment also revealed that a robot programmed with a neurotic personality was perceived as more human-like and relatable. Participants described the neurotic bot, which expressed anxiety and tentativeness, as seeming to understand deep emotions. While most robotics research has focused on positive, confident traits for service roles, this study suggests that neuroticism could be useful in specific applications, like for a robot comedian.</p>

          <p>Three miners have been successfully rescued after being trapped for two days following a mine collapse in northern British Columbia, Canada. The workers were caught behind a large pile of debris at the Red Chris mine but were able to shelter in an underground refuge chamber equipped with food, water, and ventilation. The mine operator, Newmont, confirmed the men were safe and in good health upon their rescue Thursday night. Production at the copper and gold mine was suspended during the rescue operation, and a full investigation into the collapse will be conducted.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are observing an increase in the formation of sinkholes globally and are linking the phenomenon to climate change. Sinkholes form when water erodes underground bedrock, and this process is being exacerbated by more extreme weather patterns. Intensified droughts lower the water table, weakening subterranean support, while subsequent heavy rainfall adds immense weight, causing the ground to collapse. This is particularly prevalent in "karst terrains" like those in Florida and Turkey. Experts are using technology to predict and mitigate these hazards, but the underlying climate drivers continue to pose a growing threat.</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in England have launched a five-day strike, demanding a "credible pay deal" for 2025-2026. The British Medical Association (BMA) argues that doctors' pay has been eroded by 20% in real terms since 2008 and is seeking full pay restoration. However, the government calls the strike "unreasonable," pointing to a 22% pay increase over the last two years and an additional 5.4% raise coming in August. The walkout is expected to cause significant disruption to the NHS, though hospitals have been asked to minimize cancellations of routine operations and appointments.</p>
