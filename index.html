          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates the UK will allocate 3% of its GDP to defence by 2034, according to the government's upcoming strategic defence review. This review assumes the 3% target will be met, influencing the affordability of planned measures. The review warns of emerging threats from drones and artificial intelligence, advocating for the deployment of digital experts alongside troops. Additional funding of over Â£1.5 billion will be directed towards improving military housing conditions, addressing urgent repairs and developing new housing to meet modern standards. Optimism that the spending target will be met allows for long-term planning in the face of growing pressures.</p>

          <p>Three women and two physicians have filed a lawsuit against a Kansas law that invalidates a pregnant woman's advance medical directive concerning end-of-life treatment. The lawsuit argues that the law violates rights to personal autonomy, privacy, equal treatment, and freedom of speech. The law requires physicians to provide pregnant patients with a lower standard of care, potentially exposing them to legal penalties. The plaintiffs seek to ensure that pregnant women's end-of-life decisions are respected and that physicians can provide ethical and appropriate care.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration is facing significant challenges with its tariff policies, despite the president's claim that "tariffs are easy." A New York court blocked his signature trade policy, leading to a legal battle that may reach the Supreme Court. The administration declared a national emergency to impose blanket tariffs, using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as legal justification. The court ruled that IEEPA does not authorize the tariff orders, causing confusion for businesses navigating the global economy.</p>
