          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a trade deal with China is complete, but it awaits final approval from both himself and President Xi Jinping. Trump highlighted that China will supply full magnets and necessary rare earths upfront, while the U.S. will provide agreed-upon concessions, including allowing Chinese students into American colleges and universities. Chinese state media reported an agreement on a trade "framework" reached during talks in London, though specific details were not immediately disclosed. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that this framework requires approval from both leaders, suggesting some concessions were made beyond the negotiating teams' authority.

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that consumer prices rose by 0.1% in May, which was less than anticipated.

Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also came in lower than expected at 0.1% and 2.8%.

          <p>President Trump declared that a U.S. trade deal with China is done, pending formal sign-off from himself and President Xi Jinping, following negotiations in London. The agreement aims to ease the trade war between the two largest economies, which had intensified recently due to Beijing's cut in rare earth element exports and the U.S.'s threat to revoke visas of Chinese students linked to the Communist Party. Under the deal, China will maintain its 10% tariffs on U.S. goods, while the U.S. will keep 55% tariffs on Chinese imports, with the U.S. seeking to resume and increase shipments of rare earths. The deal aims to alleviate trade tensions and promote positive trade relations between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's aggressive remarks against "communist China" at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore may not resonate well in Southeast Asia. Unlike European allies, Asian nations do not view China as an existential threat, given its role as their largest trading partner. Hegseth's assessment of an "imminent" China threat by 2027 contrasts with previous statements from his predecessor, Lloyd Austin. His remarks also raise questions about his understanding of Southeast Asian nations, given his past inability to name a single member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations during a confirmation hearing.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on the cultural gap between the Bay Area's existential concerns about AI and Washington, DC's more practical approach to AI regulation. The author argues that the proposed budget reconciliation bill fails to take AI seriously, potentially exacerbating its negative impacts. Key issues include a moratorium on state-level AI regulation, cuts to clean energy subsidies, and the imposition of work requirements on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. The author contends that these policies are ill-suited for a future where AI could displace a significant portion of the workforce.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk stated that he regrets some of his recent social media posts about President Donald Trump, admitting they "went too far." The feud between Musk and Trump had dissolved a close partnership that allowed Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, under Trump's second administration. The conflict was sparked by Musk's opposition to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill, which he claimed would undermine DOGE's work and increase the U.S. budget deficit. Trump had previously indicated he would not have a problem speaking with Musk despite the dispute.</p>

The U.S. and North Korea remain technically in a state of war, as the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.</p>

          <p>Former Taiwanese leader Ma Ying-jeou will lead a delegation to mainland China, despite warnings from Taiwanese authorities. Ma, a former chairman of Taiwanâ€™s main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), will lead a student visit and attend the Straits Forum in Xiamen. Taiwanâ€™s Mainland Affairs Council has criticized Maâ€™s decision, deeming it "inappropriate and inconsistent with his position." The DPP spokesman accused Ma of "playing along with" Beijingâ€™s show, adding that his visit would "put the Taiwanese people in an unjust situation."</p>

Farmers face challenges such as livestock losses and confusing regulations, leading to illegal killings of wolves and a sense of frustration. The article emphasizes the need for effective conflict-mitigation systems, honest communication, and acknowledging the needs of all stakeholders to achieve sustainable coexistence.</p>

          <p>The article explores whether pop music can predict economic downturns, particularly the phenomenon of "recession pop," referring to upbeat music from the Great Recession era. While some suggest that music reflects larger economic trends, others argue that the connection is tenuous and that the term "recession pop" is a recent invention. The analysis delves into the sounds and themes of the late-aughts and early 2010s, considering the broader context of the music industry and cultural shifts. Ultimately, the article suggests that attributing economic predictive power to pop music may be an oversimplification.</p>
