          <p>The UK and India have finalized a 'landmark' trade deal after three years of negotiations, designed to ease exports for UK firms like whisky and car manufacturers, while also reducing taxes on Indian clothing and footwear exports. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a significant boost to growth, forecasting an additional Â£25.5 billion in trade by 2040. The deal, celebrated by both nations, includes provisions for services and procurement, allowing British firms to compete for more contracts, and will eliminate social security payments for Indian employees on short-term visas. Once enacted, the trade deal is expected to lower tariffs on goods entering the UK from India, providing consumers with lower prices on certain items.</p>

          <p>Following an initial failed vote, the Bundestag elected Friedrich Merz as the new German chancellor in a second attempt. The first vote's failure was unprecedented, leading to discussions of a 'national crisis' within some commentaries, although CDU/CSU and SPD politicians are trying to downplay the dissent. Other parties, including the Greens, have declined to assist Merz in securing the chancellorship, asserting that the coalition partners must demonstrate their capacity to govern independently. The situation has created nervousness, with many avoiding questions about political responsibility and potential behind-the-scenes consequences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Proposed budget cuts to NASA by the Trump administration are causing concerns for the European Space Agency (ESA) due to potential impacts on international collaborations, particularly the Artemis moon program. ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher emphasized the importance of cooperation in space activities and stated that the ESA will assess the repercussions of the budget changes. The proposed cuts, which could remove approximately $6 billion from NASA's budget, signal a potential shift in priorities from the moon to Mars, potentially favoring programs pushed by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) program and Orion Spacecraft crew capsule could be dropped by 2027, with SpaceX's Starship rocket program potentially replacing them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge driven by speculation of pressure from Washington for currency strengthening. Despite the recent weakness, the Taiwanese dollar is still up over 8% this year against the greenback, while the U.S. dollar index is down by the same year to date. Experts suggest the currency moves were driven by exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging U.S. dollar debt. While Taiwan's central bank Governor Yang Chin-long refuted claims that exchange rates were part of U.S. trade negotiations, analysts remain skeptical, suggesting that currency rates may be part of broader trade discussions.</p>

          <p>The FBI has initiated 250 investigations into '764,' a violent online network that targets teenagers, coercing them into sexual and violent acts, including creating pornography, harming pets, and self-harm.

The network, viewed as a potential form of domestic terrorism, aims to 'sow chaos' and 'bring down society,' with members glorifying violence and mass casualty events.

Henry-Tenan was among the last people to see Maxwell, having spent time with her before her disappearance, and she wrote a news story about Maxwell every August for 21 years, reflecting the town's anticipation for a resolution in the case.

          <p>Experts warn of the serious consequences of missing payments on Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), including late fees, damaged credit scores, default risk, and potential foreclosure. With American homeowners holding near-record levels of home equity, many have opened HELOCs, making it crucial to understand the repercussions of missed payments. Missing payments can lead to late fees, significant drops in credit scores, and ultimately, foreclosure if the debt is not managed. Experts recommend homeowners contact their lenders immediately to explore options like deferred payments, modified payments, or forbearance to mitigate these risks. </p>

          <p>The article discusses the historical opposition of the right to American universities, tracing it back over a century. It argues that this opposition is rooted in the democratization of admissions and diversification of curriculum, which challenge the traditional exclusivity of higher education. The Maga movement, led by figures like JD Vance and Donald Trump, views universities as 'the enemy' and attacks campuses, professors, and students. The article contends that this is part of a longer history of right-wing backlash against efforts to make college more democratic and inclusive.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has announced additional staff layoffs, including at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), impacting approximately 200 employees. The layoffs surprised NIH officials, who had previously stated no further cuts were planned. The cuts include employees overseeing programs like the Cancer Information Service, which provides information to doctors and patients, and updates to databases for healthcare providers. HHS stated that the savings from these reductions will help redirect resources toward critical programs and strengthen the department's ability to serve the American people effectively.</p>

          <p>China's state broadcaster, CCTV, has provided a glimpse of the electromagnetic catapult system in action on the country's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian. The footage shows an unidentified aircraft hurtling along the deck, demonstrating the cutting-edge jet launch system. However, the report also suggested that the Fujian may require longer sea trials than China's other carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, due to the complexity of the launch system. The adoption of the electromagnetic catapult system means that the Fujian's carrier-based aircraft would take off with full fuel and ordnance.</p>

The vote highlights a potential fraying of Democratic unity in the face of intense lobbying and concerns about rising prices amid Trump's trade wars. Representative Lou Correa cited the expense and impracticality of electric vehicles in his district, while others worried about the impact on working-class constituents. The vote is seen as a setback for ambitious climate policies, with some states now reconsidering their adoption of California's ban.</p>

          <p>U.S. exports are experiencing a slump due to President Donald Trump's trade tariffs, impacting the agricultural sector and top farm products like soybeans, corn, and beef. Data shows a decline in U.S. exports, particularly to China, with ports like Portland and Tacoma experiencing significant decreases. Retailers are urging consumers to buy sooner rather than later, as data suggests a potential shortage of retail inventories in the coming months. The decline in vessel arrivals and lighter container volumes coming to the U.S. will translate into excess capacity of labor, trucks, and trains in the supply chain.</p>

The author argues that Trump seems to assume that cultural grievance and partisan backing will matter more than quiet economic competence and tangible results. The author says that within the first 100 days of his second term, 53 percent of Americans said that the economy had gotten worse since Trump took office, and 41 percent said that their own finances have taken a hit.</p>

          <p>States have long used taxes on hospitals and nursing homes to increase federal matching funds, a strategy now under scrutiny by congressional Republicans seeking steep federal spending reductions. This tactic, known as a Medicaid provider tax, allows states to inflate their Medicaid spending on paper and collect more matching funds from the federal government. Congressional Republicans are now considering curtailing or ending them as one way to achieve the steep federal spending reductions proposed in the House budget. If enacted, the change could disproportionately affect Republican-led states, which tend to rely more heavily on this financing mechanism.</p>
