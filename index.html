          <h2>Trade War Could Cause Retail Shortages for US Consumers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warnings of potential retail shortages have emerged as CEOs of major retail stores cautioned President Trump about the impact of a prolonged trade war with China. Apparel and footwear, heavily reliant on Chinese imports, are particularly vulnerable due to high tariff rates effectively acting as import bans. Experts suggest lower-end stores with lean inventories will be hit hardest, with toys, games, budget home goods, and apparel being the first to disappear from shelves. The situation's severity depends on the duration of high tariffs and companies' inventory strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff refuted a Politico report claiming they discussed lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets as part of Ukraine peace negotiations, labeling the anonymously sourced article as "totally fictitious." The report suggested Witkoff advocated for lifting sanctions, including on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, to facilitate a peace deal, while Rubio opposed the idea. Trump Jr. and other officials also criticized the report, while Politico stands by its reporting. The energy sector has been central to peace negotiations, with the U.S. proposing control of Ukraine's nuclear power plants and natural gas pipelines.</p>

          <p>Just Stop Oil (JSO), known for disruptive climate protests, announced its last ever protest due to new policing powers making operations nearly impossible. The group claims victory as its demand for no new oil and gas licenses is now government policy, although internal sources admit the crackdown on disruptive protests played a significant role. While some celebrate the end of disruptions, questions arise about the future of climate action and the movement's public image. Some activists are considering underground actions, while others explore legal avenues, such as using public nuisance laws against polluting companies.</p>
