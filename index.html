          <p>China's defense ministry announced it had warned and "drove away" the USS Higgins, an American destroyer, near the disputed Scarborough Shoal. Beijing accused the U.S. of illegally entering its territorial waters and undermining regional peace and stability. This incident elevates tensions in the valuable shipping lane, where China's expansive territorial claims conflict with international law and the interests of nations like the Philippines. The encounter occurs amid ongoing maritime friction and a broader trade dispute between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will be held at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. This large U.S. military installation, home to over 32,000 people, holds historical significance as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. The remote and militarily significant location, which houses advanced F-22 Raptor jets, was chosen for the high-stakes talks focused on the war in Ukraine. Some critics worry the Alaskan setting could be used by Putin to draw parallels between territorial transfers.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is publicly demanding that President Trump halt a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in Texas. Newsom has threatened that if the Texas plan proceeds, California will counter by redrawing its own maps to favor Democrats, potentially neutralizing any GOP gains. Using Trump's own social media style, Newsom's office issued taunting messages, warning of a national redistricting "arms race." This potential reversal of California's independent redistricting process has sparked debate about sacrificing principles for political advantage.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's Prime Minister, Christopher Luxon, stated that Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu has "lost the plot" regarding the conflict in Gaza. Luxon condemned the humanitarian situation, forceful displacement, and recent attacks as "utterly unacceptable," indicating his government is considering formal recognition of a Palestinian state. This strong criticism aligns New Zealand with other allies like Australia, Canada, and the UK, who are increasing pressure on Israel over its military actions. The comments came as protests occurred outside New Zealand's parliament, demanding more action in support of Palestine.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Nature Communications reveals that foreign-owned multinational enterprises were responsible for 25% of all corporate carbon emissions in China over a 20-year period. The research, led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, highlights a significant environmental burden associated with foreign investment. It also points to a geographical disparity, where wealthier eastern coastal regions reaped economic benefits while central and western inland areas faced heavier environmental consequences. The findings raise new questions about assessing carbon responsibility for global corporations operating within China.</p>

This economic threat has shattered the country's long-held sense of stability and political isolation, forcing a national identity crisis. The move has left the Swiss government scrambling for a response, as it highlights the vulnerability of its neutrality in an era of aggressive geoeconomics.</p>

          <p>The first direct air shipment of fresh Cambodian durians has arrived in China, marking a new "durian diplomacy" milestone between the two nations. This two-tonne shipment, transported via a four-hour cold chain logistics flight, allows Chinese consumers to enjoy the fruit at peak freshness. Durian is now the fifth fresh fruit from Cambodia approved for direct import into the large Chinese market, following products like bananas and mangoes. The move signifies strengthening agricultural ties and improved customs efficiency, although some industry insiders remain cautious about the fruit's commercial competitiveness.</p>

          <p>The meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, is a direct result of Trump's determined push to end the war in Ukraine. Having pledged to resolve the conflict quickly, Trump set a deadline for a ceasefire, which then evolved into this in-person summit. The location in Alaska, once Russian territory, adds a layer of historical resonance to the talks. While the White House has framed it as a "listening exercise," the meeting follows several unsuccessful rounds of negotiations and aims to pressure Putin into ending the war, though Ukraine's President Zelenskyy will not be present.</p>

The administration had frozen funds from the NSF, NIH, and Department of Energy, citing alleged discrimination at the university.

One such detainee, a father of three U.S. citizens, was sent to the facility after a simple traffic stop.

          <p>On the eve of his talks with Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reinforced his "friendship" with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In a call, Putin praised Pyongyang for its military support in the war against Ukraine, which has included soldiers, missiles, and artillery shells. This public reaffirmation highlights the deepening alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang, forged by Russia's isolation from the West. The war has made Russia increasingly reliant on North Korean labor and military aid, a partnership that adds a complex layer to Putin's upcoming diplomatic engagement.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to strengthen into the first hurricane of the season later this week. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, where it has already caused deadly flooding, and is moving west. Early models project Erin will become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands by the end of the week. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain, and its development marks a significant increase in Atlantic hurricane activity.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has made a surprise, unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to purchase the Google Chrome web browser. The offer comes after a U.S. judge in a major antitrust case ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly and the Justice Department proposed that Google be forced to divest Chrome. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, argues that moving Chrome to an independent operator would benefit the public. This move highlights the intense competition and strategic maneuvering within the AI and tech industries. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall cancer survival has doubled in the last 50 years, a new study reveals that progress has been starkly uneven across different types of the disease. Cancers like melanoma now have 10-year survival rates above 90%, thanks to advances in treatment and earlier detection. However, cancers that are harder to detect, such as pancreatic, esophageal, stomach, and lung cancer, have seen little improvement and maintain survival rates below 20%. This has widened the gap between the most and least survivable cancers, prompting calls for more targeted research.</p>

The poll highlights a potential shift in the city's political landscape, though leading centrist Democrats have not yet endorsed Mamdani. Meanwhile, in a hypothetical 2026 governor's race, a Republican challenger appears to be gaining ground on the incumbent.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a comprehensive review of the Smithsonian Institution's 19 museums to ensure their exhibits align with a "patriotic" and "unifying" narrative. In a letter to the Smithsonian, the White House stated the goal is to eliminate "improper, divisive or anti-American ideology" ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. The review will scrutinize everything from exhibition text to curatorial processes and will initially focus on eight major museums. This move represents a significant push to assert political oversight over the nation's leading cultural and research complex.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding the use of live facial recognition (LFR) technology by rolling out 10 new surveillance vans to seven police forces across England. The technology, which scans faces in public and compares them against wanted lists, is intended to help locate suspects for serious crimes. The government cites the successful use of LFR in London, where it led to 580 arrests in a year. However, civil liberties groups like Big Brother Watch have called the move an "alarming" expansion of the surveillance state and are pursuing legal challenges against its use.</p>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency will add questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of defibrillators to the driving theory test starting in early 2026. The initiative aims to equip the 2.4 million people who take the test each year with basic life-saving knowledge, as drivers are often the first to arrive at the scene of an emergency. Learning materials have already been updated to include this information. Evidence suggests that immediate CPR and defibrillator use can increase cardiac arrest survival rates from less than 10% to as high as 70%.</p>

In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for actions that cost "tens of thousands of lives." This acknowledgment follows a 2022 report commissioned by France which detailed how colonial authorities used mass displacement and supported brutal militias to crush the independence movement. The admission is part of Macron's broader effort to confront France's colonial history, though critics argue the gestures do not go far enough.</p>

Cases are now being reported further north than ever before, in states like Connecticut and New York, in addition to hotspots like Florida.
