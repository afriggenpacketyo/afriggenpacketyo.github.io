          <p>UCLA's football team faced a humbling 43-10 defeat against Utah in their season opener, revealing the ineffectiveness of their training camp secrecy. The Bruins struggled on both defense and offense, failing to tackle effectively and move the ball consistently with their new quarterback, Nico Iamaleava. Utah's quarterback, Devon Dampier, dominated the game, showcasing the Bruins' inability to apply pressure. This loss represents a significant setback for UCLA after closing their first season with four wins in their final six games, leaving NFL scouts unimpressed with the team's performance. The article describes the game's key moments, including Utah's early dominance and UCLA's brief offensive spark, ultimately highlighting the Bruins' overall struggles. The game was a disappointing start to the season for UCLA, raising concerns about their competitiveness. </p>

          <p>Biologists are employing drones equipped with loudspeakers to deter wolves from preying on cattle near the California-Oregon border. The drones broadcast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," movie clips, and human voices to scare away the predators, marking a creative approach to non-lethal wildlife management. This method aims to mitigate conflicts between ranchers and the growing wolf population, which has led to increased livestock losses. While environmental advocates are optimistic about the potential of drones, concerns remain about their cost-effectiveness and the possibility of wolves becoming habituated to the technology, prompting ongoing research and adaptation.
