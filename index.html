          <p>A senior official in China's Jilin province has called for a "confident and clear" explanation of the history of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region, referring to them by their Chinese names. This has revived a sensitive historical dispute with South Korea, which knows the kingdoms of Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae by their Korean names and considers them part of its own history. The official's comments also referenced China's "century of humiliation," linking the historical narrative to modern nationalist sentiments and potentially straining diplomatic ties.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man was taken into custody after allegedly stabbing eleven people with a folding knife at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The attack, which authorities described as a "brutal act of violence," appeared to be random, with victims chosen near the checkout area. As of Saturday evening, six of the victims were reported to be in critical condition and five in serious condition. Citizens in the store assisted in apprehending the suspect and providing aid to the injured before first responders arrived.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is expanding its information control to include mass casualty events, such as car rammings and knife attacks, often scrubbing details and photos from the internet. This censorship, intended to prevent copycat crimes and unrest, has led to public frustration, with some citizens complaining online about the lack of transparency. Experts suggest the information clampdown intensified after a particularly deadly attack in November, reflecting the Communist Party's broader strategy under Xi Jinping to manage public discourse and maintain stability.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that significantly escalates the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration, led by RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and raises fears of a permanent partition of the nation. This development undermines diplomatic peace efforts and threatens to prolong a conflict that has already displaced millions and killed an estimated 150,000 people, pushing large parts of the population toward famine.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield, sentencing her to 20 years in prison. The prosecution argued she killed him to ensure sole custody of their child, while the defense claimed it was self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The complex trial featured testimony about their turbulent relationship, a failed ballet company, and competing narratives of violence and manipulation. The verdict concluded a case that had drawn significant media attention for its dramatic details.</p>

While Cambodia accepted the ceasefire proposal, Thailand maintained its stance that direct dialogue must precede any formal agreement, and shelling reportedly continued overnight. The intervention comes a week before U.S. tariffs on both countries are set to take effect, with Trump linking the resumption of trade talks to a cessation of hostilities in the long-standing border dispute.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament, avoiding a worst-case scenario. Judge, who leads the major leagues in batting average, received a PRP injection and is expected to return in 10 to 14 days, initially as a designated hitter. The injury occurred while making a strong throw from the outfield, and while his absence is a blow to the team, the diagnosis was a significant relief.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beyond his "Prince of Darkness" persona, the late Ozzy Osbourne became a beloved cultural icon for a different reason: his role as the patriarch in the early 2000s reality show, "The Osbournes." The MTV series pioneered the "reality sitcom" format, showcasing the mundane and chaotic home life of the heavy metal legend, his wife Sharon, and their children. By portraying Ozzy as a comically flustered but loving father, the show transformed his image and launched a wave of celebrity-driven reality television, predating hits like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians."</p>

Kositi was killed after he blocked the smuggling of spoiled rice, which he feared would poison the public, standing firm against threats and bribery due to his devout Christian faith. The Church has declared him a martyr, recognizing his death as a sacrifice for his values. His story is now held up as an example of integrity in a region plagued by corruption and conflict.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the 60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface and cools the air. While inland Northern California has faced oppressive heat, the Bay Area has been locked in a pattern of cool, cloudy, and drizzly weather, reviving the old cliché about San Francisco's cold summers.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay has repeatedly stated he is not concerned about a back issue that has sidelined quarterback Matthew Stafford since the start of training camp.

The situation raises uncertainty for the team's prospects, as a healthy Stafford is considered crucial for the Rams to be a Super Bowl contender, and this is his second significant injury issue in recent years.</p>

          <p>A new American Eagle ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has generated controversy for its suggestive tone, with some critics calling it "tone-deaf" for promoting a jeans line meant to support domestic violence survivors. The ad, which plays on the word "genes/jeans" while focusing on her physique, was seen by some as oversexualizing a serious issue. However, many fans defended Sweeney, praising the campaign for moving away from "woke advertising," while the brand hopes her star power will boost its stock and sales. (not investment advice)</p>
