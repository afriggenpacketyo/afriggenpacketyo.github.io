          <p>Storm Amy has impacted the United Kingdom with severe weather, including heavy rain and winds gusting up to 96mph. The storm has led to significant power outages, with tens of thousands of customers in Scotland and Northern Ireland affected, alongside widespread travel disruptions on rail networks. A man in his 40s died in a weather-related incident in the Republic of Ireland, highlighting the storm's danger. The Met Office issued amber and yellow warnings, cautioning about flying debris and potential damage as the storm set a new record for the lowest atmospheric pressure in the UK for October.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack has struck a railway station in Shostka, a city in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region, injuring at least 30 people, including three children. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the strike as an act of terrorism, stating that it deliberately targeted civilians, including train staff and passengers. The attack, which involved two strikes on passenger trains, is part of a recent intensification of Russian aerial assaults on Ukrainian infrastructure. Zelensky used the incident to renew calls for Western allies to provide more advanced air defense systems to protect against such daily attacks.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has been directed to advance its readiness to implement the first phase of a Gaza peace proposal outlined by President Donald Trump, which focuses on the release of hostages. This development follows a statement from Hamas indicating its agreement to release all Israeli hostages as part of the deal. The Israel Defense Forces emphasized that the safety of its troops is a top priority during this sensitive period, instructing them to maintain high alertness. An official noted that Israeli forces have adopted a defensive-only posture within Gaza, ceasing active strikes for the time being.</p>

          <p>In the Czech Republic's parliamentary elections, the right-wing populist ANO party, led by former Prime Minister Andrej Babis, has secured a decisive victory with 36% of the vote. Babis, who has been compared to Donald Trump and opposes continued military aid to Ukraine, is now poised to return to power. His victory could shift the country's foreign policy, potentially aligning it more closely with Hungary and Slovakia in challenging EU positions on Russia and Ukraine.

          <p>Rail operator Great Western Railway (GWR) has been fined £1 million for health and safety breaches that led to the death of Bethan Roper in 2018. The 28-year-old was killed when she put her head out of a droplight window on a moving train and was struck by a tree branch. The Office of Rail and Road prosecuted GWR, stating the company had failed to act on a risk assessment identifying the danger of such windows, despite a similar fatal incident occurring in 2016. The regulator emphasized that the tragedy was preventable and highlighted the need for operators to act swiftly on safety recommendations.</p>

The Bank of England aims to position the UK at the forefront of this innovation with a robust regulatory framework for private stablecoins. This approach contrasts with the U.S. model under President Trump, which favors a more hands-off, private-sector-led system that some experts warn could be a "wild west" for digital finance.</p>

According to the plan, Gaza would be run by a technocratic government overseen by a "Board of Peace," with Blair potentially serving in a high-level capacity. The proposal has drawn criticism due to Blair's controversial history in the Middle East, particularly his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion and his subsequent tenure as a Middle East envoy.

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is causing acute financial distress for hourly contractors and low-wage workers who, unlike some federal employees, are not guaranteed back pay once funding is restored. Workers like Willie Price, a 65-year-old food service employee at the Library of Congress, live paycheck to paycheck and face the risk of losing their homes and cars. Labor unions are highlighting the disproportionate impact on these vulnerable workers, who may be forced to take on debt or ration food to support their families. The shutdown's continuation threatens to push many into a severe financial crisis.</p>

          <p>After undergoing an extensive 20-year renovation project, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III has been reopened to the public in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. Amenhotep III, who ruled during the prominent 18th Dynasty, was one of ancient Egypt's most significant pharaohs. The restoration, led by a Japanese team, focused on preserving the tomb's intricate wall paintings depicting the pharaoh with various gods. This reopening is part of a broader Egyptian initiative to revitalize its tourism industry, a crucial source of foreign currency, ahead of the official inauguration of the new Grand Egyptian Museum.</p>

          <p>State insurance commissioners are warning that Congress is running out of time to prevent a massive spike in health insurance premiums for 24 million Americans covered by the Affordable Care Act. The extension of enhanced premium subsidies, set to expire in December, has become a key sticking point in the government shutdown negotiations. Jon Godfread, president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, stated that failure to act before the November 1 open enrollment period will make it extremely difficult to bring consumers back to the marketplace after they are priced out. He noted that premiums could more than double for the average family without the subsidies.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has abruptly dismissed Navy Chief of Staff Jon Harrison, a key aide in the Trump administration's efforts to reshape the Pentagon's civilian leadership. Harrison, appointed in January, had reportedly worked with Navy Secretary John Phelan to limit the budgetary influence of the Navy under secretary, a traditionally powerful role. His firing comes just days after a new under secretary was confirmed, suggesting ongoing turmoil and power struggles within the department. This move is the latest in a series of high-level dismissals under Hegseth, who has overseen the removal of numerous top generals.</p>

          <p>The FBI is reportedly planning a conspicuous arrest and "perp walk" for its former director, James Comey, who was recently indicted on charges of lying to Congress. According to sources, FBI leadership requested "large, beefy" agents for the operation, but at least one supervisory agent refused to participate, deeming it inappropriate for a white-collar defendant, and was subsequently suspended for insubordination. The potential move is seen by critics as a politically motivated tactic, escalating the long-standing feud between Comey and President Trump, who has publicly pressured the Attorney General to investigate his former adversary.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown extends into its second week, political strategists are divided on whether it will significantly impact the 2026 midterm elections. Some Republican strategists argue that voters' memories are short and that past shutdowns have had minimal long-term electoral consequences. Democratic strategists, however, believe the party in power, currently the Republicans, will bear the immediate blame, though they concede that economic issues like inflation will likely be more decisive for voters. Polling suggests the public currently assigns slightly more blame to Republicans for the stalemate, but the ultimate political fallout remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, was unable to be sworn into Congress this week, a delay she believes is politically motivated by Speaker Mike Johnson. Grijalva suspects the delay is because her first act would be to provide the final signature on a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a move opposed by Johnson and Donald Trump. The petition currently has 217 of the 218 signatures needed. A spokesperson for the Speaker indicated Grijalva will be sworn in when the House returns to session, which is contingent on ending the current government shutdown.</p>

          <p>In the two years following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, prosecutors in 16 U.S. states have charged 412 individuals with pregnancy-related crimes, according to new research. Most cases involve allegations of substance use during pregnancy and disproportionately affect low-income women, often using laws intended to protect children, not fetuses. This trend reflects a growing acceptance of "fetal personhood," which critics warn could lead to increased surveillance of pregnant people and the criminalization of behaviors deemed risky by the state. Experts express concern that the U.S. may be following the model of countries like El Salvador, where pregnancy is aggressively policed.</p>

Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000, a goal it surpassed a year ahead of schedule.
