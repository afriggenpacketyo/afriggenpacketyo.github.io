          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Suspending Habeas Corpus for Migrants</h2>

          <p>The White House is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, a constitutional right allowing individuals to challenge their detention in court, for migrants. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller stated that the administration is actively exploring this option, citing the Constitution's allowance for suspension during invasion. Legal experts argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus and that unilateral suspensions by the President are unconstitutional. The move is controversial, with critics arguing it infringes on due process and civil liberties.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, potentially leading to new tariffs. The Commerce Department will gather industry input on demand, foreign suppliers' roles, and government support for these businesses. Tariffs could negatively impact the aerospace industry, which relies on global suppliers but has historically maintained a trade surplus. Boeing and RTX have expressed concerns about the potential costs associated with these tariffs. The United States and Europe ended a 17-year fight over subsidies, agreeing to work together against China's dominance in major industries.</p>

          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a former commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), said he will fight his dismissal by President Trump, calling it illegal. Trumka said his firing occurred after he and other commissioners voted against allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to work at the agency. Consumer Reports and several Democratic senators have condemned the CPSC firings. Trumka fears that his firing will cripple the lifesaving functions of the agency.</p>
