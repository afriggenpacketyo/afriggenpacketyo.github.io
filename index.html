          <p>The Trump administration faced criticism after a judge ruled they violated a court order by pausing FEMA funds. This occurred amidst other significant events, including mass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services and the IRS, impacting thousands of employees. Additionally, the director of the U.S. National Security Agency was terminated, adding to the sense of upheaval within the administration. These events took place against the backdrop of new, sweeping tariffs announced by President Trump, which the administration referred to as "Liberation Day."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's "Make America Great Again" policies could inadvertently strengthen Asia's economic position, particularly East Asia. The US president's trade and tariff policies are incentivizing East Asia and Europe to forge closer ties, potentially leading to a significant free-trade area within the framework of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This alliance could offset the impact of US isolationism and create a more economically dynamic region. The prospect of a Europe-Asia economic alliance could serve as leverage if Trump's tariff tactics become excessively aggressive.</p>

          <p>Meghan Markle's new lifestyle brand, "As Ever", has launched, with products quickly selling out, raising concerns within the British royal family about her cashing in on her fame.

While some experts suggest this is simply Meghan following royal traditions, others view it as inauthentic and out of touch with the average consumer. Meghan defends her decision to return to work, citing her need to earn a living and balance her home life with her career.</p>

          <p>The marketing industry's adoption of 'woke' values, intended to promote social progress, may have inadvertently contributed to the rise of the far right. By commodifying progressive values and using them as marketing tools, brands have created a contradiction where social progress is offered as a substitute for economic progress. This contradiction has been exploited by the far right, who argue that leftist thinking has infiltrated corporations, leading to a backlash against progressive values. As a result, consumers may now view these values with the same fickleness as they view condiment preferences.</p>

          <p>Raising bilingual children is achievable with consistency, exposure, and practice, without requiring expensive language lessons or immersion schools. A common myth is that teaching multiple languages can confuse or delay children, but research shows bilingualism can improve cognitive function and academic achievement. Experts recommend strategies like 'one parent, one language' or designating specific times and places for minority language use. Creating an immersive language environment at home through music, cartoons, and video calls with relatives can also be beneficial.</p>

          <p>The US has delayed a potential ban on TikTok for a second time due to stalled negotiations with China over the sale of its US operations, reportedly linked to trade tariff disputes. President Trump extended the deadline by 75 days, citing the need for further approvals. This delay comes after Trump increased tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. The proposed deal involves TikTok's US arm being run by a new US-based company with majority US investors, but Chinese government approval remains a key obstacle.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's implementation of widespread tariffs marks a significant shift in US trade policy, ending an era of globalization. This move, which includes tariffs ranging from 10% to 50% on US trading partners, has been a consistent advocacy of Trump's for decades. While many economists and businesses express concern about the potential risks and flaws in the plan, Trump believes tariffs will revitalize the US economy and unlock financial benefits.

While some may dismiss it as a lack of resilience, experts emphasize the importance of distinguishing between normal nerves and Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD).

          <p>Senator Marco Rubio has dismissed criticism of the US response to the Myanmar earthquake, arguing that the US must balance global humanitarian efforts with its own national interests. He cited challenges in accessing the country due to the military regime, despite reports that Myanmar had requested assistance. Rubio also criticized the reliance on large NGOs, asserting that the US is shifting its approach to providing aid. His comments come after reports that cuts to USAID hampered the ability to deploy a large US rescue team.</p>

          <p>Across-the-board 10% tariffs on nearly all imports went into effect, marking the first phase of President Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs. More severe tariffs on imports from numerous countries are scheduled to follow soon after, impacting global trade. Wall Street has experienced significant volatility since Trump's announcement, with Friday's trading session marking the worst day for U.S. stocks since 2020. Despite concerns about the potential economic impact, Trump has dismissed worries about short-term pain for American consumers.</p>

          <p>Financial markets experienced a sharp decline, with the Dow plunging over 2,200 points and the Nasdaq entering a bear market. Concerns over the economic fallout from new US tariffs and the potential for a global trade war triggered the sell-off. Economists have downgraded their outlook for US economic growth, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned of higher inflation and slower growth due to the levies. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own, further escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <h2>Nike's Air Jordan 1s Face Tariff Challenges</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods from Asia, where Nike manufactures most of its shoes, have raised concerns about the price of the iconic Air Jordan 1s. While it remains uncertain how much of the cost increase Nike will pass on to consumers, analysts predict a price hike is likely. With tariffs on goods from Vietnam, Indonesia, and China ranging from 32% to 54%, Nike's profit margins could be squeezed. Some suggest Nike might downgrade the tech in the shoes or refresh designs less frequently to keep retail prices low.</p>
