        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced he will step down following weeks of mounting pressure. His resignation comes after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) failed to secure a majority in the recent lower house election and faced challenges in trade negotiations with the United States, which resulted in significant tariffs on Japanese goods. An internal LDP report attributed recent election losses to unpopular inflation measures, past scandals, and an inability to mobilize younger voters, leading key party members to signal their intent to resign.</p>

          <p>A company named Pray.com is creating AI-generated videos depicting biblical stories, such as the Book of Revelation, which are gaining significant traction online, particularly among younger audiences. The company's CTO claims the videos are transforming viewers' lives spiritually, framing the project as the "Marvel Universe of faith." However, some theologians and scholars are critical, arguing that this "edutainment" approach reduces the Bible to a Hollywood-style action movie, stripping it of its spiritual depth and divine message.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A total lunar eclipse, creating a "Blood Moon" effect, will be visible across much of the United Kingdom on Sunday evening. The Moon will take on a deep red hue as it passes through the Earth's shadow, a phenomenon caused by the scattering of light through the planet's atmosphere. Visibility will vary based on location, with eastern parts of the UK having the best and longest view after moonrise. Astronomers encourage the public to watch the event, which requires no special equipment and showcases the mechanics of the solar system in real-time.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia at age 15, has been officially canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his passion for technology, Acutis created websites to document miracles and spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." The Vatican fast-tracked his sainthood, attributing two miracles to him, in a move seen as an effort to connect with and inspire younger generations of Catholics. His preserved body in Assisi, Italy, has become a major pilgrimage site.</p>

          <p>Russia launched its largest drone and missile attack of the war on Ukraine, firing a total of 823 munitions overnight into Sunday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that the cabinet building in Kyiv was among the targets, sustaining damage to its roof and upper floors. Ukraine's air force reported shooting down most of the drones and several missiles, but impacts occurred in 33 locations, killing at least two people. Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a deliberate crime and urged the international community for more military assistance.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has finished negotiations with the United States to secure the release of its citizens detained during a major immigration raid at a Hyundai battery facility in Georgia. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 475 people, including over 300 South Korean nationals, for allegedly working illegally. The raid has caused concern in Seoul, as it occurred during sensitive trade talks and could deter future investment.

While the tennis remains, the focus has shifted to branding and spectacle, turning attendance into a performance of status.

          <p>Inspired by Ukraine's successful use of a flooded river basin to halt Russian tanks near Kyiv, some NATO frontier countries are exploring "nature-based defense" strategies. Officials in Poland and Finland are considering restoring bogs and peatlands along their borders with Russia to create impassable, swampy terrain for heavy military vehicles. This dual-purpose strategy would also help combat climate change, as healthy peatlands are highly effective carbon sinks. While the idea presents logistical challenges, it marks an innovative intersection of environmental policy and military defense planning.</p>
