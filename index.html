          <p>The U.S. State Department has approved a potential sale of over $1.4 billion in helicopters and F-16 fighter jet parts to the United Arab Emirates just before President Trump's visit to the Middle Eastern nation. The sale includes $1.32 billion for CH-47 F Chinook helicopters and $130 million for F-16 parts. Some Democrats have signaled hesitation, citing the UAE's investments in Trump's ventures and concerns over the country's involvement in conflicts like the one in Sudan. The State Department reviews such deals to ensure they align with U.S. goals, and Congress can reject the sale.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced volatile trading, rising approximately 2% after announcing a 250 billion yen share buyback and exceeding operating income estimates. The company's operating income for the last quarter beat analyst expectations but was down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit through dividends to shareholders. The company's outlook for the current financial year was lackluster, forecasting only a slight increase in operating profit due to the impact of tariffs, but clarified that this estimate did not reflect the recent trade deal.</p>

The article suggests that both Russia and Ukraine are attempting to gain Trump's support, but a breakthrough is unlikely given the conflicting demands of each side.</p>

          <p>A charter plane carrying white South Africans arrived in the United States as refugees, fast-tracked by President Trump due to concerns about racist policies and a perceived genocide. Critics argue that these claims are based on lies and false narratives, as statistics show that Black South Africans are more likely to be victims of crime. While the South African government denies any persecution of white Afrikaners, Trump and Elon Musk portray a new land law as a redistribution initiative detrimental to the white population. The move strains relations between the US and South Africa, particularly after South Africa's lawsuit against Israel at the International Court of Justice.</p>

          <p>British businesses are warning that the UK government's plans to tighten immigration rules will lead to labor shortages, particularly in sectors heavily reliant on migrant workers like health and social care. The government's proposals include raising English-language requirements and skill levels for work visas, aiming to "back British workers over cheap overseas labor." However, businesses fear that British workers cannot or will not fill the gap, especially in roles with lower pay and challenging conditions. Care England warns that ending overseas recruitment for social care visas could have serious consequences for a sector already facing 131,000 vacancies.</p>

          <p>Iranian officials have proposed a joint nuclear-enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to demands that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman, though Witkoff's spokesman denied the proposal was discussed. The plan involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to Arab countries for civilian use, with representatives from other countries providing oversight. This proposal aims to offer a permanent solution compared to the 2015 nuclear deal, potentially satisfying President Trump's desire for a more lasting agreement.</p>

          <p>Families of victims from a Jeju Air plane crash in South Korea have filed a criminal complaint against 15 people, including the transport minister and airline CEO, for professional negligence. The complaint alleges the crash was a major civic disaster caused by preventable risks, calling for a more thorough investigation. The crash occurred when the plane belly-landed at Muan International Airport without its landing gear deployed, killing 179 of the 181 people on board. The complaint raises questions about air traffic control response and runway construction, as some bereaved families have been targeted by online conspiracies.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines are dominated by the release of Peter Sullivan, who spent 38 years in jail for a murder he did not commit, and breakthroughs in weight-loss drugs. Sullivan, known as the "Beast of Birkenhead," expressed he is not bitter after his conviction was quashed due to new DNA evidence. Several papers also highlight research suggesting weight-loss drugs can halve deaths from strokes and heart attacks, ushering in a "golden age" of medicine. Other headlines include investigations into arson attacks linked to Sir Keir Starmer and tensions between the UK and China over a trade deal with the US.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has expressed that Canadians were not impressed by the UK government's decision to offer Donald Trump a second state visit. The invitation, extended by Sir Keir Starmer, cuts across messages the Canadian government was sending to the White House regarding Canada's sovereignty. Carney emphasized that Canada invited King Charles to open its parliament as a clear message of sovereignty following threats from Trump to make Canada the 51st state of the US. Despite tensions, negotiations on trade and security are expected soon.</p>

          <p>China has reasserted its territorial claims near its contested border with India by publishing "standard" names for dozens of places in the region, most of them in Indian-controlled territory. The Ministry of Civil Affairs released names for 27 geographical features in Arunachal Pradesh, which China calls Zangnan. This move comes despite recent efforts to improve relations between the two countries after a deadly military clash in 2020 and other border skirmishes. Each location was assigned names in Chinese characters, Tibetan, and pinyin, along with detailed coordinates and a map.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary tariff cut between the United States and China, Beijing is preparing for broader rivalry with Washington to continue, focusing on economic and diplomatic opportunities across Asia while maintaining a tough stance on regional territorial claims. The tariff truce is unlikely to alleviate other grievances, such as US military presence in Asia and restrictions on China's access to advanced technology. China views the tariff pause as a tactical retreat by the US, not a fundamental shift in hostility, and will continue to press its claims in maritime disputes while presenting itself as a stable alternative.</p>

          <p>Children in Japan continue to suffer poor mental health, ranking 32nd among 43 developed and emerging nations, according to a UNICEF report. The country's high suicide rate among youth is a significant factor, despite improvements in academic and social skills. The report highlights a lack of awareness about children's mental health problems in Japan and the ineffectiveness of government measures. In contrast, Japan ranked first in physical health, although there are concerns about underweight children. The COVID-19 pandemic has also negatively impacted children's academic performance and overall well-being.</p>

While salaries may be lower in Europe, factors like generous social security and free healthcare are attracting interest.
