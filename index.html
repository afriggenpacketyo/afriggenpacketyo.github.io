        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Transportation has canceled nearly $700 million in federal funds designated for a dozen offshore wind infrastructure projects across the U.S. This move, part of a broader campaign against renewable energy, reallocates the money towards upgrading ports and other maritime infrastructure. The largest single project affected is the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind terminal in California, which lost about $427 million in support. This action follows other recent administrative decisions targeting renewable energy, raising concerns among industry executives about potential spikes in power prices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK Court of Appeal ruling has permitted the government to continue housing asylum seekers at a hotel in Epping, providing a technical legal win for the Home Office. The decision prevents a potential cascade of legal challenges from other local councils that could have disrupted the asylum accommodation system. However, the victory is seen as politically difficult, as it forces the government to argue in favor of using hotels, a policy it has promised to end. The situation highlights the ongoing political pressures surrounding immigration policy and small boat crossings.</p>

          <p>Anticipation of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts is boosting certain stock sectors, particularly those tied to housing, finance, and economic growth. Companies like Home Depot, Capital One, and Bristol Myers Squibb are highlighted as potential beneficiaries, as lower borrowing costs can stimulate consumer spending and housing market activity. The market is pricing in a high probability of a rate cut at the Fed's upcoming September meeting. The effectiveness of these cuts will largely depend on whether bond yields, which influence mortgage rates, also decline significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A man identified by authorities as a key coordinator in a widely publicized street assault in downtown Cincinnati has been granted bond following a separate arrest on federal drug charges. Jermaine Mathews was previously released on a $270,000 bond for local charges related to the July 26 beating and was rearrested for conspiracy to distribute fentanyl. Despite prosecutors' arguments to keep him in custody, a federal judge approved his release on bond again, though an immediate appeal by the prosecution means he remains jailed for now. The case has drawn significant public attention due to the violent nature of the attack.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) anticipates screening a record 17.5 million travelers over the Labor Day holiday period, signaling a busy end to the summer travel season. This travel surge comes despite a recent communications outage at a Philadelphia-area air traffic control facility that caused hundreds of delays at Newark Liberty International Airport. While air travel is expected to be high, most Americans will travel by car, benefiting from gasoline prices that are, on average, slightly lower than last year. Officials have promised upgrades to air traffic control technology to improve system reliability.</p>

          <p>The Spanish government has abruptly canceled a €10 million contract that would have expanded the use of Huawei's fiber-optic equipment in a nationwide public network. The digital transformation ministry cited "strategic autonomy" as the reason for the last-minute intervention, reversing a decision approved just days earlier. This move aligns with pressure from the European Union and the United States, which have urged member states to remove the Chinese tech giant from their networks due to security concerns. The contract was intended to upgrade over 16,000 kilometers of Spain's public fiber network.</p>

A former employer reported concerns about "grooming" behavior to USA Gymnastics in early 2018, yet Gardner was subsequently hired and promoted at a renowned Iowa gym. Parents and gymnasts at the new gym also reported inappropriate conduct, but he remained employed until a formal sexual abuse allegation was made to the U.S. Center for SafeSport in 2022.

          <p>A new report supported by the United Nations indicates a significant "reverse flow" of migration, with more than 14,000 people, mostly Venezuelans, turning back south after failing to reach the United States. This shift is attributed to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which has made it nearly impossible for asylum seekers to enter the U.S. legally. These migrants, who previously braved the dangerous Darién Gap, are now even more vulnerable as they travel back with depleted funds and face exploitation by criminal groups.

          <p>The Trump administration has informed Congress of its intent to cancel $4.9 billion in previously approved foreign aid using a rare procedural move known as a "pocket rescission." This allows the White House to withhold the funds late in the fiscal year, causing them to expire before Congress can vote on the matter. The funds were allocated for the State Department and USAID, and the action has drawn criticism for potentially sidestepping Congress's constitutional power over spending.

In court filings, Trump's lawyers argue that the President has the authority to remove a Fed governor for cause and that his judgment is not subject to judicial review.

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies' designated hitter Kyle Schwarber had a historic night, becoming the 21st player in MLB history to hit four home runs in a single game. His performance powered the Phillies to a 19-4 victory over the Atlanta Braves. In his final at-bat, Schwarber had a chance to be the first player ever to hit a fifth home run but popped out against a position player pitching in the blowout. This harmless out averted potential controversy over the legitimacy of such a record, as hitting against non-pitchers is often viewed as less credible.</p>

          <p>Mass protests have broken out across major Indonesian cities after a 21-year-old ride-sharing driver was killed when he was struck by a police vehicle during a demonstration. The initial protest was against housing perks for politicians and rising living costs, but his death has ignited wider unrest. Police have used tear gas and water cannons against protesters in Jakarta and Surabaya, who in turn have thrown Molotov cocktails. The incident and subsequent public anger are seen as a significant test for President Prabowo Subianto's administration.</p>

The report also revealed a strong 0.5% increase in consumer spending, suggesting that Americans continue to purchase goods despite economic uncertainty.

          <p>Crystal Palace is reportedly working to sign two new central defenders before the transfer window closes, a move that would likely pave the way for England defender Marc Guehi to join Liverpool. The Premier League champions have been in talks for a £35 million transfer for Guehi, who has indicated he will not sign a new contract with Palace. While Palace manager Oliver Glasner publicly insists on keeping his captain, the club is reluctant to lose him on a free transfer next summer. The club is in advanced talks for one defender and is pursuing another experienced player.</p>

          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has attributed his recent controversial comments to raw emotion following his team's stunning EFL Cup defeat to a fourth-tier club. After the loss, Amorim stated his team was "completely lost" and that "something has to change," leading to speculation about his future. On Friday, he clarified that such emotional reactions are part of his character, saying he will sometimes "want to quit" after a defeat and other times "want to be here for 20 years." Despite the team's winless start to the season, Amorim is understood to still have the support of the club's ownership.</p>

The object exhibits several anomalies, including an orbital plane remarkably close to Earth's and a trajectory that brings it near multiple planets, all of which are statistically unlikely. While acknowledging the idea is controversial and likely not true, Loeb argues that analyzing such objects from an open-minded perspective is a worthwhile exercise. This methodology could be used to assess future interstellar visitors for signs of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

The White House stated Monarez was "not aligned with the president's agenda," reportedly after she refused to remove other agency officials and commit to restricting certain vaccines. The turmoil has led to the resignation of four other top CDC leaders and a staff walkout in protest.
