          <p>Five police officers were shot while serving a warrant in York County, Pennsylvania, with three reported to be in grave condition and one critical. The incident, which occurred in North Codorus Township, prompted a large law enforcement response and caused a local hospital and school district to enter lockdown as a precaution. According to law enforcement sources, the gunman died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Governor Josh Shapiro and other state officials traveled to the area in response to the violent confrontation.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has stated his political strategy will not change, despite rebranding an anti-Trump campaign that used the slogan "F--- around and find out." The move followed the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which has intensified the national debate on inflammatory political discourse. Newsom defended his approach by highlighting his history of engaging with political opponents, including Steve Bannon and Newt Gingrich. The article notes that despite the rebranding, rhetoric at a related rally still compared Republican policies to the "pre-Jim Crow" era.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has announced a £150 billion U.S. investment package, a move seen as an attempt to manage the politically difficult state visit of President Donald Trump. While the government touts the deal as a major economic victory, it has faced criticism, with former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg dismissing a related tech deal as "sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley." The visit itself has been carefully managed, with President Trump's engagements largely confined to Windsor Castle, away from large-scale public protests in London.</p>

          <p>During President Donald Trump's state visit, the U.S. announced a record-breaking £150 billion investment package into the United Kingdom, which is expected to create over 7,600 jobs. The majority of the investment, £90 billion, will come from the asset manager Blackstone over the next decade, targeting sectors like data centers and life sciences. Prime Minister Keir Starmer praised the deal as a testament to Britain's economic strength and readiness to lead.

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock fell approximately 10% after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and announced it was refocusing on guest experience. The report follows a significant public backlash against a recent rebranding attempt, which involved changing the company's iconic logo, leading to accusations of the brand losing its American identity. In response to the criticism, which even drew comments from President Donald Trump, the company reversed the rebrand and is reverting updated locations to the traditional "Old Timer" signage. The company projects lower-than-expected revenue for fiscal 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, a co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the company, citing ongoing disputes with its parent company, Unilever. In a public letter, Greenfield stated that Unilever has silenced the ice cream brand's progressive social mission for fear of controversy, particularly at a time of political attacks on civil rights. This resignation is the latest development in a long-standing clash over the brand's independence, which was contractually protected by an independent board in the 2000 merger agreement. Co-founder Ben Cohen described the situation as a "marriage that has fallen apart."</p>

          <p>A recent analysis of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (OBBBA) suggests that current Republican tax policy is creating a complex system of loopholes benefiting specific groups at both high and low income levels. The law extends and expands the 2017 tax cuts, particularly aiding the wealthy through pass-through business deductions and reduced corporate rates. Simultaneously, it introduces targeted carve-outs for certain working-class professions, such as a deduction for tipped income, creating disparities where people with similar incomes face vastly different tax bills. This approach marks a shift toward using the tax code for populist ends rather than broad, equitable reform. (not investment advice)</p>

Chairman Jerome Powell noted the challenging policy environment, with officials divided on the necessity of further cuts this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study involving nearly 34,000 veterans suggests that taking a form of Vitamin B3, known as nicotinamide, is associated with a lower risk of non-melanoma skin cancers. The research found the most significant benefit among individuals who began taking the supplement after their first skin cancer diagnosis, showing a 54% reduced risk of recurrence. This builds on previous findings from 2015 and provides stronger evidence for dermatologists who often recommend the over-the-counter supplement to high-risk patients. The supplement is believed to help protect cells from damage caused by UV radiation.</p>

          <p>A dive team has identified a shipwreck located 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a fishing vessel that sank nearly a century ago. The ship disappeared during a storm in January 1929 with 21 crew members aboard, and no survivors were ever found. The wreck was initially discovered in 2022 by Atlantic Wreck Salvage, but its identity was only confirmed this year after divers were able to examine distinctive features like its steam engine and trawl winch. The discovery company hopes the finding provides a measure of closure for the descendants of the lost crewmen.</p>

          <p>In his first policy meeting, newly confirmed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran was the sole dissenter, voting for a larger half-percentage-point interest rate cut instead of the quarter-point reduction approved by the committee. Miran, a Trump appointee who also serves as a White House economic advisor, appears to favor a more aggressive easing of monetary policy than his colleagues. The dissent highlights the political dynamics at the central bank, as other governors who previously dissented in a dovish direction voted with the consensus this time. The move is seen by critics as a potential threat to the Fed's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of homeowners insurance has surged nearly 70% over the last five years, with the average policyholder now paying $2,370 annually. According to industry experts, this dramatic increase is driven by a combination of factors, including the rising frequency of climate-related disasters like wildfires and hurricanes, higher home values, and the increased cost of construction materials. The soaring premiums are forcing some homeowners to switch insurers or consider forgoing coverage altogether, a risky decision that could lead to financial ruin. Experts advise homeowners to explore mitigation measures, such as installing storm shutters, to potentially lower their costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the current political landscape, arguing that President Trump's administration is slowly dissolving the rule of law by selectively enforcing or ignoring congressional mandates, such as the ban on TikTok. It connects this pattern to a broader societal trend of mistrust in institutions, which has fueled a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles due to anti-vaccine sentiment. The author interviews historian Kyle Harper, who explains that public health successes rely on collective trust, a value that is eroding in a polarized environment. The piece concludes by linking the political strategy of creating "friend and enemy" divisions to the authoritarian philosophy of Carl Schmitt.</p>

The Fed's "dot plot" suggests two more cuts are likely this year but only one in 2026, a more conservative outlook than some expected. Meanwhile, the bond market saw yields on the 10-year Treasury note rise, creating headwinds for interest-rate-sensitive stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

The attacks allegedly occurred after the vessel experienced engine failure and food shortages. The boat, which originally carried around 300 people, was rescued with 248 survivors, highlighting the extreme dangers and violence faced by migrants on this route.</p>

          <p>A significant slowdown in the U.S. labor market, with businesses adding only 22,000 jobs from July to August, has prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Economists note that job growth is now hovering near zero, with younger workers in fields like software development being particularly affected by cautious hiring practices. Businesses are reportedly hesitant to hire due to uncertainty surrounding federal policies on taxes, tariffs, and immigration. The Fed's rate cut is intended to stimulate the economy, but its effectiveness may be limited in an environment increasingly driven by supply-side shocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>San Francisco Supervisor Joel Engardio has been recalled from office after championing a measure to permanently close a stretch of coastal highway to create a car-free park. While the "Sunset Dunes" park proposal passed citywide, it was unpopular in his district, where residents raised concerns about traffic and quality of life. The recall, fueled by many of the same voters who ousted other progressive officials in 2022, highlights ongoing tensions in the city between environmental goals and the practical needs of residents who rely on cars. Engardio is the fifth elected official in San Francisco to be recalled in four years.</p>
