          <p>Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian hospital reached a settlement agreement approaching $1 billion to compensate victims of gynecologist Robert Hadden, who sexually assaulted hundreds of women under his care. The settlement raises questions about how Hadden was able to carry out his crimes for over two decades, despite accusations and knowledge of his behavior. Hadden was convicted in 2023 and sentenced to 20 years in prison for luring patients across state lines to sexually abuse them. Victims express gratitude for holding the institutions accountable but emphasize the need for Columbia to follow through with plans to better protect patients from sexual assault in the future.</p>

          <p>Three Little Pitties, a dog rescue in the Houston area, provides a safe environment for pregnant stray dogs to give birth and find forever homes for their puppies. The organization offers a maternity suite where dogs like Matilda can deliver and care for their newborns without the dangers of the streets or overcrowded shelters. The mother dogs are spayed after giving birth to help control the pet population, and the organization has successfully adopted out 150 dogs since opening six months ago. The rescue addresses Houston's significant stray animal problem by providing care and finding homes for these vulnerable animals.</p>

          <p>European leaders are urging Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine starting on Monday, threatening ‚Äúmassive‚Äù sanctions if it does not comply. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the aim of the coalition of the willing was to show "that aggression will never prevail on our continent". The call was issued at a meeting of the "coalition of the willing" in Kyiv. Zelensky said that the ceasefire should be unconditional and that attempts to put forward any conditions would be evidence of an intention to prolong the war and undermine diplomacy.</p>
