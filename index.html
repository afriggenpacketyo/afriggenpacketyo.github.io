        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump visited a new migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, which he stated will house the "most menacing migrants." The facility, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to hold about 1,000 people and relies on the surrounding swampland's wildlife to deter escapes. However, the project faces opposition from local lawmakers and environmental groups who are concerned about the significant ecological damage to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem, a region undergoing costly restoration efforts. The move is part of a broader crackdown on immigration.</p>

          <p>Following the Senate's narrow passage of President Trump's major spending bill, House Speaker Mike Johnson faces a significant challenge in securing its approval. Several conservative House Republicans have already voiced their opposition to the Senate's version, which includes a higher debt ceiling increase and deeper Medicaid cuts than the House's original bill. With a slim majority, Johnson can only afford to lose a few votes, and potential attendance issues due to weather could further complicate the effort to pass the legislation before the self-imposed July 4 deadline.</p>

The company's prospectus reveals strong growth, with a 46% increase in first-quarter revenue and profitability, and CEO Dylan Field has signaled intentions to pursue acquisitions as a public entity.

          <p>The UK's Labour government successfully passed a vote on its contentious welfare bill, but only after making significant last-minute concessions to quell a backbench rebellion. The government reversed plans to implement stricter eligibility rules for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) disability benefit before a review could be completed, a move that significantly weakens the bill's cost-saving measures. This chaotic process has been criticized as a blow to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's authority and creates uncertainty for the Chancellor's spending plans, which relied on the projected savings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has once again raised the idea of deporting U.S. citizens who have been convicted of crimes, a proposal that legal experts widely consider unconstitutional. During a visit to a Florida detention center, Trump suggested that even citizens born in the U.S. should be removed if they commit serious offenses. While acknowledging the legal uncertainty of such an action, he stated his administration is examining the possibility. This follows a memo from a Trump-appointed official granting U.S. attorneys broader discretion in pursuing denaturalization, a process typically reserved for rare cases like treason or fraud during naturalization.</p>

          <p>Analysts report that China is significantly increasing its scientific and technological collaborations with countries in the Global South. This strategic shift comes as its long-standing research partnerships with the United States have diminished. According to Caroline Wagner of Ohio State University, Beijing has signed numerous science and technology agreements, marking a critical departure from its previous primary focus on the U.S. This development coincides with reports that the U.S. State Department is shutting down its office responsible for overseeing such international scientific agreements, potentially creating a vacuum in global science diplomacy.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a comprehensive ban on smoking in most public areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools, in a significant public health initiative. The new law aims to "denormalize" smoking, as over 200 people in the country die from tobacco-related illnesses daily. Violators of the ban face fines starting at 135 euros, though an initial grace period is expected. Despite previous bans in restaurants and bars and high taxes on cigarettes, over 30% of French adults still smoke, prompting the government to take these stricter measures to protect public health, particularly among young people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A restructured CDC advisory panel, which now includes members known for vaccine skepticism, has voted to recommend against the use of thimerosal in flu shots. Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative that has been a long-standing target of the anti-vaccine movement, despite numerous studies finding no evidence of harm. While the vast majority of U.S. flu vaccines are already thimerosal-free, experts warn that removing the few remaining multi-dose vials containing it could reduce vaccine availability and reinforce unfounded public fears about vaccine safety. The CDC must still approve the panel's recommendation.</p>

The company, which owns popular beer brands like Corona and Modelo, saw its operating margin decrease due to higher aluminum costs and a 3.3% drop in beer shipment volumes. Despite the weaker-than-expected quarter and ongoing soft consumer demand, which the CEO partly attributes to socioeconomic factors, the company has maintained its financial forecast for the fiscal year.

Santander has stated its intention to fully integrate TSB into its UK operations, which would create Britain's third-largest bank by personal current accounts. While the deal awaits shareholder approval, Santander has not ruled out branch closures or job cuts due to role duplication. This acquisition continues Santander's history of buying and absorbing UK banking brands like Abbey and Bradford & Bingley.</p>

          <h2>Drone Maker AeroVironment Stock Falls 11% After Announcing Stock and Note Offering</h2>

          <p>Shares of defense contractor AeroVironment dropped 11% following the company's announcement of a plan to offer $750 million in common stock and $600 million in convertible notes. The drone maker intends to use the proceeds primarily to repay debt incurred from its recent $4.1 billion acquisition of Blue Halo, a space-focused defense tech firm. The offering comes after a period of massive growth for the company's stock, which has surged 85% this year, partly driven by strong earnings and President Trump's executive order to boost U.S. drone production.

          <h2>Analysis: Republican-Led Changes to Medicaid Shift Ownership of U.S. Healthcare System's Flaws</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 16:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that by passing a bill with over $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, Republicans are now politically responsible for the American healthcare system. The legislation is projected to cause nearly 12 million people to lose their health insurance, primarily through new work requirements and funding restrictions. These changes, combined with expiring Obamacare subsidies, could lead to increased uncompensated care costs for hospitals, which are then passed on to all consumers through higher premiums. The author suggests this will create a significant political vulnerability for Republicans, as the public has grown to favor the protections offered by Medicaid and the ACA.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Budget Bill Proposes Deep Medicaid Cuts, Threatening Coverage for Millions and Rural Hospitals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 15:57:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The spending bill passed by the Senate includes sweeping changes to Medicaid that could leave nearly 12 million people uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The legislation proposes over $1 trillion in cuts, largely by establishing strict new work requirements for beneficiaries and capping the provider taxes states use to fund their programs. Healthcare advocates warn these changes will not only strip coverage from vulnerable populations but also threaten the financial viability of many rural hospitals, which disproportionately rely on Medicaid funding to operate.
