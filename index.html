        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a significant drop, closing down 817 points, as bond yields surged due to deficit concerns linked to a proposed tax cut bill in the House. This sell-off on Wall Street coincided with rising bond yields, increasing the cost of U.S. borrowing and sparking investor anxiety about broader economic impacts. The Congressional Budget Office projected that Trump's tax policies would add trillions to the national debt. Rising interest rates, influenced by long-term Treasury bond yields, could lead to higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing down economic activity.

          <p>President Trump announced the "Golden Dome for America," a multilayered missile defense system designed to protect the U.S. from foreign threats. The system would incorporate ground- and space-based capabilities to detect and destroy missiles, even those launched from space. China has criticized the plan, arguing that it could increase militarization of space and fuel an arms race. The initiative is still in the conceptual stage, lacking specific funding, but aims to counter both China and Russia's growing missile capabilities.</p>

          <p>Before applying for credit card debt forgiveness, cardholders should explore alternative relief options such as credit counseling, debt management programs, and debt consolidation loans. Applicants should also assess their qualifications, including having a debt load of at least $5,000 to $10,000 and being delinquent on payments due to financial hardship. Gathering necessary documentation, such as medical bills or proof of job loss, is crucial for a successful application. Taking these steps can improve the chances of debt relief and help rebuild financial health. (not investment advice)</p>
