          <p>An Ontario judge acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior ice hockey team who were accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. The judge, Maria Carroccia, stated that she did not find the complainant's testimony to be "credible or reliable," pointing to inconsistencies and a memory that did not align with other evidence presented. The high-profile case centered on the issue of consent, with the defense arguing the woman had consented to the sexual acts. The ruling has drawn significant public attention in Canada, and it is currently unclear if the prosecution will appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>China is constructing a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Medog, a remote county in Tibet near the contested border with India. This project is a central component of Beijing's strategy to develop the region, enhance its energy supply, and reinforce its border security. The location is geopolitically sensitive due to its proximity to the disputed Himalayan border, making the dam a point of contention and strategic importance. The development highlights China's dual ambitions of harnessing natural resources for energy while also solidifying its territorial and political control in a contested area.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Develop World's Largest Crystal for High-Powered Laser Weapons</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 18:00:17 EDT</div>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully manufactured the world's largest barium gallium selenide (BGSe) crystal, a key component for developing ultra-high-power laser weapons. This breakthrough could enable ground-based lasers capable of targeting satellites by efficiently converting laser beams for long-distance atmospheric transmission. The new synthetic crystal is significantly more durable than existing military-grade materials, withstanding immense laser power without the self-damage that has historically limited such weapons. The development represents a significant advance in military technology, potentially shifting the dynamics of space and defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is set to test a new lineup of ten beverages in hundreds of its U.S. restaurants, aiming to attract Gen Z customers with bold and flavorful drink options. The new drinks are inspired by the company's recently shuttered spinoff chain, CosMc's, and include items like the Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew and Popping Tropic Refresher. This move represents a strategic pivot, integrating the beverage-focused concept directly into existing McDonald's locations rather than operating separate stores. The test, starting in select markets, is part of a broader global strategy to capitalize on the growing demand for specialty drinks and afternoon snacks.</p>

          <p>Job postings that mention artificial intelligence have seen a dramatic increase, growing at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the past 15 years, according to a Brookings Institution report. This surge reflects the growing integration of AI into various industries, with companies increasingly seeking workers with AI-related expertise. While still a small portion of the overall labor market, these roles often command higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar positions without an AI requirement. The growth is expanding beyond traditional tech hubs and into non-tech fields like marketing, finance, and human resources.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally requested that the Supreme Court allow it to proceed with canceling hundreds of National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants. These grants, totaling approximately $783 million, were targeted for termination because they were linked to research on gender identity and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The move follows executive orders directing federal agencies to eliminate funding for programs not aligned with the administration's policy objectives. A lower court had previously blocked the cancellations, finding the NIH engaged in "no reasoned decision-making," but the administration is now seeking an emergency stay from the high court.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has initiated a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary city laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The legal action alleges that the city's policies intentionally obstruct federal law and have led to the release of criminals who pose a public safety threat. This move comes shortly after an off-duty Customs and Border Patrol officer was shot by an undocumented immigrant, intensifying the administration's rhetoric against sanctuary jurisdictions. Federal officials are particularly critical of the city's refusal to allow ICE agents access to Rikers Island to identify and detain undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes.</p>

          <p>USC football coach Lincoln Riley affirmed his commitment to continuing the university's historic rivalry with Notre Dame, stating, "Hell, yeah, I want to play the game." However, he noted that negotiations are complicated by uncertainty surrounding the future format of the College Football Playoff. Riley supports a model that would give the Big Ten conference automatic qualifiers, which would preserve the importance of major nonconference games like the one against Notre Dame. With the last scheduled game in the series set for this fall, the future of one of college football's most storied matchups remains in limbo pending an agreement between the two schools.</p>

The outage occurred just one day after T-Mobile launched its new satellite service powered by Starlink, which is designed to provide mobile connectivity in remote areas. It was not immediately clear if the new T-Mobile service was impacted by or involved in the widespread network failure.</p>

          <p>California state regulators have released a proposed update to the Bay-Delta water quality plan that includes a controversial approach backed by Governor Gavin Newsom. The plan would allow water agencies to meet environmental goals through negotiated "voluntary agreements," which involve funding habitat restoration, as an alternative to strict water flow requirements. Major water agencies support this flexible approach, but environmental groups and fishing communities oppose it, arguing it will harm the fragile estuary ecosystem by failing to mandate sufficient freshwater flows. The proposal now enters a public comment period before the state water board, whose members are appointed by the governor, makes a final decision.</p>

          <p>A retrospective analysis of Tesla's financial decisions reveals that the company's sale of 75% of its Bitcoin holdings in mid-2022 was poorly timed, costing it billions in potential profits. The electric vehicle maker sold the digital assets when the crypto market was plunging, but Bitcoin has since rebounded to near-record highs. Had Tesla retained its full investment, its holdings would be worth approximately $5 billion today, instead of the current $1.24 billion. This missed opportunity comes as Tesla's core auto business is facing headwinds, and the extra cash could have bolstered its struggling balance sheet. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at creating federal guardrails for the rapidly commercialized world of college athletics. The order seeks to prohibit "third-party, pay-for-play" payments to athletes that are used as recruiting inducements, while still permitting legitimate market-value compensation for name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals. It also directs athletic departments to protect and expand opportunities in non-revenue and women's sports.

Ozzfest quickly became a juggernaut for heavy metal, providing a crucial platform for established acts like Slayer and Pantera while also breaking new bands such as Disturbed and Kittie. The festival's success cemented the Osbournes' status as powerbrokers in the music industry and created a lasting cultural touchstone for generations of metal fans.</p>
