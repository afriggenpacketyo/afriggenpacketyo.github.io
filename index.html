United is treating the event as a preventable delay, meaning the airline will cover applicable customer expenses like hotels as it works to clear the backlog and return to normal operations.</p>

The policy's impact remains uncertain as details are sparse, but it appears to favor large corporations with the capital to build facilities in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

The report showed weaker-than-expected job growth in July and revised previous months' gains down by 258,000, a pattern Cook noted is often typical of economic inflection points. She also spoke of an "uncertainty tax" weighing on businesses as they navigate macroeconomic instability and potential tariff impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's justification for firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner rests on claims that the agency manipulated jobs data before the election, but the timeline of events does not support his narrative. A major downward revision of 818,000 jobs was actually announced in August 2024, months before the election, not after. Furthermore, the final jobs report before the election showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, which Trump himself used to criticize his opponent at the time, contradicting his current claims of pre-election inflation of job numbers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to raise tariffs on Indian goods to 50% could deliver a multibillion-dollar blow to India's economy, though some key sectors may be insulated. While UBS estimates that $8 billion in exports like gems, jewelry, and textiles are most vulnerable, major exports like IT services and pharmaceuticals are not currently targeted. The move, a response to India's oil trade with Russia, introduces significant uncertainty, but analysts note the 21-day implementation window may provide an opportunity for negotiation.

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, predicts that a record number of 18-year-old students will be accepted into their first-choice university this year, even if they narrowly miss their grades. This trend is attributed to universities seeking the financial stability offered by three-year domestic undergraduates amid uncertainty surrounding international student enrollment. With universities making more offers, there is increased competition for UK students, providing them with more choice and flexibility during the admissions process.</p>
