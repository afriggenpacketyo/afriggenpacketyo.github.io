          <p>Scientists have identified antibodies in the blood of Tim Friede, who has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, that can neutralize the venom of cobras, mambas, and other deadly species. This discovery is a significant step toward creating a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives each year. The researchers found that a combination of two antibodies and a drug protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species. The next step is to test the treatment on dogs bitten by venomous snakes in Australia. Optimism score is at 90.</p>
