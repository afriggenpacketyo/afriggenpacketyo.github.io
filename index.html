        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett questions the feasibility of Apple's plan to move iPhone assembly to India to mitigate the impact of tariffs. He argues that since components would still be sourced from China, the move wouldn't significantly reduce costs and Apple's supply chain would remain anchored in China. Moffett also predicts backlash against Apple in China and notes that carriers are unwilling to absorb tariff costs, potentially leading to decreased consumer demand. Moffett has a "sell" rating on Apple and a price target well below the current market value.</p>

A BBC News investigation revealed allegations from 13 people who had worked with Wallace over 17 years. Wallace denies the allegations, stating they are "not all true" and he felt "under attack" and contemplated suicide. MasterChef's production company, Banijay, has launched an inquiry into the allegations. Wallace has received support from some colleagues, including John Torode, his co-presenter on MasterChef.</p>

          <p>A parenting coach argues that the phrase "You're okay" is the most dangerous in parenting, as it teaches children to doubt their emotions and invalidates their experiences. Dismissing a child's feelings can short-circuit emotional processing, teach that love is conditional, and rewire a child's stress response. Instead of offering premature reassurance, parents should validate their children's feelings and help them identify and regulate their emotions. This approach fosters emotional safety and resilience.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Project: How Project 2025 Is Reshaping America," examines the right-wing plan to reshape America under a second Trump administration. Project 2025 seeks to dismantle the New Deal and transform the relationship between the government and its citizens. The plan's authors are focused on illegal immigration and legal immigration, with the goal of decreasing the number of people born overseas in the US. Trump is implementing some of Project 2025's agenda, including cutting federal staffing and budgets.</p>

          <p>David A Graham's book, "The Project: How Project 2025 Is Reshaping America," provides an overview of the far-right plan for a second Trump administration. Project 2025 aims to reshape the government and its relationship with Americans, viewing the New Deal as a point where government went wrong. The plan encompasses hardline policies on climate, LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive healthcare, and more. While Trump distances himself from Project 2025, his actions align with its spirit, including budget cuts and executive orders.</p>
