          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 06:07:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A week after a US military strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities, significant confusion remains regarding the extent of the damage. President Trump and top officials initially claimed the sites were "obliterated," but subsequent intelligence assessments, including a leaked DIA report, suggested a more limited impact, potentially setting back Iran's program by only a few months. This discrepancy has led to shifting narratives from the administration, with some officials downplaying the physical destruction and instead emphasizing that the strike successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. The conflicting reports raise ongoing questions about the mission's primary objectives and its ultimate success.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable feat of engineering, the city of Shanghai is using a fleet of 432 walking robots to move a 7,500-ton historic building complex. The three-building Huayanli complex, an example of classic shikumen architecture from the 1930s, is being carefully shifted to make way for a new underground commercial and transport hub. This innovative method was chosen due to the dense, historic nature of the area, where traditional relocation machinery would be impractical. The project showcases a blend of heritage preservation and modern urban development, allowing the city to expand its infrastructure while keeping its architectural history intact.</p>

She will lead alongside the more conservative Lars Klingbeil, who faced a rebuke from party delegates for the SPD's recent poor election results.

          <p>In an opinion piece, musician Elton John and advocate Jeanne White-Ginder celebrate the significant progress made in fighting HIV/AIDS, largely through the Ryan White CARE Act, but warn that this progress is now at risk. They highlight that proposed federal budget cuts would eliminate funding for essential services like HIV surveillance, testing, education, and substance abuse treatment programs. While funding for the Ryan White Act itself is maintained, the cuts to related prevention and support initiatives could undermine the national goal of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030. The authors urge lawmakers to protect these vital programs and expand access to prevention medications like PrEP.</p>

          <p>An expert from Mount Allison University is warning New Brunswick residents of an unprecedentedly high tick population this season, following two consecutive mild winters. The warmer conditions have allowed more ticks to survive and reproduce, leading to a greater risk of tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. Researchers are observing the spread of ticks further north in the province, carried by animals. The article provides crucial prevention tips, such as using appropriate insect repellent, conducting thorough tick checks after being outdoors, and seeking prompt medical or pharmaceutical assessment for bites.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has developed a searchable national database to allow state and local election officials to verify the citizenship status of voters. The system, an expansion of a Department of Homeland Security tool called SAVE, now integrates Social Security Administration data, enabling checks for both naturalized and U.S.-born citizens. While promoted as a tool to prevent noncitizen voting, its rapid development without a public process has alarmed privacy advocates and legal experts. Concerns remain about the data's accuracy, security, and potential for misuse, especially given the history of flawed data-matching efforts in elections.</p>

          <p>Couples planning weddings are facing an unexpected financial hurdle as tariffs on Chinese goods impact the bridal industry. With an estimated 90% of U.S. wedding dresses manufactured in China, a new tariff has led designers and boutiques to raise prices or add surcharges, sometimes by as much as 30%. This has created uncertainty for both store owners, who struggle to budget for orders placed months in advance, and brides, who are now hesitating on purchases. The article notes that producing these intricate gowns in the U.S. is not a viable alternative due to a lack of skilled labor and significantly higher costs. (not investment advice)</p>

SÃ¶der's plan also includes procuring 100,000 drones, hundreds of new tanks and fighting vehicles, and additional Eurofighter jets and Taurus cruise missiles.

          <p>Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has stated that Iran could restart enriching uranium in a matter of months, despite recent US and Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities. This assessment contradicts claims by President Trump that the program was "totally obliterated," suggesting the damage was severe but not total. Grossi expressed concern over the whereabouts of approximately 400 kilograms of previously enriched uranium. His comments came as Iran's parliament voted to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, further complicating diplomatic efforts to monitor the country's nuclear activities.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight from the outset, as ChÃ¡vez Jr. appeared passive and reluctant to engage, throwing very few punches through the early rounds. Despite being booed by the crowd, Paul showcased an improved jab and higher work rate, comfortably outpointing his 39-year-old opponent. The victory continues to fuel debate about the legitimacy of Paul's boxing career and the quality of his opponents, who are often past their prime.</p>

          <p>The recent murder of a 17-year-old TikTok star has intensified concerns about the safety of women with a public online presence in Pakistan. Many female creators and influencers report facing a constant barrage of threats, online stalking that spills into real life, and privacy violations, often rooted in patriarchal social norms. The article highlights that women who express themselves or achieve economic independence online are often perceived as a threat to cultural values, making them targets for harassment.

          <p>According to the Hamas-run health ministry, Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip killed at least 81 Palestinians and injured over 400 in a recent 24-hour period. One notable incident involved a strike near the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced people and resulted in at least 11 deaths, including children. Further strikes in the al-Mawasi and Tuffah areas also led to numerous civilian casualties. These attacks occurred as mediators reportedly intensified efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal, though negotiations with Israel remain stalled.</p>

          <p>A California jury has found Samuel Woodward guilty of the first-degree murder of his former high school classmate, 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein, with an added hate crime enhancement. Bernstein, who was gay and Jewish, was stabbed to death in 2018. Prosecutors argued Woodward, a member of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, was motivated by hate, while the defense claimed Woodward was provoked and acted impulsively. After a trial lasting nearly three months, the verdict means Woodward faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, bringing a long-awaited sense of justice to Bernstein's family.</p>

          <p>France is making a significant strategic investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, positioning it as a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. The French state recently led a â‚¬1.35 billion investment, becoming the company's largest shareholder in a push for the EU's technological sovereignty in space. However, industry experts are not convinced Eutelsat can effectively challenge its U.S. rival, citing major disparities in scale; Eutelsat's OneWeb constellation has 650 satellites compared to Starlink's over 7,000. While the investment may bolster Eutelsat's position in specialized government and enterprise markets, achieving mass-market parity remains a distant goal. (not investment advice)</p>

The move would allow them to produce and deploy mines along their borders as a defensive measure, creating what one analyst called a new "Iron Curtain." This decision is highly controversial due to the long-term danger mines pose to civilians, but the nations argue it is a necessary deterrent against potential aggression, citing Russia's non-participation in the treaty and its large mine stockpile.</p>
