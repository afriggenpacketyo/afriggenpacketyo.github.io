          <h2>Understanding IRS Rules on Tax Extensions and Payment Deadlines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 11:37:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A common misconception among taxpayers is that filing for a tax extension also postpones their payment due date. This article clarifies that while an extension provides six more months to file returns, thus avoiding late-filing penalties, the IRS still requires an estimated tax payment by the original April deadline. Failure to pay on time results in late-payment penalties and accruing interest, which can significantly increase a taxpayer's liability. The text also outlines options for those unable to pay their full tax bill, such as installment agreements or an Offer in Compromise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of anonymous Columbia University faculty members has sent a letter to the university's leadership, urging significant reforms to address antisemitism on campus. This comes as the White House is reportedly finalizing a deal to restore federal funding that was rescinded due to concerns over potential civil rights violations. The letter calls for accountability for professors and students involved in antisemitic conduct, restoration of faculty who supported Israel, and curriculum changes. A White House official indicated that such measures could be included in the final agreement with the Ivy League institution.</p>

          <p>England has named spinner Liam Dawson to its team for the fourth Test against India, marking his return to the format after an eight-year absence. The 35-year-old left-armer replaces Shoaib Bashir, who is out with a broken finger, and is expected to strengthen England's lower-order batting in addition to his bowling. Dawson's last Test appearance was in 2017, and his recall comes after a long period away from the international squad. England currently leads the five-Test series 2-1 and can secure a series victory with a win at Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's social media platform, X, has publicly refused to comply with a French criminal investigation's demand for data, including its recommendation algorithm. The company stated that the investigation, which concerns alleged data tampering and foreign interference, is politically motivated and an attempt to restrict free speech. French prosecutors initiated the probe after receiving complaints and have requested the algorithm for technical verification by experts. X has raised concerns about the impartiality of the named experts, suggesting the investigation has a predetermined outcome and is distorting French law.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest pilot performed what he described to passengers as an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 military aircraft while on approach to land in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot stated that air traffic control, which operates visually at the airport, did not provide a heads-up about the bomber, which was on a converging course at high speed. The Air Force confirmed a B-52 was in the area for a state fair flyover at the time of the incident. The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the near-miss, which involved a flight with 76 passengers.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons announced a significant shift in immigration enforcement, stating that agents will arrest any person found to be in the U.S. illegally, regardless of their criminal history. While the agency will still prioritize deporting those with serious criminal records, non-criminal individuals will no longer be exempt from arrest during operations. Lyons attributed this change to "sanctuary" city policies that force agents into communities.

          <p>Despite the growing popularity and investment in women's football across Europe, as evidenced by Euro 2025, nations in Eastern and parts of Southern Europe have struggled to keep pace. This article explores the reasons for this disparity, pointing to a combination of historical, cultural, and financial factors. Experts suggest that societal norms viewing football as a "man's game," a lack of investment in infrastructure and professionalization, and the political legacy of communism have hindered development. While UEFA initiatives are starting to show positive effects, the region still faces significant hurdles to catch up with its Western European counterparts.</p>

          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has warned that public service media is under a "serious threat" and has called on YouTube to help safeguard its future. The regulator's report highlights that children now watch significantly more content on YouTube than on traditional public service broadcasters like the BBC and ITV. Ofcom is urging YouTube to give more prominence to videos from these broadcasters, particularly news and children's programming, to ensure they reach younger audiences. The regulator suggests there is a strong case for government legislation to enforce this if a voluntary agreement cannot be reached.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has released an emergency fix for a critical vulnerability in its SharePoint collaboration software that has been actively exploited by hackers in widespread attacks. The breach reportedly affected businesses and government agencies, allowing attackers to gain unauthenticated access to systems and potentially steal sensitive data. The company issued patches for two versions of its on-premises SharePoint software, with a fix for an older version still in development. This "zero-day" exploit allowed attackers to impersonate users and could lead to further infiltration of connected services like Outlook and Teams.</p>

          <p>The England women's football team, the Lionesses, has decided to stop taking the knee before matches, stating a need to find another way to combat racism. The decision followed an incident where defender Jess Carter was subjected to racist abuse on social media. The move has drawn a mixed reaction, with some anti-racism campaigners calling it a powerful statement to reclaim the anti-racism narrative from divisive political discourse. However, the head of the Fare network questioned the decision, arguing that powerful anti-racist actions like taking the knee are still needed to address ongoing issues.</p>

          <p>This feature article explores the persistent and dangerous problem of bird strikes at airports, a challenge highlighted by several recent high-profile incidents. Airport wildlife management teams, like the one at Boston's Logan International Airport, employ a variety of non-lethal and lethal methods to keep birds away from aircraft, from air cannons to shotguns. The task is immense, with the FAA recording about 19,000 bird strikes in 2023, costing airlines hundreds of millions. The article details the complex environmental factors, such as proximity to water and migration patterns, that make airports attractive to birds and mitigation efforts a constant battle.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the surprisingly relevant question of whether animals need sunscreen. While many creatures have evolved natural protections like fur or pigment, domesticated and zoo animals often face sun exposure challenges their wild ancestors did not. Vets and zookeepers increasingly use sunscreen on light-colored or sparsely-furred animals like pigs, horses, and certain dog breeds to prevent sunburns and skin cancer. The practice highlights a human-created problem, as selective breeding has produced animals vulnerable to sun damage. The piece discusses the practical challenges, from finding safe products to training an animal to accept the application.</p>

          <p>Automaker Stellantis has issued a warning of a preliminary net loss of approximately 2.3 billion euros ($2.68 billion) for the first half of the year. The company, which produces Jeep and Ram vehicles, attributes the significant loss to the impact of U.S. tariffs and several large one-time charges. These charges are related to restructuring, program cancellation costs, and expenses associated with emission standards. The financial pressure from tariffs has already led the company to halt production at plants in North America and implement temporary layoffs, reflecting the broad impact of trade policy on the auto sector.
