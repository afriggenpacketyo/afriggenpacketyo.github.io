          <p>Joseph Nye, a Harvard scholar renowned for his work on international relations and the concept of "soft power," has passed away at the age of 88. Nye significantly influenced the U.S.-Japan alliance and served as dean of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. His theory of soft power highlighted the impact of cultural and nonmilitary strengths in international relations. Nye also co-authored reports with Richard Armitage to improve the U.S.-Japan relationship, with the latest report issued in April of last year calling for a more integrated partnership amid global security challenges.</p>

The men were arrested across various locations in England, and the investigation is ongoing. Iran's foreign minister has denied any involvement and offered assistance with the investigation, which has led to heightened security measures around the embassy.</p>

Columbia University is implementing stricter campus access policies, including suspending guest access and requiring university IDs for building entry, after the incident.</p>

          <p>Following weeks of escalating tensions after a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India conducted strikes against Pakistan, targeting locations associated with terrorist groups. Pakistan responded by claiming to have downed Indian aircraft, though details remain unclear. While both sides claim victory, analysts hope the events may provide an opportunity for de-escalation through back-channel conversations, with India emphasizing its actions were limited and targeted. Diplomats and analysts suggest the situation's next steps depend on whether each side feels they have satisfied their populations and if international diplomacy can prevent further escalation.</p>

          <p>Russia announced a 72-hour ceasefire in Ukraine, coinciding with Moscow's World War II Victory Day commemorations.

It is uncertain whether the ceasefire extends to the frontlines. Ukraine has dismissed the truce as a ruse by Putin to create a false impression of peace, while reiterating support for a US-backed 30-day ceasefire proposal.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to impose tariffs on films made in "foreign lands" has caused concern in the British film industry, which relies heavily on Hollywood productions. The industry is still recovering from the pandemic and the 2023 strikes, and tariffs could disrupt this progress. The British government is in discussions with the US administration about the potential tariffs, while also reportedly nearing a pact to ease the impact of recent tariff increases.

This has undermined the Palestinian Authority and sparked fears among Palestinians of a second nakba. While Israel claims its actions are aimed at restoring security, the extended presence and demolition activities have fueled concerns about long-term territorial control.</p>

          <p>North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast, according to South Korea's military. The missiles, launched from near Monsanto, traveled approximately 800 kilometers before landing in the sea. This marks North Korea's sixth missile test in 2025, violating UN Security Council resolutions. Experts speculate that the launches may be testing missiles for potential export to Russia for use in the war against Ukraine.</p>
