          <p>Former President Trump amplified a conspiracy theory by reposting a user's false claim that President Biden was "executed" in 2020 and replaced by a robotic clone. This action continues Trump's pattern of promoting outlandish and unsubstantiated claims, further blurring the lines between political discourse and misinformation. Such actions undermine public trust and contribute to a polarized information environment. The perpetuation of baseless theories can have real-world consequences, potentially influencing public opinion and inciting political unrest. The article does not offer an optimism score.</p>

          <p>Students may face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, according to a new report. A government review of higher education funding is underway in England, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) wants to support collaboration where possible. Universities are reluctant to collaborate because of concerns about breaking business laws. Increased collaboration between universities could be a solution for institutions struggling to cut costs and become more efficient. The article does not offer an optimism score.</p>

          <p>A report is urging the government to implement measures to stop children in temporary accommodation from going "missing" from schools and GPs due to widespread family displacement. The Shared Health Foundation calls for a notification system to alert authorities when a child moves into temporary accommodation.
