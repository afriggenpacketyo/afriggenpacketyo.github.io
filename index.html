          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 03:19:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, signaling persistent deflationary pressures as stimulus measures fail to significantly boost domestic consumption. The consumer price index decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, slightly better than estimates, while factory-gate prices dropped 3.3%, the steepest decline since July 2023. Price wars in the auto sector and falling property prices are contributing to the downward pressure on prices, and analysts suggest more forceful stimulus is needed to bolster consumption. Despite strong exports, China needs to strengthen domestic demand to combat deflation, as highlighted by NBS Chief Statistician Lijuan Dong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 03:17:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to vote on a proposed 3.6% pay increase, a move that could trigger further strike action if rejected. The Royal College of Nursing has criticized the offer as insufficient, arguing it undervalues the profession and contributes to a decade of pay erosion. The government defends the pay rise as the second above-inflation increase for NHS staff in the last 10 months, but nursing representatives claim it places nursing at the back of the queue. This vote is considered crucial, potentially leading to a strike ballot and casting a shadow over the government's 10-year plan for the NHS in England, as other health unions also organize votes on pay awards.</p>

This decline was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa.

          <p>China is heavily involved in the construction, operation, and maintenance of Egyptâ€™s New Administrative Capital, located east of Cairo. China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) is the primary contractor for the central business district, which includes key government buildings and the Iconic Tower, Africa's tallest skyscraper. CSCEC will also manage property and provide integrated urban services in the CBD, cementing Chinese companies' role in Egypt's infrastructure development. The new capital aims to relieve congestion in Cairo and positions Egypt as a gateway for China's Belt and Road Initiative in Africa and the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The National Opera of Ukraine in Kyiv will present Sir Frederick Ashton's La Fille mal gardÃ©e, an English ballet, after boycotting classic Russian repertoire like Swan Lake and the Nutcracker. The production, funded through London fundraising efforts, marks a departure from Russian works due to the ongoing conflict and perceived weaponization of culture by Vladimir Putin. While controversial, the boycott has pushed the opera house to explore a broader range of international productions, with the new ballet aiming to uplift spirits amid the war. The audience will have access to a coat room as a shelter during Russian air raids.</p>

          <p>China's export growth slowed in May as shipments to the United States declined following tariffs imposed by President Trump, according to customs data. Exports rose 4.8% year-on-year, but shipments to the U.S. fell almost 12% month-on-month. These figures were released just hours before another round of trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in London. To mitigate the economic impact, Beijing introduced new stimulus measures in May, including interest rate cuts, while U.S. policymakers voiced frustration at China's stalling on export license approvals for rare earths.</p>
