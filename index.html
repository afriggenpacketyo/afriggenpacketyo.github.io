China also signaled a willingness to start trade talks with the U.S., requesting the removal of unilateral tariffs to rebuild mutual trust. The market is now looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's May meeting, with expectations for unchanged interest rates until July. The article notes that investors were encouraged by the possibility of trade talks, but significant hurdles remain, as U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods stand at 145%.</p>

          <p>Senator Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized President Trump's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for proposing cuts to military capabilities in the 2026 fiscal year budget. Wicker argues that the proposed budget, while increasing defense spending to $1.01 trillion, effectively cuts discretionary defense spending, decreasing Trump's military options and negotiating leverage. He emphasized that reconciliation defense spending should not replace real growth in the military's base budget. The article highlights the ongoing debate over defense spending priorities within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's tariffs are projected to significantly impact American families, increasing the cost of household goods and food. Experts estimate the cost to American households could range from $4,900 to $7,700 per year. Various food items, baby formula, diapers, and children's products are expected to increase in price. The Consumer Brands Association has called for tariff exemptions on certain foods, while the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association has urged tariff exclusions for critical safety products for children. The article highlights concerns that higher costs could lead families to forego essential safety products or turn to used items.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at cutting public funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), accusing them of left-wing bias. The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to cease federal funding for the two outlets. PBS stated it was "exploring all options" to counter the executive order, arguing it threatens their ability to serve the American public with educational programming. The fact sheet accompanying the order cited concerns about voter registrations of NPR employees and coverage of trans issues, diversity, Covid-19's origins, and Hunter Biden's laptop.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Donald Trump's first 100 days in his second presidency paints a picture of economic and political turmoil. The article cites low approval ratings, a contracting economy, and chaotic policy decisions as evidence of a calamitous start. The author argues that Trump's reliance on tariffs has backfired, denting consumer confidence and disrupting trade. The piece highlights the failure of Trump's promises to end wars and expand the US's territory, portraying his administration as one that is skilled at winning votes but unable to govern effectively.</p>
