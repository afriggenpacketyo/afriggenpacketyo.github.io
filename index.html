          <p>Centrist Rodrigo Paz and right-wing former President Jorge Quiroga will compete in a runoff, marking the first time in over two decades Bolivia will not have a left-wing president. The ruling Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party saw its candidates perform poorly amidst a severe economic crisis characterized by high inflation and shortages. This political shift reflects widespread public discontent with the long-governing leftist establishment and signals a potential move towards more market-oriented policies and closer ties with the United States.</p>

Macdonald is now collaborating with families of other victims to advocate for clearer warnings from the UK Foreign Office about the risks of counterfeit alcohol, which can cause severe health issues including blindness and death.</p>

          <p>On the eve of a crucial meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that the responsibility to end the war lies with Kyiv. In a social media post, Trump suggested Zelenskyy could halt the conflict "if he wants to," while also reiterating Kremlin demands that Ukraine abandon its claims to Crimea and its ambitions to join NATO. These comments set a contentious tone for the talks, which follow Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin where potential peace terms were discussed.</p>

          <p>Swiss watchmaker Swatch has apologized and removed a global advertisement that featured a model making a "slanted-eye" gesture, which is widely considered a racist trope mocking Asians.

          <p>Iraqi authorities have started the initial excavation of a large sinkhole south of Mosul, believed to be a mass grave containing the remains of thousands of people killed by the Islamic State group a decade ago. The complex operation involves gathering surface evidence and preparing for a full exhumation, which will require international support due to site hazards. Officials are collecting DNA samples from families of the missing to aid in identifying the victims, who are thought to include Iraqi security personnel and members of the Yazidi community.</p>

          <p>A court-backed ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in Mumbai has sparked protests and a heated debate, pitting public health concerns against cultural and religious traditions. Authorities implemented the ban due to health hazards from pigeon droppings, which can cause respiratory illnesses, but faced backlash from animal lovers and religious groups who consider feeding the birds a pious duty. The conflict highlights the challenge of balancing urban sanitation and disease prevention with long-standing cultural practices in a city where pigeons are an iconic presence.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This strong performance is attributed to the successful rollout of new, innovative drugs and significant revenue generated from technology licensing agreements. Analysts predict Hengrui's net profit could rise by as much as 40 percent, as the company continues to shift its business focus from generic drugs to more profitable, novel treatments.
