          <p>Tesla's first-quarter sales plummeted to a three-year low, a 13% drop year-over-year.

          <p>The Trump administration argued before the Supreme Court that lower court rulings are undermining the president's authority on deportation.  The administration accuses federal judges of overreach, citing numerous injunctions against its policies.  Plaintiffs contest the administration's use of a rarely invoked 1798 law, arguing it's inapplicable to the current situation.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have a lower opening-day payroll than the New York Mets despite significant spending on free agents. This is largely due to the extensive use of deferred salaries in contracts with star players like Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts.  This strategy lowers the team's luxury tax commitment and current payroll.  While legal, the practice has raised concerns about competitive balance in Major League Baseball.</p>
