          <p>Chinese manufacturers are responding to the impact of U.S. tariffs by pausing production, furloughing employees, and seeking alternative markets, with industries like toys and sporting goods being particularly affected. Some companies are turning to domestic online sales via livestreaming to mitigate losses, while major tech companies are offering support to redirect goods to the domestic market. The disruption is forcing exporters to diversify production to countries like India and explore markets in Europe and Latin America, however, challenges remain as tariffs make business models unworkable for some, increasing competition among Chinese companies.

          <p>Japan faces a demographic crisis as its population declines, impacting various sectors including the economy, healthcare, and national defense. With more deaths than births, the country is projected to shrink significantly by the century's end. Factors contributing to this decline include the success of women in the workforce, a demanding work culture, and a decrease in marriages. The government is implementing measures like dating apps and promoting rural living to address the issue, but a fundamental shift in mindset is needed to reverse the trend.</p>

          <p>Newly surfaced evidence, including a video of a Saudi national filming the U.S. Capitol, has raised questions about the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This evidence, turned over to the FBI shortly after 9/11, was never shared with field agents or top intelligence officials. The video, taken by Omar al-Bayoumi, a suspected Saudi intelligence operative, shows detailed surveillance of the Capitol. This omission has led to concerns about potential intelligence failures and the extent of Saudi involvement in the attacks, with some believing it could have strengthened the case against Bayoumi.</p>

          <p>Proposed budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by the Trump administration are raising concerns among scientists about the future of medical research and American health. The cuts, which include staff reductions and grant terminations, are expected to slow or halt progress in areas like cancer therapies, dementia, and stroke. The NIH is a major funder of biomedical research, and scientists fear that the cuts will lead to a "brain drain" as researchers seek opportunities in other countries.</p>

More than 80% of the NIH budget goes to universities and research institutes outside the NIH. Insiders at the NIH told 60 Minutes that even after a six-week spending freeze at the agency was lifted, some shelves and refrigerators that held supplies for trials and patients remained empty because much of the staff that procured those supplies was fired.</p>

This is below the rate of 2.1 needed to naturally maintain the population. Some of the factors driving the low birth rate are that women under the age of 30 are having less babies and many young women are delaying marriage, and a significant share of that group is delaying having children. Cash incentives are unlikely to have a significant impact on the U.S. fertility rate.</p>

Economic policies, including tariffs, have faced criticism, while immigration enforcement has been strengthened.

          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks discovered off the coast of Costa Rica have been identified as Danish slave ships, Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, lost in 1710. Investigations of ship timbers, bricks, and clay pipes confirmed their identity, overturning previous assumptions that they were pirate ships. Marine archaeologists from Denmark's National Museum carried out underwater excavations in Cahuita National Park. The discovery sheds light on Denmark's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, which the country banned in 1792, though slavery itself was not abolished until 1847.</p>
