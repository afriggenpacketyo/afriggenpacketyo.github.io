          <p>The United States Department of State has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) as a foreign terrorist organization, a strategic move that analysts believe could inadvertently facilitate greater counterterrorism cooperation between China and the US through Pakistan. This action addresses Beijing's persistent concerns over regional terrorist attacks, many of which have specifically targeted Chinese nationals and their interests. The Trump administration emphasized that such designations are crucial tools in combating global terrorism, aiming to curtail financial and logistical support for these groups. This development opens a potential diplomatic channel for collaborative security initiatives, highlighting a rare area of alignment between the two major powers in a volatile region.</p>

          <p>An accident at Coney Beach Pleasure Park in Porthcawl, Bridgend county, resulted in minor injuries for thirteen children and one adult when a cart on the "Wacky Worm" roller coaster derailed. Eyewitnesses described hearing screams and seeing children crying, with one mother recounting a metal railing falling onto her son's pram, narrowly avoiding serious injury. The amusement park, which dates back to 1918 and is slated for closure in October for redevelopment, stated the ride was not owned by them and is cooperating with police and health and safety officials. Seven injured individuals were transported to the hospital, and the park will remain closed during the ongoing investigation into the incident.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a comprehensive overview of BTecs, which are practical qualifications offered at Level 2 (equivalent to GCSEs) and Level 3 (equivalent to A-levels), assessed through a combination of exams, coursework, projects, and sometimes placements. Hundreds of thousands of students receive their BTec results, often coinciding with A-level results day, with many using these qualifications as a pathway to university or direct employment. The article details the specific grading scale and discusses recent policy shifts, including former government plans to streamline post-16 education by withdrawing funding from some BTecs in favor of T-levels. However, the Labour government has since paused these plans, retaining funding for 157 key courses in important sectors like health and engineering until at least 2026.</p>

          <p>This article serves as a comprehensive guide for students receiving their A-level results in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, explaining crucial aspects of the post-results process. It details how A-level grade boundaries are determined by assessment specialists each year and outlines the multi-step appeal process available to students who believe their grade is incorrect, starting with their school or college. Crucially, the article explains the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) clearing process, a vital mechanism for students who may not have secured their desired university place, allowing them to find courses with available spaces. It also highlights alternative post-A-level options such as apprenticeships or taking a gap year.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a former Republican candidate for a New Mexico state House seat, has been sentenced to 80 years in prison after being convicted of 13 felony charges for orchestrating a series of drive-by shootings at the homes of Democratic officials. These attacks in Albuquerque followed his 2022 election defeat, fueled by unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Although no one was physically harmed, some shootings occurred while children and other relatives of the victims were at home. Prosecutors also revealed that Peña later attempted to have his co-conspirators murdered to prevent their testimony. This significant sentence reinforces the legal system's strong stance against violence and intimidation in the electoral process.</p>

          <p>This article explains secondary sanctions, a powerful US foreign policy tool that extends beyond direct targets to penalize third-party countries, companies, or individuals doing business with sanctioned entities. The US leverages its global financial influence, particularly the dollar's dominance, to compel compliance. Historically used against Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela, secondary sanctions are now proposed against countries trading with Russia to pressure Moscow into ceasefire talks. While they can be effective as part of a larger strategy, experts note challenges in enforcement, the risk of retaliation, and the potential to push targeted countries closer together, questioning their long-term efficacy as a standalone solution.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Singapore's reputation for financial prudence, a significant 60% of its workers are now living paycheck to paycheck, a figure notably higher than the Asia-Pacific average. This trend is attributed to rising living costs, particularly expensive housing and import reliance, and a growing prioritization of experiences and self-care over long-term financial planning among younger generations. Real median employment income has declined post-pandemic, exacerbating the pressure on purchasing power. Experts also point to deeper social shifts, including increased consumerism and the ease of "buy now, pay later" schemes, contributing to a "debt society" where instant gratification often trumping traditional saving habits.

          <p>The UK economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, according to preliminary estimates from the Office for National Statistics, surpassing economists' forecasts of 0.1% growth. This growth was primarily driven by the services sector and construction, despite a weaker April and May. Chancellor Rachel Reeves welcomed the "positive" figures but acknowledged more work is needed for economic improvement. However, economists caution that this momentum is unlikely to continue into the third quarter due to a weak global economy, impending tax rises, and cautious consumer sentiment. The data follows the Bank of England's recent decision to cut interest rates to 4%. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the court ruled that Wright's rendition lacked sufficient originality to qualify for copyright protection, as both songs are fundamentally based on a traditional melody widely popular at US children's summer camps.

Authors and editors rejected the publisher's claims of inadequate review, arguing it exemplifies the "Palestine exception" to academic freedom.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a historic six-game season series sweep by the Angels, resulting in their fall to second place in the National League West for the first time since April. The 6-5 loss highlighted familiar issues, including a struggling bullpen and a failure to extend early leads, leaving manager Dave Roberts with limited options. Despite Shohei Ohtani's pitching efforts, the team's offense went cold late in the game, missing crucial opportunities. This extended slump, with a 12-21 record since early July, puts pressure on the Dodgers as they face the division-leading San Diego Padres in an upcoming critical series.</p>

          <p>The trial concerning President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles concluded, with US District Judge Charles Breyer sharply questioning the limits of presidential authority and the Justice Department's arguments. California Governor Gavin Newsom's lawsuit challenged the deployment, alleging violations of the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally restricts military involvement in domestic law enforcement. Judge Breyer expressed concern over the "absence of any limits to a national police force" and the justification for the continued presence of federalized Guard members. The case highlights a significant constitutional debate regarding federalism and executive power, with a ruling pending.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump plans to deploy a "significant" federalized National Guard presence along the National Mall in Washington, D.C., starting overnight into Thursday morning, ostensibly to address crime in the city. While the law allows for National Guard activation to protect federal property or during extraordinary crises, the purpose of this particular deployment, beyond a visible display amidst tourists, remains unclear. Army officials stated their mission is to provide logistical, transportation, and administrative support to law enforcement, along with being present around national monuments. This move has raised questions about its effectiveness and necessity in a relatively safe area.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit challenging the construction and operation of the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades has concluded, leaving a key question unresolved: who holds ultimate authority over the facility—the federal or state government.

They presented testimony detailing the potential harm to Florida panthers and the Everglades' delicate balance, along with concerns from tribal members about contaminants and light pollution affecting their villages.</p>

          <p>A New York man, Shane Daley, has been charged with cyberstalking a family member of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, allegedly leaving threatening voicemails expressing satisfaction over Thompson's fatal shooting. Prosecutors state Daley made multiple calls to Thompson's family member, beginning hours after the CEO's death, conveying messages that the killing was justified and wishing similar fates upon the family. Thompson was fatally shot in December 2024, with the suspect, Luigi Mangione, arrested later and pleading not guilty to charges.

          <p>US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at easing regulations for commercial rocket launches, directing the US transportation secretary to expedite or eliminate environmental reviews for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) launch licenses. The order cites inefficient permitting processes as a hindrance to investment and innovation in global space markets, potentially benefiting private companies like SpaceX. However, environmental groups have sharply criticized the move, warning that it puts people and wildlife at risk due to the potential for rocket explosions and devastation in surrounding areas. The FAA had previously increased SpaceX's annual launch approvals despite environmental concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, a figure last seen in 1958. This decline is largely attributed to increased public awareness of alcohol's health risks, even in moderation, and changing attitudes among younger generations who are more health-conscious and less inclined to drink. Societal shifts, such as the growing acceptance of sobriety movements like Dry January and the rise of non-alcoholic alternatives, also contribute to this trend. Economic factors, with alcohol increasingly perceived as a luxury rather than a necessity, may also play a role, particularly for younger people navigating a challenging job market.</p>

Warning letters were sent to five companies, including Vacation Inc. and Supergoop!, citing a lack of required FDA approval for these products, which are classified as drugs, and for being "misbranded" due to their misleading food-like packaging.

The move aims to enhance the dam's operational security and reduce reliance on foreign technology, reflecting a broader national strategy.

Lai, a British-Chinese citizen, is a staunch critic of the Chinese state, having built a media empire including the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, known for its outspoken pro-democracy stance. His trial, recently postponed due to a typhoon, carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Critics argue the case weaponizes Hong Kong's legal system to silence dissent, with Lai's son warning that a lengthy sentence would be a "death penalty" given his father's age and health.</p>
