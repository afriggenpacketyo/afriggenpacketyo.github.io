          <p>Apollo Global Management anticipates that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration will lead to empty shelves and shortages in US stores, potentially causing a recession this summer. Economist Torsten Slok's timeline suggests that the impact of tariffs will be felt by consumers as early as next month due to slowing containership departures from China and subsequent disruptions in trucking and retail industries. While the administration acknowledges a "detox period," other analysts suggest that pre-tariff order pull-forward could delay the predicted shortages. (not investment advice)</p>
