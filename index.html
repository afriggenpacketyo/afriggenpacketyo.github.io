          <p>A recent report indicates that AI chatbots like Grok, ChatGPT, and others are increasingly used for fact-checking; however, studies from the BBC and the Tow Center for Digital Journalism reveal significant shortcomings. The BBC study found that 51% of AI-generated answers contained inaccuracies or distorted content, while the Tow Center found that AI tools often failed to correctly identify the source of article excerpts. Experts caution that AI systems should not be seen as reliable fact-checking tools, as they can be manipulated, make mistakes, and misunderstand information, stressing the importance of double-checking responses with other sources. The article suggests that the quality of AI responses depends heavily on the trustworthiness of the data it is trained on.</p>

          <p>UK police have charged three Iranian nationals with espionage on behalf of Iran's intelligence services, following arrests made earlier this month. The suspects are accused of engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service between August 2024 and February 2025, with one suspect also charged with intending to commit serious violence. Authorities emphasized the seriousness of the charges under the National Security Act, highlighting a complex and fast-moving investigation amid heightened concerns about Iranian activities on UK soil. A fourth man arrested in connection with the investigation has been released without charge.</p>

          <p>UK and EU leaders are preparing for a summit aimed at fostering a new era of cooperation following Brexit, with discussions expected on trade, immigration, and defense. While significant new deals are unlikely, the summit seeks to improve existing arrangements, particularly in areas like defense procurement and security cooperation. The UK hopes to ease administrative burdens for farmers and the food industry, and commitments are expected on energy, migration, agriculture, and data sharing. Despite high expectations, negotiations are ongoing, with disagreements remaining on issues such as access for young citizens to live and work in each other's countries and fishing rights.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is urging an investigation into credible reports that Indian authorities rounded up Rohingya refugees and expelled them, allegedly forcing them into the Andaman Sea near Myanmar. This action is part of a broader crackdown on minority Muslims, following heightened tensions with Pakistan after a terror attack in India. Refugees claim they were forced off a navy vessel with only life jackets and told to swim to Myanmar. The Indian government has not yet responded to requests for comment, while human rights groups criticize the lack of due process for the deported refugees.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring plans following a significant net loss for fiscal year 2024. The plants in question are Nissan's main Oppama plant in Yokosuka and the Shonan plant of its subsidiary Nissan Shatai Co. The closures would affect approximately 30% of Nissan's domestic production capacity, and would be the first plant shutdowns in Japan since 2001. The company has stated that the news is speculative and not based on official information, as talks with labor unions and municipalities have yet to take place.</p>

The operation follows a breakdown of a two-month ceasefire and an aid blockade imposed by Israel, leading to warnings from international figures about starvation in Gaza.

          <p>Former White House lawyers and foreign affairs experts are expressing concern over Donald Trump's acceptance of overseas gifts and targeted investments, calling it unprecedented. The concerns stem from potential conflicts of interest and the perception that American foreign policy is being influenced by personal financial gains. One particular incident involves Qatar offering the US Department of Defense a $400 million Boeing 747-8, leading to criticism that it violates the emoluments clause of the Constitution. There are also concerns about a $2 billion investment from UAE-controlled funds into a Trump-linked stablecoin.</p>

          <p>President Trump's ambitious plan for a sweeping array of tariffs, announced on what his administration dubbed "liberation day," unraveled after just 40 days, causing global market volatility and economic uncertainty. The measures included a blanket 10% tariff on all imported goods and higher rates on specific countries. After facing widespread criticism and negative economic indicators, Trump reversed course, pausing the tariffs and later making exemptions for certain goods and countries. Despite the reversal, the episode raised concerns about the impact of Trump's trade policies on economic growth and consumer prices.</p>

          <p>President Trump's push for a sweeping legislative package, dubbed "one big, beautiful bill," echoes Ronald Reagan's ambitious use of budget reconciliation in 1981 to enact Reaganomics. Like Reagan, Trump aims to implement significant tax cuts and increase military spending, but faces challenges in navigating congressional processes. Reagan's success was facilitated by a Republican-controlled Senate and a working coalition in the House, allowing him to overcome resistance and enact his agenda. The use of reconciliation, a tool created in 1974, allows for the passage of legislation with a simple majority, bypassing the Senate filibuster.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department under President Trump is focusing on voter fraud, with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) providing assistance in some cases. This comes as Republicans push for stricter voter registration requirements, including proof of citizenship. Recent cases involve non-citizens charged with illegal voting, though evidence suggests these are isolated incidents rather than a widespread conspiracy. While the White House claims non-citizen voting is a real problem, critics worry that these isolated cases will be used to justify restrictive voting laws, and the exact role of DOGE in these investigations remains unclear.</p>

          <p>After a quarter-century drought, the New York Knicks have clinched a spot in the Eastern Conference finals, defeating the reigning champions Boston Celtics in a decisive 4-2 series victory.

          <p>The latest Sunday Times rich list highlights the issue of extreme wealth, prompting a discussion about whether there should be a limit to how much an individual or family can acquire. The gap between the wealthy and the average person has tripled since 1989, leading to concerns about the power and influence that extreme wealth can wield. The article proposes the idea of an "extreme wealth line," similar to the poverty line, to identify the point at which wealth becomes harmful to society. It suggests various measures, such as higher taxes or compulsory charitable donations, to curb the excesses of wealth inequality.</p>

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt announced an increase in border checks and a policy of turning back asylum-seekers, except for vulnerable individuals. Since the new coalition government took office, there has been a significant increase in thwarted illegal entry attempts. However, this new approach has faced criticism from neighboring countries, such as Poland, which prefers to combat illegal immigration on the EU's external borders.</p>

Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, finding that early settlers split into groups isolated in different environmental settings, affecting their genetic makeup.</p>
