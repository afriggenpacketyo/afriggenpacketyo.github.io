          <p>President Trump's new executive order increasing tariffs on imports is projected to raise prices for consumers and create prolonged uncertainty for businesses. Trade experts note that the new baseline tariff of at least 15% on most countries could cost the average American family over $2,000 annually, affecting everyday goods like clothing, furniture, and cars. While the administration argues the policy is necessary to revive U.S. manufacturing, economists warn of potential inflation and slower economic growth. Businesses are facing a difficult environment, with many expecting to pass on higher costs to consumers as their previously stockpiled inventories dwindle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paula Deen has announced the sudden closure of The Lady & Sons, the iconic Savannah restaurant that launched her career and made her a household name in Southern cuisine. The restaurant, which opened in 1996, became famous for its classic Southern dishes and was instrumental in Deen's rise to Food Network stardom. The announcement came without warning, surprising customers and staff, and follows a pattern of abrupt closures for some of Deen's other establishments over the years. Deen stated she and her sons will now focus their attention on their four Paula Deen's Family Kitchen locations across the country.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, missed his opportunity to qualify for the U.S. Junior Ryder Cup team after a difficult final round at the Junior PGA Championship. After impressive back-to-back rounds of 66 put him in contention, Woods shot a final-round 74, dropping him into a tie for ninth place. He finished four strokes short of the automatic qualifying spot for the prestigious junior tournament. While one captain's pick for the team remains available, it is considered unlikely that Woods will be selected for the spot.</p>

          <p>A mechanical failure on a tractor-trailer led to a significant hotdog spill across Interstate 83 in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, causing traffic delays and a challenging cleanup. The truck struck a passenger vehicle and scraped a concrete divider, which ripped open the trailer and scattered its contents across the highway. Four individuals sustained non-life-threatening injuries in the incident. The fire chief on the scene noted the unusual and slippery nature of the cleanup, confirming that all the hotdogs that hit the road had to be disposed of as garbage.</p>

The clinic has managed to cure about 98% of its more than 7,000 patients, many of whom are recovering from addiction, by getting them onto curative drugs within a single visit. This model is gaining national attention as policymakers consider a federal plan to eliminate the disease, which could save billions in long-term healthcare costs. The clinic's success proves that despite the availability of curative drugs for over a decade, innovative approaches are needed to overcome barriers to treatment.</p>

The agreement, which is expected to be announced soon, would also give ESPN access to more regular-season games and the league's fantasy football operations. This move deepens the already close relationship between the two entities and comes as ESPN prepares to launch its new direct-to-consumer streaming service.</p>

          <p>A three-day NTSB hearing into the fatal midair collision over Washington, D.C., has uncovered significant safety concerns and operational failures. Investigators found that the Army helicopter's altimeter was likely providing inaccurate readings, and the pilots missed a crucial "pass behind" command from air traffic control. Furthermore, the FAA acknowledged that the air traffic controller failed to warn the American Airlines flight about the helicopter's presence. The cockpit voice recorder revealed the airliner's pilots were aware of the impending impact just seconds before the crash, which killed all 67 people aboard both aircraft.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added a mere 73,000 jobs in July, falling well below economists' forecasts and indicating a notable slowdown in the labor market. The unemployment rate saw a slight increase to 4.2%, while the Department of Labor also made significant downward revisions to job growth in May and June by a combined 258,000. Analysts suggest these soft numbers reflect the economic impact of escalating trade tensions and may prompt the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate cuts in the near future. The report highlights a bifurcated economy, with many individuals still struggling despite overall growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian soldiers are increasingly returning from the front lines with a unique form of psychological trauma dubbed "droneophobia," triggered by the constant, high-pitched whine of FPV drones.

Psychiatrists at Kyiv's military hospital report that this has become the predominant mental health injury for soldiers who are not physically wounded.

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has issued a ruling that closes off one avenue for millions of motorists to claim compensation for hidden commissions in car finance deals. The court did not uphold a previous finding that undisclosed commission payments to dealers were inherently unlawful. However, the judgment left open the possibility for claims based on unfairly large commissions under a different legal argument. While one claimant in the test case was awarded over £1,650, the decision significantly reduces the potential liability for lenders, which had been estimated to be as high as £30 billion.</p>

          <h2>TikTok Owner ByteDance Reports Median Employee Tenure of Nearly Three Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 19:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok and its Chinese counterpart Douyin, disclosed internal data showing the median service length for its current employees is 2.9 years. At a recent town hall meeting, the social media giant revealed that about half of its 120,000 employees have been with the company for over three years. This disclosure appears to counter online speculation that the company had a much higher turnover rate. The figures suggest ByteDance is a relatively attractive employer within China's competitive tech industry, which is known for its demanding work culture.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who have been living and working legally in the U.S., some for decades. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the administration's decision was motivated by racial animus and did not fully consider the lingering crises in those countries. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling and stated its intention to appeal.</p>

          <p>An Ohio woman, Tiah McCreary, took a unique form of revenge against a car dealership that repossessed her Kia K5. After discovering that Taylor Kia of Lima had let its business name registration lapse with the state, she registered the name for herself and sent the dealer a cease-and-desist letter. The dealership initially tried to force the dispute into arbitration, but an appeals court has now ruled that the trademark issue is separate from the car purchase. McCreary's claim over the dealership's name will now proceed in court, creating a complex legal battle for the business.</p>

          <p>The founder of the Punjabi Devils, a Bay Area motorcycle club with ties to the Hells Angels, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on multiple weapons charges. Jashanpreet Singh, 26, was arrested at the San Francisco airport while allegedly attempting to flee to India. The indictment follows an investigation where Singh allegedly sold firearms to an undercover officer, and a subsequent search of his home uncovered an arsenal including a machine gun, a silencer, a hand grenade, and what appeared to be a Claymore mine. If convicted, he faces up to 25 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen is scheduled to meet with the Los Angeles Chargers to discuss a potential return to the team. Allen, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, was traded from the Chargers to the Chicago Bears last year as a salary-cap casualty. The potential reunion makes sense for the Chargers, who are in need of experienced receiving depth following the recent retirement of Mike Williams. Allen was the franchise's longest-tenured player before his departure and had a highly productive career playing alongside quarterback Justin Herbert.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has indicated strong skepticism regarding the constitutionality of President Trump's executive order aimed at restricting birthright citizenship. During a hearing, a three-judge panel sharply questioned the Justice Department's argument for overturning lower-court rulings that have blocked the order. The policy, which seeks to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of non-citizen or non-permanent resident parents, has been consistently ruled unconstitutional by lower courts. The judges referenced the Supreme Court's long-standing precedent from 1898 that is widely understood to guarantee birthright citizenship.</p>
