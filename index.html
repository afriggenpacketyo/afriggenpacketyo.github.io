        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his first public address since a ceasefire was agreed upon, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei asserted that recent US strikes failed to disrupt the nation's nuclear program. He dismissed the damage as exaggerated by President Trump and described Iran's own retaliatory strike on a US airbase as a "heavy blow." This statement comes amid conflicting assessments, with US officials maintaining the operation severely set back Iran's nuclear ambitions by years, a claim Khamenei labeled as false.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly preparing to make significant concessions on its planned welfare reforms to avert a large-scale rebellion from Labour backbenchers. According to sources, the deal would protect existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health component of Universal Credit from proposed cuts. This move represents a substantial climbdown for the government, which faced a potential defeat on its flagship bill aimed at saving Â£5 billion annually by tightening eligibility for disability benefits.</p>

          <p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has strongly criticized the European Union for what he calls "double standards" regarding its relationship with Israel. Citing an EU report that found "indications" of human rights breaches by Israel in Gaza, Sanchez questioned why the bloc has not moved to suspend its trade agreement, contrasting this with the numerous sanctions packages against Russia. His comments highlight a deep and persistent division among EU member states, with countries like Germany opposing any such punitive measures against Israel.</p>
