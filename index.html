The church building was also reported to be actively on fire following the attack. Federal agencies, including the FBI and ATF, are en route to the scene to assist with the investigation into the tragic event.</p>

          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, Rep. Mike Turner advocated for increased U.S. support for Ukraine, including lifting restrictions on long-range weapons and imposing sanctions on Russia to cripple its war economy. He described Ukraine as winning a "modern war" with advanced anti-drone technology and urged the U.S. to align with their innovative tactics. Turner also addressed recent reports about the number of FBI agents present on January 6th, stating that the new information warrants review to determine if it alters the current understanding of the event, while refraining from speculation.</p>

This demonstration is one of several tributes that have occurred at major sporting events since Kirk's assassination earlier in the month.

          <p>European Ryder Cup player Viktor Hovland was forced to withdraw from his Sunday singles match against Harris English of the U.S. due to a persistent neck injury. The Norwegian golfer had also pulled out of the fourballs on Saturday and was unable to recover in time for the final day's play. As a result of the withdrawal, the match was declared a half, with each team receiving half a point. This development brought Europe closer to retaining the Ryder Cup, needing only two more points to secure the victory.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to attend a meeting with generals and admirals from around the world at Quantico, a gathering called by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The meeting is considered unusual due to its large scale and the short notice given to the senior military leaders who were summoned. While the White House has not commented, President Trump expressed his approval of the meeting to reporters. The purpose and agenda of this rare assembly of top military brass have not been publicly detailed.</p>

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss citizens have narrowly approved a government proposal to introduce a voluntary electronic identity card system, with 50.4% voting in favor. This revised plan addresses privacy concerns from a previously rejected 2021 proposal by ensuring data is stored only on users' smartphones and managed by the state, not private companies. The digital ID will be optional, allowing citizens to continue using traditional identity cards. Supporters believe it will streamline online bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain concerned about potential privacy risks.</p>

          <p>Turkey is facing a significant health crisis as diabetes prevalence has soared by 67% over the last two decades, now affecting over 16% of its adult population, the highest rate in Europe.

Compounding the issue, a high number of cases remain undiagnosed, and many diagnosed patients receive inadequate treatment, leading to severe complications.

European business leaders and politicians argue this creates a turbulent trade environment and harms industries that are unable to definitively trace the origin of every metal component.

He differentiated between removing illegal migrants and targeting legal residents who are part of the community and economy.

          <p>Dr. Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Iowa's largest school district, has been placed on paid administrative leave after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Federal agents allege that Roberts is in the country illegally, lacks work authorization, and was subject to a final removal order from 2024. The Des Moines school board stated they were unaware of any immigration issues, noting that background checks before his hiring revealed no problems. Roberts had stated he was a U.S. citizen when applying for his administrator license.</p>

          <h2>Skepticism of Official Statistics Drives Interest in Alternative Inflation Data Sources</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid public skepticism about official government statistics, alternative data sources are providing a different perspective on inflation. While the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) faces criticism for potentially outdated methodology, independent indexes from sources like Truflation and Zillow offer real-time insights. Currently, many of these alternative sources suggest consumer price inflation is lower than the government's reported 2.9%. However, data from business organizations like the ISM and NFIB indicate that rising costs for producers could lead to future inflationary pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is revolutionizing its space industry by implementing a "pull" production system designed to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency and consistency of car manufacturing. This new model contrasts with the traditional "push" system by having final assembly pull components from suppliers only as needed, reducing delays and waste. As global space activity is projected to grow exponentially, Chinese researchers believe that mastering this scalable production method will be key to dominating the future of the space industry. The goal is to lower costs and improve quality.</p>

          <p>As national chain stores close, rising vacancy rates in shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses to secure prime real estate. With demand softening, landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents with independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses. While overall rental rates are still rising, the pace has slowed, allowing smaller enterprises to move into spaces they were previously priced out of. This trend is helping to fill empty storefronts and allows local businesses to benefit from established high-traffic locations.</p>

          <p>For neurodivergent individuals who may struggle with executive dysfunction, a leading money coach advises that automating finances is the most effective first step toward financial stability. Challenges like impulsivity, decision fatigue, and time blindness can make traditional budgeting difficult. By setting up automatic bill payments, savings transfers, and investment contributions to align with paydays, individuals can reduce the mental energy required for money management. This strategy helps prioritize financial goals and creates more freedom for spending without the stress of potentially missing important payments.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation highlights the growing problem of AI-powered "nudify" apps and websites that allow users to easily create nonconsensual, explicit deepfakes of people from ordinary photos. The report focuses on a group of women in Minnesota who discovered a friend had used their social media pictures to generate such content. Because the images were not distributed, the man broke no existing laws, revealing a significant legal gap. Victims describe severe emotional trauma, and experts warn these services are widely available, posing a threat to anyone with an online presence.</p>

          <p>Climate activist Greta Thunberg, currently part of a flotilla aiming to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, has rejected claims that the mission is merely a publicity stunt. She argued that no one would risk their life for attention and stated the goal is to break Israel's "illegal and inhumane siege" by sea. The flotilla is also intended to send a message of solidarity to Palestinians, showing that "the people will step up" when governments fail to act. The mission has recently faced suspected drone attacks, which Thunberg condemned as violations of international law.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has pledged to start building three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its plan to construct 1.5 million new homes by 2029. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced that a taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. The plan emulates the post-war Labour government's new town developments and aims to create entire communities. The government has also accepted a recommendation that at least 40% of the new homes be classified as affordable housing.</p>

The incident occurred on the first tee on Saturday morning, contributing to what was described as a toxic atmosphere for McIlroy throughout the day. Spectators repeatedly targeted the golfer with personal abuse, prompting the PGA of America to bring in additional police for his group. McIlroy described the environment as challenging but went on to win both of his matches.</p>
