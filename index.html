          <p>Grammy-winning singer Michael Bolton's family revealed that he experienced unusual symptoms before his glioblastoma diagnosis in December 2023. Bolton's daughters noticed that he bowled out of turn and fell out of his chair during a family bowling night, which was highly uncharacteristic of the athletic and sober singer. Earlier that fall, he had also struggled with balance and nausea while performing at a charity event, symptoms initially attributed to stress and fatigue. Following the bowling incident, Bolton experienced headaches, leading to an MRI that revealed the brain tumor, which was surgically removed, followed by radiation and chemotherapy treatments to keep the cancer at bay.</p>

          <p>Psychiatrist Awais Aftab discusses the often-overlooked downsides of antidepressant medications, noting that while they can be transformative for some, many patients experience sexual side effects, manic episodes, or severe withdrawal symptoms when attempting to taper off the drugs. Aftab emphasizes the lack of high-quality research guiding clinicians on safely tapering patients off antidepressants, despite millions of people taking them long-term. He argues that psychiatry needs to engage seriously with patients' concerns and acknowledge the trade-offs of these medications to maintain credibility and avoid ceding the conversation to those who might exploit the suffering of vulnerable individuals for personal or political gain. The article calls for more research into the long-term effects and safe tapering strategies for antidepressants.</p>

          <p>The Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, a family-run business for 50 years, is experiencing the impact of decreased consumer sentiment, according to its manager, Stanley Kallivrousis. Kallivrousis notes a reduction in foot traffic and changes in customer eating habits, with people sharing meals and taking leftovers home due to economic pressures. He has paused expansion plans and faces challenges in retaining staff, as some workers leave for the gig economy's flexibility. The article highlights the broader economic uncertainty affecting businesses, with companies raising prices and pulling back on investments amid tariff concerns, though food prices have remained relatively steady.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris secured victory in a chaotic, wet-to-dry Miami Grand Prix sprint race, overtaking his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri with the aid of a safety car. Piastri had led from the start, passing Kimi Antonelli, but the safety car period, triggered by a crash between Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson, allowed Norris to pit and rejoin in the lead. Max Verstappen, who initially finished fourth, received a 10-second penalty for an unsafe pit release, dropping him to 17th place, while Antonelli's race was compromised by a collision with Verstappen during the pit stop.</p>

          <p>Voice of America (VOA) is expected to resume broadcasts as early as next week, following a court challenge to President Trump's executive order that effectively shut down the network in March. The Department of Justice informed Reporters Without Borders that VOA staff could begin returning to work, with programming set to resume shortly. This development follows a federal appeals court upholding a temporary stay on the executive order, which had eliminated the workforce and activities of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), VOA's parent agency. According to the DOJ, accounts of over 1,400 employees have been reactivated.</p>

Buffett highlighted that Berkshire Hathaway's stock has declined 50% on three occasions in the past, without any fundamental issues with the company. He expressed that he doesn't get fearful about financial concerns that worry others, and would see a 50% drop in Berkshire's stock as a "fantastic opportunity."

The opposition has boycotted the regime's "national conference," which proposed dissolving the 2005 Political Parties Charter and limiting the number of parties to five. Amnesty International has condemned the move as an attack on freedom of expression and association. Opposition parties fear the junta will strengthen its crackdown on political dissent, despite the Malian constitution of 1992 enshrining the existence of political parties.</p>

The charity condemned the attack as a "clear violation of international humanitarian law," as the hospital is the only one in Fangak county, serving over 110,000 people, and all its medical supplies were destroyed.

          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially raising prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs, enacted under President Trump's plan to boost domestic manufacturing, follow earlier tariffs on imported cars. The new levies affect even domestically produced cars, as they often contain foreign-made components. The administration claims the tariffs will protect national security by incentivizing domestic production, but automakers warn of rising costs and supply chain disruptions. While some exemptions exist for parts from Canada and Mexico, uncertainty remains, and General Motors estimates the tariffs could cost it up to $5 billion this year.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second consecutive three-year term in Australia's election, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian prime minister has achieved this feat. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging his party's underperformance. Albanese's Labor Party secured a majority in the House of Representatives, with energy policy and inflation being major campaign issues. Albanese criticized Dutton's party for mimicking U.S. President Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency, arguing that they were attempting to run American-style politics of division. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio congratulated Albanese on his re-election, emphasizing the strong alliance between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Singapore's ruling People's Action Party (PAP) is set to win another decisive victory in the general elections, bolstering the mandate of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who is in his first year in the role. The PAP has governed Singapore since 1959, and the projected results show the party poised to win 87 seats in Parliament, with the opposition Workers Party retaining 10 seats. The strong showing for the PAP strengthens Wong's mandate as he faces economic uncertainty and rising living costs, which were key concerns for voters. The PAP has been accused of suppressing dissent, but has steered the island to prosperity.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term, a victory for the center-left Labor Party amid global uncertainty. The election was called for Albanese shortly after polls closed, marking a defeat for the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton, who lost his parliamentary seat. The campaign focused on cost-of-living concerns, with both parties offering short-term relief proposals. The Trump administration's influence loomed over the election, with Albanese emphasizing that Australians had chosen to face global challenges in their own way. Albanese's victory was a recovery from the failure of a 2023 referendum on Indigenous representation.</p>

The conservative Liberal-National coalition suffered a significant defeat, with leader Peter Dutton losing his own seat. Albanese's win was attributed to a focus on Australian values, fairness, and opportunity, while Dutton's campaign was marred by policy backflips and comparisons to Donald Trump. The election was dominated by cost-of-living concerns, particularly the affordability of healthcare and housing, with international relations also playing a role.</p>

          <p>Capital One's acquisition of Discover Financial has the potential to be even more lucrative than investors expect, particularly through international expansion. The acquisition is expected to deliver billions in benefits by using Visa and Mastercard less. Discover's payment network generally trails Visa and Mastercard internationally, but if Capital One can close this gap, that would motivate the company to shift more of its Capital One-branded credit cards away from the networks of Mastercard and Visa than currently assumed in the synergy estimate. The global expansion of Discover's network will create a "flywheel effect" for the combined business.</p>
