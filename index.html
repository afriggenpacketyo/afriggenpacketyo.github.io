This strategy involves substantial investments in AI-related firms like chip designer Arm and OpenAI, aiming to create an integrated AI ecosystem. Drawing parallels to his lucrative early investment in Alibaba, Son's long-standing vision for AI, which predates the current hype, is now the core focus of SoftBank's future, despite past investment setbacks with the Vision Fund.

          <p>An Israeli airstrike near Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City killed five Al Jazeera journalists who were in a designated press tent, according to the broadcaster. Al Jazeera condemned the incident as a "targeted assassination" and a premeditated attack on press freedom. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed striking one of the journalists, Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas operative, a claim Al Jazeera and press freedom groups have contested. This event escalates concerns over the safety of journalists covering the conflict, as international reporters are largely barred from entering Gaza.</p>

          <p>The 911 emergency system in Redondo Beach, California, experienced a temporary outage on Sunday due to a fire at an AT&T communications center in nearby Gardena. The blaze, which started as a trash fire, spread to the facility and burned for five hours, involving hazardous lead-acid batteries and prompting a shelter-in-place order for local residents. Over 100 firefighters, including a Hazmat team, responded to the incident. City officials confirmed the impact on 911 services was minimal and intermittent, with no injuries reported from the event.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended a planned military offensive into Gaza City, stating it is essential to "complete the defeat of Hamas" and free Gaza from the group's control. The plan, approved by Israel's Security Cabinet, involves dismantling remaining Hamas strongholds while moving Palestinian civilians to designated safe zones. The announcement has drawn international condemnation over humanitarian concerns and the safety of remaining hostages. Netanyahu asserted that Israel has a "fairly short timetable" and will proceed with or without international support to achieve its goals.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's seas are experiencing their warmest start to the year on record, a trend linked to climate change that is causing significant shifts in marine ecosystems. This warming has led to the arrival of extraordinary species not typically found in UK waters, such as bluefin tuna, octopus, and mauve stinger jellyfish. While these new arrivals are notable, the rising temperatures are also creating challenging conditions for native, cold-adapted species like cod. Scientists warn that marine heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense, posing long-term challenges for both wildlife and local fishing communities.</p>

According to police, gunmen arrived in two pickup trucks and opened fire on a crowd gathered outside the venue in the early hours of Sunday morning.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts expressed frustration after a 5-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays, a game in which the Dodgers left 16 runners on base. Roberts specifically criticized superstar Shohei Ohtani for a poor baserunning decision, where he was thrown out trying to steal third base with two outs. Despite Ohtani hitting his 41st home run, the team's inability to capitalize on numerous opportunities and a faltering bullpen led to the loss. The defeat narrows the Dodgers' lead in the NL West, amplifying concerns as they head into a crucial series against the rival Padres.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented arrangement, Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenues from sales of specific high-end AI chips to China.

This move follows a U.S. ban and subsequent reversal on the sale of these tailored microprocessors.

          <p>A significant wildfire burning on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius near Naples, Italy, has forced the closure of all hiking trails in the popular national park. Firefighters, supported by the army and six Canadair water-bombing planes, are battling the blaze which has affected over 1,200 acres of dense vegetation. While smoke is visible from the nearby ancient city of Pompeii, the archaeological site remains open. The fire highlights the increasing vulnerability of European countries to wildfires amid intensifying summer heatwaves attributed to climate change, with similar large fires also occurring in Spain and France.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is considering imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports as a punitive measure for Beijing's continued purchases of Russian oil, according to Vice President J.D. Vance. While no firm decision has been made, the potential tariffs represent another tool the administration is exploring to pressure Russia to end its war in Ukraine. The complex U.S.-China economic relationship complicates the decision. In response, Beijing's embassy in Washington stated that China's trade with Russia is normal cooperation conducted within the framework of international law and should not be interfered with.</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas have issued apologies following criticism that their 'Oaxaca Slip-On' shoe culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal design. The footwear, inspired by huaraches made by Indigenous artisans, drew backlash for being produced without consultation or credit to the Oaxacan communities that originated the style. Mexico's president was among the critics. Both Chavarria and Adidas have removed promotional images and expressed deep regret, committing to a respectful dialogue with the community to repair the damage caused by the oversight.</p>

          <p>An in-depth report from the occupied West Bank details an intensified campaign by Israeli settlers to displace Palestinian communities, a situation that has accelerated since the October 7th attacks. Settler leaders, supported by hardline nationalist ministers in the Israeli government, are expanding outposts and using intimidation to drive away Palestinian farmers. UN experts and human rights groups report a systemic pattern of violence and land dispossession, with the Israeli military often failing to protect Palestinians. This aggressive expansion is extinguishing hopes for a two-state solution and creating an atmosphere of despair.</p>

          <p>Historian Rana Mitter, a leading expert on modern China, highlights the often-underestimated impact of World War II on the nation's development. In an interview, Mitter explains that the war, particularly Japan's invasion, was a pivotal event that shattered China's pre-war infrastructure and communications, forcing the country to rebuild almost from scratch. This historical context is crucial for understanding China's subsequent political and societal trajectory. Mitter suggests that reflecting on this history, 80 years later, shows that China's current interests are best served by maintaining a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>President Trump has demanded that homeless individuals in Washington, D.C., be moved out of the city "IMMEDIATELY" and relocated to distant places. In a series of social media posts, he linked the issue to crime and cleanliness, promising to make the capital safer and more beautiful. This comes as he floats the idea of putting the city under federal control and has already increased the presence of federal law enforcement. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back, noting that violent crime in the city has been declining and is at a 30-year low.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has ruled that commercial fishing is illegal within the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, overturning a Trump administration policy that sought to allow it. The decision blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had reversed Obama-era protections for the monument. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups filed the lawsuit, arguing the administration bypassed the required public process for changing the rules. The ruling is being hailed as a major victory for the protection of the monument's unique and vulnerable marine ecosystems.</p>

Newcomers Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong both scored on their competitive debuts in the 2-2 draw, which was decided on penalties. However, the team twice surrendered leads and looked susceptible in defense, highlighting areas manager Arne Slot needs to address. Record signing Florian Wirtz was a standout performer, showcasing his creative influence from an attacking midfield role.</p>
