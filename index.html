        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nissan is contemplating sharing its global production facilities, including the Sunderland plant in the UK, with its Chinese state-owned partner Dongfeng as part of a broader restructuring strategy. The company, facing financial challenges and recent job cuts, aims to optimize its production ecosystem and potentially integrate Dongfeng into its global operations. This move comes after Nissan reported an annual loss and experienced leadership changes, including failed merger talks with Honda. Despite these challenges, Nissan's battery partner AESC recently secured significant funding for a new plant in Sunderland, signaling ongoing investment in electric vehicle technology.</p>

          <p>Richemont, the owner of Cartier, reported better-than-expected sales for its fiscal fourth quarter, driven by strong demand for jewelry from affluent consumers. The company's Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, experienced double-digit growth, offsetting declines in its specialist watchmakers segment. While sales in Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) declined due to weakness in China, overall full-year sales rose 4%, surpassing analyst expectations. Richemont's chairman noted that ongoing global uncertainties would require continued agility and discipline, but the company's pricing power is expected to mitigate some headwinds. </p>

          <p>The article explains the phenomenon of "mud balls" in golf, which occur when golf balls become covered in mud and dirt during adverse weather conditions, significantly affecting their flight and trajectory. Unlike regular tournaments where preferred lies allow players to clean their balls, major championships like the PGA often leave the decision to implement this rule to tournament organizers. This can lead to unpredictable spins and challenges for golfers, adding an element of chance to the game depending on weather conditions.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction in the January-March period, marking the first decline in a year, due to sluggish domestic demand and rising import costs.

This downturn precedes the full effect of higher U.S. tariffs, raising concerns about further economic slowdown.

          <p>Romania is on the brink of a political shift as far-right candidate George Simion gains momentum ahead of the presidential runoff. Simion's rise is attributed to economic failures, widespread insecurity, and mass emigration, fueling anti-establishment sentiment. Despite respectable growth numbers, Romania struggles with poverty and low wages, while mainstream parties offer limited solutions. Simion's potential victory raises concerns about the country's direction, with comparisons drawn to Viktor Orban's Hungary and the persistence of economic inequality.</p>

          <p>A brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia has been kept on life support for three months to allow her fetus to grow, due to the state's abortion ban. The family is upset that Georgia's law, which restricts abortion after cardiac activity is detected, doesn't allow them to decide whether to remove life support. The woman's family says Emory doctors have told them they are not allowed to stop or remove the devices that are keeping her breathing because state law bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected — generally around six weeks into pregnancy.</p>

          <p>The World Health Organisation has declared a polio outbreak in Papua New Guinea after the virus was found in two healthy children during routine screening. Less than half of the country's population are immunised against polio, a highly infectious disease. A vaccination campaign targeting children aged 10 and below will target around 3.5 million people. The WHO, UN's children agency Unicef and Australia's government are supporting Papua New Guinea in its rollout of vaccines.</p>

          <p>Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice has suggested that the UK should learn from Dubai, praising its national pride and low crime levels. He advocates for adopting elements of Dubai's governance, while acknowledging that the UAE does not share Western values. Tice's comments come after his partner, journalist Isabel Oakeshott, wrote about her positive experience of moving to Dubai, praising its economy and culture of respect.</p>
