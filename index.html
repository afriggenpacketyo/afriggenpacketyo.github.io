          <p>The UK government has instructed the Civil Service to slash running costs by 15% by 2029-30, aiming to save Â£2.2bn annually.  The cuts will target administrative areas, not front-line services, but unions warn of potential job losses and impacts on service delivery. The government justifies the cuts as necessary for reallocating resources to front-line services.</p>
