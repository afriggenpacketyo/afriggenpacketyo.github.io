          <p>President Trump has directed ICE to prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities, following protests against his administration's immigration policies. In a Truth Social post, he urged ICE to pursue the "single largest Mass Deportation Program in History," targeting cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. This move follows increased enforcement efforts and a directive to ICE officers to aim for 3,000 arrests daily. However, the administration has paused arrests at farms, restaurants, and hotels due to concerns about the impact on key industries reliant on immigrant labor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singer Nezza sang a Spanish version of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” also known as “El Pendón Estrellado,” at Dodger Stadium, despite being told to sing it in English. Nezza's performance sparked conversations about the origins of “El Pendón Estrellado,” resurfacing the legacy of Clotilde Arias, a Latina composer who translated the anthem in 1945. Arias' translation was commissioned by the U.S. State Department to strengthen ties with Latin American countries during World War II, and it was the only official translation allowed to be sung. For Nezza, Arias’ “El Pendón Estrellado” is a symbol of American pride and a piece of forgotten Latino history.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans released details of their version of President Trump's tax bill, proposing changes to tax and Medicaid provisions that differ from the House-passed version. Key differences include steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, permanent extension of the $10,000 state and local tax deduction (SALT), and a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling. The Senate version also includes provisions to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, while making tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term permanent. House Republicans have warned against significant changes to the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have pieced together a timeline of the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband, and the attempted murder of a second state elected politician. The suspect, Vance Boelter, allegedly disguised himself as a law enforcement officer and stalked his victims before attacking them. The timeline reveals that the attacks unfolded over a roughly 90-minute period, but were foiled by police before more victims could be targeted. Boelter's vehicle contained a notebook with the names and addresses of over 45 Minnesota state and federal elected officials, as well as information on abortion providers.</p>

Despite the tensions between Canada and the US, a Canadian win would be a "cherry on top", according to fans. The rivalry between the two countries really came to a head during the winter's 4 Nations Face Off, when Trump was repeatedly making digs at Canada by calling it the "51st state".</p>

          <p>China is leveraging its dominance in rare earth elements to gain an advantage in the trade war with the United States. Rare earths are essential components in modern technologies, including smartphones, electric vehicles, and military applications. With this leverage, China concluded high-level trade talks with the US in London, agreeing "in principle to a framework" for review by top leaders. This marks a shift from the 2018 trade talks, where China's attempts at moral persuasion failed to impress President Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sudan's war is in strategic stalemate, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage, resulting in increased hunger, displacement, and despair for the Sudanese people. The Sudan armed forces announced the recapture of central Khartoum in March, but its offensive quickly stalled. The RSF, responded with a drone attack on Port Sudan, and has expanded operations to the south of Khartoum. More than half of Sudan's 45 million people are displaced, and nearly a million are facing famine.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court to Hear Appeal in Coastal Damage Lawsuits Against Chevron</h2>

          <p>The Supreme Court will hear an appeal from Chevron, Exxon, and other oil and gas companies arguing that lawsuits seeking compensation for coastal land loss and environmental degradation in Louisiana should be heard in federal court. The companies are appealing a 2024 decision that kept the lawsuits in state courts, where a jury ordered Chevron to pay upwards of $740 million to clean up damage to the state's coastline. The companies argue that because they began oil production during World War II as federal contractors, the cases should be heard in federal court.</p>
