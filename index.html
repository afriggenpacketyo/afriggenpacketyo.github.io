          <p>The Education Department has stated that Columbia University is not in compliance with federal antidiscrimination laws, potentially jeopardizing its accreditation. The department's civil rights office informed the Middle States Commission on Higher Education that Columbia failed to address antisemitism on campus following the October 7 attack against Israel by Hamas. Education Secretary Linda McMahon accused the university's leadership of deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students. Losing accreditation would render Columbia ineligible to offer federal financial aid to its students, impacting access to federal student loans and Pell Grants. The university acknowledged the concerns and stated its commitment to combating antisemitism and working with the federal government to address the issue. The situation has garnered much attention, highlighting the complexities of balancing free speech and protecting students from harassment on college campuses. The department had previously determined that Columbia failed to meaningfully protect Jewish students from severe harassment. </p>

          <p>A climber has died after falling approximately 3,000 feet on Mount McKinley, also known as Denali, in Alaska's Denali National Park. Alex Chiu, 41, was ascending the West Buttress climbing route with two companions when the incident occurred at a location called Squirrel Point. High winds and snow hampered rescue efforts, delaying the recovery of Chiu's body for two days. The National Park Service reports that this section of the West Buttress route has seen multiple fatal falls since 1980. The beginning of June is the middle of the climbing season, and there are currently 500 climbers on Mount McKinley. This event serves as a somber reminder of the inherent risks involved in mountaineering and the unpredictable nature of high-altitude environments.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has initiated an investigation into Joe Biden's actions during his presidency, claiming that top aides concealed Biden's supposed "cognitive decline." The investigation will seek to discredit Biden and potentially overturn some of his executive actions. Biden dismissed the allegations as "ridiculous," asserting that he made all decisions during his presidency. GOP lawmakers are seeking testimony from Biden's former aides regarding his mental and physical capabilities. Trump's memo also criticizes Biden's use of an autopen. The investigation will be led by Pam Bondi and David Warrington. Democrats have dismissed the probe as a distraction, while Bill Clinton has defended Biden's mental soundness. This political clash reflects the ongoing partisan divide and the use of personal attacks in political discourse.</p>

          <p>The first New York City mayoral debate saw former Governor Andrew Cuomo, the perceived front-runner, facing significant criticism from his Democratic rivals. Candidates clashed over issues such as housing, Covid-19 response, and their approach to the Trump administration. Cuomo's past controversies, including sexual harassment allegations and handling of nursing home deaths during the pandemic, were prominent topics. The debate highlighted the diverse perspectives and policy proposals among the Democratic candidates vying for the city's top job. The absence of current Mayor Eric Adams from the debate stage also drew criticism from multiple participants. This initial debate sets the stage for a competitive and contentious primary election.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to halt operations at contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide has been temporarily blocked by a U.S. District Judge. This action has left thousands of students, who rely on the program for career training, housing, and assistance, in uncertainty. The Labor Department cited concerns about program outcomes and serious incident reports as justification for the "phased pause." However, Job Corps contractors sued, arguing the administration lacked the authority to dismantle a program established and funded by Congress. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have criticized the administration's move. Students like Emily Scott and Andrea Watts, who depend on Job Corps for their future careers, face significant challenges if the program is ultimately shut down. The program's yearly average cost per student was $80,000, and the Labor Department had found that the average graduation rate for the program was under 40%.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, who is accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. The order prevents the deportation of Soliman's family, who are Egyptian citizens, pending a hearing on June 13. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing individuals for the crimes of their relatives is unlawful and violates democratic justice principles. The White House had previously tweeted about the family's detention, suggesting their imminent deportation. Stephen Miller, a White House advisor, had previously suggested suspending the right to petition for habeas corpus for immigrants. This case highlights the complex intersection of immigration law, criminal justice, and family rights.</p>

The proclamation directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking the visas of foreign students already in the U.S. studying at Harvard. This action escalates the conflict between the Trump administration and Harvard, which has been ongoing for months.

President Trump asserted that any agreement would prohibit any enrichment of uranium, contradicting earlier reports that the interim proposal allowed low-level enrichment. The U.S. is seeking Russia's involvement in the negotiations. An Iranian official described the U.S.' proposed terms as "unreasonable, greedy, and unconventional."

          <p>President Trump has restricted most international students from studying at Harvard University, escalating the administration's battle with the Ivy League school. The proclamation suspends the entry of foreign students unless their entry is deemed in the national interest. The order also directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking the visas of current student visa holders. The order claims Harvard is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student programs. Harvard has responded by calling the order an illegal retaliatory step. The administration has repeatedly tried to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students. This action follows previous attempts to cut off federal funding to the school.</p>

          <p>The front pages of UK newspapers focus on Chancellor Rachel Reeves' expected "winter fuel U-turn," restoring payments to pensioners but clawing them back through higher taxes. Concerns are raised about potential "chaos" in recovering payments from deceased pensioners' families. The Daily Express highlights support for a full reversal to help pensioners. The i Paper reports an increase in recipients and reveals a donation to the Chancellor from a lobbying firm linked to a Thames Water bidder. The Mail emphasizes the "battle lines" over immigration, contrasting policies from Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch. The Financial Times reports that Trump's tax bill will increase US debt.

          <p>Three young sisters have been found dead in Washington state, and their father, Travis Decker, is wanted for murder and kidnapping. The girls' mother reported them missing after Decker failed to return them from a visit. Decker's unoccupied truck was found near a campground, and the girls' bodies were discovered during a search. Police believe the girls died from asphyxiation. Decker is described as having "extensive training" and being "well-versed" in outdoor survival. An Amber Alert was not initially issued because the situation did not meet the required criteria. The community is mourning the loss of the children.

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from Squaxin Island in Puget Sound. The operation, funded by a federal grant, removed 14 vessels from hard-to-reach coves and mudflats. The DNR opts to airlift boats to avoid disrupting the marine environment. Since 2002, the department has removed over 1,200 derelict vessels. Squaxin Island is of particular cultural importance to the Squaxin Island Tribe. The tribe supports the cleanup effort to maintain clean beaches and water for future generations.

          <p>Boeing has reached a $1.1 billion settlement with the US Justice Department to avoid prosecution over two fatal 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people. The settlement includes payments to the families of crash victims and funds for improving compliance and safety programs. Boeing will pay a criminal penalty, part of which was already paid in 2021. The agreement aims to address the company's role in the crashes. The crashes led to a global grounding of the 737 Max and significant scrutiny of Boeing's safety practices.

          <p>Donald Trump has signed a new proclamation imposing a travel ban on 12 countries and restricting travel from seven others. The ban is justified by national security concerns and alleged deficiencies in screening and vetting processes. The affected countries include Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Critics argue that the ban is discriminatory and will separate families. The decision follows a wave of hardline immigration policies implemented by the Trump administration.

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has shed light on the evolution of flight feathers. The study suggests that the development of flight feathers was crucial for early birds to surpass dinosaurs in flight capabilities. Researchers examined feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. The development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift was an essential feature of bird evolution. While most feathered dinosaurs could not fly, scientists believe that some species could glide or have powered flight. The study was published in the journal Science Bulletin.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have found that the first bacteria infants encounter after birth may protect them from dangerous infections. The study showed that specific bacteria, like Bifidobacterium longum, can halve the risk of young children being hospitalized with lung infections. Researchers analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns to identify the species present and tracked the babies' health for two years. Babies with B. longum were less likely to require hospitalization for lung infections. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery. The findings suggest that early microbial exposure plays a crucial role in immune system development.</p>
