          <p>Representative Elise Stefanik is reassessing her political trajectory after her nomination for U.N. ambassador was withdrawn, reportedly due to Speaker Mike Johnson's concerns about the House vote margin. Despite this setback, Stefanik has garnered increased support from President Trump and top GOP donors, fueling speculation about a potential run for New York governor in 2026. However, her relationship with Speaker Johnson has deteriorated, marked by public disagreements and distrust, particularly regarding promises of a leadership position and a spot on the Intelligence Committee. Despite these challenges, Stefanik remains resilient, leveraging her strong fundraising base and the support of influential figures like Newt Gingrich and Kevin McCarthy as she considers her next political move, emphasizing her commitment to serving New Yorkers.</p>

          <p>A German couple has been arrested in Oviedo, Spain, for allegedly locking up their three young children in a house described as a "house of horror" since December 2021. Spanish police rescued the children, twin 8-year-old boys and a 10-year-old boy, after a neighbor reported that they had not been attending school. The children were found living in unsanitary conditions, sleeping in caged beds, and were allegedly forced to wear diapers and face masks, with their parents preventing them from having contact with the outside world. The couple, a 53-year-old German man and a 48-year-old woman holding dual German and American citizenship, are now in custody, and the children have been placed in a care home.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reportedly been in contact with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele concerning Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant wrongfully deported to El Salvador last month. Abrego Garcia, who resided in Maryland with his family, was deported despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution, with the Trump administration alleging gang affiliation. A federal judge has denied a motion to further delay discovery in the case, ordering government officials to testify under oath, while Abrego Garcia's attorney is seeking his return to the United States. The Trump administration maintains that Abrego Garcia's alleged gang ties make him ineligible to return, a claim his wife and attorney deny.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has acknowledged that Americans may have to accept doing with less as a result of the ongoing trade war with China. Speaking at a Cabinet meeting, Trump suggested that while some may lament the reduction in available goods, such as children having fewer dolls, the trade war's impact would be more significant for China, which relies heavily on the U.S. market. Trump insisted that the U.S. does not need many of the goods imported from China, reiterating his stance that the U.S. has been exploited by other countries, with China being the primary offender.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has attributed the U.S. economy's contraction in the first quarter of 2025 to the policies of his predecessor, Joe Biden, suggesting that the effects of Biden's policies lingered into the new administration. Trump cited a wave of imports made by companies trying to avoid his promised tariffs and a drop in government spending as factors contributing to the GDP decline. This stance contrasts with his earlier efforts to claim credit for positive economic developments during Biden's term, with analysts attributing the economic downturn to uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policies. Andrew Bates, a former White House spokesman under Biden, criticized Trump's claims, stating that Biden handed Trump the best-performing economy in the world.</p>

          <p>Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai testified in federal court against the Justice Department's proposals, arguing that requiring Google to share its search data would be a "de facto divestiture" of the company's core intellectual property. Pichai emphasized Google's significant investments in AI and argued that the DOJ's remedies are dangerous and unprecedented. The DOJ is seeking penalties against Google for allegedly maintaining a monopoly on the search engine market, including spinning off its Chrome browser and prohibiting exclusive default placements.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a slowdown in the first quarter of 2025, shrinking by 0.3% due to a surge in imports ahead of President Trump's tariff policies. Economists cautioned that the GDP figures may be skewed due to the front-loading of purchases, but concerns about the tariffs' impact on the economy remain. The slowdown was also influenced by a decline in government spending, while the weak ADP employment numbers further fueled recession fears. Experts suggest that the economic data may prompt the Federal Reserve to delay further rate cuts.</p>
