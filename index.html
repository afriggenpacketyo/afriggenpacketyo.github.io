The victim, who arrived from Italy on May 6, was lured to Woeltz's SoHo home under the pretense of retrieving Bitcoin he had allegedly been forced to send Woeltz previously. Prosecutors detailed the gruesome torture, including electric shocks, cutting the victim's leg with a saw, and forcing him to smoke crack cocaine. The victim managed to escape and flag down a traffic agent. Evidence recovered from the scene included weapons, body armor, and disturbing photos of the victim. </p>

          <p>Doctors in Japan are denouncing the continued COVID-19 restrictions at hospitals, citing them as a violation of human rights. Despite the government downgrading the threat of COVID-19 in May 2023, many hospitals still impose strict visitation rules, such as mask requirements, temperature checks, and limited visiting hours. A group of physicians and social workers are calling for the abolition or reduction of these restrictions, arguing that they prevent families from seeing hospitalized loved ones, even those who are terminally ill. One doctor recounts his family's struggle to visit his wife's mother in the hospital, highlighting the contradictions in the hospital's policies.</p>

          <p>A new study in Scientific Reports suggests that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may be passing anxiety to their pets. The research found that when dog owners dwell on work problems after hours, their dogs show more signs of stress. Researchers surveyed 85 working dog owners and measured job stress, rumination, and dog stress-related behaviors. The study indicated that owners who mentally took work home were more likely to have stressed-out dogs, highlighting the concept of "crossover" stress from humans to pets.</p>

          <p>Alibaba’s Amap has launched a ride-hailing feature on its English version, catering to foreign visitors in mainland China. The feature allows transport in over 360 domestic cities. The new Amap feature reflects the private sector’s support for China’s visa-free travel scheme, which allows visitors from 43 countries to stay for up to 30 days on the mainland. During the Labour Day “golden week” holiday, some 380,000 foreign visitors entered the mainland visa-free, up 73 per cent from a year earlier.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the influential feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault," passed away at the age of 90. Her groundbreaking book challenged traditional views of sexual assault, arguing that it was a crime of power and violence rather than passion. The book contributed to significant legal reforms, including the criminalization of sexual assault within marriage and the implementation of rape shield laws. Despite the book's impact, Brownmiller faced criticism for her views on the role of all men in perpetuating fear in women and for comments she made later in life about young women and sexual assault.</p>
