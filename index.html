          <p>The recently passed tax bill introduces 'Trump Accounts,' offering a $1,000 baby bonus, similar to a 529 college savings plan. These accounts provide tax-deferred earnings growth, with qualified withdrawals taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate. While offering tax incentives, they face competition from existing options like custodial brokerage accounts and 529 plans, which may offer more flexibility or higher contribution limits. Financial advisors suggest that 529 plans may be superior for parents focused on higher education expenses due to federal tax-free growth and the ability to roll unused funds into a Roth IRA.

          <p>Republicans in the House passed President Trump's tax bill with a narrow 215-214 vote, marking a significant victory for the GOP. The bill includes various amendments designed to appease different factions within the party, such as moving up the timeline for Medicaid work requirements and increasing the cap on deductions for state and local taxes. Democrats vehemently oppose the bill, arguing it disproportionately benefits the wealthy and cuts essential social safety nets. The bill now faces a challenging path in the Senate, where several Republican senators have already expressed the need for significant changes. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Secretary announced that prisoners in England and Wales, including some serious offenders, may be eligible for release after serving a third of their sentence, inspired by reforms in Texas supermax prisons. This follows an independent sentencing review that ministers rejected recommendations for earlier release for the most serious offenders, who will still serve at least two-thirds of their sentence. The government aims to address prison overcrowding and reoffending rates by reducing sentences and increasing funding for the Probation Service and electronic monitoring, but victims' groups have raised concerns about the impact on public safety. The shadow justice secretary criticized the plans as a 'get out of jail free card for dangerous criminals'.</p>

The increases will affect most Nike shoes costing over $100, as well as clothing and equipment, with exemptions for certain products like Air Force 1 trainers and children's items.

          <p>The House has passed a bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000, up from the current $10,000 limit. This provision, part of President Trump's tax package, benefits filers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California who itemize deductions. The SALT cap and income phaseout would increase annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033, according to the text. However, the proposal may face challenges in the Senate, and it also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could lower the benefit of the higher SALT cap.

Analysts describe the bill as a 'worse than feared' scenario for clean energy, as it significantly undermines the Inflation Reduction Act.

          <p>A recent pause on the steepest tariffs on Chinese goods has led importers to increase orders from Asia, though not enough to eliminate the risk of retail shortages, according to a CNBC survey. While the tariff de-escalation deal is a positive step, retailers say the remaining import taxes are still too high to complete full orders. This situation is expected to result in lower inventory, fewer product selections, and potentially higher prices for consumers. Experts suggest that the supply chain is experiencing mixed signals, with uncertainty remaining in business decisions and potential recession risks amid ongoing trade pressures.</p>

          <p>The spring housing market continues to face challenges with sales of previously owned homes in April falling 0.5% from March, reaching the slowest pace for that month since 2009.

The median price of an existing home sold in April was $414,000, an increase of just 1.8% year-over-year, indicating a cooling of prices.

          <p>During a tense meeting in the White House, Donald Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with contested claims about the killings of white farmers. Trump presented a video of crosses falsely claimed to be burial sites and alleged a 'genocide' against white farmers, claims that have been widely debunked. He also played footage of South African politicians singing 'Kill the Boer,' a controversial song. These claims have been amplified by Trump supporters, despite evidence showing that murder rates are high in South Africa across all races, and there is no evidence of a 'white genocide'.</p>

          <h2>Is Investing in Gold a Good Move for Seniors with Prices High?</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While gold has surged in price in 2024 and 2025, it may still be a sensible investment for seniors seeking portfolio protection rather than aggressive growth. Gold is known for its stability and ability to hedge against volatility, making it attractive for retirees. However, it doesn't produce income like dividends or interest, and there's a risk of price pullback after the recent rally. Alternatives include fractional gold investing and gold ETFs, allowing for lower-cost entry. (not investment advice)</p>
