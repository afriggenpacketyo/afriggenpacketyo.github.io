          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 00:30:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 35% tariff on all Canadian imports, scheduled to take effect on August 1. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Trump cited Canada's retaliatory duties and its alleged role in the flow of fentanyl as primary justifications for the levy. This action represents a significant escalation in trade tensions, adding to existing tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and automobiles. The administration also warned that the tariff rate could increase further if Canada implements its own countermeasures, deepening the economic dispute between the two closely linked trading partners.</p>

          <p>Lord Robert Winston, a celebrated IVF pioneer and Labour peer, has resigned from the British Medical Association (BMA) in protest of planned strikes by resident doctors. The five-day walkout is part of an ongoing pay dispute with the UK government. Lord Winston, a BMA member since 1964, argued that such industrial action is inappropriate at a time when the country and its people are struggling, stating it could erode public trust in the medical profession. He emphasized that doctors have a profound responsibility to their vulnerable patients, who are often frightened and in pain.</p>

          <p>Caesar Sengupta, the co-founder and CEO of fintech startup Arta Finance, believes the most critical skill for entrepreneurs is the ability to ground themselves through meditation. Having raised over $92 million for his startup, which is backed by prominent figures like Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Sengupta advises founders to filter out the constant noise of the entrepreneurial world. The former Google executive, who led projects like Google Pay, explained that the startup journey is highly volatile and stressful. He stated that meditating for even a few minutes daily helps maintain mental health and focus amid the immense pressures of building a company.</p>

          <p>According to new research from Princeton University, harassment and threats targeting local school officials in the U.S. have surged by 170% since the COVID-19 pandemic. The study indicates a shift in the nature of these threats, which initially centered on pandemic-related mandates like masking. Now, the hostility is increasingly fueled by national culture war issues, including diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and LGBTQ+ policies in schools. Researchers noted that the intense distrust and division that developed during the pandemic created fertile ground for these new conflicts, affecting officials across the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental restoration effort, China has begun demolishing approximately 300 dams and shutting down hydropower stations along the Red River. This waterway is a crucial tributary in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and is considered the last refuge for many rare and endemic fish species. Over decades, the dense network of dams has severely restricted water flow, blocking fish migration routes and damaging the ecosystem. This large-scale project aims to reverse the ecological degradation, reconnect migratory paths, and preserve the unique biodiversity of the region's aquatic life.</p>

In addition, the department plans to close or merge numerous domestic offices to streamline operations and consolidate functions. Critics express concern that these reductions could undermine the nation's diplomatic effectiveness, while the administration argues the changes are necessary to eliminate a "bloated bureaucracy" and focus on core priorities.</p>

While acknowledging the F-35's technological superiority, the NAO described the capability gained from the £11 billion spent so far as a "disappointing return."

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted serial killers known as the "Hillside Stranglers" who terrorized Los Angeles in the 1970s, has been denied parole after 46 years in prison. A California parole board made the decision after hearing testimony from victims and prosecutors. Bianchi and his cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., were responsible for the murders of at least 12 women, whom they often lured by impersonating police officers before subjecting them to sexual assault and torture. The board determined that Bianchi, now 74, will not be eligible for another parole hearing for ten years.</p>

The Martian rock, designated NWA 16788, is expected to fetch as much as $4 million. It was discovered in the Sahara Desert in 2023 after traveling an estimated 140 million miles through space, likely dislodged from Mars by an asteroid impact. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, accounting for only about 0.6% of all meteorites found on our planet, making this a significant event for collectors and scientists.</p>

          <p>As ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas remain deadlocked, a deadly strike in central Gaza has killed at least 15 civilians, including ten children, who were waiting outside a health clinic. The U.S.-based charity Project HOPE, which runs the clinic, said the patients had gathered to receive nutritional supplements and treatment for malnutrition. The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted a terrorist participant from the October 7th attack and said it was investigating the incident and regretted any harm to uninvolved individuals. The event highlights the devastating civilian toll of the war as diplomatic efforts falter.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable and unlikely discovery, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science has found a dinosaur fossil directly beneath its own parking lot. The hockey-puck-shaped bone fragment was uncovered in a core sample taken from a bore hole drilled over 750 feet deep as part of a geothermal energy study. Curators believe the fossil is a vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur that lived approximately 67.5 million years ago. Museum officials described the find as incredibly rare, likening the odds to hitting a hole-in-one from the moon, and have now put Denver's deepest and oldest dinosaur discovery on display.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House, a meeting that coincided with his company becoming the first to close a trading day with a market valuation over $4 trillion. The context for the meeting is significant, as Nvidia has been grappling with the Trump administration's export controls on its advanced AI chips to China, which were implemented for national security reasons. President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance in a social media post, attributing its rise to his tariff policies. The discussion's specifics were not disclosed, but it highlights the intersection of big tech, global trade, and politics.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent threat to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports is based on a broad interpretation of his emergency economic powers that is already facing a significant legal challenge. This article notes that Trump is invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the tariff, partly as retaliation for the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Critics and legal experts argue this is an abuse of power, especially since the IEEPA is meant for foreign threats to the U.S. Furthermore, the justification incorrectly claims a trade deficit with Brazil, when the U.S. actually runs a surplus.</p>

The plaintiff, Lauren Pisciotta, now claims Ye forced her to perform oral sex, sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions, and engaged in sexual acts with other employees at the Yeezy offices. The amended complaint also alleges that Ye stalked her after she filed her initial lawsuit by moving into her apartment complex and arranging a "swatting" incident at her home.

          <p>Moon Tae-il, a former singer for the popular K-Pop group NCT, has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison by a Seoul court. The sentence comes after the 31-year-old musician pleaded guilty to charges of special quasi-sexual assault for his role in the assault of an intoxicated woman in 2024. Two other men involved in the incident also received prison sentences. The court noted the grave nature of the crime, where the defendants took advantage of a victim who was unable to resist. Taeil was removed from NCT in August 2024 after his agency became aware of the criminal case.</p>

In his new book, he identifies eight key words that consistently resonate with voters across different cultures and political affiliations: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. He argues these words act as powerful "emotional shortcuts" that can be bent to fit various political narratives. While not a guarantee of victory, he suggests these words are the fundamental building blocks for crafting memorable and persuasive campaign messages.</p>

          <p>Irvine Welsh, the acclaimed author of the novel "Trainspotting," has expressed deep concern about the impact of modern technology on society. As he prepares to publish a new sequel, Welsh stated that the internet and social media have become controlling forces rather than enabling ones. He fears that humanity is becoming a collection of "dumbed down machines" taking instructions, with artificial intelligence on one side and a growing "natural stupidity" on the other. Welsh, who understands addiction, believes our constant connection to phones is making our brains atrophy and hopes for a more judicious use of technology in the future.</p>
