          <p>The Powerball jackpot climbed to an estimated $700 million after Saturday's drawing yielded no grand prize winner, marking the 36th consecutive round without one. The winning numbers were 11, 14, 34, 47, 51, and Powerball 18. While the top prize remains unclaimed, several players secured significant winnings, including a Tennessee player who won $2 million. This jackpot is the largest of the year, though it still falls short of 2024's record $1.3 billion prize.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 5-1 to the San Diego Padres, managing only two hits, which resulted in them falling out of first place in the National League West. Padres starter Nestor Cortes unexpectedly dominated, throwing six scoreless innings, while Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow struggled in the fourth. This defeat puts the Padres one game ahead, reversing the Dodgers' previous two-game lead and setting up a potential sweep. The series highlights the Padres' strong bullpen and recent trade deadline acquisitions.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration despite a judge's order, is now facing a new threat of deportation to Uganda, a country he has no ties to. After being returned to the US and released from jail, immigration officials instructed him to report for deportation to Uganda, or accept a plea deal for deportation to Costa Rica. His case has become a symbol of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies, which critics argue often disregard due process. Lawyers are fighting this latest deportation attempt, citing the severe human rights concerns in Uganda.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock plunged by almost $100 million in market value after the company unveiled a new, simplified logo, removing its traditional "Uncle Herschel" character. This redesign, part of CEO Julie Felss Masino's effort to modernize the 55-year-old chain, sparked a strong negative reaction on Wall Street and among some conservative commentators who labeled it "woke." Marketing experts also criticized the move, warning it risks alienating long-time customers who felt a strong connection to the original brand identity. The company clarified that its values and the "Uncle Herschel" character remain central to its restaurant experience.</p>

This comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula, following South Korean warning shots at North Korean troops who briefly crossed the DMZ, and ongoing joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea.

          <p>The UK government plans to overhaul its asylum appeals system by establishing a new independent body with adjudicators to expedite case hearings. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated this aims to address "unacceptable delays" in appeals, which currently average over a year for 51,000 pending cases, costing taxpayers for hotel accommodation. The initiative seeks to fulfill a pledge to end the use of asylum hotels, which currently house 32,000 asylum seekers. The announcement follows rising public frustration and protests over hotel use, with legal challenges already emerging.</p>

While some see it as a display of civic pride, others express unease, noting the flags' historical association with far-right movements and the timing amidst protests against asylum seeker housing.

While some petitions have led to legislative change, like "Finn's Law" for police animals, many others, including those with millions of signatures, have not resulted in direct policy shifts. The system has also seen numerous humorous or "joke" petitions, leading some critics to argue it creates an "illusion of a feedback loop" rather than genuine public engagement.

The Republican-backed proposal aims to redraw the state's congressional map, creating five new GOP-leaning districts to secure a narrow House majority for the 2026 midterms, a move supported by former President Trump. Democrats have vowed legal challenges, arguing the plan dilutes minority voting power and undermines fair representation. The bill's passage follows a weeks-long standoff where Texas House Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum, and California's governor introduced a counter-redistricting plan.</p>

          <p>New Israeli strikes and shootings in Gaza killed at least 33 people, including those sheltering in tents and seeking food aid, according to local hospitals. This escalation comes as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) declared famine gripping Gaza City, a rare and severe pronouncement that intensified global pressure on Israel to halt its offensive. Israel denounced the famine report as "lies" while preparing for a Gaza City offensive. Efforts for a ceasefire are on hold, with the humanitarian situation deteriorating amidst continued conflict and aid restrictions.</p>

          <p>Lt. General Jeffrey Kruse has been ousted as Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) director, with no reason given to intelligence committee leaders. Senator Mark Warner criticized the move as another instance of the Trump administration treating intelligence as a "loyalty test." This follows a DIA assessment that military strikes set back Iran's nuclear program by months, contradicting President Trump's claim of "total obliteration." DIA employees expressed widespread concern about their work being politicized. The article also notes the removal of other senior military officials without consultation from top military brass, signaling potential instability within defense leadership.</p>

          <p>The US immigrant population has decreased by over a million people since January, falling from a record 53.3 million to 51.9 million by June, according to a Pew Research Center study. This decline, the first in over 50 years, is attributed to the Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies, including 181 executive actions targeting new arrivals and mass deportations. The study also notes a drop of 750,000 immigrant workers from the labor force. Critics argue these policies, alongside previous asylum restrictions, are dismantling the immigration system, though a declining survey response rate among immigrants may also contribute to the data change.</p>

          <p>A male killer whale named Keijo at the closed Marineland Antibes in France is being sexually stimulated by trainers to prevent him from inbreeding with his mother, Wikie. The zoo's closure, ahead of a French law banning whale shows, has left the orcas in limbo as rehoming plans remain undecided. Activists raised concerns after footage emerged, though Marineland managers assert the practice is necessary, natural, and painless to relieve Keijo's sexual urges. The situation highlights the ethical complexities and challenges of managing captive marine animals, especially when facilities close and suitable sanctuaries are lacking.</p>

          <p>Anastasia Samsonova was among the first Russian tourists to visit North Korea's new Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Zone, a resort touted as Kim Jong Un's vision for tourism. Her trip, like others, was tightly controlled with guides and guards, a fixed itinerary, and rules against photographing construction or wearing revealing clothes. Despite the restrictions, Samsonova enjoyed the "vacation without people" on pristine, empty beaches. The resort's development has faced criticism over alleged harsh worker treatment, and its current limited access to only Russian tourists highlights North Korea's cautious approach to foreign visitors, aiming to prevent citizens from comparing their lives with wealthier outsiders.</p>

          <p>The Democratic governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut are challenging a Trump administration order that halted construction on the nearly complete Revolution Wind farm off their coasts. The US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued the stop-work order, citing unspecified "national security interests" and a need to re-examine the project under Trump's directive to review existing wind energy leases. The governors and Senator Chris Murphy allege political motivation, linking the decision to Trump's reported campaign donations from the oil industry. This action, the second such halt by the administration, jeopardizes the states' climate goals and highlights the ongoing conflict between fossil fuel and renewable energy policies.</p>

These reconstructions reveal features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries, providing insights into early inhabitants and migration routes. The findings support claims of an independent urban civilization in southern India dating back to 580 BC, challenging traditional narratives focused solely on the north.

          <p>Several major European parcel companies, including DHL, Royal Mail, and national post offices, are temporarily suspending some shipments to the US. This action is a direct response to a new Trump administration executive order, effective August 29, that eliminates the "de minimis" rule, which previously allowed duty-free entry for packages under $800. The companies cite ambiguous policies and insufficient time to establish new logistics systems for collecting customs duties and transmitting data to US Customs and Border Protection. This policy change, aimed at increasing tariff revenue and preventing illicit goods, is causing significant disruption for international parcel services. (not investment advice)</p>

Offenders released on probation could also face similar restrictions and mandatory drug testing.
