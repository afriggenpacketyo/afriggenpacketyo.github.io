          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading as Wall Street saw gains driven by a tech rally. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell after reaching a record high, following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation, while South Korea's Kospi rose. Indonesia's Jakarta Composite Index dropped after a surprise finance minister dismissal, and the rupiah weakened. This market activity reflects regional political uncertainties and broader global economic influences, including anticipation of US inflation data and potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

          <p>Residents of Gaza City are experiencing widespread panic and displacement following intensified Israeli military orders to evacuate the area, which Israel describes as a "mighty hurricane" of strikes if Hamas does not release hostages. The humanitarian situation is dire, with many of Gaza's two million residents already displaced multiple times since October 2023. Meanwhile, reports of a drone attack on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla in Tunisia were dismissed by Tunisian authorities, who stated a fire broke out on the vessel itself. The UN Special Rapporteur noted a history of attacks on such flotillas, calling for verification of the incident. This highlights the escalating conflict and the severe impact on civilian populations and aid efforts.</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially joined the contest for Labour's deputy leader, becoming the most prominent candidate to declare so far. This race follows Angela Rayner's departure and sees other potential contenders like Lucy Powell and Emily Thornberry considering bids. The tight three-day nomination window has drawn criticism from some within the party, including Bell Ribeiro-Addy, who argues it's unfair and prevents a broader discussion on the party's direction. Phillipson emphasizes her working-class background and commitment to Labour values, aiming to counter the threat from Reform UK. The contest takes place as Labour is in government, with a focus on delivering electoral promises. This internal election will help shape the party's future leadership. </p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security revealed a case where foreign agents, disguised as charity workers, attempted to gather sensitive information about Chinese military facilities. Operatives trained by a foreign intelligence organization, allegedly affiliated with a country's defense ministry, infiltrated southwestern mountainous areas under the guise of mountaineering and charitable relief. They conducted illegal surveying of restricted military zones. Villagers near one such zone grew suspicious of a worker named Xia, whose persistent questions about the military led to the exposure of the espionage ring. This incident highlights ongoing concerns about foreign infiltration and national security in China.</p>

          <p>A long-standing succession battle within Rupert Murdoch's media empire has concluded, with his son Lachlan set to control the news group, including Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. The agreement ensures the conservative leaning of these outlets will continue after Rupert's death, with siblings Prudence, Elisabeth, and James Murdoch ceasing to be beneficiaries of the trust holding Fox and News Corp shares. They are poised to sell their holdings for $1.1 billion each, ending years of family tension that inspired the TV drama 'Succession.' This resolution solidifies Lachlan's leadership without interference from his more politically moderate older siblings. The outcome is seen as a victory for Rupert Murdoch, albeit an expensive one, securing the ideological future of his vast media conglomerate.</p>

Trump has denied writing the letter, calling it "fake" and filing a defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for its report on the book. The White House also denies the authenticity of the signature. The 238-page book, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, lists Trump under the 'Friends' category. This release follows a subpoena for information from Epstein's estate and comes amid ongoing scrutiny of his connections.

This appeal comes as BRICS nations collectively push back against US President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have caused global economic unease. India's External Affairs Minister emphasized the need for smoother trade flows and stronger cooperation within the bloc. While India primarily views BRICS as an economic initiative, other members like China and Russia see it as a geopolitical grouping. The article notes that India's trade deficit with China reached a record high of $99.21 billion, and with Russia, it hit $59 billion, largely due to increased oil imports. Despite strained relations with the US over tariffs, recent conciliatory statements from both President Trump and Prime Minister Modi suggest a potential path to addressing sticking points.

Trusts are scored on seven areas, including waiting times and finances, and categorized to guide support and incentivize improvement. However, NHS Providers questioned the metrics, warning that a narrow focus on rankings could have unintended consequences. The initiative aims to drive up standards, with top performers gaining more autonomy and underperformers receiving support, potentially impacting leadership pay.

His initial eight-year sentence was commuted to one year by the King, and he was paroled after six months. The court found he was not in a critical condition justifying the hospital stay. This decision marks a significant development for the influential Shinawatra political dynasty, whose daughter Paetongtarn was recently removed from office.

This cultural war, the article contends, provides ideological justification for legislative changes that undermine rights for vulnerable populations. Similarly, Reform UK's call for a "patriotic" British history curriculum aims to reframe the nation's story, paving the way for policies like mass deportations. The author asserts that this project seeks to "repeal the 20th century," dismantling frameworks for race relations, women's rights, and worker protections. Resisting this requires building cross-communal solidarities to defend democratic achievements.</p>

          <h2>Apple to Unveil New iPhone Lineup Amid Trump Trade War and Potential Price Hikes</h2>

          <p>Apple is set to unveil its new iPhone lineup, likely the iPhone 17, amidst a global trade war initiated by the Trump administration that could lead to higher prices. Despite President Trump's demands for US manufacturing, the new iPhones are expected to be produced in China and India. Apple CEO Tim Cook has attempted to placate Trump with increased US investment, but iPhones imported into the US still face 25% duties. This has fueled speculation of Apple's first across-the-board price increase in five years, potentially adding $50-$100 to some models. The new lineup is anticipated to offer minor updates, with significant AI improvements delayed until next year, raising questions about Apple's innovation in the fast-moving AI era.

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel faces his sternest challenge yet as his team prepares for a World Cup qualifier against Serbia in Belgrade's hostile Rajko Mitic Stadium. Despite a flawless record of four wins and no goals conceded in qualifying, England's performances have been criticized as drab and lacking identity since Tuchel succeeded Sir Gareth Southgate. The match in Belgrade will test the team's temperament in a fervent atmosphere, compounded by a partial stadium closure due to past fan misconduct. Tuchel views this encounter as a "proof of concept," a crucial measure of England's progress and direction under his leadership. With limited games before the World Cup squad selection, the match offers a vital opportunity for Tuchel to imprint his tactical vision on the team. This article highlights the pressure on Tuchel to demonstrate an upgrade on the Southgate era.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia is commissioning its nearly $5 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a mega hydropower project expected to double the country's electricity output. The event proceeds amid unconfirmed reports from an Ethiopian magazine suggesting up to 15,000 deaths during the 14-year construction, a claim the Water and Energy Minister neither confirmed nor denied. Ethiopia self-funded the core construction, making it a model for African countries seeking control over major projects, though Chinese loans supported auxiliary infrastructure. Downstream neighbors Sudan and Egypt remain concerned about water supplies, despite Ethiopia's assurances of adherence to principles and data sharing. Years of negotiations have yet to yield a water-sharing agreement, but Ethiopia asserts its readiness for dialogue.
