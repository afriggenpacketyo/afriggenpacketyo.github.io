          <p>The U.S. Office of the Special Counsel has initiated an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led probes into Donald Trump. The inquiry centers on potential violations of the Hatch Act, which restricts the political activities of federal employees. This action follows a request from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's push for a "rushed trial" of Trump before the election constituted partisan interference. Smith, who resigned in January, had overseen the investigations into Trump's handling of classified documents and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

          <p>Actress Kristin Davis recently shared her experience on the set of the 1990s drama "Melrose Place," revealing that one of her co-stars refused to speak to her. While she did not name the individual, Davis described the set as competitive and intimidating, though she noted the person is now friendly to her. The experience influenced her to be a "welcoming committee" for guest actors on "Sex and the City" to prevent others from feeling the same discomfort. Davis also recalled her surprise at being cast in the role over future Oscar-winner Hilary Swank.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme involving military procurement. The scheme allegedly involved inflating the prices of drones and electronic warfare systems by up to 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, a critical issue for Ukraine's bid to join the European Union. The arrests follow the recent restoration of independence to the country's anti-corruption bodies after public protests against a government bill that sought to curtail their power.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, following the release of a July jobs report that showed slower-than-expected hiring.

The move has drawn criticism from economists and some lawmakers, who warn that it threatens the integrity and independence of federal economic data.

The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest example of this trend, with over 4,400 similar facilities already operating nationwide. According to the global theme park industry association, the number of attractions is forecast to grow significantly in the coming years. This strategy aims to create a powerful economic multiplier effect, where revenue from parks drives broader growth in the surrounding regions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense targeting individuals who use the internet to advertise or promote illegal crossings of the English Channel. The proposed law, part of a broader bill, could result in up to five years in prison for those creating online material that facilitates illegal immigration, such as offering fake documents or transport. According to the Home Office, a high percentage of migrants use social media to contact smuggling gangs. The move aims to give law enforcement more power to disrupt the business models of these criminal networks.</p>

          <p>Decades after the "Son of Sam" terrorized New York City, two survivors have shared their stories of the attacks that changed their lives forever. Robert Violante was on his first date with Stacy Moskowitz when David Berkowitz shot them; Violante was permanently blinded, and Moskowitz died from her injuries. Another survivor, Carl Denaro, was shot in the head months earlier and required a metal plate in his skull. Both men expressed relief when Berkowitz was captured, ending his year-long reign of violence that left six people dead and seven wounded.</p>

          <p>The Ottawa County Sheriff's new $360,000 patrol boat, which had its maiden voyage just two months ago, sank at a marina in Port Clinton, Ohio, during a severe storm. Officials believe a rapid rise in water level, known as a seiche, combined with high winds, may have caused the vessel to take on water and submerge. The boat was raised within a few hours by pumping the water out. While the engines are reportedly okay, the electronics and interior likely sustained significant damage, though the full cost of repairs is still being assessed.</p>

          <p>A global TikTok trend involving Labubu dolls has been exploited by criminals producing dangerous counterfeit versions, leading to major seizures by UK authorities. Trading Standards officers have found that the fake dolls, which are sold cheaply, easily fall apart and create serious choking hazards for children. The popularity of the authentic dolls, made by Pop Mart, has led to them selling out instantly, creating a lucrative market for both scalpers and counterfeiters. Authorities warn that these fakes are often made with unsafe materials and can be traced to criminal organizations.</p>

The demonstrations highlight the ongoing tensions surrounding the UK's asylum policy. The Home Office has stated it is reducing the number of hotels used for this purpose and plans to phase them out entirely by 2029 to cut costs.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin publicly criticized his players' mentality, ego, and effort following a disappointing 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their opening league match. Martin stated his team was "lucky to get a point" and that some players needed to "drop their ego," describing the issue as a "mentality problem" rather than a tactical one. The blunt post-game comments, coming after just one competitive match, have been described as extreme by pundits. This marks the third consecutive season that Rangers have failed to win their opening league fixture.</p>
