The study showed a 70-80% alleviation of symptoms in volunteers exposed to the sound before experiencing motion. </p>

          <p>California is running out of license plate combinations and will introduce a new sequence for newly registered vehicles starting next year. The new sequence will feature three numerals, followed by three letters, and one numeral (e.g., 000AAA0). The state is exhausting its current sequence earlier than expected, partly due to increased car registrations amid fears that President Trump's tariffs will raise car prices. The state is currently processing license plates in the 9UBA000-9UBZ999 range. </p>

Trump stated that "most of the major points are agreed to," urging both nations to finalize the deal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said territorial issues could be discussed if a ceasefire is agreed upon. Reports suggest Ukraine would cede land annexed by Russia under the U.S. proposal, which Trump supports Russia keeping the Crimean peninsula. </p>

Now, China is attacking American "bullying" and seeking international support for its position, indicating a hardening of attitudes.

          <p>The Trump administration accused UC Berkeley of failing to disclose millions of dollars in foreign funding. The inquiry revives a 2023 House subcommittee investigation into the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, a partnership between UC Berkeley’s College of Engineering and China’s Tsinghua University begun in 2016. UC Berkeley said the school has already been in contact with federal authorities about the issue. The audits are the latest in a barrage of administrative actions against elite universities around the country. </p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack in Kashmir, DW examines the major militant groups in the conflict, exploring their local impact and global jihadi connections. The Resistance Front (TRF) emerged in 2019 in the aftermath of India's abrogation of Article 370, which stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its special constitutional status. Other groups include Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Al Badr, and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGH). The militant landscape in Kashmir is fluid. Factions frequently change allegiances, and share fighters — making the insurgency difficult to track, contain, or eliminate. </p>
