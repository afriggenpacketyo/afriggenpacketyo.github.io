This marks the first time the former Kuomintang chairman has explicitly stated this view on the mainland, emphasizing it must not involve force and should respect the will of the Taiwanese people. In response, a mainland official stated that Taiwan's future should be decided by all Chinese people on both sides of the strait, highlighting the differing perspectives on the region's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A plan to build a harsh, outdoor migrant detention camp in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by state officials, has sparked outrage from environmental, immigration, and tribal groups. The facility is intended to support the Trump administration's goal of detaining 3,000 undocumented migrants daily in a remote area known for extreme heat, alligators, and pythons. Critics have condemned the project as inhumane and environmentally destructive, citing its location on protected wetlands.</p>
