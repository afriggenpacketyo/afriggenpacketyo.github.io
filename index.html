          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a U.S.-brokered peace deal in Washington, aiming to conclude decades of conflict. The agreement calls for the disarmament of armed groups in eastern DR Congo, a region rich in minerals vital for electronics. Despite skepticism due to the failure of past deals and ambiguity over the withdrawal of Rwandan troops, U.S. and Congolese leaders have hailed it as a significant diplomatic achievement. Key details regarding the M23 rebels and the return of refugees remain unspecified pending the full release of the treaty's terms.</p>

The S&P 500 has climbed over 20% since an April low, fueled by cautious investor optimism regarding eased tariff policies and signs of a healthy economy. While a sudden termination of trade talks with Canada caused a brief dip, the market recovered, demonstrating resilience. Recent data shows inflation remains relatively low and hiring is sturdy, contributing to the positive market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial advisor Ric Edelman now suggests that investment portfolios should allocate between 10% to 40% to cryptocurrencies, a significant increase from his previous recommendation of a low single-digit percentage. He attributes this shift to the maturation of crypto into a mainstream asset, with regulatory questions being resolved and institutional adoption growing via products like Bitcoin ETFs. Edelman also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-bond model is obsolete due to increased human longevity, necessitating assets like crypto for higher potential returns.

The high temperatures coincide with major events like the Glastonbury Festival and the start of Wimbledon, which could see its hottest opening day on record.

          <p>A study by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that approximately 56 million private-sector workers in the U.S. do not have access to a retirement savings plan through their employer. This lack of access creates a significant barrier to building wealth for retirement, exacerbating the divide between retirement haves and have-nots. Research indicates that employees are 15 times more likely to save for retirement when contributions are automatically deducted from their paychecks. The findings highlight a potential crisis, as millions may have to rely solely on a strained Social Security system in their later years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The job market for entry-level technology roles is shrinking, partly due to the increasing capability of artificial intelligence to perform coding tasks previously done by junior software engineers. This trend is causing a shift in the perception of computer science as a guaranteed career path, with some students reconsidering their majors. Experts suggest that AI's proficiency in coding makes senior engineers more productive, reducing the need for new hires. The article suggests this disruption may force higher education to re-emphasize durable, human-centric skills over preprofessional training that can be quickly rendered obsolete by technology.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the immediate termination of all trade discussions with Canada, citing Ottawa's implementation of a digital services tax on large technology companies. In a social media post, Trump called the tax a "blatant attack" on the U.S. and stated that new tariff rates for Canada would be announced within a week. The move jeopardizes a critical trade relationship and comes just a week after the president met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, reading her dissent from the bench, argued that a decision curbing lower courts' power to block executive orders leaves fundamental rights vulnerable. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson described the ruling as an "existential threat to the rule of law," warning it gifts the executive branch the power to disregard the law. These dissents highlight a deep ideological divide and a growing sense of crisis among the court's minority.</p>

The move is a significant victory for Hollywood studios, unions, and workers who have been lobbying for support as productions are increasingly lured to other states with more generous incentives. Governor Gavin Newsom and industry leaders hope the expanded program will bring productions back to California and revitalize the local industry.

          <p>The recent 12-day conflict, which saw U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities followed by a swift ceasefire, offers insight into President Trump's foreign policy approach in his second term. Despite ordering the attack, Trump quickly pivoted to de-escalation, suggesting a continued aversion to prolonged "regime change" wars favored by some hawks. The analysis posits that Trump views military force not as a tool for transformational change but as a way to gain leverage for negotiations. His actions indicate a preference for dealing with existing leaders at the table, using military action as a means to secure a better deal.</p>

          <p>Irish singer CMAT, speaking at the Glastonbury Festival, revealed that she continues to face daily online abuse after releasing a song that went viral on TikTok. The track, "Take A Sexy Picture Of Me," was written in response to being fat-shamed following a festival appearance last year. The 29-year-old artist, whose real name is Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, stated the comments are so severe that she does not keep the TikTok app on her phone. She noted the sad irony that while the song has resonated with many who relate to its themes, it underscores a pervasive and harmful online culture.</p>

          <p>The new independent film "Ponyboi," written by and starring River Gallo, shines a light on the intersex experience through the story of a Latine sex worker in New Jersey. The film, which evolved from Gallo's USC thesis project, is the first feature produced by Fox Entertainment's indie label, Tideline. Gallo, who is intersex, uses the narrative to explore themes of trauma, identity, and the search for freedom and self-acceptance. The project aims to provide much-needed visibility for the intersex community, whose stories are often invisible in mainstream culture and are impacted by anti-trans legislation.</p>

          <p>Crypto exchange Coinbase has become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the month of June, surging over 40%. The rally is attributed to its recent inclusion in the benchmark index, positive regulatory developments like the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches. Analysts also point to the market undervaluing Coinbase's lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. Despite concerns about declining trading volumes, some experts believe the stock has further room to grow as legislative clarity and institutional adoption of crypto continue to evolve.

          <p>President Trump has indicated that the early July deadline for reinstating high tariffs on numerous countries is not set in stone and could be extended. This flexibility applies to a 90-day pause on his "reciprocal tariffs," which are set to revert to their original, much higher rates on July 8 unless his executive order is revised. The administration has so far only secured limited trade frameworks with China and the UK, leaving many other nations facing significant economic impact. The president stated that his administration would soon inform countries what they must pay to do business with the United States.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, academics and former diplomats express a wide range of opinions on the action's effectiveness and consequences. Perspectives gathered by NPR range from John Bolton's view that only regime change can bring stability, to a former Iranian official's belief that direct U.S.-Iran negotiations are the only path forward. Other experts noted that Iran's diminished capabilities might force it to reconsider its strategies, while some warned that the strikes bypass international law and could reshape regional security perceptions. The diverse viewpoints underscore the deep fractures in policy analysis regarding the Middle East.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues in favor of new congressional bills that would ban Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from wearing masks or otherwise concealing their identities during enforcement actions. The authors contend that masked, unidentifiable officers undermine public trust, create safety risks, and evoke images of authoritarian regimes, which is contrary to policing in a democracy. While ICE claims the practice is for officer safety, the article asserts that transparency and accountability are fundamental to law enforcement legitimacy. The piece concludes that such common-sense measures are vital to separate democratic law enforcement from the actions of a secret police force.</p>

          <p>President Trump celebrated a Supreme Court ruling that curbs the power of lower federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions against his executive actions. Speaking from the White House, Trump called the 6-3 decision a "monumental victory," specifically in the context of his order to end birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, its decision limits a key tool used by opponents to block presidential policies. Democrats criticized the ruling, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer calling it a "terrifying step toward authoritarianism" that weakens judicial checks on executive power.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's recent decision focused on the use of universal, or nationwide, injunctions, a powerful tool used by single federal judges to block government policies across the entire country. The ruling states that this practice likely exceeds the authority granted to federal courts, effectively ending its use as a default remedy against executive orders. This is seen as a major victory for the Trump administration, which has faced numerous nationwide injunctions against its policies. Legal experts predict that challengers to federal policy will now shift their strategy towards class-action lawsuits to achieve broad relief.</p>
