          <p>An article in the South China Morning Post analyzes the flaws in the US's attempt at industrial policy, particularly its focus on containing China and reshoring manufacturing.  The author highlights the recent raid on a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia, where hundreds of South Korean technicians were detained for alleged visa violations, as a prime example of the policy's contradictions and negative consequences. This incident underscores the challenges of implementing industrial policy in a post-industrial economy and its potential disruptions to globalization and global trade. The article concludes by emphasizing the counterproductive nature of the current approach.</p>

          <p>China issued a warning to Mexico regarding its planned increase in tariffs on Asian-made vehicles, particularly from China.  Mexico intends to raise tariffs to 50%, prompting China to threaten countermeasures.  This action is viewed within the context of ongoing trade tensions between China and the US, with China emphasizing the importance of free trade and opposing the use of tariffs as a tool of coercion.  The potential impact on the economic relationship between China and Mexico, and the broader implications for global trade, are significant concerns.</p>

President Trump is expected to attend Kirk's planned funeral. The use of Air Force Two for the transport of Kirk's remains underscores the high profile of the deceased and the political significance of the event.</p>
