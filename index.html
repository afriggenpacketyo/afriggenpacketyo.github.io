        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Syria is conducting its first parliamentary elections after more than forty years of dictatorial rule, employing a complex, indirect voting system due to the ongoing instability and displacement of millions. Instead of a direct public vote, an appointed Supreme Committee selects electoral colleges, which then choose 121 members for the new People's Assembly. The process has drawn criticism for its potential for manipulation and the significant power it grants the interim president, who will directly appoint an additional 70 members. While some see it as a necessary first step towards democracy, many minority and civil society groups have questioned its legitimacy.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is set to enforce a significant policy change for journalists, requiring them to sign a pledge promising not to gather any information, including unclassified reports, that has not been officially authorized for release. This new rule dramatically alters the landscape for media covering the Department of Defense. Officials have confirmed that any journalist who fails to comply with this policy will have their press credentials revoked. This action effectively cuts off their access to the headquarters of the largest department within the U.S. government, raising concerns about press freedom and transparency.</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Mango nightclub in Birmingham has left four people injured, including one man who is now in critical condition. West Midlands Police responded to the incident on Bristol Street around 3:00 AM BST, discovering that three men and one woman had sustained wounds. Shortly after the event, authorities arrested three individuals in their 20s and 30s on suspicion of violent disorder after locating their vehicle on the M6 motorway. A major city route has been closed as the investigation continues, with police appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has mandated a new $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applicants, a program for skilled foreign workers, citing a need to prevent abuse and encourage hiring American citizens. The executive order has drawn sharp criticism from immigration lawyers and small businesses, who warn it could devastate their ability to attract necessary talent and harm U.S. competitiveness in the tech sector. Major tech companies like Amazon have advised employees on H-1B visas to adjust their travel plans, anticipating significant disruption from the policy which takes effect imminently.

          <p>A memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot last week, is scheduled for Sunday in Arizona, with President Trump and Vice President Vance among the speakers. The event is expected to draw tens of thousands and has been designated a high-security event. Kirk's death has intensified the national debate on political violence, with figures from both parties condemning the act while also engaging in heated rhetoric about its causes and implications.

          <p>Major German cities are bracing for a weekend of large-scale demonstrations, including simultaneous protests concerning abortion and climate change. Anti-abortion groups are organizing "March for Life" rallies in Berlin and Cologne, with thousands expected to attend, while pro-choice advocates plan significant counter-protests in both cities. Concurrently, the "Fridays for Future" movement has called for climate rallies in 70 cities, demanding an end to fossil fuel use. These climate protests come as activists criticize the government's recent announcement to build new gas-fired power plants, arguing it undermines Germany's environmental commitments.</p>

          <p>Starbucks employees in Illinois and Colorado have filed class-action lawsuits against the company, alleging its new, stricter dress code violates state laws by forcing them to purchase new clothing without reimbursement. A similar complaint has been filed with California's state labor agency. The updated policy, implemented in May, requires specific solid-colored shirts and bottoms, which workers claim goes beyond the two free shirts provided by the company. Employees argue that a billion-dollar corporation should not place this financial burden on its workers, many of whom already face challenges with unpredictable hours and understaffing.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has exposed a deep schism in how Americans interpret major news events, a divide largely fueled by social media. Immediately following the shooting, fragmented and politically charged narratives emerged online, with different communities shaping the facts to fit their pre-existing worldviews. This article analyzes how social media algorithms reward rapid, often speculative, takes from influencers, creating competing realities about the killer's motives. Despite law enforcement documents providing a more nuanced picture, the entrenched narratives on both the left and right persist, highlighting social media's role in eroding a shared understanding of reality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's work explores "limerence," a term for intense romantic infatuation characterized by obsessive thoughts and emotional highs and lows. While this state can be a normal part of early love, it can become a detrimental "person addiction" when a relationship is uncertain or unattainable, leading to anxiety and craving. Bellamy suggests that overcoming unhealthy limerence involves recognizing it as an internal mental state and taking active steps to break the cycle. Strategies include limiting contact, reframing positive daydreams into negative scenarios, and focusing on new personal goals to create a sense of purpose outside the obsession.</p>

          <p>A crackdown on female artists is intensifying in Turkey, with the government and judicial system targeting them for alleged "indecent and immoral acts." The latest case involves the popular girl band Manifest, which is under investigation for exhibitionism following a concert, leading to the cancellation of their sold-out tour. This incident is part of a broader pattern where female musicians, writers, and artists face smear campaigns and legal action, often initiated by pro-government media.

          <p>As the UK's Liberal Democrat party gathers for its conference, it confronts a key strategic question: how to build on its recent general election success. Leader Sir Ed Davey's attention-grabbing stunts, such as bungee-jumping, helped the party gain seats, but polling suggests voters may now want a more serious approach. With both the Labour and Conservative parties facing internal turmoil, the Lib Dems see an opportunity to attract centrist voters. However, the party must now define a broader policy platform beyond its core issues and find a way to make moderate positions exciting in an increasingly polarized political landscape.</p>

          <p>The German government is facing a difficult diplomatic decision as key allies like France, Canada, and the UK move towards recognizing Palestine as a state. Berlin maintains that such recognition should only be the final step in a peace process, a position critics call unrealistic given the current state of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This stance is rooted in Germany's historical responsibility for Israel's security, which it considers a "reason of state." However, Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government is under increasing pressure, both internationally and domestically from coalition partners, to take a stronger stance against Israel's actions in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is being adopted in workplaces as a tool to combat employee burnout by automating repetitive tasks, but its impact is proving to be complex. While AI can reduce emotional exhaustion by handling administrative duties, some studies suggest that frequent AI users are more likely to experience high levels of burnout. This paradox arises because the time saved by AI is often filled with more work, and the continuous cognitive engagement required to use these tools can be draining. Experts argue that for AI to be a true solution, companies must focus on rebalancing workloads rather than simply increasing output.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, are preparing to face France in a highly anticipated World Cup semi-final, carrying the weight of an imposing statistical dominance. England is on a record 31-match winning streak and has defeated France in their last 16 encounters. Despite these numbers, France has consistently been England's toughest opponent, often coming within a single score of victory in recent matches. French coaches and players are downplaying the historical statistics, emphasizing that in a high-stakes World Cup semi-final, past results are irrelevant against their desire to reach their first-ever final.</p>

          <p>The WNBA semi-finals are confirmed, guaranteeing a new league champion this season. The Minnesota Lynx, who had the best regular-season record, will face a confident Phoenix Mercury team that eliminated the New York Liberty. In the other best-of-five series, the defending champion Las Vegas Aces will play the Indiana Fever, who won their first playoff series in a decade despite the absence of injured star Caitlin Clark. While the Lynx hold a regular-season advantage over the Mercury, Phoenix notes that they were not at full strength during those earlier contests, setting the stage for competitive matchups.</p>

          <p>In what was likely his final regular-season start at Dodger Stadium, veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw received an emotional send-off from fans and teammates one day after announcing his retirement. The celebrated 18-year career, spent entirely with the Dodgers, has been marked by numerous accolades and a complex journey through postseason challenges. On a night dedicated to his legacy, the Dodgers clinched their 13th consecutive playoff berth with a 6-3 victory over the San Francisco Giants. The moment provided a fittingly triumphant backdrop for the beloved Los Angeles sports icon.</p>

          <p>While new weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro have helped many people achieve significant and rapid weight loss, an unwelcome side effect is emerging: large amounts of loose skin. Individuals who have lost substantial weight report that the excess skin on their thighs, arms, and stomachs has negatively impacted their self-confidence, making them feel self-conscious about their appearance. Surgery to remove the skin is the only effective option but is rarely covered by the NHS as it is considered cosmetic. This leaves many facing the difficult choice of living with the skin or incurring significant private surgery costs.</p>

          <p>As the school year begins, many parents are choosing to leave school-related WhatsApp groups to escape the constant notifications, competitive parenting, and unnecessary anxiety they can generate. While these groups can be useful for sharing important information like non-uniform days, they often become forums for polarized opinions and negativity, sometimes requiring intervention from school administrators. Some parents also note the chats reinforce traditional gender roles, with mothers predominantly handling school communications. For many, opting out is a way to reduce digital noise and set healthier boundaries around school life.</p>
