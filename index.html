          <p>This article examines the life of Aimee Semple McPherson, a world-famous evangelist who vanished in 1926 and reappeared weeks later with a story of abduction, drawing parallels to modern influencer scandals like that of Katie Sorensen. Claire Hoffman's biography of McPherson, Sister, Sinner, explores McPherson's career as a multihyphenate who used preaching to gain social power and financial success. The article delves into McPherson's rise to fame, her use of media, and the grand jury hearing that followed her disappearance, highlighting the costs of her actions and the complexities of her character.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s recent comments about autism are drawing criticism for placing blame on parents and suggesting they are responsible for researching every aspect of their children’s lives. Kennedy stated that parents need to “do their own research” on vaccines, implying that they are to blame for their children’s autism. Critics argue that these statements reinforce the debunked theory linking vaccines to autism and exacerbate the burden on families, particularly mothers, to navigate their children’s diagnoses and support needs.</p>

          <p>A disputed North Carolina state supreme court race, which took nearly six months to resolve, has highlighted a playbook for candidates who lose elections to challenge votes retroactively. Although a federal judge halted the effort to throw out votes, the state court's embrace of such a challenge could encourage similar attempts in the future. Election law experts express concern that this episode could set a precedent for wrongly challenging voters and undermining confidence in elections.</p>

She suggests that ideologies are our brains' way of solving the problem of uncertainty in the world and that every worldview can be practiced extremely and dogmatically.</p>
