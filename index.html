          <p>A UK government review led to shorter family court hearings, averaging 18 weeks instead of 29. While this is encouraging for reducing delays and supporting domestic abuse victims, some parents expressed concerns about the process, suggesting the speed may compromise thoroughness.  The review's bias towards faster resolutions might overlook the complexities of individual cases and the emotional toll on families. </p>
