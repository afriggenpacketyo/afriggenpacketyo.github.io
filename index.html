          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized an agreement to share revenues from Ukraine's mineral reserves, creating a joint investment fund aimed at fostering economic growth and stability. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that this deal sends a clear signal to Russia about the Trump administration's commitment to a free and sovereign Ukraine. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal highlighted that the agreement ensures Ukraine retains control over its natural resources and that profits will be reinvested in the country. This deal is intended to give President Trump a personal stake in Ukraine’s fate while addressing his concerns that the United States has provided Kyiv with a blank check to try to withstand Russia’s invasion.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan has lowered its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year, citing the impact of President Trump's tariffs on overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. The central bank now expects the Japanese economy to grow by 0.5 percent, a significant decrease from the 1.1 percent previously projected. This announcement coincides with the bank's decision to maintain interest rates at 0.5 percent, reflecting concerns about the potential for a tariff-induced slowdown. The Bank of Japan's decision highlights the growing concerns among major economies about the negative effects of U.S. trade policies on global economic stability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump asserted there is "a very good chance" of reaching a trade deal with China, even as his trade envoy, Jamieson Greer, stated that no official negotiations are currently underway.

Greer, however, emphasized that Washington seeks a fair trade relationship and an end to harmful foreign trade practices.

          <p>Fifty years after the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam, Asia is adapting to a new dynamic with China's growing influence, as President Trump's policies diminish American aid and diplomatic efforts. While China expands its economic and military presence in the region, some residents express concerns about Beijing's intentions and yearn for American support. Despite the decline in American presence, ideals of freedom and democracy still resonate, even in countries like Cambodia, where a hereditary dictatorship persists.

          <p>A recent poll indicates that a quarter of non-Asian Americans view Chinese-Americans as a potential threat, particularly in relation to national security, while 40% believe Asian-Americans have greater allegiance to their countries of origin than to the United States. These findings, from an Asian American Foundation survey, highlight growing concerns within the Asian-American community about assimilation amid rising social tensions and strained US-China relations. The survey underscores a troubling disconnect between perceptions of Asian-Americans and their lived experiences, raising concerns about safety, belonging, and opportunities for prosperity.</p>

Maria Ressa, a journalist from the Philippines, draws parallels between Trump's attacks on the media and similar tactics used by autocratic leaders.

          <p>An Assembly committee scaled back a controversial provision in a proposed bill to end solar credits for owners of rooftop solar systems, limiting its application to those who sell their homes. The bill, AB 942, targets programs providing energy credits to Californians who installed solar panels before April 15, 2025. While the committee removed a provision that would have limited the program's benefits to 10 years, the bill still cancels the program for those selling their homes.

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have signed a long-awaited deal involving Ukraine's natural resources, establishing an investment fund to search for minerals and outlining how revenues would be split. The US said the agreement signals to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine. The deal comes after months of contentious negotiations and a meeting between President Trump and Zelensky at the White House that raised concerns about US support for Ukraine. The agreement is seen as essential for Kyiv to access US military aid.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate to defeat a bipartisan resolution that sought to block President Donald Trump's global tariffs. The resolution aimed to revoke the emergency order Trump is using to enact the tariffs, but it failed in a 49-49 vote due to absences. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine criticized Republicans for supporting what he called "tariff idiocy," while Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer accused them of working to keep Trump's tariffs in place. The vote underscores the ongoing debate and divisions surrounding Trump's trade policies.</p>

With Japan planning to rely heavily on renewable and nuclear energy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, LNG is expected to play a key role in bridging its transition from fossil fuels to renewables.</p>
