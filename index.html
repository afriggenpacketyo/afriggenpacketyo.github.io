          <p>A massive spending bill championed by President Trump, which narrowly passed the Senate, is now facing significant hurdles in the House. The legislation, which includes major cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, is projected to add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. The plan also contains provisions to relax gun regulations by restructuring the ATF and extending background check validity. House Speaker Mike Johnson faces a challenge in securing enough votes, as some conservative members object to the bill's increased cost compared to the original House version.</p>

          <p>Defense attorneys for Teresa Youngblut, accused of killing a U.S. Border Patrol agent, claim the Justice Department is rushing the death penalty decision process, violating her constitutional rights. They argue that a July 28 deadline for presenting mitigating evidence is "unprecedentedly tight" and influenced by an Attorney General's memo encouraging capital punishment in such cases. Youngblut is linked to a fringe group called "Ziz" and is accused in a shootout that killed Agent David Maland and another individual. The defense is requesting an extension to January 2026 to adequately prepare their case.</p>

          <p>A Beijing-based think tank, China Finance 40 Forum, is challenging the consensus that China's consumption is underdeveloped, suggesting its actual level is much higher than mainstream metrics indicate. The report argues that when properly measured, China's real consumption power has already surpassed Mexico's and is between 40 to 50 percent of developed nations like Japan and Germany. Standard World Bank data shows China's per capita spending is low, but the think tank contends these figures are misleading. This alternative perspective offers a new way to evaluate the consumer potential of the world's second-largest economy.</p>

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage rates to their lowest level since April has triggered a significant increase in homeowner refinancing activity. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, refinance applications jumped 7% last week and are 40% higher than the same period last year. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.79%, encouraging more borrowing, particularly for conventional and VA loans. However, home purchase applications remained nearly flat, suggesting ongoing uncertainty is still deterring potential buyers from entering the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has escalated tensions with Canada by terminating trade discussions and threatening new tariffs, while also repeating his assertion that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. This article revisits philosopher George Grant's 1965 book "Lament for a Nation," which warned that economic and political integration with the U.S. would erode Canadian sovereignty and identity. Ironically, while Grant feared American liberalism, the current threat comes from an illiberal U.S. administration. Canadian resistance is now led by the Liberal Party, which champions a multicultural identity in opposition to Trump's brand of politics.</p>

This statement is a direct challenge to Beijing, which insists that any successor must be approved by the Chinese government.

Key objections center on the bill's higher cost and deeper cuts to Medicaid compared to the version the House passed in May.

          <p>The most serious charge facing Sean 'Diddy' Combs is racketeering conspiracy, a law originally designed to prosecute mob bosses. To secure a conviction, prosecutors must prove that Combs directed a criminal enterprise and used his network of associates to commit at least two crimes, such as sex trafficking or obstruction of justice. The defense has argued that since employees were not knowingly complicit in the alleged 'freak-offs,' the activity does not constitute racketeering. This complex charge, which carries a potential life sentence, is proving to be the most difficult for the jury to reach a decision on.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run interior ministry in Gaza has ordered Yasser Abu Shabab, the leader of a defiant Bedouin clan, to surrender within 10 days to face a "Revolutionary Court" on treason charges. Abu Shabab, whose group does not recognize Hamas's authority, is accused of looting UN aid trucks and collaborating with Israel. His clan, operating in the Israeli-held Rafah area, denies these allegations, claiming they are a popular force protecting aid and that Hamas is violently suppressing dissent. This order escalates an internal power struggle within the Palestinian enclave.</p>

          <p>The University of Pennsylvania has resolved a Title IX civil rights case with the U.S. Department of Education by agreeing to prohibit transgender women from competing in women's sports. The settlement stems from the participation of swimmer Lia Thomas on the women's team in 2021-2022. As part of the agreement, Penn will restore records to female athletes, issue a public statement of compliance, and send apology letters to affected swimmers. The move, praised by the Trump administration, has been condemned by local officials as a politically motivated attack on the transgender community.</p>

          <p>Scientists believe they have solved the puzzle of why Earth remained lethally hot for 5 million years after the "Great Dying" mass extinction 252 million years ago. A new study using Chinese fossil data suggests the collapse of tropical forests was the critical tipping point. The extinction, caused by massive volcanic eruptions, wiped out 90% of life, including vital vegetation. Without forests to absorb carbon and facilitate silicate weathering, atmospheric CO2 levels remained extremely high, creating a prolonged "super greenhouse" state and offering a stark warning about modern deforestation and climate change.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led spending bill passed by the Senate contains sweeping cuts to U.S. health care that could leave millions of Americans uninsured. The legislation would cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next decade, largely through a strict new national work requirement and by capping state provider taxes. The Congressional Budget Office estimates these changes would cause 11.8 million people to lose health insurance by 2034. Critics, including the American Nurses Association, warn these funding cuts could also force the closure of many rural hospitals that heavily rely on Medicaid.</p>

It describes a scenario where a seemingly weaker force used a coordinated system of data links, early warning aircraft, and air defense to defeat an opponent with a disjointed collection of weapons.

He proposed an executive order for the president to sign, coining the slogan "Make America Rake Again" to turn Trump's past criticism back on him. The White House responded by blaming Newsom for state-level budget cuts to wildfire funding.</p>

          <h2>Aggressive Immigration Raids in Southern California Spark Dissent Within Orange County's Republican Base</h2>

          <p>While some conservative areas like Huntington Beach have celebrated President Trump's immigration sweeps, dissent is growing elsewhere in traditionally Republican Orange County. A group of California Republican legislators, including two from the county, has urged Trump to focus enforcement on criminals and avoid broad raids that disrupt workplaces and instill fear. Many local residents and business leaders express a nuanced view, supporting the deportation of criminals but showing compassion for longtime residents and workers swept up in the raids, highlighting a complex shift in local sentiment.</p>

          <h2>California Lawmakers Propose Legislation to Counter Federal Immigration Raids</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement in Southern California, state lawmakers are struggling to find effective ways to push back. Several bills have been introduced, including one that would require all law enforcement, including federal agents, to wear visible identification unless undercover. Another proposal seeks to ban face coverings for officers. However, observers note these state-level efforts may lack the power to deter federal actions, especially as the administration challenges existing sanctuary policies in court, creating a complex legal and political battle.</p>
