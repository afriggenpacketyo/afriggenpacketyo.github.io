        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The High Court dismissed a legal challenge by private schools and families against the government's decision to add VAT to private school fees, a policy introduced on January 1st. The plaintiffs argued the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights, particularly affecting families with children with special educational needs (Send), those attending single-sex schools, and low-paying faith schools. The court acknowledged the policy might interfere with some human rights but found the government justified in prioritizing revenue for public services, specifically raising standards in state schools. Head teachers are planning to appeal the judgment, but for now the government's policy will continue to stand. Optimism is not high considering the policy is now likely to stay in place for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>Zornitsa Gyutsova, a Bulgarian influencer, has faced backlash for her misogynistic online content, which includes advocating for violence against women. Gyutsova suggests women prefer men who physically assault them and that men should control their partners physically and psychologically. Despite numerous complaints filed with the prosecutor's office, no charges have been brought against Gyutsova because Bulgaria's criminal code does not define gender discrimination as a crime. Some believe her content resonates in Bulgaria due to societal acceptance of patriarchal norms and a lack of consequences for abusers, though this is a global issue. The authorities are not doing much to curb the spread of hate speech.</p>

          <h2>Intellectuals Warn of Resurgence of Fascism in Open Letter</h2>

          <p>A group of Nobel laureates, scientists, writers, and artists issued an open letter warning of the resurgence of fascism, drawing parallels to the rise of fascism in Italy a century ago. The letter calls on those who value democracy to defend democratic institutions, challenge abuses of democratic principles, and uphold facts and evidence. They argue that democracies provide the best framework for addressing social injustices and fulfilling the post-war promises of human rights. The letter emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and multilateralism in maintaining a global legal order.</p>

          <p>Recent policy changes are poised to make life significantly harder for Baby Boomers, with potential overhauls to Social Security posing the biggest threat. Cuts to Social Security staff and office closures will disproportionately hurt low-income Boomers who rely on benefits to cover their cost of living. Middle-income seniors are also likely to feel the impact of a volatile market, with erratic market behavior scaring many middle-class Boomers watching their retirement savings shrink. Proposed legislation could also limit Medicare access for many documented immigrants and reduce Medicaid enrollment, impacting long-term care support.</p>

          <p>Despite surging tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, market watchers believe Tehran is unlikely to retaliate by targeting the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Blocking the strait would disrupt global oil flows but could trigger further retaliation and draw backlash from China, Iran's largest oil customer. Analysts suggest that disrupting the channel could be more of a bane than a boon for Tehran, given how most of Iran's daily consumption goods come via that route. It is more likely that Iran would find alternative routes to demonstrate its displeasure with the current state of affairs.</p>

Recipients are encouraged to "self-deport immediately" and offered travel assistance and a $1,000 bonus upon arrival in their home country via the DHS Home Mobile App. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling allowing DHS to order CHNV participants to leave the country, even as they challenge Trump's revocation of the program.

          <p>President Trump's planned military parade on the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army is being criticized for its focus on displaying military might and promoting himself as supreme leader. This contrasts with George Washington's approach, who resisted attempts to turn events into military displays and honored not only the military but also the city's artisans and tradespeople. Washington understood the dangers of using the military for personal purposes and the need for citizens to stand vigilant against leaders who would use the Army to flex their own might.

          <p>The traditional "religious right" is evolving into a new movement aligned with American nationalism, where the church is bent to the will of the state rather than the other way around. This is evident in the composition and mission of Trump's Religious Liberty Commission, which lacks mainline Protestant representation and focuses on an "official account" of American religious liberty. This new movement is a cross-faith coalition united by a shared sense of cultural siege, setting aside theological concerns in favor of a nation-building project. Unlike the old religious right, the new movement rarely discusses the afterlife, focusing instead on reshaping society in the present.</p>

However, there is no evidence that the Angels' method of drafting polished college stars is a way to win, and they have not posted a winning season in 10 years.
