          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 21:51:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency due to its infant mortality rate reaching a decade-high of 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, nearly double the national average. This crisis disproportionately affects Black infants, who are more than twice as likely to die before their first birthday, with racial gaps widening. The state plans to expand prenatal services and improve emergency transfers, but federal funding cuts to programs like PRAMS threaten vital data collection and maternal health initiatives. Experts emphasize that structural inequities, including poverty and access to healthcare, are key drivers, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive support for women before, during, and after pregnancy to address these preventable tragedies.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Monday playbook analyzes the stock market's robust rally, which was significantly boosted by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signal for upcoming interest rate cuts. Powell's pivot was largely driven by a surprising deceleration in hiring, outweighing concerns about tariffs. Cramer identifies strong investment opportunities in housing, mergers and acquisitions, and initial public offerings, while advising caution regarding enterprise software and certain healthcare sectors. The article also discusses the nuanced performance of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks and the persistent influence of political dynamics on economic policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A contingent of fewer than 50 National Guard members in Washington D.C. has been authorized to carry their service weapons starting Sunday night, marking an escalation in President Trump's law enforcement crackdown. The Defense Department confirmed the directive, citing established Rules for the Use of Force. This decision follows the deployment of nearly 2,000 National Guard members to the city to combat what the President calls an "epidemic of crime," despite local data showing a decline in violent crime. The troops' role, primarily protecting landmarks and crowd control, is now evolving with this new directive.</p>

          <p>France has summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner to Paris after he sent a letter to President Emmanuel Macron, alleging insufficient action against rising antisemitism in France. The French foreign ministry deemed these allegations "unacceptable" and a violation of international law, specifically the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which prohibits interference in internal affairs. This diplomatic incident follows Macron's rejection of similar criticisms from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding France's intent to recognize a Palestinian state. The dispute adds to existing tensions between the two allies over trade tariffs and UN peacekeeping efforts.</p>

          <p>Chinese property behemoth Evergrande has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a significant milestone in its spectacular collapse under massive debt. Once China's largest real estate firm, its shares were suspended after a winding-up order in January 2024, with its valuation plummeting over 99%. The company's downfall, stemming from Beijing's 2020 borrowing restrictions, has severely impacted China's economy, contributing to a property slump, layoffs, and a decline in household savings. Experts indicate the crisis is far from over, with other developers facing similar challenges and no immediate "light at the end of the tunnel."</p>

While acknowledging ethical concerns about "killer robots," Luckey maintains that all Anduril products incorporate a "kill switch" for human intervention and ultimately promote peace through credible deterrence.

          <p>A new human case of flesh-eating screwworm parasite has been identified in Maryland, linked to a person who traveled from Guatemala, marking the first confirmed human case this year in the U.S. The parasite, which eats the living flesh of warm-blooded animals and can be fatal if untreated, is escalating its spread northward from Central America. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is planning a sterile fly facility in Texas to combat the pest, which could cost the state's cattle industry $1.8 billion. Transparency concerns have arisen as the CDC initially deferred questions about the case.</p>

          <p>A tragic fiery crash on Interstate 15 in Temecula, California, resulted in four fatalities when a BMW M4, driven recklessly, crossed the concrete median into oncoming southbound traffic. The BMW collided with a Nissan Sentra and immediately became engulfed in flames. Three passengers in the BMW—a 23-year-old woman, a 14-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old girl—were killed, as was the 35-year-old driver of the Sentra. The 25-year-old BMW driver sustained major injuries and survived. Authorities are investigating the collision, with charges pending against the BMW driver; alcohol was not a factor.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in California's Napa County and central Oregon expanded overnight, leading to hundreds of evacuations and warnings for thousands of residents. The Pickett Fire in California, 11% contained, threatens 500 structures amid rugged terrain and hot, dry conditions, while the Flat Fire in Oregon, uncontained, endangers nearly 4,000 homes. Over 1,230 firefighters are battling the blazes, supported by air assets, but extreme heat and low humidity challenge containment efforts. Air quality alerts are in effect across multiple counties, as scientists link human-caused warming to more intense and destructive wildfires.</p>
