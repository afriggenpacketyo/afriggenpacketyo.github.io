This move follows a successful $2 billion debt offering in May and plans for a $6 billion AI data center in Pennsylvania. Despite some investor concerns about its debt levels, CoreWeave, a key partner for Nvidia and Microsoft, maintains it is meeting strong client demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Grassley has released declassified documents suggesting the FBI, under then-Director James Comey, failed to conduct a thorough investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. The documents, part of an annex to a 2018 Inspector General report, allege the FBI did not fully examine evidence, including thumb drives containing sensitive government information. Grassley contrasted this alleged lack of diligence with the robust investigation into Trump-Russia collusion claims, renewing scrutiny on the handling of the pivotal 2016-era investigation.</p>

          <p>England's women's national football team, the Lionesses, will no longer take the knee before matches, a decision manager Sarina Wiegman says was made because the gesture's impact is "not good enough." The move comes after defender Jess Carter revealed she had received racist abuse online during the ongoing Euro 2025 tournament. The players stated they need to find a different way to combat racism, with midfielder Georgia Stanway explaining they will stand at kick-off to spark conversation and signal that current anti-racism efforts are insufficient.</p>

          <p>With U.S. college costs averaging over $38,000 annually, many students rely on federal loans, which offer borrower protections but have strict borrowing caps. This article outlines the annual and lifetime limits for federal student loans, which vary based on dependency status and academic level, often leaving a significant funding gap. For dependent undergraduates, the lifetime limit is $31,000, while graduate students can borrow up to $138,500, including undergraduate loans. When federal aid is insufficient, private student loans are presented as a viable, albeit more complex, option to cover remaining costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A dispute has emerged between NHS England and the British Medical Association (BMA) ahead of a five-day strike by resident doctors. NHS England has instructed hospitals to avoid canceling non-urgent care except in exceptional circumstances, a change from previous strikes. The BMA warns this policy will stretch non-striking senior doctors too thinly, compromising their ability to cover emergency services and thereby putting patients at risk. The conflict arises as talks continue between the government and the union to avert the strike over pay restoration demands.</p>

          <p>The process for launching an American intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is defined by complex, redundant safety protocols rather than a simple red button. Inside underground bunkers, missileers must first decrypt and verify launch orders. The launch itself requires the coordinated action of at least two separate crews, with each of the four officers turning keys and levers simultaneously. This system of multiple checks and balances is designed to prevent any single individual or crew from initiating a launch or blocking a legitimate one.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated he will not support a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in D.C. unless the NFL team changes its name back to the "Washington Redskins." In a social media post, Trump called the "Commanders" moniker ridiculous and argued the team's heritage is being taken away. The team dropped its former name in 2020 after years of criticism over its racist connotations. The Association on American Indian Affairs called Trump's remarks a distraction and reiterated that such mascots are offensive.</p>

          <p>A new class of weight loss drugs, known as GLP-1s like Ozempic and Wegovy, may be a game-changer for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This common hormonal disorder is linked to metabolic issues, and women in early trials have reported significant improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and weight gain after taking the drugs. Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity indirectly helps rebalance hormones, though larger studies are needed. High costs and limited insurance coverage remain significant barriers for many patients.</p>

          <p>An article reviews the long-documented relationship between Donald Trump and the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which spanned from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. The two frequently socialized in New York and Palm Beach, with Trump once calling Epstein a "terrific guy." A recent report cited a 2003 "birthday book" message, allegedly from Trump, alluding to shared "secrets," a claim Trump denies and is suing over. Their friendship reportedly ended in 2004 over a real estate dispute, years before Epstein's first charges for sex crimes involving underage girls.</p>

The statement, signed by key U.S. allies like Britain, Canada, and Japan, highlights the deaths of over 800 Palestinians while seeking aid and calls Israel's aid delivery model dangerous. While also calling for the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas, the statement places direct pressure on the Israeli government to comply with international humanitarian law as it expands ground operations.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has named former biotech executive and Stanford professor Dr. George Tidmarsh as the new director of its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). This crucial division oversees the approval of most new drugs. The appointment comes amid significant upheaval at the FDA under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Tidmarsh's extensive industry background may reassure the pharmaceutical sector, and his past writings suggest he could take a more stringent approach to drug regulation, including the controversial accelerated approval pathway.</p>

          <p>Harvard University and the Trump administration are engaged in a legal battle in a Boston federal court over more than $2 billion in frozen federal funding. The White House has withheld the funds, demanding that Harvard alter its policies on hiring, admissions, and diversity programs to combat alleged antisemitism. Harvard argues the administration's actions violate its free speech rights and are an unconstitutional attempt to control the university's internal operations. The outcome could eventually reach the Supreme Court, with major implications for academic freedom.</p>

          <p>The Texas Legislature has begun a special session to redraw the state's congressional districts, a move pushed by President Trump's team to bolster the GOP's slim majority in the U.S. House. The effort comes just a few years after the state's last redistricting cycle and is being justified by a Justice Department letter alleging the current map contains unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. Critics argue the move is a purely political power grab that could illegally dilute the voting power of communities of color and is likely to face immediate and significant legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Approximately 5 million above-ground pools are being recalled due to a drowning hazard that has been linked to the deaths of nine children. The recall, issued by manufacturers Bestway, Intex, and Polygroup in conjunction with the CPSC, affects pools 48 inches or taller sold since 2002. The pools' external compression straps can create footholds, allowing young children to climb in even when the ladder is removed. Consumers are urged to prevent unattended access to the pools and can obtain a free repair kit to remove the hazardous straps.</p>
