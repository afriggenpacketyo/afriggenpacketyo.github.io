          <p>A former aide to New York governors, Linda Sun, faces a superseding indictment that expands on charges of acting as an unregistered agent for China. The new allegations include wire fraud, bribery, and tax evasion, accusing Sun and her husband of orchestrating a scheme to receive over $35 million in kickbacks. Prosecutors state that during the early stages of the pandemic, Sun abused her trusted position to direct state contracts for scarce protective gear to her associates. This alleged abuse of power occurred when New York was in a vulnerable state, seeking essential medical supplies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has indicated it may seek to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a country other than his native El Salvador if he is released from jail. Abrego Garcia was previously deported in what was called an "administrative error" despite a court order protecting him, and was subsequently returned to the U.S. to face federal smuggling charges in Tennessee. A judge ordered his pre-trial release, but he remains in custody as legal debates continue over the government's ability to deport him again.

          <p>This article presents the concluding text from Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The opinion eloquently argues that marriage is a profound union embodying the highest ideals of love, fidelity, and family, and that the petitioners sought not to disrespect the institution, but to find its fulfillment for themselves. Kennedy wrote that to deny them this right would be to condemn them to loneliness and exclude them from a foundational institution of civilization. The Constitution, he concluded, grants them the right to equal dignity in the eyes of the law.</p>

The prosecution argued that Combs wielded "power, violence and fear" to operate a criminal enterprise that facilitated brutal sex crimes, believing his fame and wealth placed him above the law. The defense will present its closing arguments on Friday. Combs has pleaded not guilty to five counts, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, and faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted.</p>

The changes, which aim to save Â£5 billion annually, will now primarily affect future claimants.

          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured direct images of what is believed to be a previously undiscovered exoplanet. The planet, named TWA 7b, is estimated to be the mass of Saturn and orbits a young star named TWA 7. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging with a coronagraph, a tool that blocks the star's bright light to reveal fainter nearby objects. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a planet shaping its star's debris disk.</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that Californians will pay significantly more for a typical Fourth of July barbecue this year. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, a cookout for ten guests in California costs an average of $90.06, well above the national average of $70.92. Staples like ground beef, chicken breasts, and pork chops are all more expensive in the state. The higher prices are attributed to several factors, including Trump administration tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, reduced cattle availability, and potential workforce disruptions from immigration enforcement actions.

They argued the program was set back by months, not years or decades as the administration claimed. The senators expressed concern that there is no coherent long-term strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, highlighting a deep divide on national security assessments.</p>

The company's profits fell 86% due to heavy discounting and a shift back to less profitable wholesale channels. Despite the slump, Nike's finance chief expressed confidence that headwinds will moderate and the business will be in a healthier long-term position. (not investment advice)</p>

Protestors blocked the building's entrance to object to what they describe as the company's complicity in deportations and the conflict in Gaza.
