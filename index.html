          <p>A shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in one death and two injuries. Authorities have arrested a 23-year-old suspect, Hunter Nadeau, and charged him with second-degree murder, stating there is no known connection between him and the victims. The incident occurred at the club's restaurant, where a witness reported the shooter was subdued after being hit with a chair before being apprehended by police.

          <p>The United States recently conducted a major trilateral military exercise, Freedom Edge, with Japan and South Korea but notably did not include an aircraft carrier. This departure from previous drills has prompted analysis regarding its implications for relations with China and North Korea. Some experts suggest the move could be a strategic de-escalation to improve diplomatic dealings with Beijing, while others believe it reflects the Trump administration's demand for greater contributions from its Asian allies in regional security efforts. The exercise took place in international waters near South Korea's Jeju island.</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has surpassed the ruling conservative CDU/CSU bloc to become the most popular party in a recent national opinion poll, reaching 26% support. This marks a new high for the anti-immigration party, which is officially classified as a "confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor" by Germany's domestic intelligence agency. The polling data reflects a significant shift in the German political landscape, occurring as a town on the Polish border considers electing the AfD's first-ever city mayor. This development raises concerns about the country's political direction.</p>

Sawe finished with a time of 2:02:15, while Wanjiru completed the race in 2:21:05. Despite Berlin's reputation for being a fast course, both times were slower than world records, which was attributed to unusually humid and warm late-summer conditions in the German capital. Over 55,000 runners participated in the event, which featured several celebrity participants including pop star Harry Styles.</p>

Financial experts advise consumers to carefully evaluate whether the benefits of these cards justify the high cost, especially if they carry a balance, as high interest rates can quickly negate any rewards. Consumers should assess their travel habits, consider co-branded versus general travel cards, and ensure they fully utilize perks like lounge access and travel credits.

Critics, including the Refugee Council, have called the policy "excessively harsh," urging the government to reconsider on humanitarian grounds.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent attacks on the Federal Reserve highlights the significant economic risks associated with undermining the central bank's independence. Historically, political pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates for short-term economic gains has led to long-term problems like high inflation, as seen during the Truman and Nixon administrations. Experts, including former Fed chairs, warn that forcing the central bank to finance government deficits could destabilize financial markets, increase inflation, and ultimately raise interest rates on consumer loans and the national debt.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer had previously set conditions for Israel, including a ceasefire, which the UK government has judged were not met. This action aligns the UK with over 140 other nations and comes ahead of the UN General Assembly.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, is urging the communications regulator Ofcom to investigate Elon Musk and his social media platform, X. Davey alleges that "crimes" are being committed on the platform, citing the presence of harmful content related to child abuse and self-harm, which would violate the UK's new Online Safety Act. He argues that Musk should be held personally accountable for these breaches. The call for action follows Musk's recent criticism of the safety law, which he claims is a risk to free speech.</p>

          <p>An email from 2011 has resurfaced in which Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a "supreme friend." The message was reportedly sent just weeks after she had publicly disavowed him, calling her association a "gigantic error of judgment." A spokesperson for the duchess explained that the email was sent in response to a legal threat from Epstein, who was threatening to sue her for defamation after she publicly condemned him. The spokesperson reiterated that the duchess stands by her public condemnation of Epstein's actions.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that societies in both the United States and the United Kingdom are experiencing a dangerous deficit of empathy, which is fueling political polarization and normalizing hate. The author connects personal experiences of racism with larger trends of political violence and inflammatory rhetoric, suggesting that a culture of cruelty is taking hold. Drawing on the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the article calls for empathy to become a public practice to counteract division and heal societies built on grievance and othering.</p>

          <p>Voters in Guinea are participating in a constitutional referendum that could permit the country's military leader, General Mamady Doumbouya, to run for president. The proposed constitution would also extend presidential terms and make it more difficult for opposition parties to compete in elections. The vote is expected to pass as the main opposition leaders have called for a boycott amid a government crackdown on dissent. International observers, including the UN Human Rights Office, have raised serious concerns about the fairness and inclusivity of the process.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a covert, Russian-funded network attempting to disrupt Moldova's upcoming parliamentary election with pro-Russian propaganda and fake news. An undercover reporter infiltrated the network, which paid participants to post content undermining the pro-EU ruling party and to conduct illegal polls designed to question the election's legitimacy. The operation has been linked to fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, who is sanctioned by the US and UK for his role in Kremlin-backed influence campaigns. The findings highlight ongoing efforts to destabilize the strategically significant Eastern European nation.</p>

          <p>More than a decade after 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru was found dead in Nanyuki, Kenya, a Kenyan court has issued an arrest warrant for a UK national in connection with her murder. Wanjiru was last seen in 2012 with British soldiers who were stationed at a nearby army base. A 2019 inquest concluded she was killed by one or two British soldiers, but progress on the case has been slow. This latest development could lead to the first-ever extradition of a British soldier to face a murder trial for a civilian death abroad.</p>

Investment banks like Goldman Sachs have turned more positive on Germany's outlook, citing a "window of opportunity" for the government to build on an improved macroeconomic picture. Meanwhile, London's Canary Wharf is experiencing a revival, with office leasing expected to hit a decade high as the financial sector leads a return-to-office push.
