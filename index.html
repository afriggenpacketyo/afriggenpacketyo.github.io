        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and China over TikTok's ownership are increasingly focused on a potential licensing agreement for the app's highly valued algorithm. This arrangement would allow a new U.S. entity to use the technology, potentially satisfying national security concerns while letting parent company ByteDance retain some intellectual property rights. However, experts raise questions about how such a deal would work in practice, particularly regarding data security and whether China-based engineers could still access U.S. user information. The outcome of these complex talks will determine the popular app's ability to continue operating in the American market.</p>

The 89-minute event, scheduled for October 3-5, will be shown in all U.S. AMC locations and in up to 100 additional countries. Fans attending the event will see the premiere of a new music video, behind-the-scenes footage, and Swift's personal reflections on her songs. This marks Swift's second major collaboration with AMC Theaters, following the success of her record-breaking "The Eras Tour" concert film, which became the highest-grossing concert film of all time.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications through an executive order, significantly increasing the cost for companies hiring highly skilled foreign workers. The move is intended to ensure that the program is used for truly exceptional talent that cannot be sourced domestically, thereby protecting American jobs. Critics of the program have long argued that it allows companies to hire foreign workers at lower salaries. However, policy experts warn this substantial fee could incentivize U.S. companies to move specialized jobs overseas and may discourage international students from studying in the United States.</p>

          <p>A CDC advisory committee, with new members appointed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has voted on several key vaccine recommendations. The panel now advises against the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) shot for children under four, favoring separate injections to reduce the minor risk of febrile seizures. For COVID-19 vaccines, the committee shifted from a broad recommendation to advocating for "individual-based decision-making" after consulting a clinician, a move some health experts fear may discourage vaccination. A proposal to require a prescription for the COVID-19 vaccine was narrowly defeated, maintaining its current accessibility.</p>

The Canadian team, which had to crowdfund its journey to the tournament, dominated the match from the start, scoring three tries in the first 25 minutes.

          <p>Recent decisions by the CDC's advisory committee (ACIP) are raising concerns about the potential for a two-tiered vaccine system in the United States. The panel voted to remove the combined MMRV vaccine from the federally funded Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, which serves low-income families, citing safety concerns. While privately insured families may still have access to the convenient single shot, children on VFC will not, creating a disparity. This move, along with broader changes to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, signals a shift that could complicate vaccine access for the nation's most vulnerable children, echoing historical inequities in public health.</p>

          <p>The United States military has deployed its Typhon missile system to a marine base in Japan for the first time as part of the annual Resolute Dragon joint training exercise. This marks the first deployment of such a weapons system in the Asia-Pacific region since the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty expired. The Typhon system is capable of launching missiles with a range between 500km and 5,500km. While U.S. officials stated the system would be removed after the drills, the move is seen as a significant strategic signal that could prompt China to enhance its own counterstrike capabilities in the region.</p>

During a state visit, Trump advocated for using military force to handle illegal migration, a proposal Trade Secretary Peter Kyle rejected, stating that the UK Border Force is specifically responsible for policing borders. Kyle emphasized that the military's primary focus should remain on national defense and global security issues. The statement came as nearly 1,000 migrants crossed the Channel, and the UK government continued its "one in, one out" deportation deal with France.</p>

However, critics, including the City Controller, caution that the project will divert taxpayer funds from essential services for decades and may not be completed in time for the Games.

The proposed framework would see U.S. investors gain control of the app through a new entity that licenses TikTok's algorithm from its parent company, ByteDance. This structure aims to resolve national security concerns that led to a federal law requiring ByteDance to divest its U.S. business or face a ban.</p>

Shoppers reported receiving counterfeit items, and some small business owners discovered their company identities had been stolen to create fraudulent seller accounts.

          <p>A journalist for the website L.A. Taco has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department, alleging that officers repeatedly violated his First Amendment rights. The journalist, Lexis-Olivier Ray, claims he was threatened with arrest and wrongfully handcuffed while documenting sweeps of homeless encampments. The lawsuit contends that officers and city sanitation workers improperly restricted his access to public spaces, even when other members of the public were allowed through. This legal action adds to growing scrutiny over the LAPD's treatment of the media, following other recent lawsuits and a court order limiting the use of less-lethal weapons on journalists.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have revealed that the man who pleaded guilty to the attempted assassination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022 had a broader plan to kill three justices. According to a sentencing memorandum, Nicholas Roske's goal was to "single-handedly alter the constitutional order" in response to the anticipated overturning of Roe v. Wade. The Justice Department described his actions as a form of terrorism, detailing his extensive research, cross-country travel, and the cache of weapons he brought to Kavanaugh's home. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of at least 30 years, emphasizing the severe threat his actions posed to the judiciary.</p>

Although Musk later denied the report, sources indicate the capital would be used to build out the extensive computing infrastructure needed for advanced AI development, including a large data center in Memphis.

          <p>The Trump administration has released a new version of the presidential welcome letter given to newly naturalized U.S. citizens. The revised letter shifts focus from the nation's founding ideals to an emphasis on embracing American culture, history, and traditions. Unlike letters from previous presidents, which often highlighted the U.S. as an "idea" or a "nation of immigrants," Trump's message frames citizenship as forging a "sacred bond with our Nation, her traditions, her history, her culture, and her values." This rhetorical change aligns with a broader conservative shift toward defining American identity through shared culture rather than universal principles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and the FCC Chairman to revoke broadcast licenses of networks like ABC have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over the media. Broadcast networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox operate by licensing public airwaves from the government, which requires them to serve the "public interest." While this has traditionally involved standards on obscenity or children's programming, the current administration is framing political bias as a potential violation. Experts note that revoking a license is a complex process that would likely face significant legal challenges, but the threats alone can exert pressure on broadcasters and their parent companies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and allow the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. This request follows a lower court ruling that found the administration's move to end the humanitarian program was unlawful.
