          <p>At WWE's SummerSlam event, Naomi retained her Women's World Championship in a dramatic triple-threat match against Rhea Ripley and Iyo Sky. The match featured a series of high-impact moves and momentum shifts between all three competitors. The conclusion came when Naomi executed a roll-up pin on Ripley, discreetly holding her tights to secure the victory, an action Ripley protested to no avail. The controversial win ensures Naomi continues her reign as champion, concluding a highly energetic opening to the night's events.</p>

          <p>China has firmly rejected U.S. demands to halt its oil imports from Russia and Iran, stating it will protect its national interests and sovereignty against coercion. The dispute is a major point of contention in ongoing trade negotiations, with the U.S. threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese goods if it does not comply. Analysts believe the U.S. seeks to limit funding for Moscow's war in Ukraine and Tehran's regional activities. Despite this friction, both nations have expressed optimism about reaching a broader trade deal, though China's stance on energy security remains resolute.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Health Service has initiated a nationwide rollout of a gonorrhoea vaccine in sexual health clinics to combat record-high infection rates. The program will initially target high-risk groups, such as gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple partners or STIs. The vaccine, originally developed for meningitis B, is 30-40% effective against gonorrhoea and is expected to prevent up to 100,000 cases over the next decade. Health officials and charities have praised the initiative as a significant step forward in public sexual health and in managing antibiotic-resistant strains.</p>

Sources indicate she is starting her own government affairs firm but will remain a special government employee temporarily to conclude her policy work.

The incident occurred in the village of Silwad after fires, which the Palestinian health ministry attributed to Israeli settlers, were set to homes and vehicles. The U.S. State Department condemned the violence and confirmed it is providing consular assistance to the family. This marks the second death of a Palestinian American in the West Bank in recent weeks amid escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats, led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, engaged in intense negotiations to secure the release of billions in previously approved government funds in exchange for confirming a slate of President Trump's nominees. The requested funds included significant amounts for the National Institutes of Health, the World Food Program, and other global health initiatives. However, after appearing to reach a deal, President Trump reportedly rejected the arrangement, leaving approximately 140 nominations pending and halting progress until at least September. The failed negotiations highlight the deep partisan divisions and transactional nature of recent political appointments.</p>

Opponents, including pro-democracy activists from Hong Kong and some UK politicians, fear the facility could be used for espionage, harassment of dissidents, and poses a security risk due to its proximity to the city's financial district. The sprawling complex would be Europe's largest embassy, but local residents and council members have also raised concerns over potential disruptions from protests.

          <p>Counter-terrorism police have charged a fifth individual in relation to a break-in at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, where two military aircraft were damaged. Muhammad Umer Khalid, 22, faces charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and entering a prohibited place. The incident, which caused an estimated £7 million in damages, was claimed by the group Palestine Action, which has since been proscribed by the UK government as a terrorist organization. The group's actions have primarily targeted companies linked to the arms industry since the start of the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A large-scale manhunt is in its third day for a 45-year-old army veteran suspected of killing four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana. The victims, including a barmaid and three customers, were fatally shot on Friday morning. The suspect, identified as Michael Paul Brown, was reportedly a regular at the bar and fled into the nearby foothills after the attack. Authorities have warned that the suspect is unstable and dangerous, deploying around 250 law enforcement officers to search the dense, mountainous terrain.</p>

          <p>In a new court filing, the Trump administration has denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests, contradicting earlier public statements. Previously, White House adviser Stephen Miller had stated the administration was looking to set a goal of at least 3,000 arrests per day by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). However, government lawyers now claim that while the figure may have been discussed as a goal, no such policy directive was ever issued to DHS or ICE. The denial comes amid an ongoing lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of immigration enforcement tactics in California.</p>

          <p>More than 3,200 unionized Boeing workers in Missouri and Illinois have voted to go on strike after rejecting the company's latest contract offer. The members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, who assemble fighter jets and other defense systems, argue the proposed contract is insufficient. This marks the first strike at Boeing's St. Louis defense hub since 1996. Boeing expressed disappointment with the decision, stating its offer included significant wage growth, and has activated a contingency plan to continue operations with its non-striking workforce.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has emerged as a leader in solar energy, surpassing California in new utility-scale solar capacity last year, primarily driven by large utilities like Florida Power & Light. This growth is attributed to favorable economics and a streamlined state rule that fast-tracks the approval process for projects under 75 megawatts. However, the sector faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing grid constraints, which require significant investment in storage and infrastructure. This article explores how the state is balancing this boom with policy shifts and the need for greater grid resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

The final day's play will decide the series, with England aiming for their biggest series win of the current era and India fighting to level the score.
