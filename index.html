        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Prime Minister has condemned the decision to prevent Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending an Aston Villa Europa League match due to safety concerns. West Midlands Police classified the game as high-risk, citing intelligence and past violent clashes involving Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam. This move has drawn criticism from across the political spectrum, including Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch, who argue it sends a "shameful message" about antisemitism and the inability to guarantee safety for Jewish fans. The Jewish Leadership Council called the ban "perverse," while some local officials supported the safety measure.</p>

          <p>The US Senate has once more failed to advance a crucial funding bill, prolonging the government shutdown into its seventeenth day. This persistent legislative gridlock underscores the deep political divisions and disagreements over budgetary priorities in Washington. The extended shutdown significantly impacts federal agencies, services, and hundreds of thousands of government workers across the nation, creating widespread disruption and economic uncertainty. Despite ongoing negotiations, a resolution remains elusive, with no clear path forward to restore full government operations.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a fresh record high for the third consecutive day, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., despite a broader downturn in other Asian markets. The Kospi's strong performance bucked regional trends, as fears intensified regarding the banking sector and trade tensions elsewhere. While the Kospi surged, the Kosdaq saw earlier gains recede, and other major Asia-Pacific indices like Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Japan's Nikkei experienced losses. This divergence highlights specific investor confidence in South Korea's economic outlook tied to trade developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former members of the UK military can now apply for a digital version of their identity cards, a move praised by ministers as a "case study" for a planned nationwide digital ID scheme. This optional digital card allows 1.8 million eligible veterans easier access to public services like healthcare, housing support, and discounts, complementing existing physical cards. The government emphasizes its role in addressing privacy and security concerns for the broader scheme, which is set to become mandatory for work by 2029. This initiative aims to modernize public services and streamline access for veterans.</p>

          <p>Alaska has launched one of its largest historical airlifts to evacuate hundreds of residents from coastal villages ravaged by record flooding and strong winds from Typhoon Halong's remnants. The storm caused homes to wash away, leaving one person rescued and two missing, with an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 miles of coastline impacted. Officials are working to provide shelter and restore basic services, facing challenges due to the remote locations and damaged infrastructure. The article also highlights concerns over past Trump administration cuts to grants intended for disaster preparedness in these vulnerable, predominantly Indigenous communities.</p>

          <p>A California restaurant owner, Sol Bashirian of Sunday Gravy, reports his decades-old Italian eatery is "barely breaking even" due to the crippling effects of tariffs and inflation. Despite a 30% sales increase, the rising costs of imported ingredients are eroding profits. Financial analysts confirm that restaurants catering to lower and middle-income consumers are particularly vulnerable, as these groups face multiple cost pressures. The article highlights that many restaurants plan to raise menu prices, but Bashirian fears this could deter customers, forcing him to add a 5% surcharge instead. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The booming popularity of e-bikes, now a nearly $2 billion market, is accompanied by increasing safety risks, particularly for younger riders. Emergency room visits for children aged 10-17 due to e-bike incidents have more than tripled since 2019, with high-speed models posing significant dangers. Parents are urged to recognize the risks of these powerful bikes, which some consider e-motorcycles without proper training or licensing.

          <p>Recent satellite photos vividly illustrate the dramatic transformation of California's landscape following the season's first major storm, which brought much-needed precipitation. The images show brown mountain peaks replaced by brilliant white snow and reservoirs reaching historical water levels. This deluge of moisture is expected to significantly delay the fire season in Southern California, as plants and grasses absorb vital water. Experts note that even weak atmospheric rivers can help the state recover from drought, marking a favorable start to the water year and offering a positive outlook for environmental conditions.</p>
