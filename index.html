          <p>In a statement celebrating the release of 20 Israeli hostages, former Vice President Kamala Harris commended the diplomatic efforts that led to the ceasefire deal but notably avoided mentioning President Donald Trump by name. Harris thanked "the President and his team" for their persistence in securing the agreement, which she called an important first step toward a more hopeful future in the region.

          <p>A commentary piece argues that while President Trump's Gaza peace plan has achieved a ceasefire and the return of hostages, it is a fragile truce born of raw power rather than a detailed, sustainable peace agreement. The authors contend the plan is ambiguous, lacks enforcement mechanisms, and fails to address the core issues of the conflict, such as Israel's occupation, instead micromanaging Palestinian governance. They suggest that this deal, brokered primarily between the US, Turkey, and Qatar, transitions Gaza from "utter hell to mere nightmare" and warns that a more unorthodox approach is needed to prevent future conflict.</p>

          <p>A husband and wife from Middletown, Rhode Island, were killed when their single-engine plane crashed onto Route 195 in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, during stormy weather. The aircraft, which had departed from New Bedford Regional Airport, broke apart and caught fire in the highway median. A woman driving on the highway sustained non-life-threatening injuries after her car was struck by a piece of the aircraft. The victims were identified as Thomas and Agatha Perkins, who were well-known in their community for their construction business specializing in historic restoration.</p>

          <p>The minority Labour government in Wales faces significant challenges in passing its upcoming budget, which could lead to major cuts in public services if a deal is not reached with opposition parties. Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford needs support to pass the £27 billion spending plan, as Labour does not hold a majority in the Senedd. The Welsh Conservatives have offered to negotiate in exchange for scrapping the land transaction tax, while the outcome of an upcoming by-election could further complicate the political arithmetic for the government.</p>

          <p>Randy Insko, who previously served as sheriff of Robertson County, Kentucky, for 21 years, has been appointed to complete the term of his successor, Terry Gray. Gray resigned last week following his third DUI arrest in less than two years, an incident that occurred while he was in uniform and driving a departmental vehicle. The county's Judge-Executive selected the retired Insko as an interim replacement to avoid giving any potential candidate for the next election an unfair advantage, aiming to restore stability to the county after the recent turmoil.</p>

His subjects ranged from musicians and paperboys to beggars, and his work is now recognized as a pioneering example of "instantaneous photography," offering a candid glimpse into the city's past.</p>

          <p>A new study by DHL and NYU Stern School of Business suggests that global trade has proven resilient to the Trump administration's tariff hikes and is not heading for a reversal of globalization. The research forecasts that global trade volume will grow at an average annual rate of 2.5% through 2029, a pace similar to the previous decade but slower than earlier predictions. Despite the ongoing trade disputes and a projected slowdown next year, the report concludes that the fundamental strength of international commerce persists. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR correspondent is giving up a 28-year-held Pentagon press pass in protest of a new Defense Department policy that threatens to revoke credentials for "soliciting" unclassified information that has not been officially released.

The policy has been rejected by a wide range of news organizations, which will now be barred from the building, severely limiting press access and transparency.</p>

Sunak argues that such a program, estimated to cost £25 million annually, would be affordable and could "save countless lives" by enabling early detection, though some medical experts remain cautious about the risks of over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment.</p>
