The trade data also comes as Japan's is locked in trade negotiations with the U.S. On Thursday, Trump said in a Truth Social post that there was "big progress" in the talks, having earlier said that he would also be attending the trade meeting. He also wrote that the talks will cover "tariffs, the cost of military support, and 'TRADE FAIRNESS.'" The report indicates the impact of tariffs on Japan's trade economy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant, to a mega-prison in El Salvador has sparked controversy, with Democrats claiming he was wrongly deported.

Court documents also revealed a domestic violence restraining order filed against him by his wife in 2021. The Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, but El Salvador's president has refused to allow him back into the U.S.</p>

            <p>Scientists have found tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star, K2-18b, may be home to life. The James Webb Space Telescope detected potential chemical signatures of molecules associated with life, specifically dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). On Earth, these gases are produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria. While the findings are promising, researchers emphasize the need for more data to confirm the results and explore non-biological explanations for the presence of these molecules.</p>

            <p>An ocean world that's teeming with microbes — and who knows what other kinds of life — is currently the best explanation for some chemical signatures that the James Webb Space Telescope has spotted in the atmosphere of a distant planet. That's according to Nikku Madhusudhan of the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy, who called his team's new findings "astounding."</p>

            <p>Countries in the Asia Pacific region are adjusting their security strategies in response to Donald Trump's return to the White House and concerns about Washington's commitment to its allies. Strategies range from seeking new security reassurances from the US to bolstering defence spending, and lifting the long taboo on the possible development of their own nuclear deterrents. Most concern is focused on the Taiwan Strait, with its commercially and strategically vital shipping lanes, where China has been flexing its muscles in an attempt to intimidate the self-governed island.</p>

            <p>Newcastle winger Jacob Murphy is having a breakthrough season at age 30, leading to discussions about his potential inclusion in the England squad. Murphy's strong connection with Alexander Isak has been a key factor in his success, with the duo on track to break a Premier League record for assists. Only Mohamed Salah has more assists than Murphy in the Premier League this season. Of all the English players in the Premier League this season, only Cole Palmer and Ollie Watkins have more goal involvements than Murphy.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has effectively shut down the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, a small agency that coordinates homelessness policy across the federal government. All of its staff have been put on administrative leave. The agency's mandate is to help states and localities manage homelessness, and it has focused on the record-high number of people living outside. Critics say shutting down the agency will make it easier for Trump to shift homelessness policy.</p>

            <p>A federal judge said Wednesday that probable cause exists to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt over what he said was its defiance of an order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants who were bound for El Salvador. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote in a 46-page decision that the government's actions on March 15 "demonstrate a willful disregard" for his order barring the government from transferring certain migrants into Salvadoran custody under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.</p>

During his Senate confirmation hearing last week, Brandon Judd expressed concern over China’s growing presence in Latin America, specifically in Chile, and said that if confirmed, he would seek to “restrict China’s access to Chile’s resources”, particularly in areas like space and technology.</p>
