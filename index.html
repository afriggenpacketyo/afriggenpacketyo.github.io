        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (IPCO), the watchdog responsible for overseeing MI5, reportedly rewrote a report on the handling of a violent neo-Nazi agent after receiving false information from the Security Service. An early draft of the report contradicted false evidence MI5 had presented in court, but the final version did not, leading IPCO to state they were "misled." MI5 Director General Sir Ken McCallum has since apologized to IPCO after the BBC challenged the Security Service's false statements to the courts. The article raises concerns about IPCO's ability to effectively hold MI5 accountable and ensure the Security Service operates within the law and in the public interest.</p>

          <p>European leaders are increasingly advocating for the European Union to become more self-reliant, seeking to reduce dependencies on the US for defense and technology, China for raw materials and clean technology, and Russia for energy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has emphasized the need for Europe to shape the emerging international order, while French President Emmanuel Macron supports the idea of strategic autonomy. The EU has attempted to engage with Beijing, seeking economic concessions in exchange for improved political relations, but Brussels now believes that China has declined this offer.</p>
