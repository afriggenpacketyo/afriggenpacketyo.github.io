          <p>Amid a prolonged government shutdown, an air traffic controller has taken on a second job as a DoorDash driver to pay for his daughter's tuition and other expenses. The story highlights the severe financial strain faced by essential federal employees who are working without full pay, forcing them to take out loans and tap into retirement funds. This situation also raises concerns about the immense pressure on workers in safety-sensitive positions, as the stress of financial instability is compounded by the demands of a high-stakes job.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is currently underperforming the S&P 500 by the largest margin this year, a gap that has widened to nearly seven percentage points. A significant factor is the company's decision to sell a large portion of its Apple stock, a move that has resulted in missing out on substantial subsequent gains as Apple's share price reached new highs. Buffett has explained the sale as a strategic move to realize gains at a lower capital gains tax rate, anticipating that tax rates are likely to increase in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report reveals that more than one-third of Manhattan condo apartments sold over the last year were sold at a loss, indicating a decade of stagnant prices in stark contrast to national real estate trends. Analysts attribute this weakness to factors like the cap on state and local tax deductions and migration patterns during the pandemic, although the luxury market has remained strong. While some brokers view the market as stable and presenting opportunities, the data suggests that for many owners, a Manhattan condo has not been a profitable investment in recent years.

          <h2>Despite Widespread Anxiety, Artificial Intelligence Has Yet to Significantly Disrupt Hollywood</h2>

          <p>Although new AI technologies like OpenAI's Sora 2 have sparked widespread panic in Hollywood about job displacement and copyright issues, the actual integration of AI into filmmaking has been slow and has not yet yielded major disruptions. Large studios such as Disney have reportedly invested millions into AI initiatives but are facing significant technical, legal, and logistical challenges that have prevented the realization of promised cost savings and efficiencies. For the time being, AI remains an experimental tool rather than a transformative force in the industry.</p>

          <p>Dr. Roy Meals, a retired hand surgeon approaching his 80th birthday, recently completed a solo hike along the entire 342-mile perimeter of Los Angeles to better understand the city he has called home for half a century. Documenting his journey in a new book, he argues that true exploration can only be done on foot, allowing for spontaneous discoveries of history, culture, and community. His trek uncovered hidden landmarks and diverse neighborhoods, reinforcing his belief in a life of curiosity, fitness, and engagement.</p>

          <p>The activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake of nearly 5% in the engineering and construction giant Fluor. Starboard's strategy is to address what it sees as a significant undervaluation of Fluor's core business, which is obscured by the company's large 39% ownership stake in the nuclear technology firm NuScale Power. The activist investor is advocating for Fluor to monetize or separate its NuScale holding, which could lead to a substantial rerating of Fluor's stock price by the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new survey from Charles Schwab indicates a growing disillusionment with conventional portfolios, with 45% of investors expressing interest in alternative assets like private equity, real estate, and hedge funds. For those looking to diversify, financial advisors often point to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a practical and liquid way to gain exposure to these markets without the complexities of direct investment. While alternatives can offer diversification, experts caution that a traditional, broad-based portfolio of stocks and bonds remains the most reliable strategy for long-term financial goals.
