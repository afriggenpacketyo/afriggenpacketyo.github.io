          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to ban the pro-Palestine activist group, Palestine Action, as a terrorist organization. Cooper stated the group's activities, which include claims of responsibility for property damage and violent disorder, go beyond legitimate protest. The move has led to over 700 arrests and criticism from rights groups like Amnesty International, who argue the ban is disproportionate and a threat to freedom of expression.</p>

The wallet, discovered under the hood of a 2015 Ford Edge, had fallen out of the worker's pocket in Michigan in 2014. After finding the owner on Facebook, the mechanic mailed the wallet back, which still contained $15 in cash and $250 in Cabela's gift cards that were confirmed to be valid.</p>

          <p>Anti-government protests in Serbia have intensified, with demonstrators setting fire to the ruling Serbian Progressive Party's offices in Valjevo on the fifth consecutive night of unrest. The protests, initially sparked by a deadly railway station collapse, have grown into widespread calls for President Aleksandar Vučić's resignation and early elections. Riot police have been deployed across several cities, and there are allegations of police brutality, while Russia has pledged its support for the pro-Moscow Serbian government.</p>

          <p>A new Chinese design concept proposes a hypersonic drone carrier featuring a single, centrally mounted "scissor wing" that can rotate up to 90 degrees. This innovative design aims to solve the aerodynamic challenges of flying at both low and high speeds, a long-standing goal that even NASA has explored. The wing would be perpendicular to the fuselage for efficient takeoff and subsonic flight, pivot to 45 degrees at transonic speeds to reduce drag, and align parallel to the fuselage at Mach 5, turning the entire aircraft into a "waverider."</p>

          <p>A Colorado dentist, James Craig, has been found guilty of first-degree murder for poisoning his wife, Angela Craig, who died in March 2023. Prosecutors argued that Craig researched undetectable poisons online, purchased arsenic and potassium cyanide, and administered them to his wife through her routine protein shakes. The investigation was triggered after a business partner grew suspicious of a cyanide delivery to the dental office, leading to Craig's arrest and a sentence of life in prison.</p>

          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological factors that can lead individuals to risk their careers and families by having an affair. These reasons include a lifetime of repressing personal desires to be "good," the pressures of perfectionism often rooted in trauma, and having poor boundaries developed from a parentified childhood. Other significant triggers can be escaping an abusive marriage or experiencing a profound loss, which prompts a re-evaluation of life priorities.</p>

          <p>The governors of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced the deployment of their states' National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. This action is in support of President Trump's initiative to address crime and homelessness in the nation's capital. The move follows Trump's declaration of a public safety emergency and the federalization of the D.C. police force, a decision that has sparked protests and opposition from local officials who view it as an overreach of federal power.</p>

Many families also rely on community pantries and food vouchers to cope with the extra financial pressure of providing meals that are often subsidized during the school term.</p>

          <p>A new wave of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding globally, starting with hubs like Singapore, offering authentic regional cuisines far beyond Westernized staples like chow mein. Driven by intense competition at home, brands are showcasing the vast diversity of Chinese food, from fiery Hunan dishes to delicate Zhejiang seafood, in immersive, culturally rich settings. This culinary expansion is seen by some as a powerful and effective form of soft power, potentially serving as a new "ping-pong diplomacy" to help soften China's image on the world stage.</p>

          <p>A new box set, "Sunset Boulevard," chronicles the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, capturing his final burst of creativity before his death in 1977. The collection includes hits like "Burning Love" and showcases his evolution into an expressive ballad singer, influenced by his personal troubles. According to his friend Jerry Schilling, this period also included a major disappointment when Presley lost a potential role in "A Star Is Born," a setback that may have contributed to his subsequent career decline.</p>

          <p>During his summit with Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly demanded that Ukraine cede control of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions as a condition for ending the war. In exchange, Russia would freeze the front lines and potentially give up other occupied territories. This proposal, which Trump is said to support, sets the stage for a high-stakes meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has consistently rejected surrendering any territory to Moscow, making a quick resolution seem unlikely.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard iPhone design. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of price points and new designs are creating renewed competition, with Apple now expected to release its own foldable phone by 2026.
