          <p>Tokyo police and prosecutors have issued a formal apology to two men, Masaaki Okawara and Junji Shimada, for their wrongful arrest and indictment in 2020. The case involved allegations of unauthorized export of sensitive equipment. The apology follows a Tokyo High Court ruling that ordered compensation for Okawara, president of Ohkawara Kakohki Co., and Shimada, a former director. Tetsuro Kamata and Hirohide Mori expressed regret for the stress caused by the investigation, which centered on spray-drying apparatus suspected of being used for biological weapons, however the family of a third man, Shizuo Aishima, who died after falling ill during detention, did not accept the apology. Authorities admitted to failing to thoroughly investigate the case and are facing calls for a third-party review, but they remain reluctant. Optimism score must be a multiple of 5.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow warning for thunderstorms across parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. The heat and humidity are predicted to cause torrential downpours, potentially leading to localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. The UK Health Security Agency has also issued an amber heat-health alert for England, which will remain in effect until Monday, raising concerns about pressures on health and social care services, including a possible increase in deaths among vulnerable populations. While the current heat is record-breaking for 2025, it remains below the June peak of 35.6C recorded in 1976, and firefighters are also battling a surge in wildfires across England and Wales. Despite the challenges, some relief is expected on Sunday as cooler air moves in from the west.</p>

          <p>Ukrainians returning from Russian prisons recount experiences of humiliation, subjugation, and torture, with their paths forward varying widely after their release. Yuriy Hulchuk and Vlad Zadorin, both former prisoners of war, report similar experiences of systematic torture, yet they hold different attitudes toward their tormentors. Hulchuk prefers to forget and look ahead, while Zadorin harbors deep hatred and seeks justice for the crimes committed against him. Both men received compensation from the Ukrainian state, but Hulchuk plans to study in Germany while Zadorin works to combat Russian disinformation. It is important to consider the complex emotional and psychological challenges faced by these individuals as they reintegrate into society.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld President Trump's control over the California National Guard in Los Angeles, blocking Governor Newsom's efforts to regain control amidst immigration-related protests. The White House announced that Trump will decide within two weeks whether the U.S. will strike Iran, a decision that has sparked debate among his supporters. European diplomats are meeting with Iran's foreign minister in Geneva to seek a diplomatic resolution to the Israel-Iran conflict. Separately, Doctors Without Borders has launched a project in Colombia to heal psychic wounds in a region affected by years of violence, using a photo-based healing ritual.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid controversial dismissals of independent advisors and staff at health agencies, experts express concern that the U.S. is less prepared to respond to a pandemic than it was before 2020. Experts cite a lack of quality information from officials, weakened virus monitoring systems, and public health reductions at the federal, state, and local levels. The HHS Secretary has downplayed the severity of measles and spread misinformation about vaccines, while the H5N1 outbreak has been plagued by incomplete information. Decreased testing and monitoring, coupled with budget cuts and international monitoring program cancellations, exacerbate the risk, potentially leading to preventable suffering.</p>

          <p>An article in Vox argues that progressive politics' top priority, expanding the welfare state, may be slipping out of reach due to Democrats' electoral challenges and aversion to broad-based tax increases. The piece contends that Democrats' concentration on the coasts and reluctance to tax anyone but the super-rich hinder their ability to win robust congressional majorities. With Republicans enacting tax cuts and Social Security's trust fund nearing exhaustion, space for new welfare programs is limited unless Democrats embrace broader taxation. The author suggests liberals may need to scale back ambitions and pursue regulatory policies while striving to build the political will for future tax increases.</p>

          <p>A new PBS documentary, *Caregiving*, examines the difficulties faced by caregivers in America, highlighting the lack of resources and support for those caring for sick or elderly relatives. The film traces the history of care in the U.S., revealing how it has shifted between being a public concern and a private matter. It explores the gaps in Medicare and Medicaid coverage for long-term care and the financial strain on caregivers. The documentary also features activists working to bring caregiving back into the public conversation and advocates for policies to support caregivers, such as tax credits.</p>

          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant increase after the European satellite operator announced a â‚¬1.35 billion ($1.55 billion) capital raise, led by the French state and supported by other investors. The capital will support investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focused on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. Following the move, the French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights. Eutelsat sends satellites to space using rockets from companies like SpaceX, deploying them into both LEO and geostationary orbit (GEO).</p>

          <p>The People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, has cautioned against an "addiction" to blind card packs and blind boxes among the country's youth. The report calls for strict identity verification to curb the "out-of-control consumption" of these items by minors, citing concerns over impulsive spending. The allure of unknown surprises in blind boxes and card packs is said to hide "commercial traps" that exploit young consumers. This warning echoes regulations enacted years ago to prevent online gaming addiction among teenagers, as the "guzi economy" gains traction among China's younger generation.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales experienced a significant decline in May, with sales volumes dropping 2.7%, marking the largest monthly fall in over a year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was primarily attributed to a "dismal" month for supermarkets, with reduced purchases of alcohol and tobacco as households cut back on spending. Clothing and household goods stores also reported slow trading, while government borrowing reached the second-highest level for May since 1993. Despite a previous rise in April due to sunny weather, consumers are now cutting back due to inflation, contributing to concerns about the UK economy's growth.</p>
