          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 02:41:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance in England mandates the teaching of anti-misogyny, deepfake awareness, and healthy consent in sex education classes, with full legal force by September 2026. Schools will educate pupils on identifying positive male role models and proactively involve parents in curriculum discussions. While specific age limits are removed, the guidance outlines content for primary and secondary levels, encompassing topics like incel norms, AI-generated sexual imagery, and sexual ethics beyond basic consent. Additionally, the curriculum will address suicide prevention, a crucial inclusion welcomed by advocacy groups. This updated approach aims to better equip young people for contemporary challenges.</p>

          <p>Russia's Defense Ministry reported downing 55 Ukrainian drones overnight across southern and southwestern regions, causing minor injuries and damage in Lipetsk and Voronezh. This comes as US President Donald Trump announced plans for severe tariffs on Russia and committed to sending new weapons, including Patriot missiles, to Ukraine via NATO. Concurrently, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss bilateral ties, including preparations for Putin's upcoming visit, while EU foreign ministers gathered in Brussels to coordinate support for Ukraine and consider tougher sanctions. Diplomatic efforts are intensifying amidst continued drone attacks.</p>

          <p>Ireland wing Mack Hansen's fitness for the British and Irish Lions' first Test against Australia remains ambiguous, despite initial assurances from assistant coach John Dalziel. Another assistant, Richard Wigglesworth, later confirmed Hansen sustained a foot injury against the AUNZ Invitational team and did not fully participate in Tuesday's training. This situation creates confusion, as Wigglesworth stated anyone not training fully is a "doubt" for Saturday, yet also suggested the 23-man squad had already been settled. With injured full-back Blair Kinghorn also a concern, the team's final lineup decisions for the crucial match are highly anticipated.</p>

          <p>UK Finance Minister Rachel Reeves faces increasing pressure to outline her strategy for boosting economic growth and addressing a significant budget deficit in her upcoming Mansion House speech. Investors are seeking clarity on how the Labour government plans to manage public finances, with government debt nearing 100% of GDP. Key areas of focus include a potential overhaul of the pensions regime, aiming to address the adequacy of retirement savings amidst rising state pension costs. Concerns also persist regarding possible tax increases on the financial services sector or wealthy individuals to fill the fiscal gap, as the government remains committed to the state pension "triple lock."

          <p>China's Tianlong-3 rocket successfully passed a critical ground-based stress test, a year after an explosive mishap during a static-fire test. The company, Space Pioneer, used the rocket's nine-engine first stage to simulate key mission phases, including fuelling, lift-off, flight, and recovery, confirming its structural integrity under extreme stress. Last year's incident saw the rocket lift off unexpectedly and crash in a hilly area, creating a massive fireball. This successful test marks a significant step forward for China's private space program and its efforts in developing reusable rocket technology, showcasing improved engineering.</p>

          <p>The nearly century-old Grand Canyon Lodge on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park was reduced to ruins by a wind-whipped wildfire over the weekend. Designed in 1927 by Gilbert Stanley Underwood, the lodge was a beloved refuge for hikers and tourists, offering magnificent views and blending organically with the landscape. The lightning-caused blaze, initially managed to clear fuel, shifted due to strong winds and consumed the historic structure and dozens of other buildings, prompting hundreds of evacuations. This marks the second time the lodge has been destroyed by fire, having been rebuilt in 1938 after a 1932 blaze, with optimists hoping for another regeneration.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing a rare jury trial to determine its liability in the 2019 death of Naibel Benavides, who was tragically struck by a Tesla on autopilot while stargazing in Florida. Her boyfriend was also seriously injured in the incident. Lawyers argue the car's driver assistance system should have warned the driver and braked, alleging the Model S sped through red lights and a stop sign at nearly 70mph. Tesla contends the driver, who reached for a dropped phone, is solely to blame. The case is significant as previous lawsuits against Tesla regarding its self-driving features have typically been dismissed or settled.</p>

These efforts, seen as amplifying the "China threat," are interpreted by some as revealing Washington's weakening confidence in managing regional tensions. While the Pentagon aims to restore deterrence and strengthen collective defense by urging allies to increase spending and military cooperation, experts believe Japan and Australia may resist explicit commitments to avoid further provoking China.

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, effectively ending a 2019 agreement designed to avert "anti-dumping" duties. This move, part of President Trump's broader tariff strategy, aims to protect the domestic tomato industry, which claims to be undercut by cheap Mexican imports. Critics, however, warn that the tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices and harm US companies reliant on imported produce, with some senators expressing concern about grocery costs. The decision reignites a decades-long dispute over alleged unfair trade practices, with Mexico's ministries criticizing the action as detrimental to both nations' interests.

          <p>Groundbreaking research from Tel Aviv University suggests animals react to sounds made by plants, hinting at a previously unknown ecosystem. In the first such evidence, scientists observed female moths avoiding distressed tomato plants that emitted specific sounds, indicating unhealthiness. These plant sounds, outside human hearing, are perceivable by many insects, bats, and some mammals. Researchers are now exploring whether other species make decisions based on plant sounds and if plants communicate through sound, potentially influencing behaviors like water conservation in drought conditions. This discovery opens a "vast, unexplored field" in interspecies communication and coevolution.</p>

Cases of whooping cough and measles have surged in Europe, while nine countries, including Nigeria and Afghanistan, account for over half of the world's unvaccinated children.
