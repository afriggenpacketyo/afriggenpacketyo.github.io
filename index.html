          <p>Tesla's board has granted CEO Elon Musk a new compensation package valued at approximately $29 billion in restricted stock. This decision comes just months after a Delaware judge voided his previous $56 billion package from 2018, a ruling Musk is currently appealing. The new grant is intended to incentivize Musk to remain as CEO until at least 2030 and guide the company's transition into an AI-focused entity. If the original 2018 package is reinstated by the courts, this new award will be forfeited.</p>

One of the teenagers, a boy, had expressed desires to kill a human, and both have been banned from owning animals for life.

          <p>Amazon is restructuring its audio business, leading to job cuts at its Wondery podcast division and the departure of its CEO, Jen Sargent. As part of the reorganization, some Wondery units will be consolidated under the Audible division, which handles audiobooks and podcasts. The move aims to better align teams and address the evolving podcast landscape, which includes the rising popularity of video podcasts on platforms like YouTube.

Despite recent positive price movement, the club is trimming its position, which has been ongoing since the company revised its outlook downward. The article notes that the funds would ideally be reallocated to Starbucks, which they view as a buying opportunity, but trading restrictions are currently preventing this move.

          <p>Two men, aged 23, have appeared in court in Nuneaton, UK, on charges related to the sexual assault and kidnap of a 12-year-old girl. The case has gained political attention after a local council leader alleged the men are asylum seekers, accusing authorities of a 'cover-up' regarding their immigration status. Police and the Home Office have followed standard guidance by not disclosing such details during an active investigation. The incident has prompted public concern and commentary from political figures about transparency in criminal cases.</p>

The new video features Francesa walking in on an 'annual meeting' between players from both teams, including Eli Manning and Logan Webb. This playful content finally grants the wish of 'Dan in Warwick,' whose call has become a legendary moment in sports radio history.</p>

          <p>Nuremberg Zoo in Germany has confirmed it fed culled baboons to its lions and tigers, a decision that has sparked public outcry and hundreds of criminal complaints. The zoo stated the culling of 12 baboons was a necessary measure due to chronic overcrowding and failed attempts to rehome the animals. Officials defended the practice of feeding the carcasses to predators as a way to mimic natural diets, which benefits the carnivores' dental health and behavior. The incident has fueled a wider debate on the ethics of animal management and culling practices within zoos.</p>

          <p>More than 10,000 hotels across Europe have joined a class-action lawsuit against the online travel platform Booking.com, seeking compensation for alleged unfair business practices.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is expected to name replacements for a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve's board and for the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the coming days. The Fed position opened with the resignation of Governor Adriana Kugler, while the BLS spot became vacant after Trump fired Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a disappointing jobs report. The moves have sparked concern about the potential politicization of both the central bank and the nation's key economic data collection agencies, which are traditionally independent.</p>

          <p>A farm worker in South Africa, accused in the killing of two women, has claimed he was forced by the farm's owner to dispose of their bodies by feeding them to pigs.

The case, involving three accused men, has ignited significant public outrage and highlighted ongoing racial tensions in the country's rural areas. The farm worker has turned state witness, and the trial has been postponed amid a packed and emotional courtroom.</p>

          <p>Millions of car buyers in the UK who used financing over the past 18 years could be eligible for compensation following a Supreme Court ruling on hidden commissions. The court found that in some cases, the failure of dealers to properly disclose commission charges paid by lenders was unfair and unlawful. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is now developing a compensation scheme, with payments expected in 2026. Eligibility will likely depend on whether customers were treated 'fairly' and the prominence of commission details in their contracts.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the escalating political conflict over congressional redistricting, sparked by a Republican effort in Texas to redraw maps mid-decade to gain an electoral advantage for the 2026 midterms. This move, prompted by Donald Trump, has led Texas Democrats to flee the state to block the vote and prompted Democratic governors in states like California and New York to threaten retaliatory gerrymandering. However, Democrats face significant legal and political hurdles, including independent redistricting commissions and state laws established to prevent such partisan maneuvers. The situation highlights a growing 'electoral arms race' where established political norms are being challenged.</p>

After Medvedev issued a threat on social media regarding Russia's nuclear capabilities, Trump responded by announcing the repositioning of U.S. nuclear submarines. A Kremlin spokesperson stated that everyone should be 'very cautious' with such language, while also noting that U.S. submarines are always on alert. The exchange occurs as Trump threatens sanctions if Moscow does not enter ceasefire negotiations with Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media and a former congressman, against NBCUniversal. The lawsuit concerned comments made by MSNBC host Rachel Maddow in 2021 about Nunes's handling of a package from a suspected Russian agent. The judge ruled that no reasonable jury could find that Maddow acted with 'actual malice,' the legal standard for defamation against a public figure. The court found that Nunes failed to provide clear evidence that Maddow was aware her statements were false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.</p>
