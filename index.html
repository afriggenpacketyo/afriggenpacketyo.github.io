          <p>The 2025 local elections in England saw Reform UK make significant gains, securing control of 10 councils. Both Labour and the Conservatives experienced substantial losses, failing to retain control of any councils they previously held. The Liberal Democrats and Greens also made gains, while mayoral contests presented a mixed outcome. Reform UK's success was particularly notable in former Conservative strongholds, suggesting a shift in voter allegiance and a potential loosening of the traditional main parties' grip on the electorate.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study analyzing skull shapes of cats and dogs found that domestication has led to surprising similarities between breeds, despite their distant evolutionary histories. Selective breeding by humans has caused convergence in skull structures, with breeds like Persian cats and pugs exhibiting similar flat-faced features. This convergence is driven by human preferences for infant-like features, which trigger caregiving instincts, but it often results in health problems for the animals due to exaggerated physical traits. The article underscores the powerful and sometimes detrimental role humans play in shaping the evolution of domesticated species. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>President Trump's budget proposal includes eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, along with the Institute of Museum and Library Services. This move aligns with his previous attempts to cut these agencies, which were unsuccessful due to bipartisan support in Congress. Democrats have reacted strongly, vowing to fight the proposed cuts, which they see as an attack on the arts and government funding for cultural institutions. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>A Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas has called the administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act “unlawful”—and was among other judges from across the country who have ruled against the president. Michael Scherer, an Atlantic staff writer, said last night, “The defining fact of the first three months of this second term of Trump is that so many of the institutions that so successfully opposed him in the first term have been absent or in retreat. The one exception to that is the legal process.” Although judges “operate at a different tempo than politicians or executive orders,” he added, “you have seen in the last few weeks a really dramatic move by the judiciary to step in.” Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>More high school seniors are choosing colleges based on cost due to rising tuition and student debt concerns. The rising cost of college has resulted in a higher percentage of students enrolling in public schools over private ones, according to Robert Franek, editor-in-chief of The Princeton Review. This trend is further influenced by uncertainties about financial aid and changing policies about student loans. Optimism score: 60</p>
