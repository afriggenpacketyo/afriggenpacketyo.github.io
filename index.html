          <h2>UK to End Overseas Recruitment for Care Workers Amid Immigration System Overhaul</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 08:27:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration to the UK. The government aims to shift towards hiring British nationals or extending visas for overseas workers already in the country. This initiative includes raising the threshold for skilled visas to graduate level and implementing stricter training requirements for domestic workers. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp criticized the measures as insufficient, advocating for an annual migration cap exceeding 50,000. The government has already tightened rules around care sector worker after coming to power last July.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for a second day of negotiations aimed at de-escalating trade tensions stemming from tariffs imposed by both nations. President Trump hinted at potentially lowering tariffs from 145% to 80%, contingent on China making concessions, while China maintains it will not yield to tariff pressures. The talks, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, seek to establish a foundation for broader economic discussions, although economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a swift resolution. The Trump administration has accused China of unfairly subsidizing key sectors of its economy and flooding the world with cheap goods.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is spearheading an unprecedented smear campaign against Ukraine, aiming to undermine its potential accession to the EU. Orban's government is disseminating propaganda portraying Ukraine as a hub for drug trafficking and organized crime, seeking to exploit anti-immigrant sentiments. This campaign is seen as a strategic maneuver to discredit opposition leader Peter Magyar, whose popularity is surging ahead of parliamentary elections. Orban's anti-Ukrainian stance also aligns with his pro-Russian leanings and nostalgic sentiments among far-right voters who dream of incorporating parts of western Ukraine into Hungary.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's optimistic outlook on trade deals, Wall Street strategists caution that stock market volatility is likely to persist.

Concerns include the pace of trade deal progress and potential impacts on inventory levels. The article notes declining cargo ship arrivals at Los Angeles and Long Beach ports due to tariffs, signaling existing economic strain.

          <p>Donald Trump and his Republican allies frequently denounce the US media as purveyors of ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù despite instances where news organizations seem to accommodate Trump‚Äôs agenda. Some media outlets have settled lawsuits or seen wealthy owners intervene to avoid upsetting Trump. Jeff Bezos, owner of the Washington Post, reportedly ordered changes to the paper's editorial pages, while the Los Angeles Times dropped its endorsement of Kamala Harris under pressure from its owner. Experts suggest these actions are driven by financial considerations, with media owners prioritizing their bottom lines over journalistic independence. Despite these concessions, Trump continues to attack journalists and threaten investigations into media outlets.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's use of Chinese-made weapons in the recent Kashmir conflict has demonstrated their capabilities against India's Western and Russian arms. However, analysts caution that it remains premature to definitively assess the superiority of either side's technology. Tensions escalated following India's military strikes, dubbed Operation Sindoor, in response to a terrorist attack. India claimed to have targeted terrorist camps backed by Pakistan, while Pakistan asserted it shot down five Indian aircraft, including Rafale jets.

          <p>An author recounts the experience of losing their home in the Palisades Fire and the subsequent decision to relocate to Spain due to the political climate in the United States under the Trump administration. The growing sense of authoritarianism and the perceived cruelty of the ruling party prompted the author and their wife to question the wisdom of rebuilding in America. The move to Spain, facilitated by their German passports, is seen as a temporary measure to wait out Trump's chaos. The article reflects on the difficulty of building a home in a country where they no longer feel a sense of belonging.</p>

Examples include couples moving near friends to share childcare responsibilities and families living in co-housing communities.

          <p>A university researcher discusses the phenomenon of doomsday prepping in America, noting its roots in self-sufficiency and frontier culture. While extreme preppers are often sensationalized, about half of Americans engage in some form of preparedness. This behavior is linked to a perceived inadequacy of government response to disasters, leading individuals to take personal responsibility through consumption choices. The ultra-wealthy's extravagant preparations are seen as conspicuous consumption, influencing middle-class preparedness. The article explores the motivations behind prepping, ranging from apocalyptic fears to practical concerns about extreme weather events and grid failure.</p>

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that this exemption would be part of the economic prosperity deal. The UK's Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated that the wider aerospace industry would have a specific guarantee of zero tariffs. This deal would provide certainty to a ¬£40 billion sector, supporting 450,000 jobs in the UK. The agreement follows relief for the car and steel industries, with car tariffs potentially reduced to 10% on at least 100,000 vehicles a year and steel tariffs eliminated.</p>

While birth order psychology is often debated, studies show that first-born children have a cognitive edge. The article also touches on the role of genetics, noting that genetic inclinations elicit responses from the world that shape personalities and outcomes.

          <p>A proposal to replace public basketball courts with pickleball facilities in Fort Lauderdale's historic beachfront has ignited controversy, with some residents alleging racial motivations. The basketball courts, built shortly after desegregation, have long been popular among a diverse group of players. Critics fear the conversion will displace the community tradition and cater to a wealthier, whiter demographic. Developers maintain the decision was based on pickleball's broader appeal and deny any nefarious intent. The mayor is exploring options for preservation or relocation of the basketball courts amid community outcry.</p>

          <p>Germany has started turning away asylum seekers at its borders with other European countries, marking the first such action since the new government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz tightened immigration controls. Out of 365 undocumented entries, 286 migrants and refugees were sent back, including 19 who had applied for asylum. Reasons for rejection included no valid visa, fake documents, or entry suspension. The new policy aims to curb illegal migrant entries, with Merz arguing that Germany is surrounded by safe EU states where migrants should first seek refuge. The move has drawn criticism from politicians and neighboring EU countries.</p>
