          <p>President Trump has accused China of violating a trade agreement with the U.S., just weeks after both countries tentatively eased tariffs imposed earlier in the year. Trump didn't specify the nature of the violation, but the agreement involved a 90-day suspension of most levies imposed since early April. The U.S. had reduced tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30% from 145%, while China lowered its levies on American imports to 10%. Trump expressed disappointment, stating that China had "totally violated its agreement with us."</p>

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary is on track to receive bonuses exceeding â‚¬100m, potentially marking one of the largest payouts in European corporate history. This follows Ryanair's shares closing above â‚¬21 for 28 consecutive days, meeting a key performance target. O'Leary will have the option to receive 10 million shares, valued at around â‚¬111.2m, provided he remains with the airline until the end of July 2028. Ryanair emphasized that the share price aspect of the bonus is contingent on O'Leary and the management team staying employed until July 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jesse Armstrong, known for Succession, has written and directed Mountainhead, a timely film for HBO about tech billionaires facing a global crisis due to AI. Armstrong aims to capture the power and hubris of wealthy men trying to rewire the world. The film stars Steve Carell, Cory Michael Smith, Jason Schwartzman, and Ramy Youssef, and was completed on a short timeline to stay relevant amidst current events. The film is not a direct satire but rather a portrait of buffoonish elites who believe their success entitles them to rule.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has terminated a tenured professor, Francesca Gino, for the first time in 80 years, after she was found to have falsified data in multiple published papers. The scandal, which involved manipulating study data to support her hypotheses, was initially exposed on the blog Data Colada. Gino's main academic focus was honesty in business, and her denials were deemed unconvincing. Harvard's handling of the case is seen as a positive step in addressing scientific fraud, which is a significant problem across academia.</p>
