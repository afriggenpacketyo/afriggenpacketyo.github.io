          <p>The release of over 2,000 documents related to the JFK assassination has been met with mixed reactions. While experts praise the increased transparency, they note that no major revelations have emerged, though some documents provide further insight into the CIA's surveillance of Lee Harvey Oswald.  The release includes more complete versions of previously released documents, and some old theories have been resurrected, though they remain unsubstantiated.</p>

          <p>Darden Restaurants reported lower-than-anticipated sales in its fiscal third quarter, with Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse underperforming analyst projections.  Earnings per share were slightly higher than expected, but revenue fell short.  The company's net sales still saw an increase of 6.2%, driven by the recent acquisition of Chuy's restaurants.</p>

          <p>ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems expects a significant increase in its market size due to rising defense spending.

          <h2>Review Recommends Separating Sex and Gender in Public Data</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review found that conflating sex and gender identity in public data has led to missed cancer screenings and overlooked criminal convictions. The review, led by Prof. Alice Sullivan, recommends that public bodies collect data on both sex and gender identity separately to ensure accuracy in clinical care, cancer screenings, and safeguarding.  The report also highlights concerns about policing and the issuance of NHS numbers and changed gender markers.</p>

          <p>Scottish universities experienced a significant drop in overseas student enrollment last year.  The decline, which affects students from various countries including China, India, and Nigeria, is concerning given the importance of tuition fees from international students to university funding.
