          <p>Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese strongly criticized WNBA officiating following a loss to the Minnesota Lynx, expressing frustration over a significant free-throw disparity between the two teams. Reese, who had 16 points and 17 rebounds, pointed out that her team had only shot eight free throws compared to Minnesota's 17. She stated she was tired of the issue and was willing to be fined for her comments, adding her voice to a growing number of players who have been critical of the league's officiating this season.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has officially concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and that no evidence of a so-called "client list" or blackmail material exists. The memo detailing the findings aimed to dispel long-standing conspiracy theories, stating that video footage confirmed no one entered his cell and a systematic review of evidence revealed no incriminating list. The agencies affirmed that while Epstein harmed over 1,000 victims, perpetuating unfounded theories does not serve justice, and no further disclosures are warranted.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas over the July Fourth weekend resulted in the deaths of over 100 people, with many still missing. The disaster was caused by a stationary storm system that dumped extreme rainfall, causing the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes while many were asleep. The article details how the region's geography makes it prone to such events and notes the significant death toll at Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp, raising serious questions about the adequacy of emergency warnings and preparedness.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has projected a 56% decline in its second-quarter operating profit, falling significantly short of market expectations. The South Korean tech giant is struggling to compete in the high-demand market for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are crucial for artificial intelligence applications and dominated by competitors like SK Hynix. Analysts attribute the disappointing forecast to ongoing losses in its chip foundry business and its failure to secure certification from AI leader Nvidia for its most advanced HBM chips.

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House, celebrating recent joint strikes against Iran as a major victory. However, the meeting was underscored by the urgent need to end the 21-month war in Gaza, with the U.S. pushing for a ceasefire deal. While both leaders projected unity, significant hurdles remain, as Hamas demands a permanent end to the war for the release of hostages, a condition Netanyahu has so far rejected. The discussions also touched on expanding the Abraham Accords, with an end to the Gaza conflict seen as key.</p>

          <p>Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who served as President Joe Biden's physician, has requested to delay his testimony before a House Republican-led committee investigating Biden's health and mental fitness while in office. His lawyer cited the need to protect doctor-patient confidentiality, arguing that the committee's refusal to accommodate these privilege concerns was "unprecedented." The Oversight Committee has subpoenaed Dr. O'Connor and rejected the delay, stating that its rules allow for privilege to be asserted on a question-by-question basis.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed a United Nations working group that the United States holds exclusive legal jurisdiction and responsibility for the more than 200 migrants sent to its CECOT mega-prison. This statement contradicts the Trump administration's position that it cannot retrieve the men because they are under Salvadoran authority. El Salvador clarified that it is merely facilitating the use of its prison infrastructure for individuals detained under another state's justice system, following a deal with the U.S. to house the alleged gang members.</p>

          <p>Six months after devastating wildfires, California Governor Gavin Newsom is renewing his call for $40 billion in federal disaster aid from the Republican-controlled House. While urging for bipartisan cooperation, Newsom simultaneously launched a blistering critique of the Trump administration's recent immigration raids in Los Angeles, calling them a "disgrace" and proof of a "polluted heart." This places the governor in the conflicting position of asking for federal support while sharply condemning the president's policies and actions.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has issued a correction after sending a misleading email claiming that a new law eliminated federal income taxes on benefits. In reality, the provision to eliminate taxes was removed from the final bill; instead, the law provides an additional $6,000 income tax deduction for Americans aged 65 and older. Advocacy groups criticized the original SSA communication for causing confusion among beneficiaries and for its unusually political tone in heralding the legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats in the UK have proposed an amendment to the Football Governance Bill that would mandate at least 10 Premier League soccer games be shown on free-to-air television each season. The move aims to tear down the "paywall" that makes top-flight matches inaccessible to many fans due to expensive subscription packages. If the amendment is granted a vote and passes, it would require the new independent football regulator to ensure the matches are made publicly available, similar to a law in Spain.</p>

The march, held on U.S. Independence Day, featured signs like "gringo go home" and later involved some vandalism of storefronts. This event highlights growing local anger over the transformation of neighborhoods, where rising costs and a housing crunch are increasingly attributed to the surge of remote workers and tourists.</p>
