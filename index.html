          <p>Amazon's upcoming second-quarter earnings report is being closely watched by investors, with a focus on the impacts of U.S. tariff policies and the company's substantial investments in artificial intelligence. Analysts are observing how trade tensions, particularly with China, affect Amazon's e-commerce sales, though some believe waning competition from Chinese retailers like Shein and Temu might be beneficial. Additionally, Wall Street is keen to see if the company's multi-billion dollar spending on AI will accelerate growth in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division. The company's guidance for the third quarter will be critical for understanding its outlook on these key issues. (not investment advice)</p>

Twenty-five passengers and seven crew members were transported to local hospitals for evaluation and care following the incident. Passengers described the experience as terrifying, with one likening it to an earthquake as people and items were thrown about the cabin. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have both launched investigations into the event to determine the cause of the in-flight disturbance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation has revealed that China is circumventing U.S. sanctions by purchasing oil from Iran through a network of untraceable tankers known as a "dark fleet." These ships conduct mid-sea transfers in international waters, often with their identification transponders turned off and names obscured to avoid detection. This illicit trade, which primarily occurs off the coast of Malaysia, is estimated to have generated as much as $70 billion for Iran, undermining U.S. efforts to curb the nation's nuclear program. Despite new U.S. sanctions, this activity appears to be increasing, with China maintaining that its trade with Iran is legitimate.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced sanctions against officials from the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), stating they have failed to comply with anti-terrorism commitments. The State Department's decision, which will result in U.S. visa denials for the sanctioned individuals, follows the U.S. rejection of an international push to give the PA control of Gaza. The sanctions were justified by citing the PA and PLO's support for terrorism, incitement of violence, and the "pay-for-slay" policy of compensating families of terrorists. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar praised the move for its moral clarity and for holding the PA accountable.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has formally requested that 17 major drugmakers, including Pfizer and Eli Lilly, take concrete steps to lower U.S. drug prices within the next 60 days. In letters sent to the companies, he threatened to use every available tool to combat what he termed "abusive drug pricing practices" if they do not comply. This action follows the revival of his "most favored nation" policy, which aims to tie U.S. drug costs to the lower prices paid in other developed countries. The administration is pushing for immediate relief for American families and an end to what it calls the "free ride" of other nations on American innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

According to reports, President Trump ordered his removal over the objections of FDA Commissioner Marty Makary.

          <h2>Opinion Article Argues Hamas Benefits from a Worsening Famine in Gaza</h2>

          <p>This opinion article posits that Hamas has a strategic interest in the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, using mass suffering and hunger as leverage to end the war on its own terms. The author contends that the group benefits from the international outcry generated by Israel's policies, which have restricted aid and worsened conditions for civilians. The piece notes that online supporters of Hamas have attacked efforts to alleviate the crisis, suggesting the group's intransigence in ceasefire talks is tied to this strategy. The author concludes that the best way to undermine Hamas is to flood Gaza with food and alleviate the population's suffering.</p>

          <p>A late-stage trial by Eli Lilly showed its popular diabetes drug Mounjaro offered cardiovascular health benefits when compared directly with its older treatment, Trulicity. The study found Mounjaro was not inferior to Trulicity in reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death for patients with Type 2 diabetes and established heart disease. While the results did not meet all benchmarks for superiority, Mounjaro did show a more comprehensive benefit, including a 16% lower rate of death from any cause. The data strengthens the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment, especially as Trulicity faces patent expiration in 2027.</p>

While acknowledging the focus on AI that can surpass human intellect, Field argued that Figma's complex graphics engine and proprietary technology are not easily replicable by AI models trained on public internet data. He expressed that creating such technology at scale is extremely difficult, suggesting that Figma's core business is well-defended against being replaced by advanced AI in the near future, despite the growing industry focus on superintelligence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions against Brazil, including imposing heavy tariffs and sanctioning a supreme court judge, are being widely criticized as an unprecedented interference in the nation's democracy. The moves are seen as retribution for the prosecution of his ally, former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for allegedly plotting a coup. Observers and Brazilian officials have condemned the pressure campaign as a reckless and authoritarian attempt to subvert Brazil's institutions for personal political ends. While the interference has thrilled Bolsonaro's supporters, it has angered many Brazilians who view it as a violation of their national sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The last of four former Milwaukee Hyatt hotel workers accused in the death of a guest has pleaded guilty to being a party to felony murder. Former security guard Todd Erickson entered the plea for his role in the June 2024 death of D'Vontaye Mitchell, who was pinned to the ground by the four employees for nearly nine minutes. According to investigators, the workers were attempting to restrain Mitchell after he caused a disturbance in the hotel lobby. A medical examiner ruled Mitchell's death a homicide by suffocation, in a case that has drawn comparisons to the death of George Floyd.</p>

          <p>A former nurse and a mother have lost their High Court legal challenge against the health regulator's decision to register England's first private gender clinic for teenagers. The claimants had argued that the Care Quality Commission (CQC) acted irrationally by approving the Gender Plus Hormone Clinic, which treats 16- and 17-year-olds with cross-sex hormones. However, the judge ruled that the CQC's assessment was rational and had patient safety as its foremost concern. The clinic, which maintains it follows NHS guidance, can now continue to provide services from its locations in London, Birmingham, and Leeds.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's new policy, which threatens to recognize a Palestinian state, is a significant shift driven by domestic and international pressures. The move, announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is seen as a way to push for a two-state solution and appease a large portion of his Labour Party's base, which is sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. This policy change also aligns the UK more closely with other European nations like France, which plans a similar move at the UN. However, the decision has drawn criticism from both the U.S. and Israel, highlighting the delicate diplomatic balance the UK is attempting to strike.</p>

          <p>CVS Health's stock rose after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast. The positive results were driven by strong performance in its retail pharmacy business and improvements in its Aetna insurance unit, which has been managing higher medical costs. CEO David Joyner highlighted the success of the company's new prescription drug pricing model and investments in pharmacy technology and labor. These strengths helped offset a decline in the company's health services segment, which includes its pharmacy benefit manager, Caremark. (not investment advice)</p>
