        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Washington D.C. has filed a lawsuit against the federal government following its move to take control of the city's police force. The suit challenges Attorney General Pam Bondi's appointment of the DEA head as an "emergency police commissioner," an action the city's attorney general calls an illegal abuse of authority. The legal action seeks to nullify the federal order and prevent the DEA administrator from assuming command, arguing it endangers public safety and undermines local governance. The conflict arose after the Trump administration cited the Home Rule Act to deploy federal agents and National Guard troops to address crime.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Air Force has implemented new standardized guidance for separation boards concerning service members who no longer meet military requirements, including those impacted by transgender policy changes. An internal memo states that once a board confirms a member meets the criteria for separation, it "must recommend separation," reducing the board's discretion. Supporters of the new rules argue they prioritize military readiness and create a more uniform disciplinary process across the Air Force and Space Force. This change aligns with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's broader initiative to restore a "warrior ethos" and enforce stricter physical and medical standards throughout the military.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have agreed to scale back the federal takeover of the city's police department, averting a larger legal confrontation. Under the new arrangement, Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain command, while the DEA administrator will act as a federal "designee" rather than the emergency commissioner. This resolution came after a federal judge expressed skepticism about the legality of the initial takeover order during a hearing on the city's emergency lawsuit. The agreement still allows federal authorities to direct D.C. police for specific federal purposes, such as immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas Department of Corrections reveals that Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," meticulously planned his prison escape over six months. The report details how Hardin exploited lax security in the prison kitchen to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform to simply walk out of the facility. The escape led to the firing of two prison employees and highlighted significant procedural failures, including Hardin being misclassified for a medium-security prison. Hardin survived in the wilderness for twelve days before being recaptured near the prison.</p>

          <p>The summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a tangible ceasefire agreement for the war in Ukraine. Despite both leaders describing the talks as having made "great progress," the absence of specific details or a clear path forward suggests significant differences remain. Analysts note that while the meeting provided a platform for high-level dialogue, it failed to produce the breakthrough Trump had hoped for, leaving questions about the future of U.S. policy and potential sanctions. The outcome is seen as a setback for Trump's dealmaker image but may be a relief to allies who feared unilateral concessions.</p>

          <p>San José has announced the completion of the first Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) in California that can be legally sold as a condominium, separate from the main property. This development follows a city law passed last year aimed at creating more accessible homeownership opportunities amid the state's housing crisis. Officials hope this new model of "starter home" will be replicated across California to help address the housing shortage. ADUs, often called granny flats or backyard cottages, have become increasingly popular, accounting for about one-fifth of the state's housing growth in the past year.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the dusty, exposed shoreline of California's Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in the Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust control projects at the sea have been the primary focus for addressing the region's high rates of asthma and respiratory illness. The study's authors suggest that since pollution comes from numerous sources like agriculture and diesel exhaust, efforts should pivot toward protecting people indoors with air filters and weatherization. This challenges the long-held assumption about the primary cause of the area's severe air quality issues.</p>

In one study, participants with type 2 diabetes who replaced breakfast bread with mango saw improvements in fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and other key metabolic markers. Researchers emphasize that moderation is crucial, but the findings suggest the fruit can be part of a healthy diet for diabetics when managed correctly.</p>

          <p>California Democrats have unveiled a new congressional redistricting plan designed to give their party up to five additional seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The proposal, which would be decided by voters in a special election, aims to counter similar Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas. The new map strategically redraws district lines to make several Republican-held seats more competitive for Democrats while shoring up vulnerable Democratic incumbents. This move bypasses the state's independent redistricting commission and has been framed as a necessary response to a national political battle for control of Congress.</p>

          <p>The opening Premier League match between Liverpool and Bournemouth was temporarily halted after Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by a spectator. The referee stopped play for several minutes to address the situation with both managers, and an anti-discrimination message was later read to the crowd. Despite the incident, Semenyo went on to score two goals, with his captain praising his composure in the face of the "totally unacceptable" abuse. The Football Association and Liverpool FC have condemned the act and confirmed that a police investigation is underway.</p>

          <p>A series of highly successful tech IPOs, including those for Bullish, Figma, and Circle, has signaled a strong resurgence in the market for public offerings after a nearly three-year slowdown. Investor enthusiasm is high, with several companies seeing their stock prices soar on their first day of trading, reminiscent of a bull market. This renewed confidence is encouraging a backlog of high-value startups to prepare for their own public debuts, potentially opening the floodgates for more offerings. While the market is robust, some analysts caution that the exuberant first-day pops may not be sustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An art exhibition in Bangkok featuring works by exiled artists critical of authoritarian regimes was censored following complaints from the Chinese embassy. The show's curator, a Burmese artist named Sai, claims Chinese officials demanded the removal of works by Tibetan, Uyghur, and Hong Kong artists, leading the gallery to cover up names and remove certain pieces. Fearing for their safety after being sought by Thai police, the curator and his wife fled to the UK to seek asylum. The incident has been condemned by human rights advocates as an example of China's transnational repression.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, plans to sell a simple, customizable, American-made pickup truck for a significantly lower price than the current market average. The company's strategy is to offer a barebones base model, allowing owners to add features and accessories as they see fit, thereby keeping the initial manufacturing cost down. With over 100,000 reservations, Slate is betting that affordability is the key to mass EV adoption, especially as federal incentives are being reduced. However, the vehicle will face competition from other budget-friendly models. (not investment advice)</p>

Citing the Home Rule Act, the resolution argues that the president has not demonstrated the emergency conditions required for such an unprecedented takeover. The lawmakers contend that the administration's actions are based on a misleading narrative about crime rates and have actually harmed public safety by creating command confusion. This legislative move represents a political and legal challenge to what they describe as a "lawless" overreach of executive power.</p>
