          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Suspending Habeas Corpus for Migrants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 18:37:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is actively exploring the possibility of suspending habeas corpus for migrants, a constitutional right that allows individuals to challenge their detention in court. Miller justified this consideration by arguing that the U.S. faces an "invasion" of undocumented migrants. Legal experts, however, contend that suspending habeas corpus requires congressional authorization, a point of contention given historical precedents and constitutional interpretations. The potential suspension raises concerns about due process and the rights of immigrants facing deportation. Optimism score is 20.</p>

          <p>The case of Tyre Nichols, an unarmed Black man beaten to death by Memphis police officers, underscores the challenges of achieving meaningful police reform. Despite video evidence and the officers' swift firing, securing murder convictions has proven difficult. The failure to secure convictions and the stall in broader reform efforts highlight the limitations of individual prosecutions and the need for systemic change. The article discusses the political climate and the impact of the Trump administration on police accountability. Optimism score is 15.</p>
