          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris set the fastest time during Friday's practice sessions for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, narrowly outpacing Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Norris expressed a desire for a larger performance gap, noting the high-speed Monza circuit presents a different challenge compared to tracks where McLaren has previously dominated. The session saw several drivers, including Norris's teammate Oscar Piastri, testing the limits of the track, while a spin by Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli briefly brought out a red flag. The close timings suggest a competitive weekend ahead for the teams.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies conducted a major raid at a Hyundai facility in Georgia, detaining 475 individuals suspected of working in the country illegally. The operation, described as the largest of its kind at a single site, is part of a criminal investigation into unlawful employment practices. Most of those detained were reported to be Korean nationals, prompting a response from the South Korean Foreign Ministry urging the U.S. to protect their citizens' rights. The raid has drawn criticism from labor groups who call it a politically motivated act that creates an atmosphere of fear among workers.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly stated his desire for two candidates to withdraw from the New York City mayoral race to create a one-on-one contest against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. Trump expressed his preference to not have a "communist mayor," referring to Mamdani's socialist platform and past rhetoric. The race currently includes incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo running as independents, along with Republican Curtis Sliwa. Recent reports suggest Trump's allies may be trying to persuade Adams and Sliwa to drop out by offering them positions in his administration, though both have publicly stated they are remaining in the race.</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw its most significant one-day drop in over a year, falling to 6.29% following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. This marks the lowest rate since early October and breaks a months-long trend of rates hovering in the high 6% range. For a homebuyer purchasing a median-priced home, this decrease could translate into a monthly saving of nearly $170. However, it remains uncertain whether this drop will be substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as high home prices and economic uncertainty continue to sideline many potential buyers.

          <p>The ongoing attention surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case presents several potential political scenarios for the Trump administration, according to a BBC analysis. One possibility is that continued pressure from victims and bipartisan efforts in Congress to release all government files could create a significant political crisis if new, damaging information emerges. Alternatively, the story could continue to generate noise without causing lasting damage, becoming a persistent distraction rather than a major disruption. A third scenario suggests that, without new revelations, public interest may wane, allowing the controversy to fade like many previous scandals President Trump has weathered.</p>

He pleaded not guilty, arguing his actions were aimed at exposing what he described as a "misogynistic" and "abusive" online bully. Linehan told the court that his outspoken views on gender identity have led to the breakdown of his marriage and forced him to move to the U.S.</p>

          <p>As Reform UK gains momentum, its economic plans are facing increased scrutiny, according to a BBC Verify analysis. The party's platform includes significant tax cuts totaling approximately £88 billion annually, funded by scrapping net-zero carbon emission policies and cutting alleged government waste. However, independent forecasters like the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) have cast doubt on the feasibility of these savings. The OBR's figures on net-zero costs are lower than Reform's claims, and the IFS suggests that achieving the proposed £50 billion in waste reduction would likely require substantial cuts to public services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The winner of the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot will face a substantial tax liability, regardless of whether they choose the lump sum or annuity option. The cash option, valued at $826.4 million, would be subject to a mandatory 24% federal withholding, immediately reducing it by nearly $200 million. However, since the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, a significant additional tax bill will be due. State taxes could further reduce the take-home amount, though some states do not tax lottery winnings, creating different outcomes depending on where the ticket was purchased.

          <p>The city of Norwalk, California, has agreed to repeal a controversial local ordinance that banned the development of homeless shelters, settling a lawsuit brought by the state's Attorney General. The state had sued the Los Angeles County community, arguing the ban was discriminatory and violated fair housing laws. As part of the settlement, Norwalk will also dedicate $250,000 toward new affordable housing and accept increased state monitoring of its housing policies. State officials said the outcome demonstrates their resolve to challenge cities that attempt to block housing and services for homeless residents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows to a historic $1.8 billion, a data analysis shows where winners can maximize their take-home prize. Due to varying state tax laws, the net payout differs significantly across the country. States with no income tax or those that exempt lottery winnings, such as California, Florida, and Texas, offer the highest potential returns. In contrast, states with high income taxes, like New York, would see the winner receive a substantially smaller amount after both federal and state taxes are deducted. The odds of winning the grand prize remain extremely low at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant cooling as employers added just 22,000 jobs in August, falling far short of the 80,000 forecast by economists. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3%. Adding to the concern, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised its June figures downward, revealing a loss of 13,000 jobs that month—the first monthly decline since late 2020. This slowdown in hiring points to growing economic uncertainty, influenced by the Trump administration's tariffs, and increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting to support the weakening job market.</p>

          <p>Financial planners are moving away from one-size-fits-all retirement advice, instead suggesting that a "good" monthly income is relative to an individual's lifestyle, location, and health. A common guideline is to aim for 75% to 85% of one's pre-retirement income. However, the median retirement income in the U.S. is closer to $3,900 per month, significantly less than what many may need, especially in high-cost areas. To bridge this gap, this article suggests strategies like optimizing Social Security benefits, considering annuities for guaranteed income, and exploring reverse mortgages for homeowners to supplement their retirement portfolios.

The plan would award Musk 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones, including reaching a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion and hitting high-volume production targets for vehicles, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. This proposal comes after a Delaware judge voided his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018.

The album was created with many of the same producers as its predecessor and includes guest appearances from artists like Tems and Lil B.

The company reached a $5 million settlement with the borrowers, but stated this amount will not even cover its own legal expenses incurred during the recovery effort. The loans, made in 2018 and 2019, were supposed to be backed by ships being dismantled for scrap metal, but Yieldstreet lost track of the collateral.

While a Federal Reserve rate cut is anticipated, a weakening labor market could signal broader economic trouble ahead. Experts suggest that investors re-evaluate their concentration in mega-cap tech stocks, which dominate major indexes, and consider rotating some capital into value and defensive sectors that have been overlooked during the recent rally. This doesn't require a major portfolio overhaul, but rather strategic adjustments to insulate returns from a potential downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

An analysis by Washingtonian magazine indicates that upcoming performances, such as the prestigious Stuttgart Ballet, are projected to be less than 20% full. The decline is attributed to public protest over Trump's insertion into the center's management, which has included firing the dance programming team and hiring a self-described "Maga former dancer."

This downturn is attributed to economic uncertainty driven by shifting tariff policies and high inflation, which has caused businesses to pause expansion plans.
