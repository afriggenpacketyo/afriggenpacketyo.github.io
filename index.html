          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has reached a non-prosecution agreement with Boeing, allowing the company to avoid criminal charges related to the two 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people. Under the agreement, Boeing will pay over $1.1 billion, including a criminal fine, a fund for crash victims, and investments in compliance and safety programs. Families of the victims have criticized previous agreements as lenient and have called for executives to be held accountable, though a former chief technical pilot was acquitted of fraud charges in 2022. The agreement shields Boeing from prosecution for three years, provided they adhere to the terms of the settlement.</p>

          <p>The ETF market is poised for significant growth due to an SEC rule change allowing mutual fund managers to offer ETF share classes, potentially doubling the number of ETFs available. While ETFs offer benefits like liquidity and tax efficiency, the surge in new products requires investors to conduct thorough research. Experts advise caution with new strategies, particularly in illiquid asset classes, and highlight the importance of understanding the risks associated with active management. While traditional asset allocation products will likely remain the core of the market, investors should be mindful of potential capacity constraints and liquidity issues with newer, more complex ETFs.

The orders aim to streamline the licensing process, requiring decisions within 18 months, and support both small, advanced reactors and large plants. The actions also seek to boost uranium mining and domestic enrichment capacity, while establishing a framework for the Departments of Energy and Defense to construct reactors on federal land.

The Democratic primary features six figures hoping to succeed incumbent and term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and to keep the governorship blue. Republicans are hoping to flip New Jersey's governorship red -- and point to the closer-than-expected margin between Trump and Harris in 2024 as evidence that it's in reach. Trump has endorsed the Republican front-runner Ciattarelli in the race that the president wrote is being "closely watched by the entire World."</p>

          <p>The social media platform X, under Elon Musk's ownership, faces ongoing criticism for its handling of hate speech and controversial content. Recent incidents, such as the platform's chatbot Grok's promotion of white genocide conspiracy theories and Ye's release of an anti-Semitic song, have raised concerns about the platform's neutrality. While some defend X as a bastion of free speech, critics argue that it has become an accelerator for a culture of hate, normalizing extreme viewpoints and allowing them to spread more widely.</p>

          <p>A Supreme Court ruling prevented the nationâ€™s first religious charter school from opening in Oklahoma, while the House narrowly passed legislation that could create a federal school voucher program. The bill sets aside $5 billion to fund vouchers for families to pay for private school tuition, home-schooling, or virtual learning, potentially reaching as many as 1 million students nationwide. Critics argue that the bill would siphon crucial funding from public schools, while supporters believe it would provide more options to low-income students. The legislation is now headed to the Senate.</p>

          <p>A cargo ship, the NCL Salten, ran aground in Norway, narrowly missing a house after the officer on watch reportedly fell asleep. The ship ran aground at about 5 a.m. on Thursday, barely missing a house on the shore in Byneset, a part of the city of Trondheim in central Norway. The police said on Friday that their investigation was focusing on the officer guiding the ship, saying that he told them he had fallen asleep before the crash. No injuries or oil spills were reported, and authorities are investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>The Republican-backed budget bill includes tax rules that could impact workers who earn tips or overtime pay, offering potential savings of about $1,700 per worker. The "No Tax on Tips" provision would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for those earning less than $160,000, while a separate bill passed by the Senate focuses solely on tax breaks for tipped workers. The GOP bill also includes a tax break for overtime pay, but both provisions have restrictions, including a requirement for a Social Security number. Concerns have been raised that the tax breaks may not benefit low-income workers and could lead to employers reclassifying workers as tipped. (not investment advice)</p>
