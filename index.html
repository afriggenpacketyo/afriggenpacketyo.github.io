          <h2>Women's Africa Cup of Nations Kicks Off Amidst Persistent Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 03:13:00 EDT</div>

          <p>The Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) is underway in Morocco, showcasing top talent but also highlighting familiar problems that hinder the tournament's growth. Despite rising stars and Morocco's investment in the women's game, issues like last-minute scheduling, smaller venues, and inadequate promotion persist. A significant point of contention is the financial disparity, with player compensation issues and a prize fund that, while increased, still lags far behind the men's tournament. These off-field hurdles reflect broader challenges for professional women's football in Africa.</p>

          <p>In a phone interview with the BBC, President Trump stated he is "disappointed in him, but I'm not done with him" when asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin. He reiterated plans to arm Ukraine and impose tariffs if a ceasefire is not reached within 50 days, highlighting his frustration with stalled peace efforts. Trump lamented that after seemingly productive calls with Putin, Russia would launch new attacks on Ukrainian cities. The president also affirmed his support for NATO, a shift from his previous criticisms of the alliance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of vehicles destined for the United States are sitting idle at the Port of Antwerp-Bruges in Europe, a direct consequence of new U.S. tariffs. The port has seen a significant drop in vehicle exports to the U.S., particularly a 31.5% decrease in heavy equipment like tractors, since the tariffs were announced. This has created a logistical challenge, turning parts of the major transport hub into a giant car park. The situation highlights the immediate and tangible impact of the trade policy on global supply chains and European manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the conclusion of the recent Club World Cup, FIFA President Gianni Infantino's vision for a bigger, more frequent tournament appears to be gaining momentum despite initial criticism. The substantial prize money has convinced top clubs of the event's value, with some even proposing it be held every two years. FIFA is reportedly considering expanding the competition to 48 teams in 2029, aiming to involve more elite clubs and increase revenue. However, concerns from players' unions about welfare and a packed schedule remain a significant unresolved issue.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion article posits that President Trump is aggressively implementing his campaign promises, such as sealing the border and imposing high tariffs, while mainstream media frames these actions as destructive to democracy. The author contends that this dynamic mirrors the media's previous portrayal of Joe Biden's policies as progressive reforms. The article suggests that Trump is intentionally reversing the policies of the prior administration, an action his supporters view as necessary. It also touches on the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, calling it a significant public relations failure.</p>

Among its key recommendations, the report urges the NHS to hold a summit to tackle the problem and to include antisemitism in all diversity and inclusion training. It also emphasizes that Judaism should be understood as both an ethnicity and a religion to ensure discrimination is addressed appropriately.</p>

          <p>Yields on Japan's benchmark 10-year government bonds have surged to their highest point since 2008, reflecting growing market anxiety about the country's fiscal stability. The spike comes ahead of an upper house election where discussions of potential tax cuts by various political parties are fueling fears of increased government debt. Japan already has one of the world's highest public debt-to-GDP ratios, and any deviation from fiscal discipline could further unnerve investors. This market reaction signals significant pressure on the government to maintain a prudent fiscal policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. immigration authorities are reportedly issuing administrative subpoenas to landlords, demanding they turn over extensive tenant information including leases, rental applications, and identification cards. The practice, which appears to be a new tactic in the Trump administration's deportation efforts, is raising legal questions and causing confusion. Legal experts question the legitimacy of these subpoenas as they are not signed by a judge, and warn that landlords who comply could risk violating fair housing laws. Critics fear the tactic intimidates landlords into overcompliance without proper legal oversight.</p>

The test simulated the intense forces of launch, flight, and recovery on the rocket's first stage, which features nine engines. This milestone is particularly significant as it comes a year after a previous static-fire test of the same rocket stage ended in an explosive failure. The successful test marks a crucial step forward for the company's goal of developing a reusable rocket capable of competing in the commercial launch market.</p>

The first of these massive clusters, named Prometheus, is slated to come online in 2026 in Ohio. This colossal investment underscores Meta's commitment to leading the AI race, but also raises concerns about the immense energy and water consumption required for such large-scale data operations.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing a rare jury trial to determine its responsibility in the 2019 death of a woman who was struck by a Model S sedan allegedly operating on Autopilot. The victim, Naibel Benavides, was stargazing in Florida when the car, traveling at high speed, collided with her. Lawyers for the victim's family argue that the driver-assistance feature failed to warn the driver or apply the brakes. Tesla contends the driver is solely to blame for being distracted by his phone, making this a pivotal case for the legal liability of semi-autonomous driving technology.</p>

However, experts suggest that such explicit public pledges are improbable.

A study from Tel Aviv University found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were emitting sounds associated with distress, such as dehydration. This is the first evidence of an animal responding to plant-generated sounds. The findings open up a new field of study, suggesting that many animals might use these sounds to make decisions about pollination, feeding, or seeking shelter.</p>
