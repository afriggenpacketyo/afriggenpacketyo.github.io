          <p>President Trump has invoked a rarely used law to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to address immigration protests, bypassing the authority of California Governor Gavin Newsom. This move comes amid escalating tensions surrounding federal immigration operations in Los Angeles and other cities. The deployment signifies a significant escalation in the federal government's response to protests against immigration enforcement. The context involves ongoing clashes between protesters and law enforcement, prompting the federal government to assert greater control over the situation. The deployment of the National Guard aims to quell unrest and ensure the continuation of immigration enforcement activities.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Barbara has formed off the southwestern coast of Mexico, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect, but the storm is expected to bring two to four inches of rainfall to portions of Mexico's western states, potentially leading to flooding and mudslides. The storm is also likely to generate sea swells with life-threatening surf and rip currents along the southwestern coast. Barbara is forecast to continue to strengthen and become a hurricane on Monday.</p>
