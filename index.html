          <p>Coca-Cola reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by higher prices for its beverages. However, the company noted that overall demand remains soft as consumers are becoming more cautious with their spending habits. Despite this, the beverage giant raised its full-year revenue forecast, signaling confidence in its pricing strategy and brand loyalty. The results reflect a challenging consumer environment where value is becoming increasingly important.</p>

          <p>The Central American nation of Belize has agreed to a deal with the United States to function as a "safe third country" for migrants seeking asylum. Under the agreement, which awaits approval from the Belizean Senate, migrants deported from the U.S. could apply for asylum in Belize instead of being returned to their home countries. The U.S. State Department praised the deal as a milestone in curbing illegal immigration, while human rights groups and Belize's opposition have raised concerns about its implications.</p>

          <p>Since the beginning of President Trump's second term, his administration has significantly intensified immigration enforcement, putting its deportation operations on a trajectory to surpass previous records. This push is a central component of the administration's broader immigration policy, which has been a key promise to his supporters. The accelerated pace of removals reflects a hardline stance that has been met with both strong support from his base and significant opposition from immigrant rights advocates and legal experts.</p>

          <p>A recent poll conducted by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation reveals significant pessimism among the Taiwanese public regarding President Donald Trump's willingness to defend the island from a potential Chinese invasion. Nearly 45% of respondents believe Trump is not serious about preventing an attack by force, compared to just over 34% who think he is. The findings suggest wavering confidence in the United States as a reliable security partner, reflecting broader anxieties over America's defense commitments during Trump's second term.</p>

          <p>General Motors announced strong third-quarter financial results, beating Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue. The automaker also raised its full-year financial guidance, citing robust performance and a lower-than-expected impact from tariffs. The positive outlook signals confidence in the company's trajectory heading into the final quarter of the year. GM's updated earnings-per-share target suggests a stronger fourth-quarter performance than analysts had previously anticipated, causing its stock to rise in pre-market trading.</p>

          <p>In his new book, internet activist Cory Doctorow details his theory of "enshittification," a term he coined to describe the predictable decay of online platforms like Facebook, Amazon, and Google. He argues these platforms follow a three-stage pattern: first, they are good to users to build a base; second, they abuse users to benefit business customers; and finally, they abuse business customers to extract all value for themselves. Doctorow contends this process is driven by a lack of competition and regulation, ultimately making the internet worse for everyone.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has hired Sean Dyche as its new manager on a deal lasting until 2027, seeking to bring stability to a chaotic season. The move comes after the club sacked Ange Postecoglou just 39 days into his tenure following a poor run of results that left the team in the relegation zone. Dyche, a former Burnley and Everton manager, is tasked with restoring organization and confidence to a squad that has underperformed despite significant summer investment, marking the club's third manager in just six weeks.</p>

          <p>China's exports of rare earth magnets to the United States fell by nearly 29% in September compared to the previous month, marking the second straight monthly decline. This downturn reverses a short-lived recovery and comes amid ongoing trade disputes and Washington's push to establish alternative supply chains for critical minerals. The drop coincides with reports of tighter scrutiny on export licenses by Beijing, which holds a dominant position in the global market for these magnets essential for defense, electronics, and renewable energy technologies.
