          <p>Chinese tech companies Huawei and ByteDance are planning significant investments in Brazil's cloud infrastructure and AI sectors, potentially heightening US concerns about China's expanding digital influence in Latin America. Huawei is reportedly finalizing a deal with Dataprev, a Brazilian state-run tech firm, to utilize its data centers and is also in discussions with Edge UOL, a cloud services provider. Executives from Huawei and Edge UOL met in China to discuss infrastructure, cybersecurity, and AI expansion across Brazil, aiming to create a bridge between China and Latin America. The United States has been increasingly wary of Chinese investments in Latin American tech infrastructure, citing potential risks of data theft and surveillance. The expansion reflects a strategic move by Chinese firms to deepen their presence in the region's growing digital economy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his intention to intensify deportation efforts in major U.S. cities, particularly those governed by Democrats. During a meeting at the G7 summit, Trump stated that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should focus on cities like New York and Chicago, which he described as "sanctuary cities." This announcement followed a social media post where Trump directed ICE to pursue the largest mass deportation program in history. Trump accused Democrats of leveraging illegal immigration to influence elections and expand the welfare state, though noncitizens are barred from voting in federal or state elections. His renewed focus on deportations comes after protests against his administration's immigration policies and a temporary shift towards accommodating undocumented workers in the farming and hospitality sectors.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine have completed an exchange of dead bodies, marking the final stage of an agreement to repatriate fallen soldiers. The latest exchange occurred at an undisclosed location, with Red Cross members monitoring the process as bodies were transported in refrigerator lorries. Ukraine reported receiving 1,245 bodies in the latest exchange, bringing the total to 6,057, while Russia claimed to have handed over 1,248 Ukrainian soldiers' bodies and received 51 Russian soldiers' bodies, totaling 78. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of deliberately complicating the identification process, citing the mutilated state of the bodies and the mixing of remains. Despite the exchange, trust between the two sides remains low, highlighting the ongoing challenges in managing the human cost of the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey indicates that authorities have avoided addressing the ethnicity of perpetrators involved in grooming gangs. The report reveals that ethnicity data is not recorded for two-thirds of grooming gang offenders, making it difficult to draw national conclusions. However, local data from three police forces suggests a disproportionate number of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds are suspects in group-based child sexual exploitation. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has apologized to victims and announced a national inquiry into grooming gangs, promising to implement the report's recommendations, including mandatory ethnicity data collection and a review of convictions of exploitation victims.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston extended legal relief to Harvard University in its challenge against the Trump administration's attempt to halt the entry of international students. Judge Allison Burroughs extended a temporary restraining order until June 23, while considering a longer-term injunction. The Trump administration's proclamation, citing Harvard's engagement with China and other national security concerns, sought to prevent the university's foreign students from entering the country. Harvard argued that the proclamation circumvented a previous court decision and violated the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

          <p>Geoffrey Hinton, known as the "Godfather of AI," predicts that AI will eventually surpass human capabilities in all areas. He suggests that "mundane intellectual labor" is at the highest risk of being replaced, while physical manipulation jobs, such as plumbing, are safer. Hinton sees mass job displacement as the biggest immediate threat to human happiness, even with the implementation of a universal basic income. He notes that AI is already being used for jobs previously popular with recent college graduates, leading to potential mass firings in many industries, although some sectors, like healthcare, may be able to absorb the change.</p>
