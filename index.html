          <p>Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, announced plans to visit Ukraine to contribute to a lasting ceasefire and peace agreement with Russia, emphasizing the importance of continued U.S. involvement and European Union defense spending increases. Speaking in Paris alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, Merz expressed hope for a ceasefire beyond the coming weekend and subsequent peace negotiations. He stressed that Germany's security guarantees for Ukraine depend on the conditions of any eventual agreement, urging all EU members to boost defense spending to support Ukraine collectively. After France, Merz will visit Poland as part of his first foreign trip as chancellor.</p>

          <p>For the second time in eight days, a U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman was lost in the Red Sea; the pilots sustained minor injuries. The incident occurred during an attempted landing when the arrestment mechanism failed, causing the aircraft to go overboard, and both aviators safely ejected and were rescued by a helicopter. This follows a previous incident where a Super Hornet was lost overboard due to crews losing control while it was being towed in the hangar bay. President Trump also disclosed that the Iranian-backed Houthis had agreed to halt attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea, marking a potential de-escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>The United States may soon begin deporting migrants to Libya as part of a crackdown on immigration, according to U.S. officials speaking to CBS News. The officials, who requested anonymity, indicated that the U.S. military could start flying migrants to Libya as early as this week. This move is likely to generate controversy due to the ongoing conflict and instability in Libya, as the U.S. State Department advises against travel to the country because of crime, terrorism, and civil unrest. The BBC has reached out to the U.S. State Department for comment on the matter.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter results revealed earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations, but revenue fell short of anticipated growth, leading to a drop in share value. Despite a 14% increase in revenue compared to the previous year, the company reported a net income of $1.78 billion, a significant turnaround from the net loss in the first quarter of 2024. Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, expressed optimism about autonomous vehicles, viewing them as the single greatest opportunity for Uber, noting the annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips. The company is also facing a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission regarding deceptive billing practices related to its Uber One subscription service.</p>

U.N.

          <p>Pandora, the Danish jewelry brand, has cautioned that U.S. tariffs could lead to widespread price increases in the affordable jewelry sector. CEO Alexander Lacik stated that while current 10% levies are manageable, higher "reciprocal" rates would significantly impact jewelry manufacturers who rely on imports from Asia. Pandora is heavily dependent on manufacturing in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China, which were previously subjected to tariffs ranging from 26% to 46%. The company has modeled various scenarios but anticipates that consumer pricing will likely see some changes due to these tariffs.</p>

The article suggests Collins could leverage her committee to call hearings, pass legislation, and block funds for Trump's favored programs, but her aversion to confrontation and fear of political retribution have kept her on the sidelines. The article also notes Collins's history of only opposing Trump when her vote is not essential and her declining poll numbers ahead of the 2026 election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsene Wenger has proposed a change to the offside rule in football to benefit the attacking player, similar to a change implemented after the 1990 World Cup. The suggested adjustment would mean a player is only considered offside if they are clearly ahead of the last defender, rather than being offside if any part of their body is beyond the defender. Wenger believes that VAR has removed the advantage previously given to the attacker in marginal situations, and this change would restore that balance, potentially increasing goal-scoring opportunities.</p>

          <p>Corporate executives are becoming resigned to President Trump's tariffs, adopting the mindset that a 10 percent tariff is the "new zero" due to the threat of even larger increases. By threatening tariffs ranging from 10 to 60 percent and even higher on China, Trump has seemingly increased the acceptance of significant tariffs that remain in place, using a psychological effect known as anchoring. Despite the moderated impulses, the tariffs still constitute a major change for global trade and a tax increase for the country, with consumers facing an average effective tariff rate of 28 percent, the highest since 1901.</p>
