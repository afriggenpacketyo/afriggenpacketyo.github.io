          <p>The Trump administration's 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) commission has unveiled a comprehensive strategy aimed at improving children's health, with a notable proposal to lift the decade-long restriction on whole milk in schools. This initiative is part of a larger plan that includes over 120 measures targeting issues like toxic food dyes, nutrient requirements, and misleading health advertisements. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. framed the strategy as a major reform to combat childhood chronic diseases by realigning food and health systems. The plan also involves updating national dietary guidelines and increasing enforcement of prescription drug advertising laws, particularly on social media.</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a major downward revision, indicating the U.S. labor market added 911,000 fewer jobs in the year ending March 2025 than initially reported. This annual benchmark revision, which was larger than economists had anticipated, suggests the economy possessed less momentum and the labor market was cooling more significantly than previously understood. This new data strengthens the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will implement an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting to address the weakening job market. Economists note that such revisions are a normal part of the statistical process but the magnitude is significant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Akron, Ohio's Metro bus system has been named the national mass transit system of the year after a successful overhaul that boosted ridership by 24%, far exceeding the national average. The transformation, achieved without a budget increase, was driven by directly addressing passenger needs, such as increasing bus frequency to every 15 minutes on key routes and extending service to seven days a week. Under the leadership of CEO Dawn Distler, a former bus driver, the agency reinvented its routes and hiring practices, prioritizing customer service. This rider-centric approach has been credited with making public transportation more accessible and reliable for the community.</p>

          <p>Recently released data from the National Center for Education Statistics, known as The Nation's Report Card, shows a troubling decline in academic proficiency among U.S. students. Average scores for eighth graders in science and for 12th graders in both mathematics and reading dropped between 2019 and 2024. The assessment, which is the first post-pandemic evaluation for these subjects, also revealed the widest performance gaps ever recorded between the highest- and lowest-performing students. Officials described the results as "sobering," noting that the downward trend in achievement for lower-performing students began even before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted education nationwide.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a federal charge against Decarlos Brown Jr. for the fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, on a light rail train in Charlotte, North Carolina. The charge of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system carries a maximum penalty of life in prison or death.

          <p>A district court judge in Michigan has dismissed all criminal charges against 15 Republicans who signed documents claiming to be the state's official electors for Donald Trump in the 2020 election. The judge ruled that the group, who prosecutors accused of forgery and conspiracy, were not sophisticated enough to fully understand the electoral process and had acted based on a sincere belief of election irregularities. The ruling stated their actions were a legal exercise of their constitutional rights. Michigan's Attorney General, Dana Nessel, called the decision disappointing and indicated her office may appeal, maintaining it was a coordinated attempt to overturn the election.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled Missouri House has passed a newly proposed congressional map designed to strengthen the GOP's hold on the state's delegation, aiming for a 7-1 Republican advantage. This move is part of a broader mid-decade redistricting push encouraged by President Trump to expand the party's narrow majority in the U.S. House. The proposed map dismantles the district of Democratic Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, making it significantly more conservative. The measure, which now moves to the state Senate, follows similar Republican efforts in Texas and has prompted a defensive redistricting response from Democrats in California, setting the stage for likely legal challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed eliminating the £100 cap on contactless card payments, potentially allowing for unlimited transactions via tapping a card. If approved, the change would empower individual banks and card providers to set their own limits, aligning card payments with the unrestricted limits already available on digital wallets like Apple Pay. The move reflects the evolving nature of consumer payments but has raised concerns about fraud and theft, though the FCA insists providers would be responsible for losses on high-value transactions. Protections, such as requiring a PIN after a certain number of consecutive taps, would likely remain in place.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's newly unveiled, ultra-thin iPhone Air may face a delayed or limited launch in mainland China due to its exclusive use of eSIM technology, which replaces physical SIM cards. Currently, only one of China's three major cellular carriers supports the eSIM standard, creating a significant barrier to widespread adoption. The technology allows for thinner device designs and easier switching between carriers, but Chinese regulators appear to be moving slowly on its approval. Analysts suggest this delay could stem from concerns that easy carrier switching might negatively impact the business models of state-owned telecom companies, potentially giving domestic competitors a temporary advantage.</p>

The case, which consolidates two challenges from small businesses and states, will be heard in November. At stake are the legality of "reciprocal tariffs" and duties on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico, which lower courts found were an overreach of presidential authority.

İmamoğlu, seen as Erdoğan's strongest potential rival for the presidency, faces a series of corruption charges that he and his supporters dismiss as politically motivated. His arrest has sparked major anti-government protests and is viewed by many as part of a broader crackdown on opposition figures, academics, and journalists. While Erdoğan maintains he is tackling corruption, human rights groups argue Turkey is moving towards autocracy, with a justice system that is no longer independent.</p>

The opinion, commissioned by local residents, contends that redacted sections of the planning application obscure the intended use of certain rooms, preventing a lawful assessment of their impact on the historic site. Furthermore, it asserts that China's assurances regarding public and emergency service access to parts of the site are unenforceable due to diplomatic immunity.

          <p>Voters in Northern Virginia's 11th congressional district are participating in a special election to fill the seat of the late Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly. The race pits Democrat James Walkinshaw against Republican Stewart Whitson in a district that has reliably voted for Democrats. A victory for Walkinshaw would narrow the already slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-213, potentially complicating legislative efforts ahead of a looming government funding deadline. A key issue in the election has been President Trump's cuts to the federal workforce, as the district has one of the highest concentrations of federal employees in the country.</p>

A district court had previously enjoined ICE from this practice, but the Supreme Court's action, without a full explanation, lets the practice continue while the case is appealed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England delivered a commanding 5-0 victory over Serbia in a World Cup qualifier, providing a decisive response to recent criticism of the team's style of play. Manager Thomas Tuchel praised the performance as a masterclass that silenced the hostile Belgrade crowd from the outset. The win, achieved without key players like Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka, showcased the squad's depth, with Noni Madueke and others excelling. The result puts England firmly in control of their qualification group and gives Tuchel positive selection dilemmas for future matches, as the team demonstrated impressive attacking flair and cohesion.</p>

          <p>Wales head coach Craig Bellamy described the past week as challenging but valuable after his young, experimental team was defeated 1-0 by Canada in a friendly match. Bellamy intentionally chose a strong opponent to expose his fringe players to a higher level of competition, providing crucial experience for the developing squad. Despite the loss, he was impressed with how the new and inexperienced players, including three debutants, adapted to the team's style of play. He emphasized that facing top-tier teams is essential for player development, as it forces quicker decision-making and better physical conditioning, which will benefit Wales in the long run.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock price jumped 27% in after-hours trading, driven by the company's extremely optimistic projections for its cloud infrastructure business, which overshadowed a slight miss on quarterly earnings and revenue. The company reported a massive increase in its remaining performance obligations, a measure of future contracted revenue, largely due to new AI-related contracts, including one with OpenAI. CEO Safra Catz announced that Oracle signed four multi-billion-dollar cloud deals during the quarter. The company now projects its cloud infrastructure revenue will grow to $144 billion annually within five years, signaling a major competitive push against rivals like Microsoft and Amazon.

          <p>President Trump's repeated and strenuous denials of any close relationship with Jeffrey Epstein are backfiring, creating more suspicion than if he had adopted his usual brazen approach to scandal. The White House press secretary has insisted that documents, including a signed birthday card, are not authentic, a defense that many find unconvincing. Unlike past controversies where Trump has openly admitted to or deflected misconduct, his current strategy of suing media outlets and refusing to comment on a "dead issue" is seen as uncharacteristic. This departure from his typical playbook is fueling speculation among both critics and supporters that the unreleased Epstein files may contain something uniquely damaging.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Doha, Qatar, targeting a senior Hamas negotiator, carries significant geopolitical implications that challenge Qatar's established role as a safe haven for international diplomacy. The attack undermines the perceived neutrality of Doha, which has served as a crucial intermediary for opposing global factions, including the U.S., Iran, and various militant groups. While Israel claims the strike was justified, it suggests that the U.S. and Israel may now view mediation as a ruse in this conflict. The incident highlights the limits of Qatar's influence and could shift regional power dynamics, as neighbors like Saudi Arabia have long been critical of its ties to Islamist groups.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a temporary halt on a lower court's order that would have forced the Trump administration to spend nearly $5 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress. Chief Justice John Roberts granted the administration's request while the legal battle continues. President Trump had previously informed Congress he would not spend the funds, which were allocated for UN organizations, peacekeeping, and development projects, calling the spending "woke, weaponized and wasteful." This move, known as a "pocket rescission," was challenged by aid groups, who now have until Friday to respond to the Supreme Court's order.</p>

          <p>Australian regulators have approved the first-ever vaccine designed to protect endangered koalas from chlamydia, a disease that has devastated their populations across the country's eastern states. Developed over a decade by scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast, the single-dose vaccine has been shown in trials to reduce symptoms and decrease mortality by at least 65%. Chlamydia is a leading cause of death for koalas, causing infertility, blindness, and painful infections. With regulatory approval secured, researchers are now seeking major funding to roll out the vaccine to wildlife hospitals and wild koala populations to curb the epidemic.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has informed cabinet ministers that government departments will face stricter limits on accessing the Treasury's £9 billion emergency reserve fund. The move is intended to enforce fiscal discipline and ensure spending stays within established totals ahead of the November budget presentation. Reeves stated that the reserve, meant for unforeseen and unavoidable pressures, will only be available to departments that have maximized their own savings first. This tightening of spending comes as the Labour government faces pressure to stimulate economic growth while adhering to its borrowing rules, which include eliminating borrowing for day-to-day costs by 2029-30.</p>

The model is designed to mimic the human brain by only activating necessary neurons, making it highly efficient and capable of learning from a small fraction of the training data typically required. Significantly, the system operates entirely on China's domestic MetaX chip platform, not on dominant Nvidia hardware. This makes the development strategically important for China's goal of achieving AI self-sufficiency amid U.S. export controls on advanced chips.</p>

The attack took place at a residential complex in the city, where Hamas has maintained a political office since 2012. The White House confirmed it was informed of the operation, while President Trump stated the decision was Israel's alone and that he feels badly about the location of the attack.</p>
