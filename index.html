          <p>The US and UK have reached an agreement to reduce tariffs imposed by President Trump on British cars and metals, providing relief to key UK industries. The US will reduce the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars annually and slash tariffs on steel and aluminum. In return, the UK will provide "reciprocal access" for beef exports, with a quota of 13,000 metric tonnes for UK farmers. While leaders from both countries hailed the deal as significant, some analysts believe it does not meaningfully alter pre-existing trade terms and Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the deal, saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK, while being hiked in the US.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, which he claims will provide billions of dollars in increased market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture. The UK will reduce or eliminate numerous non-tariff barriers as part of the agreement. Britain states the deal will cut tariffs on UK cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, with a quota of 100,000 UK vehicles that can be imported to the US at a 10% tariff. The agreement boosted investor confidence, with markets making gains in early trading.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison is facing a lawsuit claiming that its negligence in maintaining infrastructure caused the Eaton fire, leading to residents' exposure to dangerous levels of lead, asbestos, and other toxic substances. The lawsuit cites an investigation by The Times that found toxic heavy metals in soil samples at home sites, even after federal crews removed ash and topsoil. The suit seeks compensation for residents harmed by the toxic substances, as well as money for medical monitoring of their health in the future. The company says the cause of the Eaton fire has not yet been determined.</p>

          <p>A judge declared a mistrial in the murder case against Christopher Schurr, a Michigan police officer who fatally shot Patrick Lyoya, a black man, during a traffic stop in April 2022. The jury was unable to reach a verdict, resulting in the mistrial, which is a partial victory for Schurr, who could still face another trial. The incident, captured on police bodycam and other sources, shows Lyoya fleeing from Schurr, followed by a scuffle over the officer's Taser before Schurr shoots Lyoya. Schurr's defense centered on the scuffle over the Taser, with Schurr testifying he feared for his safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic discusses how President Trump's focus on individual federal judges, rather than on law and precedent, is a step away from a government of laws and toward one of men and women. By attacking judges who rule against his policies, Trump delegitimizes the court system and risks physical harm against judges. While acknowledging that judges are not purely objective, the article argues that the focus on judges' personalities serves Trump's purpose of demonizing them and avoiding discussion of the law.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing to cut a $56 million grant that teaches first responders how to use naloxone, a lifesaving overdose reversal drug, despite a recent dip in overdose deaths credited to wider naloxone access.

The grant money is used by state and local organizations for training, administering, and distributing naloxone, as well as referring patients to treatment and support services.

His sentencing mirrors the fate of other crypto executives like FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance's Changpeng Zhao.

          <p>The National Institutes of Health will use information from Medicare and Medicaid to create a "real-world data platform" to determine the cause of autism, according to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The database will utilize insurance claims, electronic medical records, and data from wearable devices with health sensors. This announcement has raised concerns among the autistic community and privacy experts, who question how the data will be used and protected. The increased focus on autism comes as Kennedy has made baseless claims about the disorder, including the debunked notion that vaccines are a cause.</p>

However, it is just a framework for a deal and there could be weeks, if not more, of additional negotiations before it becomes final. The agreement will come as a relief for Britain’s auto industry, which will now face 10 percent tariffs on the first 100,000 cars exported annually to the United States. Despite the agreement, British goods exports in general still face higher tariffs then they did two months ago, with the base line 10 percent tariff still in place.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has taken a more assertive approach to pro-Palestinian protests, intervening aggressively to end an occupation of Butler Library and arresting demonstrators. This contrasts with the university's response a year earlier, when a similar occupation was met with little resistance. The shift in approach has drawn praise from some, including the Trump administration's antisemitism task force, but has also disturbed those who feel that unarmed demonstrators should not be met with aggression. Columbia is moving the judicial board that oversees protest discipline from the supervision of the university senate to the provost’s office, in part to meet a demand from the Trump administration to tighten control of discipline.</p>
