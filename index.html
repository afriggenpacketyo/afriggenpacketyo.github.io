          <p>Technology firm Oracle is reportedly part of a consortium involved in a framework deal to allow TikTok to continue its U.S. operations. The agreement, being negotiated between the Trump administration and China, aims to resolve national security concerns that led to a threatened ban of the popular video app. While the final structure remains unclear, the deal would address U.S. worries over data privacy and Chinese influence over the platform's algorithm, with both President Trump and President Xi expected to discuss the final terms.</p>

The discussion also covered broader industry challenges, including the need for more land entitlements and addressing persistent labor shortages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk may paradoxically lead to a more accommodative U.S. stance toward China. This opinion article suggests the event could intensify the Trump administration's focus on domestic culture wars and border security, thereby reducing its appetite for ambitious foreign policy confrontations. As the administration grapples with internal divisions and limited hard power, it may become more inclined to seek stability in its relationship with Beijing, potentially de-escalating ongoing trade and geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over two decades, the United States has formally decertified Colombia as a partner in drug control efforts, citing a demonstrable failure to meet its obligations. The Trump administration criticized Colombian President Gustavo Petro's leadership as cocaine production in the country reached unprecedented levels. Despite the official rebuke, the White House issued a "national interest waiver," preventing the imposition of sanctions and preserving U.S. aid, signaling continued strategic cooperation even as diplomatic tensions rise between the historic allies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified what may be the world's oldest known mummies, dating back as far as 12,000 years, in various sites across Southeast Asia. The study suggests that ancient hunter-gatherer communities practiced smoke-drying bodies over fires, a form of mummification that predates previously known examples, like those of the Chinchorro people in South America, by thousands of years. This practice likely allowed people to maintain physical and spiritual connections with their deceased ancestors, reflecting a deeply human desire to keep loved ones close.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has initiated a $15 billion lawsuit against The New York Times, alleging a long-standing pattern of "defamation and libel." The lawsuit, filed in Florida, specifically targets a book and several articles published during the 2024 presidential campaign, claiming they were written with "actual malice." The New York Times responded by stating the lawsuit has "no merit" and is an attempt to intimidate journalists and stifle independent reporting, vowing to defend its First Amendment rights.</p>

The voluntary quits rate has fallen to its lowest sustained level since 2016, driven by economic uncertainty and a slower pace of hiring.

          <p>Maria Caulfield, a former Conservative health minister who lost her parliamentary seat last year, has become the latest Tory figure to defect to Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. Caulfield stated she joined Reform because the Conservative Party no longer aligns with her beliefs, following the recent defection of sitting MP Danny Kruger. Her move marks the 15th time a former Tory MP has joined the right-wing party, signaling ongoing turmoil and a potential realignment on the right of British politics following the last general election.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk has released positive late-stage trial data for its new obesity treatment, Cagrilinitide, which helped patients achieve an average weight loss of 11.8% over 68 weeks. This new drug is an amylin analogue, working differently from existing GLP-1 treatments like the company's blockbuster drug Wegovy. As it seeks the next generation of weight-loss medications, Novo Nordisk highlighted the drug's favorable tolerability profile, with most side effects being mild, a key factor in a competitive and rapidly growing market.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's killing, progressive organizations fear a new "McCarthy era" as President Trump and his allies call for government investigations into a supposed "vast domestic terrorist network" on the left. The White House has vowed to use the full power of the Department of Justice and Homeland Security to "dismantle and destroy" these networks. Targeted groups, some of which were named in a letter from the House Freedom Caucus, say the goal of these threats is to silence dissent and inflict fear, drawing parallels to the anti-communist "red scare" of the 1950s.</p>

          <p>Reflecting on an off-the-record 2022 interview, a reporter shares insights into the worldview of the late Charlie Kirk, who saw his primary mission as educational and transformational, not purely political. Kirk emphasized his focus on instilling Judeo-Christian values in young people to effect multi-decade cultural change, viewing electoral politics as merely an outgrowth of a deeper philosophical battle. He considered his greatest accomplishment to be the establishment of Turning Point USA chapters on high school and college campuses, aiming to create an "educational monolith" to counter what he viewed as leftist ideology.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history of free speech, arguing that it is not a timeless, absolute ideal but a dangerous and context-dependent concept that has always been contested. Historian Fara Dabhoiwala explains that speech is a form of action with real-world consequences, and its meaning is shaped by power dynamics and who is speaking. The modern American absolutist view, rooted in 18th-century political tracts, is an exception globally and struggles to address the challenges of the digital age, where platform algorithms have immense power to amplify or suppress voices.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump cannot remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook from her position, delivering a blow to the administration's efforts to influence the central bank. The 2-1 decision allows Cook, a Biden appointee, to participate in the upcoming policy meeting where an interest rate cut is expected. Trump had attempted to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, but the case is seen as a major test of the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference.
