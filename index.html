          <p>A large-scale raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies at a Hyundai construction site in Georgia resulted in the detention of 475 individuals suspected of working illegally. The operation, described as the largest of its kind at a single site, targeted alleged unlawful employment practices and involved mostly South Korean nationals. While no criminal charges were immediately announced, the investigation is ongoing, and the action has drawn criticism from labor groups who call it a politically motivated campaign of harassment. The raid highlights the administration's intensified crackdown on illegal immigration, impacting a major economic development project in the state.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has adjusted his prominent campaign promise to halt small boat migrant crossings within two weeks of gaining power. He clarified on a BBC program that the two-week timeline would begin only after his proposed "Illegal Migration (Mass Deportation) Bill" is passed into law, a process that could take months. This new legislation would grant a Farage-led government the authority to detain and deport migrants who arrive illegally. The shift in language adds a significant condition to what was presented as an immediate and decisive policy action.</p>

          <p>Scotland's momentum in the Women's Rugby World Cup was halted by a strong Canadian team, resulting in a defeat that places Canada at the top of Pool B. Despite an early try from Scotland's Rhona Lloyd and a second-half score by Evie Gallagher, Canada's power and clinical execution proved decisive. The Canadian team secured their victory with multiple tries, including two from hooker Emily Tuttosi. This result means Scotland is now on a course to face the formidable host nation, England, in the quarter-finals of the tournament.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have issued urgent warnings for Palestinian residents to evacuate several areas of Gaza City, signaling an imminent expansion of military operations. The IDF released a map indicating specific zones to be targeted due to the alleged presence of Hamas infrastructure, advising civilians to move south to a designated humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi. This escalation, part of 'Operation Gideon’s Chariots II,' comes as Israel moves to relocate thousands to southern Gaza, where humanitarian supplies are being staged. The planned offensive has drawn criticism from international leaders, including those from the U.K. and Canada, who fear it will lead to more bloodshed.</p>

          <p>An opinion article questions Melania Trump's suitability as a leader on the responsible growth of artificial intelligence, following her recent White House event on the topic. The author argues that while the First Lady champions online safety, the "Take It Down Act" she supported contains broad provisions that civil rights activists warn could be weaponized to suppress free speech. The piece suggests her focus on AI in education is a distraction from the Trump administration's broader efforts to defund public education programs like Head Start. The author concludes that the administration's interest in AI is likely driven more by its potential to enrich tech allies than to genuinely improve education.</p>

          <p>A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) provided a rare live-streamed tour of the bottom of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the United States, reaching depths of over 1,500 feet. The event, sponsored by environmental non-profits, aimed to raise awareness about the lake's unique ecosystem and the importance of conservation efforts. Experts discussed the lake's ancient origins, explaining how its floor functions like a lung, processing materials from the watershed. While the dive dispelled urban legends of preserved bodies, it highlighted the ongoing challenge of pollution, as past expeditions have discovered trash even in the deepest parts of the lake.</p>

She addressed the controversial 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, arguing it respected the democratic process by returning the issue of abortion to the American people.

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, an activist investor with a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo, has presented a detailed plan to the company's board aimed at improving performance and accelerating growth. The proposal suggests refranchising the bottling network for PepsiCo's North American beverage business and divesting from underperforming brands to refocus on core products like Pepsi and Mountain Dew. Elliott argues these strategic shifts, along with cost optimization in the Frito-Lay division, could unlock significant shareholder value and reverse years of stock underperformance. The plan emphasizes long-term reinvestment over short-term buybacks to revitalize the company's iconic brands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire and financial coach Bernadette Joy advocates for renting over homeownership, a decision she made after selling four properties she previously owned. She argues that renting provides greater financial flexibility and has allowed her to grow her net worth more rapidly by investing the proceeds from her home sales into index funds. Joy highlights the often-underestimated hidden costs of homeownership, such as maintenance, renovations, and property taxes, as well as the emotional and logistical burdens of being a landlord. For her, the ability to adapt her living situation to her current needs without being tied to a property has been key to her financial success.</p>

While famous for her street photography, Model embarked on a project to capture jazz musicians and their audiences, a venture that was ultimately derailed due to FBI suspicion of her leftist politics. Her images are noted for capturing a sense of wariness and inner turmoil in her subjects, including icons like Duke Ellington and Miles Davis.

The article notes that while humans are wired to worry about others' opinions, these fears are often overblown, and letting go can lead to a more honest life. This form of indifference is not about apathy but about consciously choosing whose approval matters, which can be a quiet act of defiance against a world of external pressures.</p>

          <p>New research utilizing machine learning suggests that the climate crisis will lead to a significant increase in lightning-sparked wildfires across the western United States for decades to come. The study found that conditions favoring both lightning and the spread of fire, such as higher temperatures and drier soil, are becoming more common. Because lightning-caused fires often occur in remote areas, they tend to grow larger and produce more smoke, posing greater risks to public health and safety. The findings indicate that nearly 98% of the western U.S. will face a heightened risk of these fires, exacerbating the strain on already limited firefighting resources.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old man was arrested in a residential area near Portland, Oregon, after he was discovered living in the crawl space of a home without the owner's knowledge. The homeowner had reported hearing strange noises, and a witness saw the man entering the space. When Clackamas County Sheriff's deputies investigated, they found the suspect, Beniamin Bucur, had set up a furnished living area complete with a bed, television, and lights powered by the house's electricity. Bucur was charged with burglary and unlawful possession of methamphetamine after a meth pipe was also found at the scene.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old surfer was killed in a shark attack on Saturday while in the water off Long Reef beach in northern Sydney, Australia. Authorities reported that the man, an experienced local surfer, suffered the loss of multiple limbs and disappeared underwater before his body was recovered by fellow surfers. Despite resuscitation efforts, he was pronounced dead at the scene, having sustained significant blood loss. Local beaches were closed for at least 24 hours as officials used drones and watercraft to patrol for the shark, believed to be a large species.</p>

          <p>Recent political discourse in Germany has highlighted a growing crisis in student mental health, with a student representative calling for a €100 billion investment in schools to address widespread bullying and anxiety. Meanwhile, Bavarian leader Markus Söder has questioned the stationing of German troops in Ukraine as part of NATO security guarantees, citing the German army's readiness and the potential for escalation with Russia. Additionally, a senior CDU politician has called for the coalition government to shift further to the center-right and implement significant cuts to social welfare programs, a proposal that has created friction with their center-left SPD partners.</p>

          <p>China is designing a 'kinetic impact demonstration mission' to test its ability to defend the planet from potential asteroid threats, a top space researcher has revealed. The mission, which could launch as early as this year, will target a small asteroid millions of kilometers away with an impactor spacecraft, aiming to alter its orbit by a few centimeters. If successful, China would become only the second nation, after the United States, to demonstrate this planetary defense capability. The plan was announced by Wu Weiren, chief designer of China's lunar exploration program, at an international conference on deep space exploration.</p>

          <p>In a remote area of Sudan's Darfur region, villagers are resorting to digging with their bare hands to recover victims buried by a massive landslide triggered by heavy rainfall. Aid group Save the Children described scenes of devastation, reporting that at least 373 bodies have been recovered, with fears that up to 1,000 people, including 200 children, may have perished. Rescue and aid efforts are severely hampered by the area's remoteness and the ongoing civil war in Sudan, which makes access for humanitarian organizations extremely difficult. The disaster compounds an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis facing the country.</p>

          <p>One year after Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, a 26-year-old American-Turkish woman, was killed by an Israeli sniper in the occupied West Bank, her family continues to demand an independent U.S. investigation. Eygi was shot while attending a protest against settlement expansion, but despite her U.S. citizenship, American officials have not launched their own inquiry into her death. An Israeli military investigation quickly concluded the shooting was unintentional, a finding disputed by a Washington Post report and the Turkish government. Eygi's family feels their pleas for accountability have been met with inaction, highlighting a perceived double standard in how the U.S. responds to the deaths of its citizens abroad.</p>

The event included speakers like Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt and Deputy Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon alongside individuals associated with white nationalism and secretive, men-only Christian ultranationalist networks. According to extremism experts, the conference demonstrates the increasingly indistinguishable nature of the mainstream Republican party under Trump and the more extreme fringes of the nationalist hard right, who share anti-democratic and reactionary views.</p>

          <p>As the price of gold continues to hit new records, climbing about 35% this year to nearly $3,600 an ounce, financial experts are advising on the best ways for investors to gain exposure. Gold is seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty and low interest rates, with central bank purchases also driving demand. Most experts recommend investing through liquid, low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), rather than buying physical bullion. Financial advisors generally suggest limiting gold allocation to a small portion, typically less than 3%, of a well-diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

An expert on the musical notes that its legacy is deeply intertwined with the Obama era, initially representing a hopeful vision of an inclusive America. However, in the current political climate, the show's second act, which depicts political polarization and collapse, feels more resonant. While the musical once united figures across the political spectrum, it later became a symbol of counter-Trump sentiment, and critiques of its progressive portrayal of the Founding Fathers have become more widespread.</p>
