        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim O'Neill has been named acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention following the ouster of Susan Monarez. The appointment comes after Monarez was terminated by the White House just weeks into her tenure, with her lawyers claiming she was targeted for resisting unscientific directives. Several other top CDC leaders have also resigned recently, citing concerns over the administration's views on vaccines and budget cuts. O'Neill, a former tech investor, aims to rebuild the institution and restore trust amid the agency's internal strife and external pressures regarding vaccine policies and scientific integrity. The circumstances surrounding the recent leadership changes suggest a shift in the CDC's direction under Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership at HHS, prompting concerns about the agency's future. Optimism about the CDC's ability to navigate these challenges remains cautious.</p>

          <p>China is reinforcing its commitment to artificial intelligence, emphasizing rational development over rapid, unchecked expansion. The National Development and Reform Commission stressed the importance of tailoring AI initiatives to local conditions and leveraging regional strengths. The commission plans to continue providing AI vouchers to subsidize companies' access to computing power and consumer subsidies for AI-powered products. This approach aligns with the State Council's blueprint for the 'AI Plus' strategy, which aims for widespread AI adoption across industries by 2027 and 2030. China's focus on AI reflects its broader strategy to bolster technological self-reliance and innovation.</p>

          <p>An unlikely alliance has formed between Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi in support of a bill to ban members of Congress and their households from trading stocks. The legislation aims to address public corruption and restore Americans' trust in Congress, with broad bipartisan support. Concerns about the integrity of the financial system have been raised, as members of Congress may have access to information unavailable to ordinary investors. The volume of trading activity by members of Congress is significant, with some achieving returns that surpass those of professional investors, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. This proposed ban seeks to ensure that policy decisions serve the public good rather than personal profit.</p>

Trade chief Maroš Šefčovič announced the doctrine, emphasizing the need for quicker and more efficient deployment of resources. However, there is a growing concern that the EU may lack the necessary structures to effectively compete with the more direct economic weapons employed by the US and China. Efforts to develop a comprehensive strategy, including screening hi-tech investments and harmonizing export controls, have faced significant resistance from member states, highlighting the challenges in achieving a unified approach to economic security.</p>

Trump's action was prompted by allegations that Cook made misrepresentations on a mortgage application. Cook argues that the president lacks the authority to fire her, as her term extends until 2038, and that the allegations do not constitute sufficient cause for removal. The legal challenge highlights ongoing tensions between Trump and the Fed, where policymakers have largely resisted his calls for interest rate cuts. The outcome of the case could have significant implications for the Fed's independence from political influence.</p>

          <p>Several NFL records are within reach this season, including Jacksonville kicker Cam Little potentially breaking the record for the longest successful field goal. Patrick Mahomes is also on track to surpass Aaron Rodgers as the fastest quarterback to reach 250 career passing touchdowns. Joe Burrow has a chance to break the record for the most 500-yard passing games, while Ja'Marr Chase could challenge Michael Thomas's record for most receptions in a single season. The NFL's revised kickoff rule may lead to an increase in return touchdowns, with Green Bay's Keisean Nixon as a potential contender to break the single-season record.</p>

          <p>In the wake of increasing school shootings, experts advise parents and teachers to communicate openly and honestly with children about these tragedies. It's crucial to first understand what children have already heard and address their specific concerns, offering truthful answers while acknowledging the inherent risks. Age-appropriate information should be shared, and routines should be maintained to provide a sense of security. Limiting media exposure and encouraging healthy coping mechanisms, such as reading relevant books or engaging in initiatives to address gun violence, can help children process their emotions and anxieties, ultimately fostering resilience.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has ordered the removal of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office, citing ethical violations related to a leaked phone call with Cambodia's Hun Sen. The court stated that while Paetongtarn did not act dishonestly, she failed to uphold the required ethical standards. The case centered on a call in which Paetongtarn reportedly addressed Hun Sen as 'uncle' and referred to a Thai military commander as her 'opponent' while discussing border tensions. This decision could trigger political instability in Thailand, which recently reached a ceasefire with Cambodia following deadly clashes, and appointing a new prime minister may be a complex and lengthy process.</p>

          <p>Denmark has significantly reduced its annual growth forecast for 2025 from 3% to 1.4%, primarily due to weaker expectations for pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk. The economy ministry cited a decline in U.S. exports after a surge in late 2024, attributing it to inventory build-up and increased competition in the weight loss drug market. Generic medicines are also impacting sales in the U.S., and U.S. tariffs have contributed to the downward revision. Despite these challenges, the Danish economy remains strong overall, with high employment and low inflation, and the growth forecast for 2026 has been revised upward.</p>

          <p>Colin Smyth, a Member of the Scottish Parliament, has had his Holyrood pass deactivated amid a police investigation. Smyth was previously suspended by the Labour Party after being charged with possessing indecent images of children. The parliament's chief executive informed members that Smyth's pass has been deactivated given the ongoing criminal investigation. The situation has prompted the parliament to remind staff of available confidential support services, and swift action has been taken to address the serious allegations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government did not conduct its own analysis of the cost implications of merging councils in England, instead relying on a 2020 report commissioned by the County Council Network (CCN). The government based its savings estimates on the CCN's report, which initially projected £2.9 billion in savings over five years. However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, indicating that the reorganization could potentially cost money in some scenarios. The situation raises questions about the government's due diligence in assessing the financial impact of the council mergers.</p>

          <p>The United States has ended the 'de minimis' exemption that allowed low-value parcels shipped to the country to avoid tariffs. The move aims to close a loophole used to evade tariffs and restrict the flow of narcotics into the US, which has the potential to save thousands of American lives. A transition period will allow postal service shippers to pay a flat duty per package. The change applies to all nations, impacting retailers who previously benefited from shipping inexpensive goods tax-free.</p>

          <p>UK businesses are expressing concerns over new US taxes on low-value parcels, which are causing uncertainty and potential price increases. The US decision to end the "de minimis" exemption means that parcels valued under $800 will be subject to tax, which is expected to push up costs and create barriers for small firms. Many businesses have halted shipments to the US due to the uncertainty surrounding the costs and procedures. The Federation of Small Businesses is calling for the UK government to provide more support to help firms cope with the changes, but there is no indication of how or when this may happen.</p>
