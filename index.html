          <p>Protests erupted in Los Angeles over the weekend in response to federal immigration enforcement operations, leading to clashes between demonstrators and authorities. The Trump administration deployed the California National Guard to address what it described as "lawlessness," prompting criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who called the move "purposefully inflammatory." Demonstrators halted traffic and engaged in confrontations with law enforcement, resulting in arrests and injuries. The events sparked debate over federal authority and state sovereignty, with Newsom requesting the withdrawal of the National Guard.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating persistent deflationary pressures. Weak domestic demand and price wars in the automotive sector are contributing factors, despite Beijing's attempts to stimulate the economy.

Trade tensions with the U.S. add to the uncertainty and inventory strains for manufacturers, although a preliminary trade deal led to some tariff reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

This proclamation is broader than the 2017 ban and includes Haiti, while also raising concerns about Afghans who supported U.S. troops. The restrictions will be reviewed every 180 days.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering a radical overhaul of the electricity market, potentially moving from a national market to smaller regional markets, to address rising energy bills. Currently, energy firms are paid significant sums to not provide power due to grid limitations. The proposed changes aim to make the system more efficient and deliver cheaper bills, but face opposition from energy companies concerned about undermining contracts and green energy investments. The debate centers on whether regional pricing can lower costs and attract energy-intensive businesses to areas with abundant renewable resources.</p>
