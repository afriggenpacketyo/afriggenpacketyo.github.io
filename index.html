          <p>President Trump's promise to be a peacemaker in the Middle East is now under scrutiny as the U.S. has launched a direct military strike on Iran, targeting three nuclear sites.

Despite past statements emphasizing the need to prevent Iran from achieving nuclear capability, Trump's recent decision signifies a shift from diplomatic efforts to military intervention. The strikes follow Trump's earlier suggestion that the U.S. would wait two weeks to see if the conflict between Israel and Iran could be resolved diplomatically.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion of a two-week window for diplomacy with Iran was a deceptive ploy to keep the Iranians off guard before the U.S. bombed Iran's nuclear sites.

The attack, which Trump claims obliterated Iran's nuclear facilities, increases the potential for counterattacks and economic disruption. The administration must now brace for Iranian retaliation, which could target U.S. bases, personnel, or shipping in the region.</p>
