          <p>The article recounts the life of former MMA heavyweight champion Mark Kerr, whose journey from the top of the sport to battles with opioid addiction and alcoholism is the subject of the new film "The Smashing Machine." It details Kerr's initial encounter with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson in 1997 and how, decades later, Johnson championed the project to bring his story to the screen. The piece highlights Kerr's difficult path, his eventual sobriety, and his collaboration on the biographical film directed by Benny Safdie, which has been met with critical acclaim. This represents a remarkable second act for Kerr, bringing his story of struggle and redemption to a global audience.</p>

          <p>This article explores the paradoxical situation in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a post-industrial area heavily reliant on federal aid. Many low-income residents, including some who depend on programs like Snap and Medicaid, continue to support Donald Trump despite his administration's significant cuts to these very safety nets. The piece highlights personal stories of individuals struggling with healthcare access and food insecurity, contrasting their dire circumstances with their political allegiance and the belief that welfare needs reform. It paints a picture of a community grappling with economic decline and the real-world consequences of policy changes.</p>

          <p>Following Sean "Diddy" Combs' sentencing to 50 months in prison for federal prostitution charges, his longtime rival Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson publicly mocked him on social media. Jackson offered to take over Combs' scheduled speaking engagements, continuing a feud that has lasted for decades. The article notes that 50 Cent had previously expressed fear for his life due to their dispute and even posted a mock "letter" to the judge presiding over the case. Combs was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, though he was acquitted of more serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges.</p>

          <p>Storm Amy has hit the United Kingdom, bringing severe weather conditions including gusts up to 96mph and heavy rainfall. An amber wind warning is active for northern Scotland, with authorities cautioning about potential power outages and life-threatening flying debris. The storm has already been linked to one death in the Republic of Ireland and has caused significant travel disruptions, including suspended rail services and flight cancellations. Tens of thousands of customers lost power, and the storm set a new record for the lowest atmospheric pressure recorded in the UK for October, indicating its unusual intensity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a deadly attack on a synagogue in Manchester, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called on pro-Palestinian groups to reconsider planned protests, asking them to "recognise and respect the grief of British Jews." While affirming the right to peaceful protest, Starmer and other officials expressed concern that the demonstrations could stoke tensions and cause further pain to the grieving community. Protest organizers have condemned the attack but stated their intention to proceed, arguing that canceling peaceful demonstrations would be letting "terror win."

          <p>The aviation industry is grappling with the feasibility of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, with a heavy reliance on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). While the UK and EU have mandated that 2% of jet fuel be sustainable this year, rising to 10% in Britain by 2030, some industry leaders like Ryanair's Michael O'Leary are skeptical that production can meet these targets. The article discusses the significant challenges, including insufficient supply, high costs, and wavering political support, such as the US scaling back incentives. Despite these hurdles, proponents insist SAF is the only viable path and that progress is being made, albeit in a "lumpy transition."</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has successfully summited the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States, all peaks above 14,000 feet, within a 31-day period. His project, "States of Elevation," involved cycling over 3,000 miles between the mountains and then running up each one. The article describes Jornet's minimalist and artistic approach, choosing "the most aesthetic line" rather than the easiest path, exemplified by his traverse of demanding technical routes like Colorado's Elks Traverse. The feat is portrayed not just as a physical challenge but as an expression of Jornet's deep connection with nature and his desire to explore and appreciate remote wilderness areas.</p>

The piece also delves into the prize's historical omissions, noting that Einstein never won for his theory of relativity and that there is no prize for mathematics. Furthermore, it discusses cases where deserving female scientists like Lise Meitner and Jocelyn Bell Burnell were overlooked, and instances where prizes were awarded for now-debunked or harmful science, such as the lobotomy.</p>

A staunch conservative and protégé of former leader Shinzo Abe, Takaichi faces the challenges of uniting a fractured party and addressing a sluggish economy. Despite being a woman, she is not seen as a champion of progressive gender policies, having opposed measures like allowing married women to retain their maiden names and same-sex marriage. Her policy platform is hawkish on security, includes revising Japan's pacifist constitution, and aims to revive the "Abenomics" economic strategy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is drawing disproportionately high support from "Russia Germans"—ethnic Germans who resettled from the former Soviet Union. A recent study found that 31% of this demographic is prepared to vote for the AfD, a figure significantly higher than for other migrant-background groups. This trend was evident in recent municipal elections where the AfD performed strongly in areas with large Russia German populations. Analysts suggest the support stems from the group's stricter views on citizenship and culture, as well as the AfD's Russia-friendly political stance, which resonates with voters maintaining ties to their heritage.</p>

The gifting of these non-essential items is often seen as an informal barometer of consumer and corporate sentiment. The article cites a manager at a consulting firm who noted her company's budget for employee mooncake gifts was slashed by 40% this year due to a sluggish business environment and recent layoffs. This trend suggests that Chinese consumers and businesses are cutting back on discretionary spending amid ongoing economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The payment would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the child arrives back in their country of origin.

This development presents a strategic dilemma for China, a close partner to both nations. While Beijing has assisted Saudi Arabia's civilian nuclear program, analysts believe it would be reluctant to see this partnership extend to military applications, as this could provoke the United States and undermine non-proliferation efforts. The move is seen as being triggered by regional instability and a perception that the U.S. is becoming a less reliable ally in the Middle East.</p>

The article suggests Trump's decision is driven by pragmatism and a desire for a diplomatic victory rather than ideological alignment with Israel. Key factors include the unanimous international support for his plan, rising unfavorable views of Israel's Gaza policy among Americans, and Trump's own anger over a recent Israeli attack on Hamas negotiators in Qatar. By demanding Israel halt its bombing, Trump has seized control of the endgame, prioritizing the release of hostages to secure a deal.</p>

The study's authors emphasize that the most effective way to prevent future heat-related fatalities is through rapid and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Another wounded individual was also hit by an officer's bullet during the chaotic emergency response. The attacker, a 35-year-old Syrian-born British citizen, was shot dead by police after driving into pedestrians and attacking people with a knife. The police chief described the friendly fire incident as a "tragic and unforeseen consequence" of the necessary action taken to stop the attack. The police complaints watchdog has launched an investigation into the shooting.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Threatens Funding Cuts to Universities That Accept Trump's Higher Education Compact</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly urged the University of Southern California (USC) to reject a compact offered by President Trump, threatening to cut state funding if it agrees. The proposal, sent to nine universities, offers preferential federal funding in exchange for adopting right-wing policies on admissions, free speech, and diversity, including restricting foreign student enrollment and not recognizing transgender identities. Newsom called the offer a "false choice" that undermines academic freedom and has threatened to withhold billions in state aid, including Cal Grants, from any California university that signs on. He expressed confidence that the public UC system would not accept such terms.</p>

          <h2>China's Biopharmaceutical Sector Gains Global Attention with Advances in Drug Development</h2>

          <p>China's biopharmaceutical industry is experiencing a renaissance, marked by a growing ability to create innovative drugs that are attracting international notice. A key example is a cancer drug from Guangzhou-based Akeso, which clinical trials showed was more effective at delaying lung cancer progression than Merck's blockbuster drug, Keytruda. This success is cited as evidence of the sector's rapid development, with China now having the world's second-largest number of novel drugs in development. While this progress is significant, analysts remain cautious about whether the industry can consistently produce major breakthroughs in a highly complex and regulated field.

          <h2>Moroccan Youth Lead Protests Demanding Better Public Services Over World Cup Spending</h2>

          <p>Protests led by young people have erupted across Morocco, demanding the government prioritize essential services like healthcare and education over massive spending on infrastructure for the 2030 World Cup. Coordinated by a group called "Gen Z 212," demonstrators argue that the reported $5 billion budget for football stadiums is misguided when the country's public systems are failing. The movement was galvanized by the recent deaths of eight women in a maternity ward, highlighting deficiencies in the healthcare system. Despite a police response involving mass arrests and some violent clashes, the leaderless movement has vowed to continue until its demands for fundamental improvements are met.</p>
