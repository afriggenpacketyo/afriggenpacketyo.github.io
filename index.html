          <h2>Gaza's Severe Hunger Crisis Nears Famine Declaration Amidst Strict International Criteria</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 13:46:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gaza faces catastrophic food shortages, with a third of its population enduring multiple days without eating, leading UN officials to label the situation a "horror show." An official famine declaration requires meeting three strict criteria: at least 20% of households facing extreme food lack, 30% of children under five suffering acute malnutrition, and two non-trauma deaths per 10,000 adults daily. While parts of Gaza are already experiencing emergency or catastrophe levels, reliable data collection in conflict zones poses challenges to formal classification, despite widespread starvation. Aid agencies stress that a cessation of hostilities and full humanitarian access are crucial to alleviate the crisis and prevent a formal famine declaration.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in the Texas Hill Country on July 4th have resulted in over 130 fatalities, with search and recovery operations continuing along the Guadalupe River. More than a foot of rain fell in less than 12 hours, causing rapid water level rises that destroyed homes and vehicles, impacting summer camps and local towns. Numerous organizations, including the Kerr County Flood Relief Fund, Southern Oaks Church, TEXSAR, and the American Red Cross, are actively seeking donations and volunteers to support rescue, relief, and recovery efforts across affected communities. Corporations like Walmart, Sam's Club, DoorDash, and Papa Johns are also contributing significant funds and initiatives to assist the victims and first responders in their crucial work.</p>

          <h2>President Trump Expresses Doubt on Reaching Trade Deal with Canada by August 1 Deadline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 13:45:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that a trade deal with Canada may not be reached by the August 1 deadline, suggesting that tariffs might be imposed instead of a renegotiated agreement. He expressed skepticism about progress, stating the US has not had "a lot of luck with Canada" in negotiations, even though Canadian officials describe ongoing talks as "productive" and "cordial." Trump has already implemented tariffs on certain Canadian goods, arguing these measures protect American manufacturing and jobs, but critics warn of increased consumer prices. Canada, which sells three-quarters of its products to the US, faces significant economic impact if new tariffs are enacted, particularly affecting its deeply intertwined auto industry.</p>

          <p>Brandenburg's Interior Minister Rene Wilke is pushing for the return of a Yazidi family, including four underage children, who were deported to Iraq despite a court order lifting their obligation to leave Germany. The family was on a charter flight to Baghdad when the court ruled in their favor, but the written decision was not available until after their landing, making intervention impossible at the time. The deportation is highly controversial because Yazidis suffered genocide by ISIS in 2014, and many cannot safely return to their destroyed or lawless villages. Politicians and advocacy groups are calling for their return, emphasizing the family's integration into German society and the constant fear many Yazidi families now live under due to similar deportation notices.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Mariners have initiated Major League Baseball's trade deadline action by acquiring first baseman Josh Naylor from the Arizona Diamondbacks. In return, the Diamondbacks received minor league pitchers Brandyn Garcia and Ashton Izzi, as they look to potentially shed expiring contracts after a disappointing season. Naylor, 28, has been a productive player this season with a .292 batting average, 11 home runs, and 59 RBI in 93 games, and was an American League All-Star last season. The Mariners, currently holding the second wild card spot, hope Naylor will significantly boost their postseason push, slotting him into the top of their lineup alongside key players. This trade signals the official start of what is expected to be an active period leading up to the July 31 deadline.</p>

Health officials launched an investigation after seven people sought emergency care, with 85 out of 107 questionnaire respondents reporting symptoms within five hours of eating.

This aggressive move, which could secure several House seats in Texas, Ohio, and Missouri, is forcing national and state-level Democrats to consider retaliatory redistricting efforts, despite their past advocacy for fair representation. Democrats face significant obstacles, including independent commissions and state constitutional prohibitions in many states they control, making it difficult to mirror Republican tactics.

          <p>A new bipartisan bill in Congress, the SHARE Act, aims to incentivize public companies to distribute stock to their rank-and-file employees. The proposed legislation would offer a 3 percentage point corporate tax rate discount to large companies that allocate at least 5% of their stock to their lowest-paid 80% of employees. Proponents suggest this could transfer nearly $4 trillion in stock value to almost 40 million middle-class Americans, fostering employee loyalty and expanding ownership within companies.

While past spikes in speculative trading have sometimes led to stronger-than-usual returns over the next three to twelve months, returns have historically faltered over a two-year horizon.

          <p>Keaton Muldoon has been jailed for five years and three months after his "pursuit of anger" led to a fatal e-bike crash, killing 25-year-old mother Alana Armstrong and seriously injuring her boyfriend. Muldoon, 23, admitted causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury after he intentionally followed and hit the e-bike on a narrow country lane, though he was found not guilty of murder. The victim's boyfriend, Jordan Newton-Kay, who later had his right leg amputated, expressed immense anger and grief, revealing he had planned to propose to Armstrong. The court heard emotional statements from the family, highlighting the devastating and permanent impact of Muldoon's reckless actions.</p>

          <h2>US-EU Trade Deal Uncertain as August 1 Tariff Deadline Approaches</h2>

          <p>President Trump stated there's a "50/50 chance, maybe less" of striking a trade deal with the European Union before the August 1 deadline, after which a 30% tariff on EU imports is threatened. This comes as the US has recently outlined trade deals with Japan, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and the UK. European officials are reportedly open to a 15% US baseline tariff but are prepared to retaliate with levies on over $100 billion of US goods starting August 7 if no agreement is reached. Despite the looming threat, financial markets have remained relatively stable, suggesting some optimism for a resolution that avoids much higher tariffs and a full-blown trade war.</p>

          <p>A Guardian report details a single day at New York City's Jacob K Javits federal immigration courthouse, illustrating the Trump administration's expanding crackdown on immigration. The article highlights instances of immediate detentions by masked federal agents in hallways, even for individuals granted future hearings, leading to distressing family separations. This practice, part of a broader effort to arrest 3,000 people daily, has transformed routine hearings into scenes fraught with anxiety and fear for immigrants, prompting a recently filed class-action lawsuit seeking to bar courthouse arrests. Lawmakers attempting oversight were rebuffed, and footage reveals harsh conditions for those held on the building's 10th floor.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Ends Federal Police Accountability Reforms, Drawing Criticism</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Justice has reversed investigations and consent decrees aimed at police accountability in several US cities, including Louisville, Phoenix, Trenton, and Minneapolis. This move effectively ends federal oversight mechanisms, like those initiated after Breonna Taylor's death in Louisville, which had found patterns of civil rights violations and excessive force. Critics, including the ACLU, decry this rollback as an abdication of statutory authority, fearing it will hinder progress towards ending police abuses and ensuring constitutional policing. While some cities, like Louisville and Trenton, have pledged to continue reforms independently, concerns remain about their ability to ensure full accountability without federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Hulk Hogan, the legendary professional wrestler known for his larger-than-life persona and iconic catchphrases, has died at 71. Hogan, whose real name was Terry Bollea, was instrumental in popularizing pro wrestling in the 1980s with his patriotic, heroic "Hulkster" character, becoming arguably the most famous wrestler of all time. The article reflects on his unique ability to maintain his wrestling identity throughout his career and even in personal life, often blurring the lines between performance and reality. His enduring appeal allowed him to navigate controversies, including a racist audio leak and his polarizing public alliance with Donald Trump, consistently embodying his conquering hero persona.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump expressed confidence that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is ready to begin lowering interest rates, following their recent meeting and a positive assessment of the economy. Trump interpreted Powell's remarks as a signal for monetary policy easing, which he has been advocating for months, despite the Fed's reluctance due to inflation concerns. While the White House continues to push for a review of the central bank's management and operational deficit, Trump has recently backed off threats to fire Powell, stating he sees no need for his resignation. Futures markets, however, currently assign a low probability of a rate cut in the immediate future, with September being the earliest expectation. (not investment advice)</p>
