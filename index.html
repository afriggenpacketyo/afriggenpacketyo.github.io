          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, along with the leaders of France and Canada, has joined in condemning Israel's military operations in Gaza, urging the government to immediately allow humanitarian aid into the region. The leaders criticized Israel's plan to allow only a "basic amount of food" after an 11-week blockade as wholly inadequate, warning of potential breaches of International Humanitarian Law. They reiterated their support for a ceasefire and a two-state solution while also calling for Hamas to release the remaining hostages. The situation in Gaza is described as intolerable, with the UN noting the disastrous toll of the blockade on the Palestinian population.</p>

Additionally, In-N-Out will switch from high fructose corn syrup to real sugar in its ketchup and introduce Stevia Leaf Extract as a healthier sweetener option.

          <p>New Jersey Representative LaMonica McIver has been charged by the Department of Justice for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers during a protest outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility. The charges stem from an incident on May 9 where McIver, along with other members of Congress and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, protested outside Delaney Hall. McIver claims the charges are politically motivated and mischaracterize her actions, while top House Democrats have vowed to respond vigorously to what they call an abuse of power. The charges against Mayor Baraka were dropped.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest EV battery maker, saw its shares jump as much as 14% during its Hong Kong debut, reflecting the strong demand for EV-related stocks.

CATL plans to use the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aiming to supply batteries to European automotive clients including Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen, capitalizing on Europe's growing EV market penetration. The company's global expansion coincides with similar moves from Chinese EV makers, despite facing trade tensions and scrutiny from the U.S.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. under President Trump, China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion in April into its bond and equities markets. This contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and a recent downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this shift reflects changing global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from U.S. dollar assets. The Bank of America noted the attractiveness of emerging markets due to a weaker U.S. dollar and China's economic recovery.</p>

The investigation began after suspected illegal aliens entered a vehicle, leading to a high-speed chase where Regalado crashed into the Rio Grande and escaped to Mexico.

          <p>A report by the Cato Institute alleges that at least 50 Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador had legally entered the U.S. The report analyzed immigration data for a portion of the men sent to the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), revealing that many had advanced U.S. government permission to enter the country. This contradicts the Trump administration's claim that only undocumented individuals were deported. The analysis highlights concerns over the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act and the treatment of migrants.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, lowering the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. The move comes as Beijing intensifies efforts to stimulate its economy, taking advantage of a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions. This decision follows a series of measures, including deposit rate reductions by state-backed lenders and lowered mortgage rates, and is part of a broader stimulus package.

          <p>Hawaii's coral reefs are experiencing widespread bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures, threatening marine life and coastal protection. Marine scientist Greg Asner notes that 84% of coral reefs are under heat stress, leading to the expulsion of algae that give corals their color. The decline of coral reefs is accelerating, with some reefs dying in weeks rather than years. Efforts are underway to educate tourists on using reef-safe sunscreens and to implement underwater nurseries for coral restoration, but long-term recovery depends on controlling fossil fuel emissions.</p>
