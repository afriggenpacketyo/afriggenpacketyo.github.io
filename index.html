          <p>UK Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick is standing by his remarks describing the Handsworth area of Birmingham as poorly integrated, where he claimed to have seen no other white faces during a visit. The comments, published by the Guardian, have drawn sharp criticism from Labour politicians and the local MP, who called them irresponsible and false. Jenrick maintains he is highlighting a real issue of "parallel communities" cited in government reports, while critics accuse him of reducing people to their skin color and stoking division. The controversy has put pressure on the Conservative leadership to respond.</p>

France's CAC 40 index saw declines, particularly affecting major banks like Societe Generale and BNP Paribas. Compounding the issue, new data revealed a significant drop in German factory orders, contrary to analyst expectations of growth. Meanwhile, Shell announced expectations of higher gas trading profits but also a major loss from a canceled biofuels project. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An art exhibition is creating a unique dialogue between artifacts recovered from a Tang dynasty shipwreck and Western art, particularly the works of Impressionist painter Claude Monet. The curator, inspired by a Monet painting of merchant ships, sees a parallel between the global journey of trade goods and the borderless nature of art. The exhibit aims to highlight how both ancient maritime culture and timeless art can transcend boundaries and inspire audiences across different cultures. This convergence underscores the enduring power of cultural exchange throughout history.</p>

          <p>France is facing a significant political crisis after Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned just 27 days into his term, citing an inability to form a stable government amid partisan deadlock. President Emmanuel Macron, who now has limited options, granted Lecornu a 48-hour extension for last-ditch negotiations. The turmoil stems from inconclusive elections last year that left Macron without a parliamentary majority, making governance difficult. Potential next steps include appointing a new prime minister, possibly from an opposition party, or calling for another risky snap election.</p>

While she feels safer personally in Jeddah than in the UK, she recognizes the developing state of the women's league and the need for its gradual, sustainable growth.</p>

          <p>Indirect talks in Egypt between Israel and Hamas over a US-proposed peace plan face several major hurdles despite being the closest the two sides have come to a deal. Key sticking points include the structure and timing of the hostage release, with Hamas's willingness to free all captives upfront remaining uncertain. Furthermore, Israel's demand for Hamas to disarm is a long-standing point of refusal for the militant group. Disagreements also persist over the future governance of Gaza and the timeline for a full Israeli military withdrawal.</p>

          <p>The recent resignation of French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu marks a new phase in France's ongoing political instability, differing from previous government collapses. This crisis was triggered not by the opposition, but by the withdrawal of support from a key center-right ally, Les Republicains, signaling a breakdown in President Macron's governing coalition. Analysts suggest this shift is driven by parties positioning themselves for the 2027 presidential election, as Macron cannot run again. The situation leaves Macron with few good options, as another snap election is unlikely to produce a clear majority.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has upgraded its 2025 economic growth forecast for China to 4.8%, up from a previous prediction of 4%, despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States. This revision brings the forecast closer to Beijing's official target of around 5% growth. The report notes that government stimulus measures and strong export performance have supported the economy, though this momentum is expected to slow. The World Bank projects China's growth will ease to 4.2% in 2026 due to challenges like a real estate slump and sluggish consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

The measure, which would temporarily return map-drawing power from an independent commission to lawmakers, has sparked fierce debate.

The lawsuit argues the deployment is an "unconstitutional invasion" and that the president is unlawfully using the military for domestic law enforcement over the objections of state leadership. During a court hearing, it was revealed that National Guard troops from Texas are already on their way to Illinois. Governor J.B. Pritzker condemned the action, vowing to resist the administration's "power grab."</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla is intensifying over the Pacific Ocean and is expected to become a Category 2 storm as it moves parallel to the southwestern coast of Mexico. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the storm could approach major hurricane status in the coming days before it begins to weaken midweek. While Priscilla's center is predicted to remain offshore, it is expected to bring heavy rainfall, strong winds, and dangerous surf and rip currents to coastal areas. A tropical storm watch has been issued for a portion of the Baja California Sur peninsula.</p>

          <p>According to preliminary federal data, U.S. Border Patrol recorded approximately 238,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border illegally in fiscal year 2025, the lowest annual total since 1970. This sharp decline follows the implementation of the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies, which include militarizing the border and virtually ending the practice of releasing migrants into the U.S. The current monthly apprehension numbers are a fraction of those seen during peaks under the previous administration. The White House credited the president's policies for securing the border and enhancing American safety.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is creating significant disruptions in the aviation system, with Hollywood Burbank Airport in Los Angeles facing several hours without any air traffic controllers in its tower on Monday. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed the staffing shortage, which is also affecting flights at other major airports. While some 13,000 air traffic controllers are required to work without pay during the shutdown, officials warn that increased sick calls could force a reduction in air traffic to maintain safety. The situation has led to significant flight delays at the affected airports.</p>

While some see it as a welcome convenience that could boost tourism, others worry about the environmental impact on the pristine landscape. The development highlights the growing influence of Chinese investment in Indonesia's tourism infrastructure and the challenges of balancing development with conservation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's crackdown on legal immigration, particularly the H-1B skilled-worker visa program, is having an unexpected social consequence in India. According to matchmaking services and academics, families in India are becoming more hesitant to arrange marriages with Indian citizens working in the U.S. due to fears of job loss or uncertain immigration status. Non-Resident Indians in the U.S. were traditionally considered highly prized marriage prospects. Now, the uncertainty is causing some families to delay weddings or look for potential partners in countries with more stable immigration pathways, such as Canada or the UK.</p>

Despite the agonizing two-year wait, she expressed "real hope" that the current U.S.-led peace plan could lead to the return of all hostages. She highlighted the importance of the plan's provision to release all captives, both living and deceased, in the first phase, as it would provide closure for families.

This initiative aims to combat the urban heat island effect, with projections showing the new roofs could cool the city by an average of 2.4 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition to the cooling benefits, the ordinance is expected to save residents and businesses an estimated $315 million on energy bills over 35 years. The bill's author framed the legislation as a measure for climate justice, resilience, and public health.</p>

The legislation extends existing federal regulations, which have applied to broadcast and cable television since 2010, to the streaming industry. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the bill, which was inspired by a legislative aide's complaint about loud ads waking a sleeping baby. Because many major streaming platforms are based in California, this state law could effectively set a new national standard for ad volume.</p>
