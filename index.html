            <p>Walgreens reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue, driven by cost reductions as the drugstore chain prepares to go private in a deal with Sycamore Partners. The company is currently shuttering stores and managing expenses due to challenges like pharmacy reimbursement headwinds, softer consumer spending, and competition from rivals like CVS and Amazon. Walgreens' CEO, Tim Wentworth, noted that the results reflect disciplined cost management but also acknowledged the early stages of their turnaround plan. The company reported a net loss of $2.85 billion, including a $4.2 billion charge related to its U.S. retail pharmacy and VillageMD investment, but saw gains from its investments in Cencora and BrightSpring.

            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the U.S. holds a significant advantage over China in their ongoing trade conflict, arguing that China has more to lose due to the imbalance in export volumes. Bessent's comments come as the U.S. prepares to raise tariffs on China and other nations, aiming to bring trading partners to the negotiating table and jobs back to the U.S. He emphasized that the administration is addressing non-tariff barriers like currency manipulation and value-added taxes to ensure fair trade. While acknowledging that tariffs could bring jobs back to the US, Bessent said the ultimate goal is to level the playing field and promote American manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

This statement comes as President Trump moves forward with imposing severe tariffs on numerous U.S. trading partners. Despite Trump's claims that the U.S. is open to negotiations, he has rejected the possibility of pausing tariffs during discussions. A senior White House official indicated that additional tariffs could be placed on Chinese imports if China continues to retaliate, potentially raising the total tariff to 104%.</p>

            <p>The ongoing bin strike in Birmingham, now in its fifth week, has prompted concerns from Health Secretary Wes Streeting regarding public health due to unsanitary conditions and vermin infestations. Talks between bin workers and the city council have so far failed to reach an agreement, leading to a growing backlog of waste and the declaration of a major incident. Neighboring Lichfield District Council is preparing to assist in clearing the waste, while the impact of fly-tipping is being debated in Parliament. The bin workers are striking over plans to remove roles and downgrade others, as the city council struggles with financial difficulties after declaring bankruptcy in 2023.</p>

Dunne argued that the settlement undervalues her true worth as a Division I athlete and businesswoman. The settlement aims to allow schools to pay a portion of their revenue directly to college athletes for NIL usage and establish a clearinghouse to ensure fair market value for NIL deals. Despite Dunne's objections, the judge indicated preliminary approval of the settlement, which is set to take effect on July 1.</p>

Iran has expressed openness to indirect discussions, with Trump asserting his desire for a deal to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and to avert possible military action.

            <p>Lenders are anticipated to lower mortgage rates due to the instability created by President Trump's tariff policies, which have increased expectations of further interest rate cuts by the Bank of England.

Financial markets and economists now predict more interest rate cuts than previously anticipated to mitigate potential economic downturns. The interest rate, currently at 4.5%, was initially expected to be reduced twice this year, but the uncertainty caused by the tariffs has altered the outlook to three cuts, potentially bringing it down to 3.75%.

            <p>Colossal Biosciences announced the birth of three dire wolf puppies, claiming to have "de-extincted" the species through genetic engineering and ancient DNA. However, independent experts dispute this claim, stating that the puppies are genetically modified grey wolves rather than true dire wolves. Paleogeneticists explain that ancient dire wolf DNA is too degraded to be cloned, and instead, the team used synthetic biology to insert dire wolf-like characteristics into grey wolf cells. While Colossal maintains that this represents de-extinction by recreating animals with the same characteristics, experts argue that dire wolves diverged from grey wolves millions of years ago and belong to a different genus.</p>

            <p>President Trump defended his new tariffs against countries worldwide, urging Americans to be "strong, courageous, and patient." Market shares in Europe and Asia experienced a slight rebound after recent sell-offs. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Trump administration's deportation of Venezuelan gang members, requiring officials to provide migrants adequate notice before removal. The court emphasized that officials must give migrants adequate notice that they are being removed under the Act so that they have time to challenge it. (not investment advice)</p>
