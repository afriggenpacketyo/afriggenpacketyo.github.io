          <p>Approximately 55,000 Los Angeles County workers, represented by SEIU Local 721, initiated a two-day strike on Monday night due to unsuccessful contract negotiations with the county. The union alleges 44 labor law violations, including retaliation and outsourcing of union work. The strike is expected to disrupt various public services, including libraries, healthcare clinics, and beach cleanup, though hospitals will remain open. County officials express concern about the union's salary proposals potentially leading to a structural deficit and emphasize the importance of protecting the county's credit rating.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its immigration enforcement efforts to include unaccompanied minors, conducting "welfare checks" on children who arrived in the US alone. These actions have raised concerns about potential family separation and a broader crackdown on immigration. President Trump has also signed executive orders targeting "sanctuary cities" that limit cooperation with federal immigration laws. The administration's policies continue to spark debate and legal challenges regarding immigration enforcement and humanitarian concerns.</p>

          <p>A research team predicts that without serious action on global warming, Japanese students may be unable to participate in extracurricular outdoor sports during the summer by the 2060s. Heat stress projections indicate that intense sporting activity should be avoided during certain hours in July and August in most areas, excluding Hokkaido. The study highlights the potential impact of climate change on daily life and the need for adaptation strategies in school activities. The annual Koshien national high school baseball tournament has already adopted a two-session system to mitigate heat effects.</p>

          <p>President Trump is providing automakers with tariff relief, marking a shift from his previous stance on trade policies aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing. The decision will prevent the accumulation of various tariffs on imported foreign cars and auto parts. Importers of foreign auto parts will be eligible for government reimbursement of tariffs for the next two years. The move is intended to reward domestic manufacturers and provide time for others to invest in domestic plants.</p>

          <p>Communities along the Mississippi River south of New Orleans are facing an increasing threat from saltwater intrusion, which is impacting drinking water infrastructure and the local seafood industry. The intrusion has compromised the freshwater supply for thousands of residents and caused damage to water supply pipes. The estimated cost to fix broken pipes and build resilient infrastructure is $200 million. Experts attribute the increased frequency of saltwater intrusion to drought, sea level rise, and dredging.</p>

          <p>Two California judges, Dean Pregerson and Vijay Gandhi, have joined a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), alleging the utility failed to adequately prepare for and respond to the January firestorm in the Pacific Palisades. The lawsuit claims LADWP's empty Santa Ynez Reservoir and energized power lines contributed to the fire's spread. The utility denies responsibility, citing the fire's speed and scale, and stating that water utilities are not liable for wildfire losses.

In the study, 82 out of 103 participants responded well to the drug and no longer needed an operation. The study focused on patients with tumors that had a mismatch repair defect, a genetic problem that makes cells more likely to respond to immunotherapy. The results are promising but require further research.</p>
