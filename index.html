          <p>Many millennials and Gen Zers are finding financial security elusive despite increases in their net worth, as they navigate a landscape of rising costs and increased responsibility for retirement funding. Experts argue that the financial struggles of young Americans are largely structural rather than behavioral, with traditional markers of success becoming increasingly difficult to achieve. As a result, young adults are adapting by living with their parents longer, sharing child care, and seeking new ways to build community. The article highlights the growing disparity between generations and the challenges faced by young people in achieving financial stability.</p>

          <p>A top UK Special Forces general, Gen Sir Gwyn Jenkins, is under scrutiny for allegedly blocking UK resettlement applications from Afghan commandos who served with the SAS, potentially preventing them from testifying in a public inquiry into alleged SAS war crimes in Afghanistan. According to BBC Panorama, Gen Jenkins, who led UKSF in Afghanistan, appointed an officer under his command to assess the applications, leading to the rejection of thousands of Afghans with credible evidence of service. Concerns were raised among cabinet ministers about the conflict of interest, with some denied visas reportedly tortured and killed by the Taliban.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at dramatically reducing prescription drug costs for American consumers by forcing pharmaceutical companies to match the lowest global prices. Trump criticized the current pricing system as exploitative, stating that the U.S. subsidizes healthcare for other countries. The policy, dubbed “most favored nation,” seeks to level the global pharmaceutical playing field, but it is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceuticals industry, which argues it could limit access to vital care for Medicare patients. The Rand Corporation found that the U.S. paid significantly more for drugs than other wealthy democracies in 2022.</p>

While some measures aim to restrict immigration, others, such as expanding eligibility for elite university graduates, seek to attract top talent.

          <p>The Defense Department has spent over $21 million on flights to Guantanamo Bay amid the Trump administration's migrant deportation efforts, according to figures shared in a letter sent to Congress and obtained by CBS News. In January, President Trump directed his administration to use Guantanamo Bay as a holding site for migrants, particularly "worst" offenders. Between January 20 and April 8, U.S. Transportation Command conducted 46 flights to Guantanamo Bay, costing an average of $26,277 per flight hour. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the expenditure as a waste of military resources for political stunts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has dismissed ethical concerns about accepting a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar to serve as the new Air Force One, stating that it would be "stupid" to decline such an offer, according to the New York Times article. While Qatari officials say the plan is not finalized, Trump said the plane would be donated to the Defense Department and not to him personally. Democrats and government watchdogs have suggested the donation would violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution and create an incentive structure for Trump regarding Qatar. Trump grew angry at the ethical questions, likening it to accepting a free putt in golf.</p>

The TfL website experienced intermittent issues, and a TfL spokesperson stated that the outage was a result of a National Grid issue, shutting down everything for a matter of minutes.</p>

          <p>Former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has been denied over $600,000 in public matching funds for his mayoral campaign after the New York City Campaign Finance Board determined he likely engaged in illicit coordination with a super PAC, according to the New York Times article. The board found that Cuomo's campaign posted detailed spending instructions online, and a super PAC subsequently aired an ad aligning with those requests. While Cuomo received $1.5 million in public matching funds, the board withheld the additional amount due to concerns that the television commercial was not independent of the Cuomo campaign. A spokesman for Cuomo stated that the campaign operated in compliance with campaign finance laws.</p>
