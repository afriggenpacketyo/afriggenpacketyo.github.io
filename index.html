          <p>Ahead of its tournament in Dallas, LIV Golf is focusing on community outreach and fostering the next generation of players through its 'Potential, Unleashed' initiative. The program partners with local schools and charities to provide educational and athletic opportunities for students in the DFW area, aiming to increase diversity in the sport. Players like Cameron Tringale participated in clinics, emphasizing the goal of breaking down barriers to entry in golf. This community-focused effort runs parallel to the main tournament, which organizers say offers a more relaxed, fan-friendly atmosphere compared to traditional golf events.</p>

The event aims to ensure AI serves the common good, but major US and Chinese AI firms like OpenAI and DeepSeek were notably absent. Amid the deepening tech rivalry, Thailand’s Ministry of Digital Economy and Society stated it would not take sides between the US and China. Instead, the nation intends to focus on developing its own independent AI ecosystem while engaging with the UN's ethical framework.</p>

          <p>The ACLU of Idaho has filed a federal lawsuit challenging a new state law set to restrict public benefits for undocumented residents, including access to life-saving HIV/AIDS medication. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of a doctor and four immigrant patients, argues the law is unconstitutionally vague and contradicts federal statutes that permit aid for public health services. According to the complaint, the law jeopardizes the health of dozens of patients who rely on the federal Ryan White Program for treatment. This legal challenge highlights the severe public health risks, as untreated patients could transmit the virus, reversing years of progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government has announced a significant reversal on its flagship welfare bill following intense pressure from over 100 of its own Labour MPs. The changes will protect current recipients of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) from planned cuts, which will now only apply to future claimants. This major U-turn, which also includes fast-tracking a £1 billion support plan, was made to avoid a parliamentary defeat and quell what some rebels called a 'civil war' within the party. While the move secured the bill's likely passage, it marks the third government reversal in a month, raising questions about the prime minister's authority.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman is facing mounting criticism from fellow Democrats and progressive groups over his perceived cooperation with President Trump and his staunch support for Israel's war in Gaza. This frustration has created an opening for his 2022 primary opponent, Conor Lamb, who is now actively engaging with voters at town halls across the state, often criticizing Fetterman's positions. While Fetterman defends his actions by stating he was elected to work with Republicans, organizations like Indivisible PA have called for his resignation. Lamb's reemergence signals a deepening rift within the state's Democratic party halfway through Fetterman's term.</p>

          <p>During the World Economic Forum event in Tianjin, prominent economists argued that China must shift its economic focus from production to consumption to achieve long-term prosperity. Professor Jin Keyu stated that despite technological advancements, China's reliance on subsidizing production creates trade imbalances and global friction. The experts called for structural reforms that would elevate internal consumption, particularly in the services sector and smaller cities, as a key metric for local government success. This change is seen as essential not only for sustainable growth but also for harmonizing China's economic relationships with the rest of the world.</p>

          <p>Chongqing, China, is experiencing a massive surge in tourism from Southeast Asia, largely fueled by viral social media clips showcasing its unique, multi-dimensional urban landscape. Online travel platforms report that flight bookings have increased dramatically, with Klook noting a nearly twelve-fold surge in demand for the city in 2025. Tourists are drawn to its 'cyberpunk' architecture, such as a monorail passing through a residential building.

          <p>China's industrial profits fell by 9.1% in May compared to the previous year, marking the most significant monthly drop since last October and signaling that stimulus measures are not yet reviving corporate earnings. The National Bureau of Statistics attributed the decline to weak domestic demand and falling prices for industrial goods. Over the first five months of 2025, cumulative profits for major industrial firms were down 1.1%. Despite this downturn, some economists believe the robust performance in other economic areas, like retail sales, may reduce the urgency for Beijing to introduce further large-scale stimulus measures.

During the two-week period, officials conducted extensive searches that uncovered 169 weapons and 310 cellphones.

          <p>The L.A. County Department of Public Health is holding its last community event for free blood lead testing for residents affected by January's firestorms. Although previous screenings of over 1,500 people showed low levels of contamination for most, officials still urge residents to get tested due to the documented health risks of lead exposure from wildfire ash. Research has shown that fires burning through urban areas can release toxic metals into the environment. Testing commissioned by the county found elevated lead levels in the soil of the Eaton fire burn scar, highlighting the potential danger, especially for children.</p>

          <p>A region in northern West Virginia, still recovering from deadly flash floods less than two weeks ago, was inundated by torrential rain again on Thursday night.

This new deluge follows a tragic event on June 14, when sudden, intense rainfall led to flooding that killed nine people and damaged numerous homes and businesses.

          <p>A closed-door intelligence briefing on the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites has left Republican and Democratic senators with starkly different conclusions, intensifying political divisions.
