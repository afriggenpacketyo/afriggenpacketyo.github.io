          <p>Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP), led by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, secured a landslide victory in the recent general election, increasing its vote share amidst global trade turmoil. The PAP won 87 out of 97 parliamentary seats, with Wong becoming the first PAP leader to improve the party's vote share in his inaugural election. Wong emphasized the mandate provides stability and confidence for Singapore to navigate turbulent global conditions, as the country faces slowing economic growth and trade uncertainties. The United States and the European Union have already expressed their intent to strengthen ties with Singapore's new government.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, wealthy mainland Chinese investors are increasingly diverting their real estate investments to other markets. Data indicates a significant shift in demand for homes priced above US$5 million, with Thailand, Australia, and Canada becoming preferred destinations. This trend reflects concerns about increased scrutiny of property deals and protectionist policies, leading Chinese buyers to seek friendlier and more stable investment environments. Investment in US homes by Chinese buyers has dropped more than 50 percent from its peak in 2017.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill into law allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, allowing parents to use public funds for private school tuition. This marks a significant victory for school choice advocates who argue it will provide more options for parents seeking alternatives to underperforming public schools. The program will provide families with $10,000 per year, or up to $30,000 for children with disabilities, to cover private school or homeschooling expenses. Critics, however, argue that it will divert resources from public schools and primarily benefit wealthy families.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president marked a shift from a coalition government to a "royal court" structure. Unlike previous administrations where advisors acted as checks on Trump's impulses, Vance's appointment signaled an embrace of loyalists who would not challenge Trump's decisions. This shift has resulted in a more unchecked presidency, with fewer internal skeptics and an increased willingness to pursue extreme policies. The article suggests that this structural change is intentional and will lead to a more reckless and uninhibited administration.</p>

While some political parties support introducing the option of separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling party oppose the move, citing concerns about traditional family values.</p>
