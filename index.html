Despite the positive results, Samsung flagged macroeconomic uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and a slowdown in global growth.

In response, Harvard pledged to review its academic offerings and admissions policies to ensure applicants are evaluated on their ability to engage constructively with different perspectives and show empathy.

          <p>Mexico's Attorney General Alejandro Gertz stated that the Izaguirre ranch in Teuchitlán was used by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel for training and recruitment, based on testimonials and documents. However, he contradicted earlier statements, asserting that there is no evidence to prove the ranch was a site for human cremations. He said studies on bone fragments and other materials found at the ranch did not indicate heat levels high enough for cremations. Héctor Flores, a leader of a search group, maintains the belief that the ranch was an extermination site, criticizing officials for attempting to alter the narrative. </p>

          <p>As President Trump marked his 100th day in office, the White House framed his policies as ending "the era of economic surrender". However, official press releases from the White House and Treasury Department gave little direct mention of tariffs, emphasizing broader economic indicators like job growth and investment. Trump, in a speech, revived claims that countries were seeking trade deals to avoid tariffs, despite China's denials of ongoing negotiations. He justified tariffs on China as a historic effort to curb job theft, but maintained that the tension around tariffs did not preclude reaching a deal. </p>

Japan is considering increasing U.S.-grown soybean and corn imports and allowing more imported cars to qualify for simplified screening to ease trade friction.

The denial comes after Mangione's attorney accused federal prosecutors of listening to a recorded call between them. Prosecutors explained that the Metropolitan Detention Center, where Mangione is held, routinely records and monitors jail lines. Mangione reportedly used a monitored line instead of a designated attorney line, leading to the inadvertent recording and transmission of the call to prosecutors. </p>

          <p>Australia's first-quarter inflation remained steady at a four-year low of 2.4%, slightly higher than Reuters' expectations. The most significant price increases were in housing, education, and food, partially offset by falls in recreation and household goods prices. Inflation has been softening since hitting a multi-year high in late 2022, allowing the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut rates to 4.1%.

This temporary alleviation came after automakers argued that their complex supply chains require time to procure domestic parts.

          <p>China's manufacturing activity fell to a near two-year low in April, entering contractionary territory due to escalating trade tensions with the U.S. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped below the 50-level threshold for the first time since January. President Trump has imposed cumulative new tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods, leading to disrupted trade flows and a decline in cargo shipments. Despite some tariff relief on the ground, Nomura estimates that a significant portion of China's GDP and manufacturing jobs will be directly impacted by the U.S. tariffs. </p>

The orders call for federal agencies to provide best practices to local police and improve crime tracking. However, concerns arise regarding the potential for federal overreach in controlling local policing. The White House also says it may pursue "legal remedies" for potential violations of federal law against "sanctuary" jurisdictions that don't cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated his 100th day in office with a campaign-style speech, touting his achievements and targeting political foes. He hailed what he called a "revolution of common sense" and mocked his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. Trump also criticized the US Federal Reserve's chairman and dismissed polls that show his own popularity slipping. While Trump has delivered a dramatic fall in the number of migrants crossing illegally into the US, the economy is a potential political vulnerability as he wages a global trade war. </p>

When pressed about complying with a Supreme Court order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, Trump conceded that he could call the president of El Salvador but suggested he would only do so if Abrego Garcia were "the gentleman" described. </p>
