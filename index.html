          <p>Middle Eastern and European leaders have expressed support for President Trump's new peace plan for Gaza, which outlines an immediate cessation of military operations and a staged withdrawal of Israeli forces. The proposal requires Hamas to release 20 living Israeli hostages and the remains of deceased hostages within 72 hours, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. It stipulates Hamas will have no governing role in Gaza, instead proposing a technocratic Palestinian committee overseen by an international transitional body chaired by Trump, with former UK PM Sir Tony Blair also involved. The plan includes a significant economic development initiative to rebuild Gaza and leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled a 20-point plan for ending the Israel-Hamas conflict, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has backed, though Hamas's response remains pending. The plan calls for an immediate ceasefire, Hamas's release of all remaining Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from parts of Gaza. It proposes a "technocratic" Palestinian committee to govern Gaza, overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump, alongside an international stabilization force backed by the US and Arab states. The proposal also includes significant humanitarian aid and economic development for Gaza, while offering amnesty to Hamas members who decommission weapons and commit to peaceful coexistence, aiming for a sustainable, long-term peace.</p>

          <p>Moroccan police have detained dozens of individuals during a third day of protests across several cities, including Rabat and Casablanca, initiated by youth networks like Moroccan Youth Voice and GenZ 212. Demonstrators are calling for urgent reforms in education and healthcare, citing concerns over profound social inequalities and a youth unemployment rate reaching 35.8%. Protesters criticized government spending on sports stadiums for the 2030 Fifa World Cup while public health and education systems face crises, chanting "Stadiums are here, but where are the hospitals?". Human rights groups have condemned the arrests, confirming that activists were among those detained, highlighting a perceived crackdown on free expression and assembly.</p>

          <h2>Germany's Anti-Diversity Stance Viewed as Strategic, Not Neutral</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant backlash against diversity and inclusion initiatives, which the article argues is a strategic move disguised as a return to neutrality, rather than mere fatigue. Once a leader in promoting diversity post-Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, Berlin's cultural institutions are now seeing diversity programs cut amid austerity measures and rising far-right influence. Critics, including choreographer Joana Tischkau, contend this shift is anti-democratic, with marginalized artists facing increased scrutiny and accusations of preferential treatment. The article suggests this trend, mirroring global patterns seen in the US with critical race theory, undermines truth and complexity in art by framing diversity as dangerous or "woke" and questioning public funding for inclusive programming.</p>

This IPO marks the world's second-largest this year, benefiting from a period of record-high gold prices driven by strong safe-haven demand, anticipated rate cuts, and global economic uncertainty. The company's successful listing contributes to a resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market, which has seen a substantial year-on-year increase in funds raised. Major investors included Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, Hillhouse's HHLRA, and BlackRock Funds, highlighting significant investor confidence in the gold sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's major grocery retailers, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are adopting tactics similar to German discounters like Aldi and Lidl to attract increasingly price-sensitive shoppers. Amid economic uncertainty, these chains are streamlining hypermarkets, reducing clutter, and heavily promoting their own "private label" brands, which promise quality comparable to established brands at significantly lower prices. This strategic shift responds to an ongoing slump in China's grocery sector, where sales at top operators were flat last year and store counts decreased by nearly 10 percent. Retailers are betting on this playbook to capitalize on consumers' growing demand for value-for-money offers by cutting intermediaries and marketing costs for store brands, reflecting a rationalization of consumer spending habits.</p>

Victims, ranging from 6 to 78 years old, suffered gunshot wounds and smoke inhalation, with two remaining in critical condition.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to address the Labour Party conference, declaring Britain stands "at a fork in the road" and emphasizing a stark choice between Labour's vision of "renewal" and "decency" versus Reform UK's path of "decline and division." This speech, intended as his clearest statement of political creed, comes amid criticism of his leadership, recent ministerial reshuffles, and dire opinion polls for the party, including the loss of his US ambassador and deputy. Starmer will appeal beyond Labour's traditional base, urging unity around a common good to improve living standards and grow the economy, while acknowledging the "hard path" and difficult, potentially uncomfortable, decisions ahead to rebuild the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace proposal, while hailed by him as potentially historic, is seen by analysts as a significant diplomatic step but one facing fundamental obstacles. The plan marks a shift in the Trump administration's post-war Gaza stance and increases pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has accepted its principles despite internal coalition dissent. However, Hamas's response remains unclear, with previous indications suggesting the group would reject terms not guaranteeing Israeli withdrawal. The article highlights ambiguities and potential for sabotage during negotiations, noting the plan is more a framework than a detailed agreement, requiring extensive work on issues like Israeli withdrawal lines, specific hostage exchanges, the identities of Palestinian prisoners, and the conditions for post-war governance, all of which could derail peace.</p>

          <p>Stef Reid, a world champion Paralympic long jumper and sprinter, is campaigning for major sports brands like Nike, Adidas, and Puma to sell single shoes instead of pairs. Reid, who had her right foot amputated at 15 after a horrific boat accident, highlights the financial burden and impracticality for amputees who only need one shoe, wasting hundreds of pounds on unused footwear. Her motivation extends beyond cost to the principle of inclusivity, arguing that while brands proudly display inclusive imagery with bladed mannequins, their retail practices often fail to accommodate athletes like her. This initiative would also benefit thousands of people whose feet are different sizes, promoting greater accessibility and reducing waste in the sportswear market.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has reiterated his threat to impose a 100% tariff on all films not made in the US, claiming the American film industry has been "stolen" by other countries. He asserted that this levy would "solve this long time, never ending problem," particularly affecting California, which he criticized for its "weak and incompetent Governor." Trump previously mentioned this plan in May, alongside announcing other tariffs on branded drug imports and kitchen/bathroom cabinets. The proposal raises significant questions about its implementation, including its application to streaming services and how an "American-made" film would be defined given international collaborations. Analysts suggest such tariffs could increase production costs, potentially harming consumers and content makers, though investors currently do not view it as a serious threat.</p>

          <p>The US Justice Department has sued the state of Minnesota over its sanctuary city immigration policies, making it the latest Democratic-led jurisdiction to face legal action from the Trump administration. Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated that Minnesota's refusal to cooperate with immigration authorities jeopardizes public safety by allowing "dangerous criminals" to circumvent legal processes. The lawsuit argues that Minnesota's policies, which limit local participation with federal immigration agents, violate federal law. This action aligns with President Trump's campaign promise of mass deportations and follows similar lawsuits against other sanctuary jurisdictions like Los Angeles and New York, intensifying the federal government's crackdown on undocumented immigrants.</p>

This initiative, inspired by local students and similar bans in places like Lake Tahoe, aims to make Vail more sustainable and drastically reduce plastic waste. Mayor Travis Coggin acknowledges the need for significant investment in infrastructure, particularly expanding water refill stations, to support the transition, noting "There's a lot there." While critics question the consistency of banning only water bottles while other plastic beverages remain, proponents believe the ban will protect the environment and inspire a refill-and-reuse culture for future generations.</p>

Trump promoted this narrative, accusing Wray of lying, despite a DOJ Inspector General report finding no evidence of FBI informants encouraging illegal activity or joining the assault. This call follows the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump also publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute, saying he expected "there will be others." Trump's increasing calls for prosecuting political foes raise concerns about the independence of the Justice Department, according to Senator Lisa Murkowski.</p>

The article highlights Hong Kong's potential, exemplified by its role in the International Organisation for Mediation, as a hub for international engagement and attracting global talent.

Vice President JD Vance criticized Democrats for using a shutdown as leverage, while Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer noted "very large differences."

While NMIA is designed to be India's first fully digital hub airport, it faces major challenges, particularly last-mile connectivity.
