          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant surge in its Hong Kong trading debut, with shares rising over 18%. Investors are optimistic about the company's capacity to capitalize on the expanding electric vehicle (EV) market. The IPO generated HK$35.7 billion, reportedly the largest global listing in 2025. CATL intends to allocate 90% of the funds to constructing a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients. However, the company has faced challenges, including punitive tariffs on Chinese EVs and scrutiny over alleged links to China's military.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are facing a challenging week as they attempt to pass President Trump’s budget bill, marked by late-night sessions and internal disagreements. The House Budget Committee convened late Sunday night to advance the tax cut and spending reduction package, following an earlier setback. The bill faces opposition from Republicans concerned about spending cuts, green energy tax credits, and Medicaid work requirements. Despite the challenges, Republican leaders are pushing to get the bill passed, navigating competing priorities and a narrow margin for error. The process involves long meetings and potential votes at any hour, reflecting the intensity surrounding major legislation.</p>

          <p>Richard Grenell, President Trump's appointee as president of the Kennedy Center, has accused the center of "criminal" debt and deferred maintenance, stating he will refer the matter to federal prosecutors. Grenell claimed officials found $26 million in "phantom revenue" in the center's budgets. The upcoming season will feature both union and nonunion Broadway productions, a shift touted as increasing options for audiences. The season includes "The Outsiders" but not "Hamilton," which canceled its run due to concerns over Trump's takeover, and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater will not perform there next season.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the collision of a Mexican navy ship, the Cuauhtémoc, with the Brooklyn Bridge, which resulted in two fatalities and multiple injuries. The NTSB is awaiting permission from the Mexican government to access the ship, which remains docked at Pier 36. Investigators are examining whether wind and tide played roles in the incident, and will analyze the ship's engine status and electronic data to determine the cause of acceleration. The ship, carrying 277 people, was departing Pier 17 when the collision occurred, snapping all three masts.</p>

However, these deals required politically challenging concessions, highlighting Britain's diminished economic position. While the agreements offer benefits such as reduced tariffs on British luxury cars and streamlined airport access for travelers, they also involve trade-offs like allowing European trawlers access to British waters and increased access for American agricultural products. Despite these deals, Brexit has cost the country 5.5 percent of its GDP, according to a 2022 study.</p>

          <p>China attracted a significant net capital inflow into its bond and equities markets in April, totaling US$17.3 billion, despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States. This contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and market volatility following Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this reflects a shift in global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from U.S. dollar assets since President Trump launched his global trade war. Bank of America analysts noted that a weaker U.S. dollar, peaking U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery are factors driving investment towards emerging markets.</p>

          <p>Simon Daniel, an 18-year-old Cal State Fullerton student, drowned during a fraternity trip to Lake Havasu after disappearing below the surface while swimming in the Copper Canyon area. Daniel's body was found the next morning, and the Sigma Pi fraternity described him as "the heart of the fraternity." Recent rainfall had created hazardous swimming conditions, including strong currents, and Daniel was swept away by a sudden wave. Over 200 students attended a candlelit vigil for Daniel on Sunday night.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government will launch offshore "blue carbon" research aimed at capturing carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and storing it in the deep sea to accelerate decarbonization. The government hopes these plants will play a key role in mitigating climate change, as CO2 is highly soluble in water, and marine vegetation grows by absorbing dissolved CO2. Coastal and ocean plants, such as mangroves and kelp, are known to absorb and store more carbon than terrestrial vegetation. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.</p>

          <p>China cut its key lending rates by 10 basis points on Tuesday, marking the first reduction since October, as Beijing intensifies efforts to shore up its economy. The People's Bank of China trimmed the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. The rate cuts came as state-backed commercial lenders moved to reduce their deposit rates, paving the way to lower key lending rates. The PBOC is likely to continue to ease policy, with forecasts suggesting further reductions by year-end.</p>

The government's self-imposed limitations intentionally restricted its room for manoeuvre in these post-Brexit negotiations. Those who see themselves as custodians of the original Brexit deal would see it as an unforgivable dilution, and those who have consistently argued Brexit is a disaster would regard ministers as shamefully unambitious.
