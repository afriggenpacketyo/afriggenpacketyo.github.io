          <p>CICC views Hong Kong as having a significant opportunity to become a major offshore yuan hub, despite current pressures on the yuan.  The bank cites the decreasing interest rate differential between the US dollar and the yuan as a factor supporting this.  Miao Yanliang of CICC predicts renewed investor interest, capital inflows, and yuan stabilization.  The analysis suggests that both onshore and offshore markets are crucial for the yuan's broader international use.</p>

Yoon's initially broad appeal eroded as his politics shifted sharply to the right, alienating moderates and fueling conflict with the opposition.
