          <p>A shooting at a Baptist church in Lexington, Kentucky, left two people dead after a suspect, who had earlier shot and wounded a state trooper, fled to the location. The victims were identified as Beverly Gum, 72, and Christina Combs, 32. The incident began when the suspect shot a trooper during a traffic stop near the Blue Grass Airport. The suspect then proceeded to the church, where he killed the two victims and wounded two others before being shot and killed by Lexington police, ending the violent spree.</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured the inaugural Club World Cup trophy with a commanding 3-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain, driven by a brilliant performance from Cole Palmer. The English attacker scored two nearly identical goals in the first half and assisted a third for João Pedro, effectively deciding the match before halftime. PSG, despite controlling possession, struggled to break down Chelsea's organized defense and create clear chances, with goalkeeper Robert Sánchez making several key saves. The match was sealed for Chelsea when PSG's João Neves received a late red card for unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>

He cited multiple failures that allowed the gunman to position himself on a rooftop despite being spotted beforehand by the crowd. The senator believes that while the motive is a mystery, the security failures that enabled the attack are clear.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. In a social media post, Trump urged followers to let Bondi do her job and not to "waste time and energy" on the matter. The backlash emerged after a Justice Department memo stated there was no incriminating "client list" and no evidence of blackmail, which contradicted the expectations of many who anticipated major revelations. This has caused a rift, with prominent conservative figures and media personalities openly questioning the administration's transparency.</p>

The article praises the album for its authenticity and vulnerability, comparing its idiosyncratic vibe to modern pop stars like SZA and Lana Del Rey.

He attributed the need for increased military power to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and uncertainties related to the United States.

His return to power was fueled by public anger over corruption and insecurity, but his tenure was ultimately seen by many as disappointing, marked by economic decline and widespread violence.

          <p>A Senate committee report released one year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump found the Secret Service denied or left unfulfilled at least ten requests to enhance his security detail during the 2024 campaign. The report highlights that requests for additional counter-snipers and drone defense systems were among those not met. It accuses the agency of "inexcusable negligence" and systemic communication breakdowns that contributed to the preventable tragedy in Butler, Pennsylvania. The investigation also revealed a lack of formal processes for resource requests, leading to a pattern of unfulfilled needs that compromised security.</p>

Hassett suggested that President Trump could remove Powell "if there's cause," amid escalating administration criticism of the Fed's management, particularly concerning a renovation project at its headquarters. This development indicates the White House may be laying the groundwork to oust Powell before his term expires, a move that would challenge the central bank's traditional independence from political pressure and potentially create economic instability.

In subsequent media appearances, Homan clarified previous remarks, stating that physical appearance cannot be the sole factor for an ICE agent to detain someone, but is one of a "myriad of factors." He also acknowledged that U.S. citizens have been swept up in raids in what he termed "collateral arrests." Homan's increasingly public role comes as he defends controversial policies, including raids on farms employing undocumented workers.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's rhetoric about deporting dangerous criminals, U.S. government data reveals a different reality about immigration enforcement. As of late June, over 71% of individuals detained by ICE have no criminal convictions, and the majority are not classified with a high threat level. An analysis by the Cato Institute further shows that of detainees with convictions, most were for nonviolent offenses like traffic or immigration violations. This data suggests a significant disconnect between the administration's public justification for its mass deportation program and the actual profiles of those being arrested and detained.</p>
