          <h2>Private Forum Between Judges and Climate Activists Raises Ethical Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 14:38:17 EDT</div>

          <p>An exclusive report from Fox News Digital reveals that the Climate Judiciary Project (CJP), an environmental group, hosted a private online forum with judges to discuss climate-related legal topics. Leaked messages show judges and CJP staff sharing information on climate litigation, studies, and events, raising concerns about judicial impartiality. Critics, including Senator Ted Cruz, argue this constitutes "ex parte indoctrination" designed to influence court outcomes, while the CJP maintains it provides neutral, objective scientific information to the judiciary. The forum was made private after its existence was discovered.</p>

          <p>Connie Francis, a prominent pop star of the 1950s and '60s, has died at the age of 87 in a Florida hospital. Known for chart-topping hits such as "Who's Sorry Now?" and "Don't Break the Heart That Loves You," she was a major performer in the pre-Beatles era. Despite her professional success, Francis's personal life was marked by significant tragedy and heartbreak, including a violent assault in 1974 and the murder of her brother. Her 1960s song "Pretty Little Baby" recently found new fame on social media.</p>

          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer announced they will sell their popular blood-thinning medication, Eliquis, directly to patients at a 40% discount from its list price. This move allows the pharmaceutical giants to bypass pharmacy benefit managers, potentially mitigating pricing pressures from the government. Analysts do not expect this to negatively impact the companies' net pricing, as the drug is already heavily rebated. The decision is also seen as a strategic effort to build goodwill with the Trump administration amid threats of drug pricing reform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic legislators have introduced the Price Gouging Prevention Act of 2025, aiming to make excessive price hikes by large corporations illegal. The bill grants the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general new powers to litigate abuses, particularly in response to market shocks like President Trump's tariff policies. Companies with over $100 million in revenue would face increased disclosure requirements for price changes. The proposal comes as inflation shows signs of resurgence and companies cite tariffs as a reason for expected price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Government's Plan to Lower Voting Age to 16 Sparks Political Debate</h2>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to lower the voting age to 16 for all elections, a move ministers say will boost democratic engagement among young people. The proposal has drawn criticism from opponents who claim it is a political maneuver to benefit the Labour Party, which polls show is more popular with younger voters. However, polling data for 16 and 17-year-olds is scarce, and their small share of the electorate means the overall impact on election results would likely be minimal. The debate highlights the fracturing political landscape, with various parties vying for the youth vote.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has suspended longtime MP Diane Abbott pending an investigation into comments she made about racism. In a BBC interview, Abbott reiterated controversial views she had previously expressed, suggesting that racism experienced by Jewish and Traveller people is different from that faced by Black people because it is not based on skin color. The party, which had previously suspended her for similar remarks, acted swiftly to remove the whip. The incident reopens internal debates within Labour about antisemitism and the definition of racism, creating significant political fallout.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey from the National Association of Home Builders shows that homebuilders are cutting prices at the highest rate in three years due to weakening buyer demand and economic concerns. In July, 38% of builders reported reducing prices, with an average reduction of 5%, as elevated interest rates and affordability challenges persist. Despite a slight uptick in overall builder confidence, sentiment remains negative for the 15th consecutive month. The data indicates that the housing sector continues to struggle, with builders resorting to price cuts to attract buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin judge has ordered the conditional release of Morgan Geyser, one of two girls involved in the 2014 "Slender Man" stabbing. Geyser, now 22, has spent seven years in a psychiatric hospital after she and a friend stabbed a classmate 19 times to appease a fictional internet character. Geyser, who was diagnosed with early-onset schizophrenia, pleaded guilty but was found not responsible due to mental illness. Her release comes after experts testified she has made significant progress and no longer presents a risk, though prosecutors raised concerns about recent behavior.</p>

Grynbaum examines how the media landscape's shift toward social media and influencers, combined with the company's lavish spending, led to its decline from a position of cultural dominance to its current attenuated state.</p>

          <p>A CNBC analysis of prices at a Walmart store reveals that some items, including kitchenware, apparel, and a car seat, have seen price increases following the implementation of President Trump's tariffs. Many of the affected products are manufactured in China and other countries facing new duties. While Walmart stated that price fluctuations are normal, the company had previously warned that the magnitude of the tariffs was too large to absorb entirely. The findings offer a real-world glimpse into how the administration's trade policies are beginning to impact consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Maine State Police have arrested a 17-year-old male in connection with the killing of 48-year-old Sunshine "Sunny" Stewart. Stewart's body was discovered on July 3 in a pond where she had been paddleboarding alone; an autopsy revealed she died from strangulation and blunt force trauma. The arrest was made without incident, and the juvenile suspect has been taken to a youth detention center. The killing had shocked the small coastal community of Union, which residents described as a safe area where such violent crime is unheard of, bringing a sense of unease.</p>
