        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has requested the Supreme Court expedite an appeal to reverse lower court rulings that declared most of his tariffs illegal. This move comes after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found Trump overstepped his authority in implementing broad levies, challenging a key aspect of his trade agenda. The administration argues delaying a decision until mid-2026 could lead to significant disruption from unwinding up to $1 trillion in collected tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent asserted that the appeals court's decision undermines the President's ability to conduct diplomacy and protect national security and the economy.</p>

          <p>China has initiated an aviation management training program for eight Southeast Asian nations in Beijing, aiming to promote its domestically produced civilian aircraft, including the C919. The 14-day workshop covers critical areas like safety, airworthiness, and green development, as China seeks to expand its presence in a region increasingly accepting its aircraft deliveries. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to challenge the long-standing duopoly of Airbus and Boeing in the global large jet market. Experts note this aligns with growing economic cooperation between China and Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, often compared to Instagram, saw its valuation climb 19% to $31 billion in three months, according to recent transactions by a GSR Ventures Management fund. This surge reflects robust investor interest, particularly as the company emerges as a potential competitor to TikTok, which faces regulatory challenges in the U.S. The increased confidence follows China's pledge to support private firms, revitalizing the country's startup ecosystem. Xiaohongshu constituted a significant portion of GSR's fund assets, highlighting its importance to the firm's portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Republican Senator John E. Sununu is actively exploring a return to the Senate, eyeing the open New Hampshire seat in the 2026 midterm elections. With Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen not seeking re-election, Republicans view Sununu, from an influential political family, as a strong candidate for a state that has been challenging for GOP Senate hopefuls. Sununu plans to travel the state and make a decision by the end of next month, emphasizing his desire to appeal broadly across the political spectrum. His potential candidacy sets up a competitive primary against other Republican contenders.</p>

          <p>A controversial bill that would allow Texas residents to sue out-of-state providers of abortion-inducing drugs has reached Governor Greg Abbott's desk, potentially making Texas the first state to target this common abortion method. Supporters argue it enforces the state's abortion ban and protects women and fetuses, while opponents view it as an attempt to intimidate providers and encourage vigilantism. The measure, which allows lawsuits for up to $100,000 against those who manufacture, transport, or provide the pills to Texans, is expected to face significant legal challenges if signed into law. This initiative builds on a 2021 Texas law that empowered citizens to enforce abortion bans.</p>

          <p>Chinese smart electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, including Nio and Xpeng, must significantly increase deliveries in the coming quarters to achieve their 2025 break-even goals amid an intense discount war in the world's largest vehicle market. Despite reporting narrowed losses in the second quarter, companies like Nio aim to double monthly deliveries to 50,000 EVs to stay competitive and attract investors. Analysts warn that sustained heavy losses could threaten some Chinese EV builders, making robust sales performance critical for survival in this highly competitive industry. The market's overcapacity concerns also make it difficult to raise fresh funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Epstein's survivors gathered on Capitol Hill, bringing authentic and emotional accounts of their abuse, shifting the focus of the ongoing scandal from politics to the human cost. Their collective presence and demands for the release of all Epstein files have created a startling political spectacle, uniting figures like Marjorie Taylor Greene with Democrats. This renewed public pressure underscores President Trump's vulnerability, given his past association with Epstein and his wavering stance on releasing the files. The event served as a powerful reminder of the moral imperative for justice at the heart of the saga.</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade, marking the 80th anniversary of World War Two's end, served as a powerful display of its growing global power and a potential alternative to the American-backed world order. This spectacle, observed by President Trump, underscored the geopolitical ramifications of his "America First" trade policies, which have strained traditional alliances and fostered new international alignments. The article suggests that Trump's sweeping tariffs, aimed at protecting U.S. industry, carry a diplomatic price, potentially pushing nations like China, Russia, and India closer together. Legal challenges to Trump's tariffs also raise questions about the long-term viability of his high-risk strategy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has significantly expanded the U.S. military's role in crime fighting, notably with an air strike in the Caribbean against alleged "narco-terrorists," traditionally a law enforcement task. This move, which targeted a vessel linked to the Tren de Aragua gang, represents a departure from the historical vision of the armed forces primarily defending against external threats. Critics argue the administration's use of terrorist designations for criminal gangs and military action without congressional notification sets a problematic precedent. Legal challenges are emerging, questioning the constitutional authority for such deployments and the implications for civil liberties.</p>

          <p>Leaked messages reveal a contradiction in Elon Musk's stance on Tesla's self-driving technology, with the CEO reportedly admitting in 2021 that high-resolution radar would be safer than a camera-only system, despite Tesla later removing radars from its vehicles. This disclosure raises concerns about Musk's motives, suggesting a prioritization of cost-benefit over maximum safety, and potentially eroding consumer trust in Tesla's autonomous driving claims. Critics argue that relying solely on cameras might compromise "superhuman levels of safety" that multi-sensor approaches offer.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's use of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants, ruling there was "no invasion or predatory incursion" to justify its application. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the argument that "mass illegal migration" constituted an incursion, asserting that an armed, organized force was not present. This decision marks a significant legal victory for civil liberties advocates, who argued that migrants were denied due process and that the U.S. was misusing a wartime statute during peacetime. The ruling underscores the judiciary's role in scrutinizing executive power in immigration matters.</p>

One entrepreneur, for example, cultivated a $500,000-a-year online persona while spending significantly less, using day passes and hotel tips for photo opportunities to attract brand partnerships. Property managers observe that Gen Z housing applicants frequently show high debt-to-income ratios and personal loans for "vacation funding."

While the Treasury noted existing taxes on the wealthy, the TUC argues that more progressive taxation is needed.
