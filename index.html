          <p>Seven men in Rochdale have been convicted of sexually exploiting two teenage girls over a five-year period, between 2001 and 2006. The victims, known as Girl A and Girl B, were groomed from the age of 13 and treated as "sex slaves," being plied with drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes. One victim reported being targeted by over 200 men, while the other stated social workers dismissed her as a prostitute from a young age. The abusers, some of whom worked on the town's market or as taxi drivers, provided the girls with places to stay and gifts in exchange for sexual activity, highlighting a disturbing pattern of exploitation and neglect by authorities. 0</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was wrongly deported and subsequently returned to the United States, faces arraignment in Nashville on charges of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia conspired with others between 2016 and 2025 to bring migrants from Latin American countries into the U.S., devising cover stories to mislead law enforcement. His lawyers accuse the Trump administration of abusing its power and engaging in "delay and secrecy" in his return, while prosecutors maintain he is a member of the MS-13 gang and a flight risk. The case has drawn significant attention due to the circumstances surrounding his deportation and return. 25</p>

          <p>Israel launched strikes across Iran, targeting the "heart" of Iran's nuclear program and resulting in the deaths of senior military figures, nuclear scientists, and civilians. The Israeli military stated that Iran launched approximately 100 drones towards Israel, which they intercepted, prompting a state of emergency in Israel. The global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported no increase in radiation levels at the Natanz plant, urging maximum restraint from all parties.

          <p>Authorities are investigating an Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, India, which occurred shortly after takeoff, killing 241 of the 242 passengers and crew on board, as well as several people on the ground. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed into a residential area, including a medical college, just minutes after departing for London Gatwick Airport. One passenger, Vishwashkumar Ramesh, survived the crash and is being treated at a local hospital, while investigation teams have recovered at least one of the plane's "black boxes." Aviation experts are examining the flight data and cockpit voice recorders to determine the cause of the crash, which is considered India's worst aviation disaster in over two decades. 10</p>

Governor Newsom expressed his intention to redeploy the National Guard to their previous duties, but the appeals court's decision allows the Trump administration to maintain control for now. 40</p>

          <p>Global stock markets experienced a downturn and oil prices surged following Israel's military strike on Iran, raising concerns about escalating tensions in the Middle East. S&P 500 futures contracts fell by 1.1%, and U.S. benchmark crude oil jumped by 7.3% to $72.91 per barrel. Analysts suggest that any hopes for lower oil prices this year are dashed, as the attacks could impact the global economy through higher energy costs. Despite no direct impact on oil production facilities, the risk of Iran blocking the Strait of Hormuz remains a key concern for global energy markets. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite heightened tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. The Strait of Hormuz sees roughly 20 million barrels per day of oil and oil products pass through, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments. Experts argue that impeding oil passage would bring "no net benefit" to Iran, potentially triggering further retaliation and drawing backlash from its largest oil customer, China. While Iran has threatened to close the strait in the past, analysts suggest that a full-scale disruption of global oil flows is both unlikely and possibly physically impossible. 55</p>

The move follows a Supreme Court ruling allowing DHS to order CHNV participants to leave the country, even while they challenge the revocation. Immigrants who agree to "self-deport" via the DHS Home Mobile App will receive travel assistance and a $1,000 bonus upon arrival in their home country. This action comes after the administration revoked protected status for nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants, drawing criticism for the administration's stance on immigration. 10</p>

          <p>Summer Fridays, once a highly desired perk, are becoming increasingly rare as more companies adopt hybrid work schedules, allowing employees to work from home on Fridays. While employees still value summer-specific benefits like summer Fridays, summer hours, and flextime, most workers are not offered any such perks. A survey by job site Monster reveals that 84% of workers do not receive summer-specific benefits, despite 55% believing these benefits improve productivity. As more commuters settle into flexible working arrangements, fewer workers are making Friday trips, shifting traffic patterns away from the end of the week. 60</p>

          <p>President Trump's planned military parade on the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army is contrasted with George Washington's approach to public celebrations. Washington resisted attempts to turn events into military displays, prioritizing the values of a constitutional republic based on the will of the people. The current president's eagerness for a display of military might is seen as a warning by those concerned about basic rights.

          <p>The traditional "religious right" is being replaced by a new movement that is fundamentally different and opposed to traditional religion, according to the article. This new religious right, aligned with the MAGA movement, prioritizes American nationalism over religious doctrine, bending the church to the will of the state. This shift is evident in the composition and mission of Trump's Religious Liberty Commission, which excludes mainline Protestants and focuses on reshaping American society in unprecedented ways. The movement's focus is on reshaping society in the here and now, with little emphasis on the afterlife, and it is impervious to shame or theological arguments. 30</p>

This contrasts with the Dodgers' strategy of acquiring established stars for high costs. The Angels' approach, however, has not yet translated into winning seasons, and the team's success hinges on the performance of their top draft picks. 50</p>

Both sides have much to gain from stabilizing the relationship, particularly in a volatile world, with strong trade and people-to-people ties already in place.
