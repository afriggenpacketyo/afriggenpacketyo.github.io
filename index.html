          <p>Financial markets across the Asia-Pacific region displayed a mixed performance as investors processed the results of the recent U.S.-Russia summit, which concluded without a ceasefire agreement for Ukraine. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw gains, while South Korea's Kospi experienced a decline, reflecting investor caution. This market activity occurred as U.S. equity futures ticked upward, influenced by hopes for potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which had previously fueled a positive week on Wall Street.

          <p>A U.S. special envoy has claimed that a significant concession was made during the recent summit between the American and Russian presidents. According to envoy Steve Witkoff, Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense principle. This development is being described as potentially "game-changing," as it could address Ukraine's security needs while navigating Russia's long-standing opposition to formal NATO membership for the country.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel engaged in a nationwide strike, blocking major highways and closing some businesses to demand a ceasefire deal with Hamas and the release of hostages from Gaza. The demonstrations reflect escalating public frustration after 22 months of war and concern that a new military offensive could endanger the remaining hostages.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, was downgraded to a Category 3 storm but is forecast to restrengthen as it moves over the ocean. The storm's center is currently north of the Caribbean, and while it is not projected to make a direct impact on the U.S. East Coast, its large size is generating life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast. Forecasters have advised the Bahamas, Bermuda, and North Carolina's Outer Banks to monitor its progress closely.</p>

MacIntyre described his performance as a "horrific start" and struggled to explain why his shots were traveling much farther than expected. He ultimately finished as the runner-up to Scottie Scheffler, who clinched the title with a dramatic chip-in on the 17th hole, leaving MacIntyre admittedly wanting to "smash up my golf clubs."</p>

          <p>A new analysis from JPMorgan Chase indicates a significant trend in how Americans are managing their money, with a notable shift away from traditional checking and savings accounts. Instead, households are moving funds into higher-yield options such as money market funds, certificates of deposit (CDs), and brokerage accounts, leading to an overall growth in total cash reserves. This strategic move to secure better returns, especially among lower-income families, may be a key factor in sustaining consumer spending despite inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued an expanded restraining order against former congressman Beto O'Rourke and his political action group, Powered by People. The order prohibits the organization from transferring funds out of Texas, specifically those raised to support Democratic state lawmakers who left the state to block a legislative session on redistricting. The ruling, sought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, claims the fundraising constitutes deceptive trade practices and could cause "irreparable injury" to the state.</p>

          <p>An early goalkeeping mistake by Altay Bayindir was the decisive moment in Manchester United's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford. The decision by manager Ruben Amorim to start Bayindir over the fit-again Andre Onana proved costly when Bayindir failed to properly handle a corner kick, leading directly to Arsenal's goal. Despite an improved attacking effort, United could not find an equalizer, placing the club's goalkeeping situation under renewed scrutiny at the start of the season.</p>
