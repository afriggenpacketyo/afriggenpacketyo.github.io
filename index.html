          <p>The article discusses the potential monthly income one could receive from a $400,000 fixed annuity purchased at age 65, noting that payments can range from approximately $2,246 to $2,590 depending on gender and payout options. Higher interest rates create a favorable environment for annuity buyers, potentially maximizing lifetime income. The article emphasizes that annuities offer guaranteed monthly income, providing financial security, but also come with trade-offs such as illiquidity and giving up potential for higher investment returns. Careful consideration of retirement strategy, health status, and liquidity needs is crucial before deciding to invest in an annuity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article reports on the aftermath of the shootings of Minnesota lawmakers, which has led to increased security concerns among members of Congress. Following the shootings, both the House and Senate are holding briefings on member security, with discussions focusing on allowing members more flexibility in using office funds for security measures. Some lawmakers are advocating for scrubbing personal information from the web and approving anti-doxxing legislation, while others are considering a "Secret Session" to debate security approaches. The key challenge is reaching a consensus on the appropriate security measures and ensuring the U.S. Capitol Police have adequate resources to protect members and their families. </p>

          <p>The State Department has elevated its travel advisory for Israel to Level 4, advising U.S. citizens against traveling to the country due to ongoing armed conflict, terrorism, and civil unrest.

          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey reveals that the ethnicity of individuals involved in grooming gangs has been inadequately recorded by authorities. The report indicates that ethnicity data is missing for two-thirds of perpetrators, hindering accurate assessment at a national level. However, data from three police forces suggests a disproportionate number of suspects from Asian ethnic backgrounds in group-based child sexual exploitation cases. The report criticizes the authorities' failure to understand the nature and scale of the problem, attributing this to ignorance and a fear of being perceived as racist, leading to a national inquiry into grooming gangs.</p>

          <p>The suspect in the Minnesota lawmaker killings, Vance Luther Boelter, also visited the homes of two other legislators on the same night, according to authorities. Boelter, who is charged with the murder of Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband and the attempted murder of Senator John Hoffman and his wife, had planned to attack multiple lawmakers. Boelter was found to have researched his victims and their families, stalking their homes and taking notes. The motive remains unclear, but the writings found in his vehicle suggest a wide range of potential targets, including prominent officials and abortion rights advocates.</p>

          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, Israel is targeting Iran's vital energy infrastructure, including oil storage sites and gas fields, to impact Iran's economy. Israeli attacks have forced Tehran to partially suspend production at the South Pars gas field, raising concerns about energy production and supply. Iran is a major player in the global energy sector, holding the world's second-largest natural gas reserves and third-largest crude oil reserves. Sanctions and mismanagement have already crippled Iran's economy, and further attacks on its energy facilities could trigger a spike in global oil and gas prices.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is likely to maintain current interest rates, which will have varying impacts on different aspects of personal finance.

Federal student loan rates are set annually and will see a slight decrease for loans made after July 1, though many borrowers face fewer federal loan forgiveness options. (not investment advice)</p>

There is a call for tightening the law to ensure adults who have sexual relations with a child under 16 are always charged with sexual assault.
