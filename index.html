          <p>Newcastle United is preparing for a highly anticipated Premier League match against Liverpool, a fixture made more intense by the ongoing transfer saga surrounding striker Alexander Isak, who has indicated a wish to join Liverpool. This situation is further complicated by Newcastle's recent inability to secure other key transfer targets, leaving them scrambling for new forwards. Coach Eddie Howe emphasizes the need for his team to remain focused and harness the passionate home crowd's energy, recognizing the game's significance beyond just league points. The encounter is viewed as a crucial early-season test, set against a backdrop of strategic transfer implications and a history of intense rivalry, making it a pivotal moment for both clubs' aspirations.</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a lower-than-expected 0.6% in July, reaching its lowest point since January 2021, as the city-state prepares for slower economic growth later this year. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, also dipped to 0.5%. The Monetary Authority of Singapore attributed this moderation to decreases in retail, other goods, and utility prices, while private transport costs saw a slight increase. The central bank expects inflation to remain moderate, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes. This development follows two monetary policy easings this year, aimed at mitigating the impact of a weaker global trade environment on Singapore's economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized the Senate's "blue slip" tradition, labeling it unconstitutional and asserting it unfairly grants Democrats veto power over his judicial and U.S. Attorney nominations. He expressed significant frustration with the slowed confirmation rate in his current term compared to his first, urging Senator Chuck Grassley to abandon the century-old custom and "tell the Democrats... to go to HELL!" Grassley, a Republican, has defended the practice as important for state input and institutional balance. This ongoing political dispute underscores the deep partisan divisions surrounding federal appointments and the executive branch's efforts to shape the judiciary, with Trump's aggressive rhetoric escalating the confrontation.</p>

          <p>Some National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C. have begun carrying service weapons, marking an escalation in President Trump's federal intervention into the city's policing. This directive from the Defense Secretary reverses earlier guidance for troops to be unarmed, indicating a potential shift in their operational scope. While the Guard's presence has primarily focused on protecting landmarks and crowd control without reports of direct threats, the move aligns with President Trump's broader crackdown on what he calls an "epidemic of crime." However, local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, contend that violent crime rates have been declining, making the armed deployment unnecessary and an "authoritarian push."</p>

          <p>Global labor markets are undergoing a significant transformation, moving from the "Great Resignation" to a "Great Stay," where employees are less likely to leave their current positions. This trend is accompanied by a "no-hire, no-fire" approach from employers, who are postponing hiring decisions due to economic uncertainty rather than actively reducing headcount. While U.S. nonfarm payroll growth has slowed, initial jobless claims remain near historical lows, reflecting companies' reluctance to dismiss workers they struggled to re-employ post-pandemic. This shift is evident in both the U.S. and the U.K., as businesses await greater economic confidence to resume robust hiring.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic secured a battling first-round victory at the US Open, defeating American teenager Learner Tien 6-1, 7-6 (3), 6-2, despite experiencing significant physical struggles. Returning after a six-week hiatus, the 38-year-old Serb looked visibly fatigued and flustered during the second set, needing treatment for blisters. Djokovic attributed his discomfort to a lack of match practice rather than injury, emphasizing his focused schedule on Grand Slam tournaments at this stage of his career. This win marks his 75th consecutive first-round Grand Slam victory, showcasing his enduring drive and strategic approach to managing the physical demands of elite tennis.</p>

          <p>India fears a planned Chinese mega-dam on the Yarlung Zangbo river, known as the Brahmaputra in India, could drastically reduce water flows by up to 85% during dry seasons, affecting over 100 million people downstream. This concern has prompted India to fast-track its own Upper Siang Multipurpose Storage Dam project, despite local resistance, to mitigate potential impacts and prevent China from weaponizing water. The Chinese dam, costing nearly $170 billion, broke ground in July, significantly raising geopolitical tensions between the two strategic rivals. China asserts its hydropower projects are scientifically researched and will not adversely impact downstream nations, but India remains cautious and is implementing safeguard measures.</p>

          <p>Hopes are fading for Natalia Nagovitsyna, an experienced mountaineer who has been stranded on Kyrgyzstan's Jengish Chokusu, an icy mountain, for 12 days after breaking her leg. Rescue efforts have been terminated due to severe weather conditions, which also claimed the life of another climber attempting to save her. Nagovitsyna was last spotted alive by a surveillance drone on August 19, but deteriorating weather, including heavy snowfall, led to the suspension of the search. Victory Peak, at over 24,400 feet, is known for its extreme conditions and is considered one of the world's most difficult mountains to climb.</p>

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency due to the state's infant mortality rate rising to 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, nearly double the national average and its highest in over a decade. Disparities are stark, with Black infants more than twice as likely to die before their first birthday. The declaration aims to expand prenatal services, create regional obstetric care systems, and strengthen community health worker programs. Experts emphasize that structural inequities, poverty, and lack of continuous healthcare access are key drivers, not solely individual behavior. Federal funding cuts to vital maternal and infant health programs further complicate the state's ability to address this tragic public health crisis.</p>

          <p>France has formally summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner after he sent a letter to President Emmanuel Macron, alleging France was not doing enough to combat antisemitism. The French foreign ministry deemed these allegations "unacceptable," asserting they violate international law and constitute interference in internal affairs. France firmly rejects the claims, stating its authorities are fully mobilized against a rise in antisemitic acts since the October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas, which it considers "intolerable." This diplomatic discord highlights underlying tensions between the allies, following Macron's recent rejection of similar accusations from Israel's Prime Minister and broader disagreements on international issues.</p>

          <p>Chinese property giant Evergrande has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a grim milestone after its spectacular collapse under immense debt. Once China's largest real estate firm with a $50 billion valuation, its founder Hui Ka Yan was fined and banned for overstating revenue, and liquidators are now seeking to recover assets. The company's troubles, stemming from new government rules on developer borrowing, led to its default in 2021 and a liquidation order in January 2024. Evergrande's downfall has severely impacted the Chinese economy, causing massive layoffs, reduced household savings, and suppressed consumer spending, with experts predicting a prolonged recovery for the property sector.
