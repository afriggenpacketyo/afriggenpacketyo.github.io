          <p>Google has entered into an agreement with Elementl Power to fund the development of three new nuclear sites, each capable of generating at least 600 megawatts of power. This move reflects Google's commitment to securing reliable, 24/7 baseload energy for its data centers, particularly in light of the increasing energy demands of artificial intelligence. Elementl Power, a nuclear power project developer founded in 2022, will use Google's early-stage capital for site permitting, interconnection rights, and contract negotiations, aiming to add 10 gigawatts of nuclear capacity to the grid by 2035. This partnership underscores the growing trend of tech companies collaborating with the nuclear industry to meet their substantial energy needs.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate the Energy Star program, a 33-year-old initiative that certifies energy-efficient appliances. This proposal, announced at an EPA meeting, aims to cut costs for manufacturers and energy providers, but critics argue it would increase energy costs for consumers and harm the environment. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse condemned the move as a giveaway to polluters, while the EPA maintains it is reorganizing to better advance its core mission. The Energy Star program helps prevent 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from entering the atmosphere.</p>
