          <p>Terence Stamp, the acclaimed English actor renowned for his role as General Zod in the original "Superman" films, has passed away at the age of 87. With a career spanning six decades, Stamp earned an Oscar nomination for his debut in "Billy Budd" and became a prominent figure of 1960s cinema, also starring in films like "The Collector" and "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert." His family and former co-stars have paid tribute to his extraordinary body of work and talent.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, was downgraded to a Category 3 storm but is forecast to strengthen again as it moves north of the Caribbean. While not expected to make a direct impact on the U.S. East Coast, its large size poses a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast coast. The storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," a process that can cause temporary weakening before it potentially emerges even stronger. Officials in the Bahamas, Bermuda, and North Carolina's Outer Banks are closely monitoring its progress as it remains a dangerous major hurricane.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a restraining order preventing former congressman Beto O'Rourke's organization, Powered by People, from transferring funds to Democratic state lawmakers who left Texas to block a Republican-led redistricting session. The judge ruled that the group's fundraising constituted deceptive acts, causing imminent and irreparable harm to the state. This legal action, initiated by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, aims to halt financial support for the legislators who had relocated to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass the controversial redistricting measure. The order also freezes the group's funds held by financial institutions like ActBlue.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old boy from La Puente was fatally shot at a house party in Covina on Saturday night, according to local police. Officers responded to reports of gunfire and found a large crowd, later learning the victim had been transported to a hospital by other partygoers where he succumbed to his injuries. No other injuries were reported from the incident. As of Sunday, no arrests have been made, and the Covina Police Department is actively investigating the circumstances that led to the shooting. Authorities have not confirmed reports that the gathering was a "back-to-school" party.</p>

          <p>Manchester United suffered a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal in their Premier League opener, with a critical error from goalkeeper Altay Bayindir leading to the decisive goal. The Turkish keeper failed to handle a corner, allowing Riccardo Calafiori to score for Arsenal in the 13th minute, a mistake that has renewed debate about United's goalkeeping situation. Despite a more threatening attack following a £200m summer investment in forwards, United could not find an equalizer. Manager Ruben Amorim defended his selection of Bayindir over the recently injured Andre Onana, but the focus remains on the team's vulnerability in goal.</p>

          <p>Iraqi authorities have started the excavation of a large sinkhole south of Mosul, believed to be a mass grave containing the remains of thousands of people killed by the Islamic State group a decade ago. The operation, a collaboration between multiple Iraqi agencies, is currently focused on collecting surface evidence and preparing for a full exhumation, which will require international support due to site hazards. Officials are building a DNA database from families of the missing to aid in identification. The site, known as al-Khafsa, is considered one of the largest mass graves in modern Iraqi history.</p>

          <p>Businesses in Florida's beach cities are reporting a significant downturn, with some experiencing a 30% drop in revenue this summer despite official tourism numbers remaining strong. This discrepancy is attributed to economic pressures on American consumers, who are reportedly spending less on travel-related items like lodging and airfare due to inflation and a gloomy economic outlook. The trend suggests that while people are still traveling, their budgets are tighter, leading to reduced spending at local establishments and creating a "ghost town" feeling in some areas.

          <p>As the U.S. reportedly plans to press Ukraine to surrender the Donbas region for peace, Ukrainians view the prospect as a profound betrayal and a strategic disaster. The regions of Donetsk and Luhansk are rich in resources and have been defended at the cost of tens of thousands of lives, with a significant portion of Donetsk still under Ukrainian control. For many Ukrainians, handing over this territory feels like abandoning their fellow citizens and rewarding aggression, with little faith that Russia would honor such a deal.

          <p>Firefighters across Spain are struggling to contain numerous wildfires as the country endures a prolonged and intense heatwave with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104 F). At least three fatalities have been reported, with thousands of residents evacuated and vast areas of forest destroyed. The government has deployed military emergency units to support firefighting efforts in the worst-affected regions, including Galicia, Castile and Leon, and Extremadura. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has acknowledged the crisis, linking it to the climate emergency and pledging government assistance for victims of the devastating blazes.</p>

          <h2>Trump Aligns with Putin, Pivoting from Ceasefire to Full Peace Agreement for Ukraine</h2>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump has shifted his public stance on resolving the Ukraine war, now advocating for direct negotiations on a comprehensive peace agreement rather than an immediate ceasefire. This new position aligns with Russia's long-held preference and contrasts with the approach favored by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who argues a ceasefire is a necessary first step to de-escalate and enable diplomacy. Ukraine fears that negotiating without a halt in fighting allows Russia to prolong the conflict while continuing its military assaults. This diplomatic pivot sets a tense backdrop for upcoming meetings between Trump and Zelensky.</p>

          <h2>Draft of U.S. Government Health Report May Not Recommend Strict Limits on Pesticides</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 12:07:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A draft of an upcoming "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) report does not recommend severe restrictions on pesticides or ultra-processed foods, a potential setback for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The document, obtained by ABC News, instead calls for more targeted pesticide applications and research rather than elimination. This language suggests a victory for agriculture industry lobbyists who pushed against stricter regulations. The report is the second from the Trump administration's initiative to improve children's health, following an earlier one that linked chemical food additives to developmental disorders and cancer.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio asserted that a peaceful resolution to the war in Ukraine will require concessions from both sides. In a series of Sunday interviews following the Trump-Putin summit, Rubio emphasized that a peace agreement is impossible unless both parties are willing to compromise, stating that anything else would amount to surrender, which neither side is prepared to do. While he indicated that the Alaska talks identified potential areas of agreement, significant disagreements remain. This framing of the negotiations suggests the U.S. is preparing to broker a deal that may not fully satisfy all of Ukraine's initial demands.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump responded with a series of angry social media posts on Sunday following media reports that characterized his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin as unproductive. After coming away from the Alaska meeting with no concrete deal or ceasefire, Trump accused the "Fake News" of distorting the truth and claimed he had a "great meeting" about the war. He lashed out at the coverage, suggesting that even a perfect deal would be reported negatively by his political opponents and the media. The reaction highlights the pressure on the president after positioning himself as a master dealmaker.</p>

          <h2>Malnourished Woman from Gaza Dies in Italian Hospital After Medical Evacuation</h2>

          <p>A 20-year-old Gazan woman, who was evacuated to Italy for medical treatment due to severe emaciation, has died in a hospital in Pisa. She was flown to Italy as part of a program for patients with serious conditions from the conflict zone but suffered a cardiac arrest less than 48 hours after her arrival. The hospital described her condition as a "very complex clinical picture" with severe weight and muscle loss. This event occurs as the UN continues to warn of widespread malnutrition and a potential famine in Gaza, a claim Israel denies while facilitating some medical transfers.</p>
