          <p>Eleven adult men escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans, prompting a full-scale search operation involving local, state, and federal law enforcement. One inmate, Kendall Myles, was quickly apprehended in the French Quarter, but ten remain at large, including Gary Price, who was charged with attempted first-degree murder. Authorities believe the inmates likely had assistance and have changed clothes, urging the public to remain vigilant but avoid panic. The sheriff's department has launched a full investigation into the escape to review facility protocols and staff performance. </p>

          <p>The Justice Department and Boeing are reportedly nearing a deal that would allow the aerospace giant to avoid pleading guilty or facing trial in a criminal case related to the two deadly 737 Max crashes. Boeing had previously agreed to plead guilty after the Biden administration determined the company violated a 2021 agreement, but a judge rejected the plea deal due to diversity, equity, and inclusion concerns. The fraud charge stems from allegations that Boeing misled regulators about a flight-control system implicated in the crashes.</p>

          <p>Gold prices are experiencing a pullback after a period of steady gains, presenting potential investment opportunities for those with a longer-term view.

Investors may consider physical gold bullion, gold ETFs, or gold mining stocks to capitalize on the lower prices, while keeping in mind that timing the market perfectly is nearly impossible.

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill faced a setback as conservatives blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee, citing concerns that the legislation did not sufficiently cut federal spending. Five Republicans voted against advancing the bill, demanding quicker implementation of work requirements for Medicaid recipients. House Speaker Mike Johnson remains committed to putting the legislation on the floor before Memorial Day, despite disagreements within his party. The bill aims to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term, increase military spending, and cut Medicaid and clean energy subsidies.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are considering abandoning a deal in which Boeing would plead guilty to a felony charge related to the 737 Max crashes. Justice Department officials informed families of the victims that they are considering a non-prosecution agreement instead. Under this agreement, Boeing would pay about $445 million to a crash victims’ fund, invest in compliance and safety, and be overseen by an independent consultant. The victims’ families are objecting to this potential agreement, arguing it would allow Boeing to avoid full accountability.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that “a lot of people are starving” in the Gaza Strip, acknowledging the humanitarian crisis under the Israeli blockade. This marks a potential shift from his administration's previous silence on Israel’s conduct in the war. Trump indicated the U.S. would address the situation, spurred by Gulf Arab leaders who met with him during his recent trip to the Middle East. Despite his long-standing relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump expressed a more sympathetic tone on Gaza and suggested the U.S. must take action.</p>

While some call for tougher crime crackdowns, others suggest deregulation to enhance crypto anonymity. The rise in cryptocurrency values has created a new class of wealthy investors, making them potential targets for criminals who believe crypto is easier to launder than traditional cash.</p>

          <p>Home electricity bills are expected to rise to an average of $784 this summer, marking a 12-year high, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). This increase is driven by rising electricity prices and high temperatures, which will force households to consume more energy to stay cool. Low-income families, who already spend a larger portion of their income on energy, may struggle to afford cooling, posing serious health risks. Only 26 states offer summer cooling assistance to help Americans pay their bills.</p>
