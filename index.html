          <p>A sperm donor in Europe, used in at least 67 pregnancies, carried a rare cancer-causing mutation, leading to cancer diagnoses in 10 children. The mutation, affecting the TP53 gene and causing Li-Fraumeni syndrome, went undetected during standard screening in 2008. The European Sperm Bank acknowledged the case and confirmed the variant's presence, expressing concern and advocating for internationally binding family limits. Genetic counseling is recommended for children born from this donor, and the European Sperm Bank is calling for continued dialogue regarding setting an internationally binding family limit, which they have advocated for on several occasions, also at EU level.</p>

          <p>Memory cafes are providing camaraderie and support for people with dementia and their caregivers, offering a space for socializing and activities. These cafes, which are relatively inexpensive to run, offer a sense of community and help combat social isolation, with over 600 operating across the country. The cafes benefit both patients and caregivers by easing stress and improving quality of life, and they are becoming increasingly important as cases of memory loss rise. As the population ages, the number of available family caregivers is decreasing, making memory cafes a vital resource for those affected by dementia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta plans to automate up to 90% of privacy and integrity risk assessments for new features on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, replacing human evaluators with AI. This shift aims to expedite product development, but some fear it could lead to overlooking potential real-world harm caused by Meta's apps. While Meta claims human expertise will still be used for complex issues, critics worry that engineers may lack the necessary privacy expertise. Internal documents suggest that the European Union could be somewhat insulated from these changes due to stricter regulations, as the changes reflect a new emphasis at Meta in favor of more unrestrained speech and more rapidly updating its apps.</p>

          <p>Legal experts are raising concerns about the legality of President Trump's agreements with law firms, which involve providing pro bono services in exchange for favorable treatment. Critics argue these deals, made under coercion, lack a true meeting of the minds and may violate federal bribery statutes. Some firms that settled with the White House have lost clients, while others that challenged Trump's actions have gained business. The State Bar of California has warned that the Trump administration's orders threaten core principles of the rule of law, causing harm to people with limited means who need free legal services.</p>

          <p>An NPR producer and group of friends recreate the reality TV show 'Survivor' every year, spending a weekend competing in challenges and tribal councils. The tradition started during the pandemic and has evolved into a larger event with participants traveling from across the country. Friends not competing serve as producers, and each year two players plan the challenges and twists, acting as "Jeffs" in reference to the show's host. The games involve strategy, alliances, and voting each other off, with the winner earning bragging rights for the year, highlighting the strong friendships and shared love of the show.</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates UK defence spending will reach 3% of GDP by 2034, underpinning the government's upcoming strategic defence review. The review, based on this spending assumption, will outline priorities for military and security spending in the coming years, warning of a "new era of threat" involving drones and artificial intelligence. The plan includes deploying new "digital" experts to protect troops from enemy drones and control unmanned weapons. The government's budget watchdog estimates meeting the 3% target would cost an additional £17.3 billion in 2029-30, demonstrating the financial commitment to defence.</p>

He warned of devastating consequences if China attempts to conquer Taiwan by force, while noting NATO members are pledging to spend 5 percent of their gross domestic product on defense.

          <p>The A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened after 23 years of roadworks and congestion, costing £2bn. The 28-mile improvement is designed to bring prosperity to one of the UK's most deprived areas and cut journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. The upgrade programme was initially drawn up in 1990 and work began in 2002, involving the construction of almost 70 structures and the planting of 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. Despite criticism over the cost and delays, Welsh ministers assert the upgrade will boost the region, though Plaid Cymru has called the funding a "waste of public money."</p>

          <p>The Japanese government's stockpiled rice, released through direct contracts with retailers, has begun appearing on store shelves, attracting consumers with its lower prices. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were the first to start selling the rice, priced at 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, 500 bags sold out in just 30 minutes, and long lines formed at an Iris Ohyama store in Sendai. The government's effort aims to lower soaring rice prices affecting households, with 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 being sold directly to retailers.</p>

          <p>German–Greek relations are facing a crisis due to differing views on refugee policy, with Germany seeking to send asylum seekers back to Greece, which Athens opposes. While both countries agree on stopping irregular immigration, Greece, as an EU external border country, wants more EU support with border protection and a migration agreement with Libya. Germany intends to facilitate the deportation of migrants already registered or recognized in Greece, but the Greek government has expressed resistance to any such requests. Greece has seen a 30% drop in arrivals this year and is hoping for an agreement with Libya to manage migration flows.</p>

          <p>President Trump's ambitious plan to overhaul the global economy through tariffs is facing legal challenges and economic realities that contradict his claims of ease and success. A New York court blocked his signature trade policy, leading to a legal battle likely to reach the Supreme Court. The administration's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs has been questioned, and the sweeping levies have been followed by delays and exemptions. Despite Trump's promises, tariffs have not raised trillions of dollars or created millions of jobs, and the recent legal spats add further confusion to businesses navigating the world economy.</p>

          <p>Firefighters are battling a brush fire that erupted in steep hillside terrain in Pala, prompting evacuation orders in northern San Diego County. The Henderson fire broke out near Henderson Road and Pala Mission Road, charring 183 acres in two hours. Evacuation orders have been issued for surrounding hillside communities where many members of the Pala Band of Mission Indians live, and a temporary evacuation location was set up in the Pala Casino parking lot. The blaze was 5% contained, and road closures are in effect in the area, with weather conditions posing challenges to containment efforts.</p>
