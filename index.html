          <h2>US Treasury Now Accepting Donations via Venmo to Reduce National Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 19:31:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department now allows Americans to make contributions to pay down the national debt using Venmo, a modern addition to its long-standing "Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt" program. This move comes as the national debt surpasses $36 trillion, with fiscal year 2024 seeing a significant gap between federal spending and revenue. While patriotic citizens have donated over $67 million since 1996, this amount covers only a tiny fraction of government spending, highlighting the immense scale of the nation's financial challenge. The article notes the irony of this crowd-sourcing effort against a backdrop of massive government expenditures.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, sentenced to four life terms for the 2022 University of Idaho murders, is expected to be incarcerated at the Idaho Maximum Security Institution (IMSI). The facility is known for housing other infamous inmates, including Chad Daybell and serial killer Thomas Creech, and has a reputation for harsh conditions and violence. Reports from fellow inmates during his pre-sentencing detention described Kohberger as obsessive and temperamental, offering a glimpse into his behavior behind bars. IMSI has faced criticism for its heavy use of solitary confinement and has been the site of recent inmate protests.</p>

          <p>Pitcher Walker Buehler, now with the Boston Red Sox, is preparing to face his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the first time since his departure. The reunion prompted reflections on his seven-year tenure in L.A., which was highlighted by his heroic performance in the 2024 World Series but also marked by injuries. Buehler expressed gratitude for his time with the Dodgers and the fan reception but noted the business realities that led to his free agency and signing with Boston. He received his World Series ring before the game, a moment of nostalgia before competing against his old teammates.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals judge has maintained a nationwide injunction, blocking former President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented or temporary residents. The judge, Leo Sorokin, ruled that the order is unconstitutional, asserting that while the Supreme Court will likely have the final say, the injunction stands for now. This decision is the latest in a series of judicial setbacks for the administration's policy, with other federal courts also ruling against the executive order. The legal challenges argue that the order violates the 14th Amendment and threatens state funding for essential services.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after "Big Brother" first aired, a new perspective on reality television suggests it may have positive societal impacts beyond simple entertainment. While often criticized, some psychologists and sociologists argue the genre can foster social understanding by exposing viewers to diverse demographics and unfiltered human emotions. The article points to examples where reality shows have raised awareness about disabilities, like Tourette's syndrome, and sparked national conversations on complex issues such as coercive control. Despite valid concerns about contestant welfare, which have led to industry changes, some studies suggest these programs can positively influence viewer behavior and social discourse.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom met with Texas Democratic lawmakers to form a united front against what they describe as a Republican effort to "rig" the 2026 midterm elections through partisan redistricting. At President Trump's urging, Texas may redraw its congressional maps, a move Newsom has threatened to counter by potentially redrawing California's maps to favor Democrats. This would be a significant departure from California's recent use of an independent commission for redistricting, a process Newsom's office is exploring legal ways to bypass. The Texas Democrats emphasized their state's history of discriminatory redistricting and the potential harm to minority voters.</p>

          <p>A surge in global popularity, driven by social media trends and a tourism boom in Japan, has created a worldwide shortage of matcha tea.

Retailers in Japan are limiting purchases, while importers in the U.S. report that a month's supply is now selling out in days. The situation is exacerbated by new U.S. tariffs on Japanese products, which are expected to further increase costs for consumers and distributors.</p>

          <p>The Syrian city of Sweida has been devastated by a recent wave of sectarian violence between local Druze factions and Bedouin clans allegedly supported by government forces, leaving over 1,300 people dead and displacing more than 120,000. The conflict, marked by summary executions and shelling, has turned the once-stable city into a scene of carnage, with hospitals overwhelmed and mass graves being dug. This violence highlights the fragile state of Syria under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, as minority groups like the Druze fear his government and resist integration. The situation was further complicated by Israeli airstrikes aimed at protecting their Druze coreligionists.</p>

After over 21 months of war and inadequate nutrition, Gazans are extremely vulnerable, and the recent cutoff of mainstream aid has pushed them to a breaking point. The limited aid provided by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is insufficient and dangerous to access, with hundreds of Palestinians reportedly killed while trying to get food.

The investigation, which began with a tip from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, revealed that an Albanian-led gang exploited the workers' access and knowledge of port operations.

This trend, described by some as "barstool conversion rock," often blends country music aesthetics with themes of faith and masculinity, resonating with a growing audience. The article explores the multi-million dollar industry behind CCM, which is heavily influenced by megachurches that package and distribute worship music for smaller congregations to replicate.

          <p>Disgraced former New York congressman George Santos has begun serving his seven-year federal prison sentence for crimes including wire fraud and identity theft. Santos, who was expelled from Congress in 2023, pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds for personal luxury expenses and fabricating his background and qualifications. His case became a symbol of political deception after a New York Times investigation revealed he had lied about his education, work history, and even his family's connection to the 9/11 attacks. Before reporting to a federal facility in New Jersey, Santos posted a defiant message on social media.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life sentences in Idaho for murdering her two children, has been given two additional consecutive life sentences in Arizona. An Arizona court found her guilty of conspiring with her late brother to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019, and attempting to murder her niece's ex-husband. During the emotional sentencing, family members delivered powerful victim impact statements, condemning her actions and mourning their losses. The judge described Daybell's manipulation as "profoundly destructive" and noted the crimes involved an unparalleled level of calculation and a blatant disregard for human life.</p>

Instead of investing the funds, he allegedly used the money for personal expenses, including a down payment on a Lexus.

          <p>Legal experts and multiple former federal prosecutors have described Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's decision to personally interview Ghislaine Maxwell as highly unorthodox and concerning. They argue that such interviews are typically handled by line prosecutors who have deep knowledge of the case, which is crucial for assessing the credibility of a convicted and potentially desperate informant. The direct involvement of a top political appointee, who previously served as President Trump's lawyer, raises questions about political motivations rather than standard investigative procedure. Critics suggest the move breaks with longstanding Justice Department practices and could compromise the integrity of any information obtained.</p>
