        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate confirmed a block of 48 of Donald Trump's executive branch nominees using new rules implemented by the Republican majority. This move aims to overcome Democratic delays that had created a significant backlog for lower-level, non-judicial positions. The rule change allows for a simple majority vote to confirm multiple nominees at once, a tactic Democrats argue erodes Senate traditions and rubber-stamps "historically bad" candidates. Republicans contend the change was necessary to fix a broken process and ensure the administration is adequately staffed.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has effectively acquired key talent and technology from AI hardware startup Enfabrica in a transaction valued at over $900 million. The deal involves hiring CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees while licensing the company's technology, which focuses on networking solutions for large-scale GPU clusters. This move, structured similarly to an "acqui-hire," enhances Nvidia's ability to offer integrated systems that can connect vast numbers of GPUs to function as a single powerful computer. It reflects a broader trend among tech giants to secure top AI expertise through strategic talent acquisitions.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier responded with the word "Scary" to a statement from former President Barack Obama accusing the Trump administration of escalating "cancel culture." Obama's criticism came after ABC, under pressure from the FCC, pulled Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show following the host's controversial remarks about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. The incident has drawn widespread backlash and fueled a national debate over free speech and political pressure on media outlets. The FCC chairman, a Trump appointee, had threatened regulatory action against Disney if it did not address the controversy.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United was defeated 2-1 by Barcelona in their Champions League opener, despite a spirited performance that earned applause from the home crowd. After falling behind by two goals from Barcelona's Marcus Rashford, Newcastle fought back with a late goal from Anthony Gordon but could not secure a result. Manager Eddie Howe praised his team's "heart" and "commitment" but lamented missed chances in the first half that could have changed the game's outcome. The loss serves as a reminder that competing at Europe's highest level requires not just effort but clinical finishing.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. With maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, the storm is currently tracking west-northwest over open waters. Forecasters do not anticipate any immediate threat to land, as its projected path is expected to keep it north of the Caribbean islands. However, the system could gradually intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend and potentially impact Bermuda by early next week.</p>

This trend reflects the broader industry pressure from cord-cutting as viewers shift from traditional pay TV to streaming services.

          <p>First Amendment experts are suggesting that the Trump administration's actions leading to Jimmy Kimmel's suspension may constitute illegal "jawboning," or censorship by proxy. This occurs when government officials coerce private entities, like broadcast networks, into stifling speech. The direct threat from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to ABC, followed by the network's decision to pull the show, creates what some scholars call a "prime example" of government censorship. The situation is drawing comparisons to past debates over government influence on social media, with legal observers noting this case presents a very clear link between regulatory pressure and a media company's action.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has claimed he personally blocked London Mayor Sadiq Khan from attending events during his UK state visit.

The statement is the latest development in a long-running public feud between the two political figures. A spokesperson for the mayor is understood to have clarified that Khan had not sought or expected an invitation to the events for the contentious state visit.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence weighed in on the Jimmy Kimmel controversy, stating that while he would have preferred the FCC chairman not get involved, he respects a private employer's right to dismiss an employee for "crass or thoughtless" remarks. Speaking at The Atlantic Festival, he drew a distinction between government censorship and a private company's employment decisions. Pence also discussed the broader political climate, expressing his belief that Donald Trump has changed the leadership of the Republican Party but not its fundamental conservative principles, and called for a return to civility.</p>

          <p>The British foreign intelligence service, MI6, is launching a secure portal on the dark web to recruit new agents, with a particular focus on individuals in Russia. The platform, named Silent Courier, is designed to provide a secure and anonymous channel for potential informants to contact the agency with sensitive information. This move aims to bolster national security by leveraging modern technology to reach people who may be disillusioned with their own governments. The initiative follows a similar strategy employed by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to attract Russian sources.</p>

          <p>ABC has indefinitely suspended its late-night program "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after the host made controversial comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The decision followed announcements by major station owners, including Nexstar and Sinclair Broadcast Group, that they would no longer air the show. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr had also publicly criticized Kimmel's remarks, suggesting there could be remedies for the network to consider. The move has sparked a widespread debate about free speech, censorship, and government influence on media.</p>

          <h2>Trump Announces Intent to Designate Antifa as a Major Terrorist Organization</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced his intention to designate the loose affiliation of anti-fascist activists known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." In a social media post, he also recommended that those who fund the movement be investigated. This follows a similar, unfulfilled threat from his first term and comes in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which the administration has blamed on "radical left political violence." It remains unclear what the legal basis or practical implications of such a designation would be, given that antifa is not a formal, structured group.</p>

          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has been assigned a U.S. Secret Service protective detail, a move that is uncommon but not unprecedented for the role. The decision comes amid heightened concerns about the safety of high-profile political figures following the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. While details were not provided, the assignment reflects the tense political environment and a broader effort to increase security for government officials. Former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also received temporary protection during her tenure after a public confrontation.</p>
