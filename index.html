          <h2>Former UK Defence Secretary Defends Secrecy Over Afghan Data Breach</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 04:42:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has defended the decision to conceal a significant data breach that exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK resettlement. In his first interview on the matter, Shapps argued the secrecy was justified to prevent individuals from being targeted and killed by the Taliban, stating his focus was on saving lives. The breach, which also leaked data on over 100 Britons, led to a covert £850 million resettlement scheme for those affected. A super-injunction that blocked reporting on the leak was recently lifted, prompting public scrutiny of the government's handling of the crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data from the Environment Agency reveals that serious water pollution incidents in England increased by 60% in 2024, reaching the highest level on record. There were 75 incidents classified as causing serious harm to the environment and human health, with Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water being the primary offenders. This rise comes despite a target to reduce pollution incidents by 40% by 2025. A cross-party committee of MPs has labeled the situation a "national disgrace" and criticized regulators for failing to hold water companies accountable for their legal obligations.</p>

          <h2>Hosepipe and Sprinkler Ban Implemented for 1.4 Million in South East England</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 04:31:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A temporary ban on using hosepipes and sprinklers has been enforced for over 1.4 million households in Kent and Sussex by South East Water. The restriction follows a period of warm, dry weather that has led to record-high demand for drinking water. Under the ban, activities like watering gardens, washing cars, and filling pools with a hose are prohibited, with potential fines of up to £1,000 for violations. This measure is one of several being implemented across the UK as water companies grapple with drought conditions and the effects of recent heatwaves.</p>

          <p>The European Union has approved its 18th sanctions package against Russia, which includes lowering the price cap on Russian crude oil. This measure aims to further restrict Moscow's revenues that fund its war in Ukraine, while keeping Russian oil on the global market to prevent price shocks. The original cap, set in 2022, was $60 per barrel. While EU officials confirmed the cap will be lowered, the new price level has not yet been specified. The new sanctions also target Rosneft's largest refinery in India for the first time.</p>

Abbott, who had previously apologized for the remarks, stated in the interview that she did not regret them and believes the Labour leadership wants her out of the party.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has requested that sheriff's departments in California, including Los Angeles County, provide lists of all non-citizen inmates in their custody. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna stated his department cannot comply due to state and local sanctuary laws that prohibit sharing such information with federal immigration agents without a warrant. Luna also described receiving what he called "threatening letters" from the federal government, warning of potential charges for non-cooperation. The situation underscores the escalating conflict between federal immigration enforcement and state-level sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>The family of Raynor Winn's former employer has publicly alleged that the bestselling author of "The Salt Path" stole approximately £64,000 from their property business in the early 2000s. They claim this financial dispute, which was settled privately, was the true reason Winn and her husband lost their home, directly contradicting the book's narrative of a bad business deal. The allegations first surfaced in an Observer investigation. In a statement, Winn acknowledged making "mistakes" and expressed regret but stood by her book's account of how they became homeless.</p>

          <p>Syrian government forces have largely withdrawn from the southern province of Sweida following a ceasefire agreement with local Druze militias, ending days of deadly clashes. The conflict, which drew in neighboring Israel with airstrikes to defend the Druze, reportedly resulted in nearly 600 casualties. The truce, mediated by the U.S., Turkey, and Arab nations, appoints Druze factions to maintain internal security. However, reports of revenge attacks on Sunni Bedouin communities who fought alongside government forces indicate that deep sectarian tensions persist despite the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal has reported that Donald Trump sent a vulgar birthday card to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which allegedly included a hand-drawn sketch of a naked woman and a raunchy message. The letter was reportedly part of a collection compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell for Epstein's 50th birthday. President Trump has vehemently denied the report, calling the story "fake" and a "scam" and has threatened to sue the newspaper. The allegation emerges amid growing political pressure on Trump to release Justice Department files related to the Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>HMP Pentonville, a large prison in north London, has been placed into special measures following a damning inspection that uncovered "frightening conditions" and illegal practices. The chief inspector of prisons issued an urgent notification after finding that 130 inmates had been illegally detained past their release dates due to staff errors in sentence calculation. The report also detailed severe overcrowding, widespread infestations of mice and cockroaches, and "shockingly poor" oversight of prisoners at risk of suicide. The findings have prompted calls for immediate and significant reform at the failing institution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed a $9 billion rescissions package that eliminates all federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which supports NPR, PBS, and their member stations nationwide.

Public media executives have warned the move will be devastating, forcing many local stations, particularly those serving rural and underserved communities, to shut down.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, calling it "unacceptable blackmail."

Lula defended Brazil's judicial independence and national sovereignty, labeling Brazilian politicians who support Trump's stance as "traitors."

The move is widely seen as an attempt to quell the political firestorm over his administration's handling of the Epstein files.

          <p>A prominent index that tracks China's progress toward a market-based economy has declined, prompting concern and calls for reform from Chinese economists. The report, from a Beijing-based think tank, showed a drop in the country's overall marketisation score in 2023, with the subindex measuring government-market relations seeing the most significant deterioration. Economists speaking at a forum urged the government to reverse this trend by reducing state intervention in the economy. They argue that more pro-market reforms are needed to address economic imbalances and intense domestic competition. (not investment advice)</p>
