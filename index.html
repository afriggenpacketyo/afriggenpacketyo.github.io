          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese officials in Switzerland to discuss ongoing trade disputes. This meeting follows previous comments from President Trump suggesting active trade discussions, which China had refuted. The talks aim to address the trade war between the two countries, with Bessent emphasizing the need to rebalance the international economic system to better serve U.S. interests. China's Commerce Ministry stated that they are willing to negotiate but will firmly safeguard their development interests and uphold international fairness.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, named "Operation Sindoor." The Indian defence ministry stated the strikes targeted "terrorist infrastructure" involved in planning attacks. Pakistan has condemned the strikes as "unprovoked" and claims to have shot down Indian aircraft, which India has yet to confirm. Tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors have escalated, with both sides taking retaliatory measures, raising concerns about further conflict in the disputed region.</p>

President Zelensky rejected the cease-fire offer, deeming it insufficient for meaningful negotiations, and suggested Putin's proposal was merely to reassure guests attending the Victory Day parade in Moscow.

          <p>With credit card interest rates remaining high, experts are weighing the advantages and disadvantages of credit card debt forgiveness for seniors. Debt forgiveness may be beneficial for seniors with high medical expenses, limited income, or no significant assets, especially if repaying debt compromises basic needs. However, it may not be wise for seniors with assets or those planning to use credit in the future, as it can damage credit scores and trigger tax consequences. Seniors are advised to explore DIY strategies like stopping credit card use and negotiating lower interest rates before considering debt forgiveness.</p>

The spacecraft, which failed to leave Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction, could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south. Experts estimate that the spacecraft will likely break apart during reentry, but there is a chance that a portion of the 1,000-pound object could survive and impact the surface.

          <p>The price of gold is influenced by a complex interplay of supply and demand dynamics, economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies. As of May 7, 2025, the price of gold is $3,392.86 per ounce, but this figure is subject to constant fluctuations. Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty, and investors should monitor these factors to make informed decisions regarding their gold investments. Understanding the dynamics of the gold market is crucial for making sound financial choices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping's visit to Russia adds symbolic weight to the relationship between the two countries, but the strategic implications are more significant. European observers caution that Beijing faces a balancing act, strengthening ties with Moscow while trying to foster closer relations with Europe. Xi's presence at the May 9 military parade in Red Square underscores the profound friendship forged during World War II. However, China's deepening ties with Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine pose challenges to its relationships with European nations.</p>

          <p>Renewable energy in the U.S. has surged in the past decade, with solar, wind, and geothermal power more than tripling. This growth has reduced emissions, enhanced energy resilience, and prevented premature deaths from pollution. However, progress is threatened by the Trump administration's dismantling of climate policies, leading to the cancellation or downsizing of nearly $8 billion in clean energy investments. Market uncertainty and debates over tax credits contribute to the slowdown, despite the Inflation Reduction Act's extension of renewable energy tax credits.</p>

          <p>Germany's new coalition government, while committed to climate neutrality by 2045, faces significant challenges in prioritizing and implementing climate action. Despite extreme weather events, climate issues took a backseat during the election campaign. Domestic and international climate policy will now be moved back under the environment ministry, which could lead to conflicts with other ministries. The economy was a major focus during the election, often pitted against climate-protection measures, and the new Chancellor has made it clear that he would only wind down coal and gas power plants if it did not further endanger an already beleaguered industrial sector.</p>

Measles is highly contagious and preventable through vaccination, requiring a 95% immunization rate to achieve herd immunity.

Health experts emphasize that anti-vaccine campaigns cost lives and that improving and sustaining high vaccine uptake is crucial to eradicating measles.

          <p>Jewelry brand Pandora has warned of significant price increases across the affordable jewelry industry if U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed tariff hikes come into play. CEO Alexander Lacik stated that while current 10% levies are manageable, previously announced "reciprocal" rates would be game-changing for jewelry manufacturers. Pandora, heavily reliant on manufacturing in Asia, particularly Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China, expects consumer pricing to see some change if tariffs remain in place.

Kessler criticizes the Trump administration's decision to reject a plan to expand access to these drugs, stating that they offer a chance for people to improve their health and confront the metabolic damage caused by ultraformulated foods.

          <p>Congressional Republicans are relying on a spending and tax cut package, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, to revitalize their political prospects after a period marked by President Trump's overreach and economic self-immolation. However, this strategy may not yield the desired results, as voters may not reward them for simply extending existing tax rates. The Republican leaders face a dilemma, needing Trump's support to pass the tax extension while also avoiding criticism of his trade policy. Economists warn that the negative impacts of tariffs may overshadow any positive effects from the tax cuts, potentially jeopardizing Republican control of the House.</p>
