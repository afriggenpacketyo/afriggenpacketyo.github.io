          <p>AstraZeneca's decision to pursue a Wall Street listing for its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) has been welcomed by investors, but sparks fears of further defections from the London Stock Exchange. While AZ emphasized its UK-listed, headquartered, and tax-resident status would remain, the move aims to attract a broader global investor base and access New York's larger capital pools. This follows a trend of several major companies shifting primary listings away from the UK, reflecting frustrations with the country's drug-pricing regime and seeking better market access. The British government is urged to address risks to the London market, such as removing Stamp Duty Reserve Tax. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck a central Philippine province, resulting in at least 69 deaths and trapping numerous residents in collapsed structures. The quake, one of the strongest in over a decade, hit Cebu province, with Bogo city reporting about half the fatalities. Rescue efforts are hampered by intermittent rain and damaged infrastructure, as authorities scramble to find survivors during the "golden hour." The region, still reeling from a recent tropical storm, is prone to seismic activity and typhoons, adding to the trauma for its residents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England has implemented a ban on multi-buy promotions, such as "buy one, get one free" deals, for unhealthy food and drinks in larger supermarkets and online retailers. This measure, delayed due to the cost-of-living crisis, aims to tackle rising obesity rates, particularly among children. Public health officials view it as a crucial, albeit not singular, step, hoping retailers will now promote healthier choices. Previous restrictions on unhealthy product placement have shown a reduction in sales, indicating potential positive impact from this new legislation.</p>

          <p>China's military perceives the expanded joint cyber and AI-integrated exercises between the US, Japan, and South Korea as a significant risk to regional security. A Chinese military commentary argued that these drills transcend traditional cooperation, evolving into strategic tools used by an external power to destabilize the region. The article further suggested that "exaggerated regional threats" concerning China and North Korea are being used to justify the increasing frequency, geographic scope, and operational domains of these military exercises. This highlights growing tensions and a perception of heightened military posturing in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

          <p>Mark Rutte, in his first year as NATO Secretary General, has been widely praised by foreign policy experts for skillfully managing the alliance, particularly in renewing the US commitment under a re-elected Donald Trump.

          <p>India's Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept its policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, aligning with economists' expectations, as it assesses the impact of previous rate cuts. Governor Sanjay Malhotra noted moderated inflation in Q1 but anticipated a growth deceleration in the second half due to global trade uncertainties, particularly US tariffs on Indian exports. Despite August inflation undershooting targets, the RBI's unanimous decision reflects a cautious approach, allowing earlier cuts to filter through the economy.

          <p>Despite the US government shutdown, student loan borrowers are still required to make payments on their outstanding debt. However, with most Education Department employees furloughed, borrowers may face difficulties reaching assistance if problems arise. Federal aid, including Pell Grants and Direct Student loans, is expected to continue disbursement as it's funded through mandatory spending. Nevertheless, new grant applications and loan forgiveness programs could be impacted if the shutdown is prolonged, and the Department of Veterans Affairs has historically experienced backlogs in claims processing during such lapses.

          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing blue-collar careers, like electricians and plumbers, driven by high college costs and the perceived threat of AI to white-collar jobs. Jacob Palmer, 23, runs his own electrical company, finding independence and security in the trades. Surveys show Gen Z is concerned about student loan debt and values jobs hard to automate, viewing fields like software development as less secure. This shift challenges the long-held emphasis on college diplomas, as unemployment rises for recent college graduates while non-college-educated workers see smaller upticks.</p>

          <p>A short US government shutdown is unlikely to significantly impact air travel, as most Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees are deemed essential and must work unpaid. However, a prolonged shutdown could lead to disruptions if these workers, under financial strain, call in sick or seek other jobs, causing labor shortages and longer security lines. The US Travel Association warns of a potential $1 billion weekly economic hit and delays in hiring air traffic controllers, exacerbating existing shortages. Train travel and passport services are expected to remain largely unaffected.</p>

          <p>The current US government shutdown marks the 15th such lapse in federal funding since 1980, triggered by disagreements over health care tax credits and broader spending. Historically, shutdowns became more impactful after 1980 legal opinions mandated agencies cease operations without funding. President Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns, mostly brief, while Clinton's presidency saw a 21-day impasse. The most recent, in 2018-2019, lasted 34 days and cost $3 billion in permanent losses. These recurring funding fights highlight deep partisan divides and have significant economic and political consequences.</p>

          <p>During a US government shutdown, members of Congress and the President continue to receive their salaries, protected by the Constitution and federal law, which mandates their compensation regardless of funding lapses.

          <p>The US government officially shut down just after midnight after Congress failed to pass stopgap funding bills, with Republicans and Democrats unable to resolve their opposing positions. A key sticking point was the Democrats' insistence on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. Both parties immediately engaged in a blame game, with the White House blaming Democrats and Governor Gavin Newsom blaming Donald Trump. The shutdown is expected to furlough approximately 750,000 federal employees, costing roughly $400 million daily in compensation, underscoring the severe consequences of the political impasse.</p>

          <p>Scholars at Risk (SAR), a global academic freedom group, has issued a stark warning that the Trump administration's actions are turning the US into a "model for how to dismantle" academic freedom. Their report documented approximately 40 attacks in the first half of 2025, including research fund revocations and attempted deportations of foreign scholars. The article highlights a shift from state-level pressure to federal government control over university admissions, hiring, and research, often using the Gaza war and antisemitism allegations as pretexts. This trend signifies a grim global picture for academic freedom, even in established democracies.</p>
