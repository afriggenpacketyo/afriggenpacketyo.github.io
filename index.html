          <h2>AI Data Center Growth Experiences Strategic Reassessment Amid Strong Overall Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 10:14:04 EDT</div>

          <p>While some data center projects are being reconsidered, the AI data center market remains robust, with major players like Amazon and Nvidia reaffirming strong demand. Factors such as evolving AI technologies, geopolitical concerns, and scarcity of resources like power and land are contributing to a strategic reallocation of data center investments rather than a bust. Companies are focusing on efficiency and proximity to end-users, and utilities face challenges in providing sufficient power to meet the growing demands of increasingly large data centers. The market is expected to continue growing, albeit with variations in the growth rate due to factors like tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan noted that the meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy gave him some hope regarding the Trump administration's approach to the war in Ukraine. He highlighted Trump's previous concessions to Putin and expressed concern about potential pressure on Ukraine. Sullivan emphasized the importance of holding Russia accountable and maintaining U.S. credibility with allies. Sullivan stated that he had remained quiet on these matters because he 'didn't want to be a backseat driver' and expressed concern that China was reaping the benefits of Trump's foreign policy.</p>

These tariffs, particularly on hi-tech manufacturing, have stunned Taiwanese policymakers, who believed they had already made significant contributions to the United States through investments like TSMC's chip plants in Arizona and increased defense spending. The exclusion of Taiwan from initial trade negotiations has further fueled concerns about the island's strategic value being primarily assessed on economic and military contributions.</p>

          <p>Robert Walters, a senior vice president at AT&T, suggests that aspiring leaders should focus on raising the median level of performance of their team rather than striving to be the best individual performer. He realized that he had less patience and less time allocated toward nurturing relationships with those he didn't consider top performers, and changing his mindset led to better outcomes. Experts like Simon Sinek suggest a similar approach, advising employees to not care too much about specific accolades or achievements in the workplace.</p>

          <p>Tees Valley mayor Lord Houchen suggested that the Conservative Party may need to form a coalition with Reform UK to keep Labour out of government at the next general election. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has ruled out a coalition with Nigel Farage's party at a national level, arguing Reform is seeking to destroy the Tories. A Reform UK spokesman said the party had "no intention of forming coalitions or pacts with the Tories", saying they "broke Britain".</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has paused online orders following a cyber attack, which analysts say is a "bruise" to its reputation. The retail giant has been working to restore operations since Friday, but the disruption could lead to lost sales as shoppers turn to rival brands. While M&S's quick response and open communication may limit long-term damage, the incident highlights the importance of data security and reliable online services.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that while President Trump maintains support from his base, concerns over tariffs and rising prices are weighing on his approval ratings, particularly regarding the economy and inflation. While his voters believe he is doing what he promised in the campaign, there is a widespread and growing belief among others that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. MAGA Republicans have a much rosier outlook on the U.S. economy than Americans overall now that Trump is in office.</p>
