          <p>A terror attack at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur resulted in the deaths of two Jewish men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz. The attacker, identified as Jihad Al-Shamie, used a car and a knife before being shot dead by police. One of the deceased victims was tragically hit by police gunfire while securing the synagogue doors against the assailant, who was on bail for an alleged sexual assault. The incident, which injured three others, is being investigated as an act of extreme Islamist ideology, prompting widespread condemnation and increased security for Jewish communities.</p>

          <p>Actor Eric Dane, known for his role in "Euphoria," recently spoke with lawmakers in Washington, D.C., about his battle with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). He advocated for the reauthorization of the ACT for ALS law, which expands access to treatments. Dane, 52, expressed his determination to "fight to the last breath" for his family, wanting to see his two daughters grow up. Since announcing his diagnosis in April, he has been open about the disease's progression and its profound impact on his life and physical abilities.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett stated she is "not afraid" despite facing routine protests and death threats following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. In a recent interview, she explained that she has learned to handle such pressures in a businesslike manner, refusing to let threats influence her emotions or judicial decisions. Barrett, who is promoting her new book, emphasized her commitment to originalism, the judicial philosophy of her mentor Antonin Scalia. She maintains that her legal interpretations are based on the Constitution's original meaning, not political pressure or personal feelings.</p>

          <p>At 70, marine biologist Elvira Alvarado, known as "the mother of Colombian corals," is pioneering efforts to save Colombia's endangered coral reefs. Witnessing over half of the Caribbean's coral die since the 1970s due to climate change and pollution, she now leads a team using in-vitro fertilization. This technique involves collecting coral eggs and sperm to grow new, more resilient coral in nurseries before transplanting them to the reefs. Alvarado's work not only aims to regenerate these vital ecosystems but also inspires a new generation of scientists to continue the fight.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores How Algorithmic Social Media Drives Seemingly Random Consumer Fads</h2>

          <p>Recent consumer fads like Labubu dolls and Dubai chocolate bars are examined as products of an algorithm-driven culture, lacking the clear sociological origins of past trends like Beanie Babies. Unlike older fads fueled by specific marketing or new commerce platforms, today's trends gain traction through visually stimulating content on platforms like TikTok, which prioritizes engagement over context. This phenomenon can lead to the infantilization of adult consumer tastes, as products designed for maximum stimulation often resemble children's items. However, it also reflects a desire to connect online experiences with tangible, real-world activities.</p>

          <h2>UK Green Party Adopts More Confrontational Strategy Under New Leadership</h2>

          <p>Under new leader Zack Polanski, the Green Party of England and Wales is shifting towards a more confrontational, "eco-populist" strategy to capitalize on recent membership growth. Polanski's promise to "pick fights" aims to cut through voter disillusionment and challenge rising right-wing populism, a move inspired in part by the attention-grabbing tactics of Reform UK. While this bolder approach has energized some within the party, there are concerns it could alienate rural voters who were key to their 2024 election successes. The party hopes this new direction will translate its growing momentum into significant electoral power.</p>

          <p>Intense overnight missile and drone attacks by Russia across Ukraine have resulted in at least five deaths and left tens of thousands without electricity. According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia fired over 50 missiles and numerous drones, targeting energy infrastructure in several regions, including Lviv and Zaporizhzhia. A family of four was killed in a village near Lviv. In response to the widespread assault, neighboring Poland scrambled its fighter jets, along with allied NATO aircraft, to secure its airspace. Russia's defense ministry claimed it successfully struck Ukrainian military and infrastructure targets.</p>

Acknowledging poor polling and defections to Reform, Badenoch insisted that "winning elections without a plan is what got us into trouble."

The original study, which received global media attention, suggested participants lost about 9% of their body mass in 12 weeks.

          <p>This article analyzes a speech by Donald Trump to the U.S. military's senior officer corps at Quantico, where he reportedly belittled commanders and demanded their loyalty. The author argues that the silent, disciplined response from the generals and admirals demonstrated their fidelity to the Constitution over any individual. The speech, framed by an introduction from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, outlined a new mission to use the military against domestic political opponents, which would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. The event is portrayed as a concerning display of authoritarian tendencies and a misunderstanding of the military's non-partisan role.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intensified its opposition to renewable energy, actively working to dismantle clean energy projects and reverse pro-climate policies. This stance marks a stark reversal from 2009, when Donald Trump signed a letter advocating for climate action. His current policies include halting offshore wind farms, banning renewables on federal land, and eliminating subsidies, actions that have caused over $22 billion in clean energy projects to be canceled or scaled back. This approach is causing the U.S. to fall behind competitors like China in the booming clean energy sector, perplexing experts who note it undermines American energy dominance goals.</p>

          <p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence is causing significant concern among China's new generation of writers, who fear the technology's potential to devalue their work and infringe on copyrights. At a recent conference on speculative fiction, authors discussed the "psychological shock" of AI's near-human capabilities, with some calling for stronger copyright protections. While established writers may be less affected, emerging authors are particularly worried about the implications for their careers. The debate highlights the dual nature of AI, with some writers finding it a helpful tool while others view it as a significant threat.</p>

          <p>Democrats face a difficult path to gaining control of the U.S. Senate in the 2026 midterm elections, with the electoral map heavily favoring Republicans.

Potential targets like Maine, Ohio, Iowa, and Texas present formidable challenges, as these states have trended increasingly Republican. The steep odds in the Senate are why much of the political focus is on the House of Representatives.</p>

The author, an educator and author herself, connects Raquel's story of heritage and compassion to the original character Samantha Parkington, who inspired her as a child. While praising the doll's narrative for exploring a blended cultural identity, the author criticizes Mattel for Raquel's physical resemblance to a previous Latina doll, Maritza Ochoa.

          <p>The UK Conservative Party has unveiled a new immigration plan aiming to remove 750,000 people who are in the country illegally over a five-year period. The proposal includes banning anyone who enters the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum and replacing court appeals with an internal Home Office process. To execute this, an immigration enforcement unit would be rebranded as a "Removals Force" with expanded powers and increased funding. This hardline stance, which includes leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, is seen as an effort to counter the electoral threat from Nigel Farage's Reform UK party.</p>

          <p>A trend known as the "spiritual economy" is growing in China, particularly among younger consumers seeking guidance amid economic uncertainty. Businesses combining nightlife with metaphysical services, such as tarot reading bars in Shanghai, are becoming increasingly popular. This rise in spending on fortune-telling and other occult activities reflects a search for answers and comfort as people grapple with issues like pay cuts and career instability. The phenomenon points to a broader cultural shift where consumers are turning to spiritual or metaphysical experiences for solace and direction in their lives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent record sales, the U.S. electric vehicle market is expected to slow down significantly following the expiration of a key $7,500 federal tax credit. The recent sales boom was largely driven by consumers rushing to buy before the subsidy ended. The U.S. already lags behind Europe and China in EV adoption, a situation attributed to weaker government support and higher vehicle prices. With the end of the tax credit and the imposition of new tariffs, automakers like Ford and GM predict a drop in demand, challenging the industry's growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in three Indian states have banned the sale of Coldrif cough syrup after it was linked to the deaths of at least nine children. India's Health Ministry confirmed that test samples of the syrup, manufactured by Sresan Pharma, contained toxic levels of diethylene glycol (DEG), a poisonous industrial solvent. The majority of the deaths occurred in the state of Madhya Pradesh. This incident places India's large pharmaceutical industry under renewed scrutiny, following several international warnings from the World Health Organization about other contaminated, Indian-made medicines.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of 300 National Guard members to Chicago, citing what the White House described as "ongoing violent riots and lawlessness." This marks the latest instance of the administration sending federal troops to a U.S. city, following similar deployments in Los Angeles, Washington, and Portland. Illinois' Democratic Governor, JB Pritzker, condemned the move as an "outrageous and un-American" political performance rather than a genuine effort to ensure public safety. The deployment comes as legal challenges have been mounted against the use of the National Guard for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, a Black British doctoral student at Cornell University recounts his experience of being targeted by U.S. authorities for his pro-Palestinian activism. After participating in a campus protest, he was banned from campus, went into hiding, and eventually self-deported after learning he was being sought by immigration officials. He later discovered his student visa was terminated and his Google data had been handed to the Department of Homeland Security. He attributes this to AI-powered surveillance tools used to monitor non-citizens, arguing his case highlights a dangerous collusion between big tech and the state to suppress dissent.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the January 2023 murder of Kenneth Fandrich at an Intel campus in Hillsboro, Oregon, faced a major setback when a key piece of evidence was destroyed. Police believe Fandrich was killed inside a maroon minivan by a stalker, Dr. Steven Milner, who was later arrested and charged. Detectives tracked the "burner" vehicle to a tow company, only to discover it had been sold to a scrapyard and crushed just a week before they located it. The loss of the minivan, considered the primary crime scene, complicated the forensic case against Milner.</p>

          <p>Nearly four years after its controversial £305m Saudi-led takeover, Newcastle United has undergone a significant transformation, though its path to success has been gradual. The club has modernized its training facilities, won its first major domestic trophy in 70 years, and qualified for the Champions League twice. However, growth has been constrained by the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules, preventing the owners from simply buying their way to the top like previous disruptors. While the club's revenue and staff have grown, the takeover continues to draw criticism from human rights campaigners concerned about sportswashing.</p>

As the 21st typhoon to hit China this year, Matmo triggered the country's highest-level red alert. By late Sunday, transportation services were beginning to resume as the storm moved inland.</p>

New Zealand finished as runners-up, with coach Scott Robertson also focused on developing new talent ahead of the 2027 World Cup.
