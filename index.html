This ban is broader than Trump's initial 2017 travel ban and includes full restrictions on nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and others, while partially restricting entry from countries like Burundi and Venezuela. Unlike the previous ban, legal experts anticipate this one will withstand legal challenges. The announcement has been met with less outrage than the 2017 ban, overshadowed by protests in Los Angeles over immigration enforcement operations and the deployment of the National Guard.</p>

The editorial argues that the deployment is based on false pretenses and is likely to escalate tensions rather than prevent chaos. The board highlights that the situation in Los Angeles did not warrant federal intervention, as local law enforcement was managing the protests effectively. The move is described as ahistoric and compared to instances where presidential authority was used to overrule state governors during times of significant social unrest.</p>

Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans.

          <p>China's consumer prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, underscoring persistent deflationary pressures driven by sluggish domestic demand and ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The national consumer price index (CPI) declined by 0.1% year-on-year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. This data highlights the challenges China faces in stimulating domestic consumption and managing inventory strains for manufacturers. A new round of trade talks between China and the United States is scheduled to take place in London.</p>

          <p>China has started mass production of the world’s first non-binary AI chip, developed by Professor Li Hongge’s team at Beihang University in Beijing. This breakthrough overcomes limitations in traditional computing by merging binary and stochastic logic, enabling greater fault tolerance and power efficiency. The new chip is designed for intelligent control applications, such as touch displays and flight systems, while also circumventing U.S. chip restrictions. The Hybrid Stochastic Number (HSN) system combines traditional binary numbers with probability-based numbers, offering an alternative to binary logic, which requires extensive hardware resources.</p>

          <p>Protests erupted in Los Angeles following rumors of an immigration raid at a hardware store, leading to clashes between protesters and authorities. The unrest was sparked by reports of immigration enforcement vehicles and alleged arrests of day laborers at a Home Depot in Paramount, California. Despite the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stating that the rumors of a raid were misinformation, the protests turned violent, with rocks and Molotov cocktails thrown. President Trump deployed the California National Guard in response, escalating tensions further.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly criticized President Donald Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, likening his actions to those of a "dictator." Newsom accused Trump of inciting violence, creating chaos, and militarizing cities in response to protests against his anti-immigration policies. He demanded that Trump rescind the order, describing the deployment as an alarming abuse of power. Other Democratic governors have joined in the criticism, denouncing the deployment as an overreach of federal authority.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are in disagreement over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles amid ongoing protests. The dispute centers on differing interpretations of the Posse Comitatus Act, which governs the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Trump deployed the National Guard after attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, while Newsom objected, calling the move an unlawful breach of state sovereignty. The Pentagon has also indicated it is prepared to send in active-duty Marines.</p>

He emphasizes the U.S.'s reliance on China for these essential materials, which are used in various high-tech products, including smartphones and electric vehicles. Cramer suggests that the U.S. needs to develop its own rare earth mineral production and refining capacity to reduce its dependence on China. He expresses concern that the U.S. may lack leverage in the trade negotiations due to this vulnerability. (not investment advice)</p>
