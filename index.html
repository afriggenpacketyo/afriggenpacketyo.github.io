          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decline in rice prices following the appointment of a new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi. The previous minister was dismissed due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice, which sparked public anger. The poll also indicates that 44.7% believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, contrasting with the government's pledged target. The survey also showed increased support for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet following the change in agriculture minister. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that the media's biggest failure in the 2024 presidential campaign was not in covering Joe Biden's age, but in normalizing Donald Trump's actions surrounding January 6th. The author contends that the press downplayed Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election in exchange for access, failing to adequately portray him as a threat to democracy. The author contrasts this with the intense scrutiny of Hillary Clinton's email server, suggesting that more frequent reminders of Trump's actions might have altered the election's outcome. The article concludes that voters ultimately prioritized economic concerns over the preservation of democracy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the fringe movement of anti-natalism, sparked by an attack on a Palm Springs fertility clinic by Guy Edward Bartkus, who identified as a pro-mortalist. Anti-natalism posits that procreation is immoral due to the inevitability of suffering and death, with some extreme variants like efilism advocating for the destruction of DNA. The article traces the origins of anti-natalism to philosophical treatises and its growing online presence, fueled by anxieties about climate change and artificial intelligence. The article also explores how these ideas can be twisted and lead to violence, as seen in Bartkus's actions and his connection to a woman who died in an apparent assisted suicide.</p>

          <p>An Australian couple in Ghinni Ghinni, New South Wales, experienced a moment of joy during a news interview as they were reunited with one of their calves after severe floods. The couple had been forced to evacuate, leaving behind their livestock, and feared they had lost one of the calves in the floodwaters. The unexpected return of the calf brought a "spark of extra energy" to the couple, who were dealing with the exhaustion and devastation caused by the flooding. The flooding, described as the worst ever seen in the area, has caused extensive damage to properties and livestock.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the impact of political instability and policy uncertainty on the American economy. Businesses are facing challenges such as unstable tariff rates, bond-market swings, and canceled federal contracts, leading to uncertainty about the economic outlook. Despite this, the U.S. economy has shown resilience, with high corporate profits and low unemployment, but this resilience may be wearing off. The article suggests that proactive destabilization by the government is making the economic environment more vulnerable than it was a few years ago. (not investment advice)</p>
