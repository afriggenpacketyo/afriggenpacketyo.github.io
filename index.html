          <p>The British pound reached a near four-year high against the dollar following reports that former U.S. President Donald Trump might accelerate the appointment of a new Federal Reserve chair. Market concerns arose from the possibility of Trump selecting a candidate more aligned with his demands, potentially compromising the Fed's independence. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has faced criticism from Trump for maintaining steady interest rates, with concerns that retaliatory tariffs could drive up inflation. The dollar's weakness reflects broader anxieties about the erosion of institutional independence in the U.S., potentially leading to higher borrowing costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a greater contraction than previously estimated during the first quarter of 2025, marking the first decline in three years. The Commerce Department's final GDP report indicated a 0.5% annual rate decrease, revised from earlier estimates of 0.3% and 0.2%. This downturn was largely attributed to a surge in imports as companies rushed to acquire foreign goods ahead of tariff implementations, though consumer spending also sharply decreased. While underlying economic strength, measured by real final sales to private domestic purchasers, showed a modest increase, it was less robust than the previous quarter, with economists forecasting a rebound in the second quarter.

          <p>In the Sean Combs trial, the prosecution presented closing arguments, portraying Combs as the leader of a criminal enterprise who used power, violence, and fear to exploit women. The prosecutor linked two alleged episodes involving Cassie Ventura and another woman, referred to as "Jane," to depict Combs as a serial sex trafficker. The prosecution argued that Combs used his money and influence to cover up his crimes for two decades, emphasizing that he did not act alone in these alleged offenses. The trial has drawn significant attention due to the serious nature of the allegations and Combs' prominent status.</p>

          <p>After escalating tensions, the U.S. and China have entered a period of uneasy calm in their trade relations, retreating from extreme positions. This pause follows months of tariff battles and mutual threats, including China's restrictions on rare earth exports and the U.S. limiting jet engine and semiconductor software access. Analysts suggest this breather, effective since May 12, aims to stabilize relations, with the U.S. seeking resumed rare earth exports and China pushing for more organized negotiations to moderate Trump's unpredictable approach. While the Iran crisis adds uncertainty, its impact on any potential U.S.-China deal is expected to be minimal.</p>

          <p>An international traveler pleaded guilty to maliciously assaulting a police dog at Dulles International Airport. Hamed Aly Marie was accused of kicking Freddy, a Customs and Border Protection K9 trained to detect illicit agricultural contraband, so hard that the dog was lifted off the ground, causing injury. Marie was arrested and sentenced to probation and ordered to pay $840 in restitution. The incident occurred as Freddy was inspecting luggage arriving on an EgyptAir flight, and Marie's motive for the assault remains unclear.</p>

          <p>The State Department may begin laying off hundreds of Washington, D.C.-based employees, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio seeks to streamline the agency. The timing hinges on a Supreme Court decision regarding a lower court's pause on government-wide layoffs. The American Foreign Service Association has urged the State Department to comply with the court order, while a senior State Department official denies any plans to violate it. Internal correspondence indicates that over 2,000 staffers, including 700 D.C.-based foreign service officers, could be affected by the reduction in force, with large conference rooms reserved for processing terminated employees.</p>

          <p>A $200,000 annuity purchased at age 65 could provide a monthly income to supplement retirement funds. Monthly payments from a fixed lifetime annuity can vary based on factors such as gender, annuity type, and the prevailing interest rate environment. Current estimates suggest a 65-year-old man might receive around $1,294 per month, while a woman of the same age could receive approximately $1,240 per month. The decision to buy an annuity depends on an individual's retirement income strategy and whether guaranteed income is desired to offset market volatility and longevity risk.

          <p>Russia plans to summon the German ambassador to address retaliatory measures in response to what it describes as harassment of Russian journalists in Germany. This action follows previous clashes between Russia and Germany over journalist treatment, including the expulsion of a German correspondent and cameraman last November. Russia accuses Germany of applying undue pressure and harassment against Russian journalists and their families, citing passport revocations and movement restrictions. Despite these issues, Russia continues to accredit Western correspondents, although many left the country after the full-scale war against Ukraine began.</p>

          <p>The Senate parliamentarian ruled against a key provision in the Republican tax and spending package, impacting Medicaid provider taxes. The parliamentarian determined that changes to how states tax Medicaid providers do not adhere to rules for passing the bill with a simple majority, a setback for GOP efforts to offset tax cut costs. Democrats praised the ruling, stating it removes over $250 billion in healthcare cuts from the bill. The parliamentarian also flagged other provisions, including those barring Medicaid from covering gender-affirming care and denying coverage to some non-U.S. citizens.</p>

This decision allows Merck to launch the shot ahead of the RSV season, competing with a rival shot from Sanofi and AstraZeneca.
