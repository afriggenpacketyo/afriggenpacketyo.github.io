          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has praised US President Donald Trump's diplomatic actions, stating they have brought the end of the war in Ukraine "closer than ever before." This statement followed a summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, which did not result in a formal ceasefire agreement. Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and that the UK's support for Ukraine remains steadfast until Russia's aggression ceases.</p>

          <p>After more than two decades, Bryan Patrick Miller, a local Phoenix man known for his "Zombie Hunter" persona, has been convicted and sentenced to death for the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas in the early 1990s. The cold case was solved using genetic genealogy, which linked Miller's DNA to the crime scenes. His defense argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming a history of severe childhood abuse by his mother caused him to develop dissociative amnesia, but the judge ultimately found him guilty.</p>

          <p>A planned visit by United States trade representatives to New Delhi has been called off, signaling deepening trade friction between the two nations. The postponement comes as India faces a cumulative 50% tariff rate from the U.S., partly as a penalty for purchasing Russian crude oil. New Delhi has criticized the tariffs as unfair, pointing out that many Western nations continue their own trade with Russia. The U.S. remains India's largest single export partner, making the unresolved tensions economically significant for both countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to ban the pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action, classifying it as a terrorist organization. Cooper argued the group's activities, which include claims of responsibility for property damage and violent disorder, go beyond legitimate protest. The ban, which makes support for the group a criminal offense, has led to over 700 arrests and has been challenged by the group and human rights organizations as an infringement on free speech and disproportionate.</p>

          <p>A mechanic in Minnesota discovered a wallet that had been lost 11 years prior by a Ford assembly plant worker in Michigan. The wallet, belonging to retired autoworker Richard Guilford, had apparently slipped from his pocket and fallen into the airbox of a 2015 Ford Edge he was working on in 2014. After finding the owner's Ford employee ID, the mechanic located him on Facebook and mailed the wallet, which still contained $15 cash and unexpired gift cards, back to him.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a concept for a hypersonic drone carrier featuring a unique, single, centrally mounted "scissor wing" that rotates to optimize flight across different speeds. The design allows the wing to be perpendicular to the fuselage for efficient lift at low speeds, pivot to a 45-degree angle to mitigate shockwaves at transonic speeds, and align parallel with the fuselage at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5. This innovative approach aims to solve long-standing aerodynamic challenges, potentially realizing a concept once explored by NASA for creating highly versatile and efficient high-speed aircraft.</p>

The article suggests that factors such as a lifetime of repressing emotions to be "good," perfectionism stemming from trauma, and having poor personal boundaries developed in childhood can create a breaking point. Additionally, being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage, or experiencing a significant recent loss, can act as catalysts for seeking connection outside the primary relationship.</p>

          <p>During his summit in Alaska, President Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning children affected by the war. The letter speaks in general terms about restoring the "melodic laughter" of children and protecting their innocence, without explicitly mentioning Russia's abduction of thousands of Ukrainian children. The transfer of these children is considered a war crime by the International Criminal Court, and Ukrainian officials expressed gratitude for the First Lady's attention to the issue.</p>

          <p>Villa Baviera, a German-style village in Chile, is now a tourist destination with a hotel and restaurant, but it was once known as Colonia Dignidad, a secretive and abusive cult. Founded by Paul Schäfer, the colony was a site of forced labor, child sexual assault, and collaboration with the Pinochet dictatorship, serving as a torture center for political prisoners. The Chilean government's plan to expropriate part of the land for a memorial site has divided the remaining residents, many of whom were also victims of Schäfer's regime, highlighting the complex legacy of the horrific events that occurred there.</p>

          <p>A caller to "The Ramsey Show" seeking financial advice initially described her husband as "not very good with money," but later revealed he had a severe gambling problem. She disclosed that in a single month, her husband had spent $14,000 on scratch-off lottery tickets, exceeding their combined monthly income of $10,000. Host Dave Ramsey's advice shifted dramatically from standard budgeting to treating the situation as a serious addiction, urging the caller to take full control of their finances and for her husband to immediately seek professional help.

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, offering authentic, regionally diverse cuisine that moves far beyond Westernized staples like chow mein. Driven by intense competition in their home market, brands specializing in fiery Hunanese dishes, savory Zhejiang seafood, and other regional specialties are using Singapore as a launchpad for global expansion. These restaurants aim to correct outdated perceptions of Chinese food as low-brow by providing immersive dining experiences that showcase the sophistication and variety of China's gastronomic culture, potentially serving as a form of "ping-pong diplomacy."</p>

          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" captures the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, a period that represented his last major burst of creativity. The collection includes his final Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads recorded as his marriage was ending, showcasing his evolution as an expressive singer in middle age. This era was also marked by a significant missed opportunity, as Presley was considered for, but ultimately did not get, a starring role opposite Barbra Streisand in "A Star Is Born," a disappointment some believe hastened his career's decline before his death in 1977.</p>

          <p>The late Charlie Munger, former vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, revealed that once he became wealthy, he stopped carrying insurance on assets he could afford to replace, such as cars and houses. He argued that self-insuring is the logical approach for intelligent people who can absorb the financial impact of a loss, as it avoids the "waste" of dealing with insurance companies and paying for the fraudulent claims of others. While acknowledging that Berkshire Hathaway is a major insurance provider, Munger maintained that for those with sufficient wealth, avoiding the claims process and unnecessary premiums is the most efficient strategy.
