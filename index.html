          <p>This article provides an update on the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of Jermain Charlo, a Montana mother who went missing in June 2018. Security footage shows Charlo at The Badlander bar with her ex-boyfriend, Michael DeFrance, who has given conflicting accounts of her whereabouts that night. Cellphone data placed Charlo's phone in an area where DeFrance was living hours after she was last seen, and he later admitted to discarding her phone in Idaho. Despite extensive searches and investigation, Charlo remains missing, and DeFrance has never been named a suspect. The case remains open, with Charlo's family continuing to seek justice and closure.</p>

NASA and ESA are collaborating on the Artemis program to establish a permanent base at the moon's south pole, while China and Russia plan to build the International Lunar Research Station by 2035. The moon's appeal lies in its abundant resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and rare earth elements, which could be used for lunar bases and potentially transported back to Earth. Scientific research on the moon aims to make space travel safer, understand lunar environments, and develop technologies that benefit both lunar missions and life on Earth.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer’s government's plans to modernize and potentially expand Britain’s nuclear weapons arsenal, as unveiled in the 2025 strategic defence review, undermine international non-proliferation efforts. The plans will fuel a global nuclear arms race and increase the chances of deploying tactical nukes in conflict zones. This is a dangerous path towards normalizing nuclear warfare, and the article advocates for gradual disarmament instead of rearmament. The author critiques the claim that Russian nuclear coercion is the biggest threat, arguing that political will and conventional forces are more effective.</p>

The study, which analysed data from 23 countries, also found that traditional expectations that place the burden on women to perform most childcare duties persist in China and other East Asian countries, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>
