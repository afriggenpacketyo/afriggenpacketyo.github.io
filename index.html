          <p>The Federal Communications Commission has approved the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, clearing the final regulatory obstacle for the deal. The approval came with commitments from Skydance to ensure viewpoint diversity, hire a news ombudsman for CBS News, and maintain local news coverage. The transaction, valued at $8.4 billion, is expected to close in early August, concluding a prolonged and complex sales process that involved numerous other potential buyers. A dissenting FCC commissioner raised concerns about a recent legal settlement involving Paramount, suggesting it could erode press freedom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former federal prosecutors have described the Justice Department's direct interview of Ghislaine Maxwell by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as highly unorthodox and concerning. Experts noted that such interviews are typically handled by line prosecutors with deep case knowledge to assess credibility, not high-ranking officials. The decision for Blanche, a former personal attorney to President Trump, to conduct the questioning raises concerns about political motivations rather than standard investigative procedure. Questions also arose about the lack of an FBI agent to formally document the meeting, which is standard practice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has declared President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional. The court found the order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration had argued the amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction" clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected. While the White House plans to appeal, the ruling upholds a nationwide injunction, preventing the policy from taking effect for now.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested Jose Madrid Reyes, a Salvadoran national, for allegedly stalking a U.S. government official and her family. According to the Department of Homeland Security, Reyes had a criminal record including convictions for assault and DWI. He had previously been ordered removed from the country in 2022 but had remained in the U.S. illegally. The arrest was made following an investigation by Homeland Security Investigations after the official reported fears for her safety.</p>

          <p>Economists warn that a new baseline tariff of at least 15% on foreign goods is likely to increase U.S. consumer prices, even as new trade agreements are negotiated. Major companies like Nestlé and General Electric have indicated they may raise prices to offset the increased costs from these tariffs. While the White House contends that foreign exporters will bear the cost, analyses suggest U.S. prices could rise significantly, particularly for import-heavy categories like apparel and electronics. The full impact is expected to mount gradually over the coming months as the new tariff structure becomes embedded in global supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order targeting street homelessness, which has drawn both criticism and cautious interest from local officials and advocates. The order promotes the civil commitment of individuals with mental illness and funds encampment removals, while seeking to divert money from "housing first" and "harm reduction" strategies. Critics, including the National Homelessness Law Center, decry the order as a move toward criminalizing homelessness and a rejection of proven methods. However, some local leaders see a potential opportunity for funding, reflecting an ongoing shift in how some cities are already addressing the crisis.</p>

The piece lampoons the ongoing political controversy, imagining a long-running, confusing conspiracy orchestrated by a mysterious figure to create the "Epstein files" for future political turmoil.

          <p>Intel's stock price dropped significantly after the company announced it was cutting costs and potentially discontinuing projects within its chip manufacturing (foundry) division. The company revealed it has been unsuccessful in securing a major external customer for its advanced manufacturing processes and may pause the business if one isn't found. This news overshadowed an otherwise positive earnings report that beat revenue and sales forecasts. The market's reaction reflects deep skepticism about Intel's ability to compete in the foundry market and its struggles in the AI chip sector dominated by rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has cast doubt on the likelihood of reaching a new trade agreement with Canada, suggesting a tariff-based approach might be the outcome instead of a negotiated deal. His comments came ahead of an August 1 deadline for several countries to finalize new trade terms with the U.S. or face steep taxes. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has stated that Canada will not be rushed into a "bad deal." The U.S. has already imposed various tariffs on Canadian goods, disrupting the deeply integrated economies of the two nations and creating uncertainty for their trade relationship.

          <p>The UN's World Food Programme has issued a stark warning about the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, stating that nearly one-third of the population is experiencing days without eating. Malnutrition is reportedly surging, with 90,000 women and children in urgent need of treatment. The warnings have intensified as the Hamas-run health ministry reported more deaths from malnutrition. Amid mounting international pressure on Israel to lift restrictions on aid, an Israeli security official indicated that airdrops could be permitted soon, a method aid agencies consider inefficient and a distraction from meaningful action.</p>

          <p>Thousands of resident doctors in England have commenced a five-day strike after negotiations over pay with the government failed, posing a significant challenge for the National Health Service (NHS). Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the disruption but stated the NHS is working to minimize the impact, urging patients to attend appointments unless contacted. The British Medical Association (BMA) argues that doctors' pay has effectively been cut by a fifth since 2008 due to inflation and is seeking pay restoration. This is the 12th strike by resident doctors since March 2023, with previous walkouts causing over a million appointment cancellations.</p>

The closure allowed crews to connect power and communication systems for the first phase of the extension, which will add three new stations connecting downtown to the Westside. This phase is now 98% complete and expected to open in 2025. The entire seven-station expansion, which broke ground over a decade ago, aims to be completed by the 2028 Summer Olympics, significantly enhancing public transit in one of the city's busiest corridors.</p>

The government's list of "extremist" materials is vast and includes not only hate speech but also works critical of the government and materials from organizations like Meta.

An internal investigation found that players and personnel were selling their allocated tickets to third-party "bundlers" for more than face value. The league's policy prohibits profiting from tickets acquired through an NFL affiliation. Players will be fined 1.5 times the face value of the tickets they sold, while employees face a steeper penalty and will lose future ticket-buying privileges.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the widespread public humor following the viral "kiss-cam" video of an executive's infidelity is not malicious but a healthy societal reaction. The author suggests that such laughter reinforces a collective respect for the institution of marriage and acknowledges a shared, fallible human nature. The piece compares the incident to historical forms of lowbrow humor that police social norms. It pushes back against criticism that the reaction was a form of "sadistic pile-on," contending that those who engage in public indiscretions at large events have a lower expectation of privacy.</p>
