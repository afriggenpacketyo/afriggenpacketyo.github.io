          <p>Three men who followed a Nazi ideology were sentenced to prison in the UK for preparing terrorist acts. The group, which communicated online, had planned to attack an Islamic education center in Leeds and had amassed over 200 weapons, including components for a 3D-printed firearm. A judge noted they continued to adhere to their extremist beliefs, and they were apprehended after undercover officers infiltrated their online group when an attack was believed to be imminent. The case highlights the ongoing threat of domestic far-right terrorism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's recent trend of breaking with Republican leadership on key issues like the government shutdown and healthcare. An expert suggests this is not a moderation of her hard-right views but rather a consistent application of her populist, "MAGA" principles, even when they diverge from Donald Trump's position. This shift has led some Democrats to find common ground with her, challenging partisan assumptions about her political identity and signaling a potential fragmentation of the MAGA movement. Her actions reflect a complex evolution from a controversial figure to a more strategic political operator.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC has confirmed it will air the new series of "Celebrity MasterChef," despite co-presenter John Torode being sacked over an upheld allegation of using an "extremely offensive racist term." The decision was made after consulting with all celebrity participants, who agreed to the broadcast. This situation follows the previous removal of host Gregg Wallace over separate allegations, creating a complex ethical dilemma for the broadcaster as it navigates airing pre-recorded content featuring dismissed personalities. The corporation stated it was not a "straightforward decision."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union Court of Justice has ruled that pets traveling in an airplane's cargo hold are to be classified as baggage regarding airline liability. This decision means airlines are only required to pay the lower compensation limit set for lost luggage, not a higher amount for the loss of a pet. The case stemmed from a passenger whose dog, Mona, escaped on a runway and was never found, with the owner seeking greater damages for her loss. The ruling has disappointed animal rights advocates, who see it as a missed opportunity to advance animal welfare protections in travel.</p>

          <p>Global stock markets, including the UK's FTSE 100, experienced a significant sell-off following warnings from two US regional banks about bad or fraudulent loans. The news from Western Alliance Bank and Zions Bank triggered fears about wider instability and poor risk management within the banking sector. This nervousness, compounded by recent corporate failures and warnings of an AI investment bubble, drove investors towards safe-haven assets like gold, which hit a record high. The market volatility indicates growing investor anxiety about the health of the financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican from New York, has labeled Democratic NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani a "jihadist," accusing him of being a "raging antisemite" who supports Hamas. The accusation stemmed from an interview where Mamdani initially hesitated to explicitly call for Hamas to lay down its arms, though he later clarified his position at a debate. The incendiary comment highlights the intensely polarized and often personal nature of the political discourse surrounding the NYC mayoral race and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, who served as Donald Trump's national security adviser before becoming a prominent critic, has been indicted on federal charges for mishandling classified information. The 18-count indictment alleges that Bolton transmitted and retained highly sensitive diary entries from his time in the White House under the Espionage Act. Bolton has stated he looks forward to defending his conduct and exposing what he calls an abuse of power by the administration. This marks the third time in recent weeks that the Justice Department has brought criminal charges against a notable critic of the former president.</p>

          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has ruled that the BBC committed a "serious breach" of broadcasting rules by failing to disclose the narrator of a Gaza documentary was the son of a Hamas official. The program, "Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone," was deemed "materially misleading" because the omission deprived the audience of critical context needed to assess the narrator's perspective. The BBC, which had already pulled the program and apologized, has been ordered by Ofcom to broadcast a statement about the findings during prime time.

          <p>Chicago has successfully reduced drug overdose deaths by 37% since the national peak in 2023, the largest reduction among major US cities. The city's public health department credits a multi-faceted approach that includes robust drug supply surveillance, widespread distribution of naloxone and test strips through accessible venues like public libraries, and rapid response to overdose spikes using real-time data. By using advanced technology to identify new, dangerous adulterants in the drug supply and quickly disseminating that information, Chicago is empowering users and emergency services to respond more effectively. The strategy highlights the success of a proactive, data-driven public health model.</p>

The continent, which had previously eliminated the disease, is now at risk of losing its measles-free status, with Mexico and Bolivia being the hardest-hit Latin American nations. Doctors and public health officials express concern that the anti-vaccine movement in the U.S., amplified by political figures, is undermining vaccination efforts abroad.

          <p>The ongoing U.S. federal government shutdown is being described as peculiar by political analysts due to its seemingly low-stakes nature despite the significant impact on federal workers and services. The core dispute revolves around extending healthcare subsidies, a demand seen as more achievable than the ideological standoffs of past shutdowns. However, an underlying issue is the Democratic party's distrust in the president's commitment to any deal, while media attention remains focused on other major events. The Trump administration's use of executive actions to mitigate some effects, such as paying troops, further complicates the situation and reduces public pressure for a resolution.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Widespread Marketing of Unproven Stem Cell Supplements on Amazon</h2>

          <p>A new research paper finds that hundreds of dietary supplements making unsupported stem cell-related claims are being sold on Amazon, using the language of legitimate science to market their products. These supplements do not contain stem cells but vaguely claim to support the body's own stem cell function for benefits like "anti-aging" and improved cognition, using weasel words to evade regulatory scrutiny. The article explains how the 1994 DSHEA law allows such products to be sold with minimal oversight, as long as they include a disclaimer that they are not intended to "diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease." Experts warn consumers that these products are worthless and potentially risky.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has successfully shifted the Trump administration's policy on Venezuela from cooperation to confrontation, bringing the two nations to the brink of military conflict. Initially, the administration focused on practical deals with Nicolás Maduro's regime, but Rubio, a longtime advocate for toppling leftist autocrats, reframed the issue to align with Trump's focus on drugs and immigration. By portraying Maduro as a "narco-trafficking" leader tied to the Tren de Aragua gang, Rubio convinced Trump to authorize military strikes on suspected drug boats and covert CIA action, marking a significant victory for his interventionist foreign policy goals.</p>

The farewell festivities, which also included a community block party, highlight Dudamel's deep connection with the orchestra and the city over his tenure. As he prepares to depart for the New York Philharmonic, his final appearances are being treated as a victory lap for a transformative era.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece contends that the term "snowflake," long used by the political right to criticize liberals, now more accurately describes the Trump administration and its supporters. The author points to the administration's extreme reactions to criticism, threats of retribution against perceived enemies, and frequent complaints as evidence of a "veritable pity party." The article argues that while possessing immense power, the administration and its agencies, like ICE, react with disproportionate force and claims of victimhood when faced with the slightest dissent or protest. This behavior, the columnist concludes, reveals an inherent fragility that contradicts their "tough talk" image.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2022, California has made it through a summer without issuing a single "Flex Alert" urging energy conservation, a success experts attribute to a massive expansion of battery energy storage. The state's battery capacity has grown over 3,000% since 2020, allowing it to store solar power generated during the day and release it onto the grid during peak evening demand. This technological shift has significantly improved grid reliability, reduced reliance on fossil-fuel "peaker" plants, and helped California avoid the rolling blackouts that plagued it in the past. The success marks a turning point in the state's transition to a cleaner and more dependable energy system.</p>

          <p>A preliminary hearing has revealed new details about the final days of Maleesa Mooney, the 31-year-old pregnant model found dead in her refrigerator in September 2023. Prosecutors presented evidence suggesting the suspect, Magnus Humphrey, became "obsessive" during a brief, weeklong relationship with Mooney before allegedly torturing and killing her. Witnesses testified about Humphrey's possessive behavior, while forensic evidence showed Mooney was bound, gagged, and beaten before her death. A judge ruled there is enough evidence for Humphrey to stand trial for murder and torture in a case that prosecutors described as a "cold, calculated, premeditated act of violence."</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that nine months after the January fires in Los Angeles County, a majority of affected residents in Altadena and Pacific Palisades have not been able to return home. Survivors are facing significant financial strain and housing instability, with many struggling in battles with insurance companies and expecting to run out of displacement coverage soon. The hardship is particularly acute for seniors and lower-income families, some of whom are now cutting back on food and medical care. The findings indicate that the recovery process has stalled, highlighting a widening gap between survivors' needs and the support systems available to them.</p>

          <p>The Malibu City Council has declared a state of emergency and directed law enforcement to arrest homeless individuals who refuse to cease unpermitted camping, citing the severe risk of wildfires. The decision follows over 30 fires since 2021 believed to have been started by homeless individuals, a major concern in the fire-prone coastal city. The move has created a potential policy conflict, as the L.A. County Sheriff's Office, which Malibu contracts for policing, generally does not criminalize homelessness. The debate highlights the difficult balance Malibu faces between public safety, fire prevention, and compassionate approaches to its unhoused population.</p>

          <p>The first debate for New York City mayor saw heated confrontations between Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. The candidates clashed repeatedly on key issues including crime, housing affordability, and their positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with President Trump's influence looming over the discussion. Cuomo attempted to portray himself as the sensible choice for Democrats by attacking Mamdani's progressive credentials, while Mamdani criticized Cuomo for a lack of integrity and connection to the city's affordability crisis. The tense exchanges highlighted the deep divisions and personal animosities shaping the race for leadership of the nation's largest city.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to advocate for receiving long-range Tomahawk missiles, a request that could dramatically escalate the war with Russia. The crucial meeting is complicated by a preceding "very productive" phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, where they agreed to hold a summit in Hungary within two weeks. While Zelenskyy argues the mere threat of Tomahawks prompted Moscow to resume dialogue, Trump has expressed reluctance to deplete the U.S. stockpile, creating uncertainty about the future of American military support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Tomiichi Murayama, the former prime minister of Japan who issued a landmark 1995 apology for the country's World War II aggression, has died at the age of 101. As the head of the Socialist Party, Murayama led a coalition government and delivered what became known as the "Murayama statement" on the 50th anniversary of the war's end, expressing "deep remorse" for Japan's colonial rule and aggression in Asia. This apology set a precedent for subsequent governments for nearly two decades and remains a pivotal moment in Japan's post-war history. Even after retirement, Murayama was a vocal critic of nationalist politicians who sought to downplay Japan's wartime responsibilities.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of National Defence has announced a major anti-corruption purge, expelling nine senior military officials, including General He Weidong, the second-ranked general in the country. The officials were found to have "seriously violated party discipline" and committed "grave duty-related crimes" involving particularly huge sums of money. This rare public announcement of a high-level investigation signals a significant shake-up within the People's Liberation Army's top brass. The move is part of a broader campaign to enforce discipline and loyalty within the Chinese military leadership.</p>
