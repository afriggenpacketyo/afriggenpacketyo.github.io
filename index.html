          <p>A major crash involving an overturned vehicle led to the closure of the M4 motorway in both directions in Berkshire, causing significant traffic disruptions. Emergency services, including five critical care units and six ambulances from South Central Ambulance Service, responded to the incident near Reading. The westbound carriageway reopened after approximately three hours, followed by the eastbound carriageway about 30 minutes later; however, the slip road remained closed as of the article's writing. The incident occurred around 14:45 BST on Sunday, causing major delays for travelers and requiring extensive emergency response efforts.</p>

          <p>Wealthy Gulf states have pledged substantial investments to the United States, particularly to the Trump administration, but declining oil prices pose a significant challenge to their ability to fulfill these commitments. Despite efforts to diversify their economies, Gulf states remain heavily reliant on oil revenues, and lower prices impact their financial capacity to invest in projects like Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 and regional reconstruction efforts. Analysts suggest that countries like the UAE and Qatar are better positioned to manage due to current account surpluses, while Saudi Arabia may face spending pressures. The article notes that previous pledges by Gulf states have not always materialized, casting doubt on the feasibility of current promises.</p>

          <p>Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, numerous attempts to establish a lasting ceasefire in Ukraine have failed, with both nations repeatedly accusing each other of violations. Despite agreements like the Budapest Memorandum and the Minsk agreements, Russia's invasion and continued attacks have breached these pacts. In March 2025, US-led negotiations resulted in a 30-day ceasefire for energy infrastructure, but both sides quickly accused each other of violations.

          <p>Germany is grappling with the question of how to deal with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), with growing concerns about societal polarization. The AfD has been classified as "confirmed right-wing extremist" by the German domestic intelligence service, but the party has challenged this in court. The new government led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz faces the explosive question of whether to consider banning the AfD, with opponents arguing it would further divide society. Experts suggest journalists should change how they report on the AfD, focusing on countering its narratives with successful models of democracy.</p>

          <p>The United States and Israel have announced a plan to allow food and essential supplies into Gaza after a ten-week Israeli ban, but top aid groups are objecting to the proposal. The plan, which would provide aid to about 60% of Gaza's civilians, involves a private charity distributing pre-packaged food and supplies in a new zone cordoned off by the Israeli military. Humanitarian groups refuse to cooperate, citing fundamental humanitarian principles and concerns that the program is designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic. The aid groups are against the U.S. plan because they say that they cannot work with a program that refuses aid to anyone seeking it, even belligerents.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, mediated by the U.S., was shaken by overnight clashes in disputed Kashmir, with both sides accusing each other of violations. The truce followed a week of escalating violence, including Indian military strikes into Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan, which India claimed killed over 100 militants. Despite the agreement to halt military action, reports of heavy fire exchanges continued, leading to uncertainty among residents on both sides of the Line of Control. While Pakistan thanked the U.S. for facilitating the ceasefire, India remained silent on the American role.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US and China have made "substantial progress" in de-escalating the trade war following high-level talks in Geneva, Switzerland.

While Bessent did not disclose specific details, he mentioned that further information would be released on Monday and that President Trump has been informed. This development comes after both sides issued warnings before the meeting, with China insisting on easing tariffs and the US emphasizing de-escalation rather than a comprehensive trade agreement.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northwestern Peru have unearthed the ruins of a ceremonial temple dating back 4,000 to 5,000 years. The site features walls, architectural elements indicating a temple, and skeletal remains. The ruins include friezes with images of cats, reptiles, and a human body with a bird's head, preserved in "fine plaster". The team believes the temple contains information about a people group predating known inhabitants of the region, and that the temple likely contains more information about a people group that predated the known inhabitants of the region.</p>
