          <p>Smartmatic has accused Fox News and Fox Corp of intentionally destroying text messages from key executives, including Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, related to the 2020 election claims. Smartmatic argues this destruction creates an "evidentiary void" and seeks an adverse inference instruction for the jury. Fox News dismisses the allegations as a distraction from their recent legal setback, where they were ordered to disclose documents related to a DOJ investigation into Smartmatic executives. Fox News also claims Smartmatic failed to preserve evidence, including instructions from their CEO to delete relevant text messages. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the expansion of state-funded health care benefits to low-income immigrants without legal status starting in 2026 due to a $12 billion budget deficit. The decision is driven by higher-than-expected program costs and economic uncertainty, although Newsom insists California remains committed to supporting immigrants. Under the proposal, new applications for Medi-Cal will be halted, and existing enrollees may face a $100 monthly premium starting in 2027. The changes are estimated to save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029, as California grapples with the financial strain of recovery from wildfires and federal tariff policies.</p>

          <p>A cross-party committee of MPs is calling for a change in the law to prevent harm to benefit claimants, citing several deaths linked to failures by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).

The MPs recommend a statutory duty to safeguard vulnerable claimants, holding the Secretary of State accountable, and suggest including the views of people with lived experience in policy development.

The EPA will give utilities two extra years, until 2031, to comply and treat for PFOA and PFOS.

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, marking the strongest indication yet of progress against the opioid crisis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a nearly 27% drop in drug fatalities nationwide. However, these gains are threatened by proposed budget cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing addiction. Experts warn that these cuts could undermine ongoing efforts to combat the crisis and reverse the positive trend.</p>

          <p>Several UK newspapers report on the government's new plans to address overcrowding in prisons, including the early release of some inmates who break the terms of their release. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood warns of a "total breakdown of the justice system" if the issue is not addressed. Critics, including the government's victims' commissioner, argue that the early release of sexual offenders will put the public "at risk." The article underscores the challenges facing the UK's criminal justice system and the difficult decisions required to manage prison capacity.</p>

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report reveals that a 2023 plane crash that killed four people was likely caused by the pilot becoming incapacitated due to loss of cabin pressure. The NTSB also cited the decision to operate the plane without supplemental oxygen as a contributing factor. Investigators were unable to determine the exact cause of the cabin pressure loss or whether it occurred rapidly or gradually. The plane continued on autopilot for an hour after the pilot became unresponsive before crashing in a wooded area in Virginia.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to accept a luxury jet from Qatar has drawn criticism from both Democrats and some of his staunchest supporters. Critics question Qatar's motives, citing allegations of funding terrorist groups, and accuse Trump of accepting a "bribe." The White House defends the deal, emphasizing transparency and compliance with all applicable laws. However, concerns persist about potential conflicts of interest, given Trump's business ties to Qatar and the past lobbying work of Attorney General Pam Bondi for the Qatari government.</p>
