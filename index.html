          <p>Volcanic activity is increasing around Naples, Italy, with thousands of earthquakes recorded recently, raising concerns for the half a million people living within the area's volcanic "red zone." The activity is centered on Campi Flegrei, a massive volcanic caldera located west of Mount Vesuvius that stretches for 125 miles under urban areas. Italian scientists from the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology are closely monitoring the seismic events and ground deformation. The situation highlights the constant threat posed by the region's geology and the challenge of protecting a large population living in close proximity to active supervolcanoes.</p>

          <h2>New Research Explores the Science Behind Willfully Changing Personality Traits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 13:46:05 EDT</div>

          <p>A new book by writer Olga Khazan, titled "Me, But Better," explores the science of personality change, detailing her personal journey to redesign her own traits. Unhappy with her anxious and introverted nature, Khazan engaged in activities far outside her comfort zone, such as improv comedy, to become more outgoing. The article also features insights from Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala, who explains that it is possible to alter seemingly fixed personality traits through targeted behavioral interventions. The research suggests that personality is not as immutable as once thought, offering a hopeful perspective on personal growth and self-improvement.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the next two weeks will be historic for trade, expressing confidence that the Trump administration will secure significant deals with key partners like the European Union. He asserted that the president's strategy of threatening steep tariffs, with an August 1st hard deadline, has successfully brought negotiating partners to the table. Lutnick suggested that countries must either open their markets to American goods or face substantial tariffs, a policy he believes will ultimately benefit U.S. workers and manufacturers. He also dismissed concerns about consumer price hikes, predicting that inflation will remain stable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from Senator Joni Ernst's office has found that the U.S. State Department under the Biden administration authorized over $1.2 million in taxpayer funds for renovating swimming pools at embassies and residences, including in countries like Iraq, Haiti, and Russia. The spending included a $41,259 contract for the embassy pool in Moscow, approved three months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and $444,000 for a dehumidification system at the Baghdad embassy pool. Senator Ernst criticized the expenditures as wasteful, highlighting the spending as an example of what she terms the "splashy spending of the Biden years."</p>

She criticized the tactics used by federal agents, such as wearing masks and using unmarked vehicles, which she says resemble kidnappings and terrorize residents, including U.S. citizens. Bass argued that the fear has crippled local businesses and daily life, as many are afraid to leave their homes. She also condemned the deployment of the National Guard to the city as an unnecessary political stunt that misuses taxpayer funds and military personnel.</p>

          <p>Todd Lyons, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), confirmed a significant shift in enforcement policy, stating that agents will now arrest any person they encounter who is in the country without legal authorization. While noting that the agency's priority remains on deporting serious criminal offenders, this new directive broadens the scope to include non-criminals, often referred to as "collateral" arrests. Lyons attributed this change to a lack of cooperation from sanctuary jurisdictions, which he claims forces agents to conduct more at-large arrests in communities. The agency is also increasing its focus on worksite enforcement, targeting both unauthorized workers and their employers.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged to remain in office despite exit polls projecting his ruling coalition will lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election was marked by public frustration over rising prices and the looming threat of U.S. tariffs. A loss of the majority in the upper house, following a similar defeat in the more powerful lower house last year, would significantly weaken the coalition's legislative influence. Analysts suggest the result reflects voter dissatisfaction with Ishiba's leadership and could trigger a challenge for control of the Liberal Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>Sources suggest that the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea presents a prime opportunity for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The meeting could potentially occur on the sidelines of the summit, which runs from October 30 to November 1, or during a visit by Trump to China beforehand. This development follows recent high-level talks between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, where both sides expressed a strong desire for a presidential meeting to help stabilize fluctuating bilateral relations amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The small desert community of Newberry Springs, California, a near-ghost town on the historic Route 66, is hoping for a revival as the famed highway approaches its 100th anniversary in 2026. Once a bustling stop, the town withered after being bypassed by Interstate 40 in the 1970s. Now, local residents and business owners are banding together to attract a new wave of tourists by organizing events, creating new attractions like a vintage trailer campground, and leading historical tours. They hope to capitalize on the centennial celebration to bring new life and economic activity back to their small slice of Americana.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that traditional methods of measuring the U.S. labor market, such as job creation numbers and the unemployment rate, are becoming obsolete in the modern economy. With the rise of the "over-employed," the gig economy, and remote work, focusing on jobs alone provides an incomplete picture. The author suggests a shift towards measuring income from all sources as a more relevant indicator of economic health. This would involve aggregating data from tax returns, social security, and private platforms like Etsy and Uber to better reflect how Americans are actually earning a living.

          <p>Four people, including two children and two adults, are still in the hospital following a school coach crash in Somerset, UK, that killed a 10-year-old boy. A major incident was declared after the coach, carrying pupils from Minehead Middle School, left the road and slid down a 20-foot slope. The school was closed as the community mourned, leaving tributes and flowers at the gates. The head teacher described the incident as horrific, and local fundraisers have collected over £40,000 to support those affected by the tragedy as the police investigation continues.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas are voicing increasing frustration and a deep sense of mistrust towards their own government's handling of negotiations for their release. Campaigners and relatives, such as Gil Dickman, whose cousin was killed in captivity, feel that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration is not prioritizing the lives of the hostages. They point to the government's insistence on certain military conditions and the influence of far-right coalition partners as major obstacles to securing a comprehensive deal. Many are now placing their hopes in U.S. pressure to compel the Israeli government to finalize an agreement.</p>

          <p>England defender Jess Carter has revealed she has been subjected to significant racial abuse on social media throughout the Euro 2025 tournament. In response, Carter announced she is taking a step back from social media, and the Lionesses team stated they will stop taking a knee before matches as the gesture is not effectively tackling the issue. The Football Association condemned the hate crime and is working with police to identify those responsible. The incident has drawn widespread support for Carter and has renewed calls for social media companies to take more urgent action against online racism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan opposition for circumventing a 2021 law by restoring the Confederate-era names of several U.S. Army bases. To bypass the legislation, Hegseth claims the bases are being renamed after different historical soldiers who coincidentally share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes, such as Braxton Bragg and Henry Benning. The House Armed Services Committee, with support from two Republicans, voted to block this move, arguing it flouts congressional authority and honors individuals who fought against the United States to preserve slavery. The action has been described by critics as an insult and legally questionable.</p>
