        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports fell by 1.7% year-on-year in May, marking the steepest drop since September 2024, primarily due to declining shipments to the U.S. and China. The decrease, though less severe than economists' predictions, highlights Japan's struggle with ongoing trade uncertainties and potential U.S. tariffs. The Bank of Japan noted that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade-related factors, which could negatively impact domestic corporate profits. President Trump reportedly stated that Japan was being "tough" in trade talks, potentially leading to increased tariffs if a deal isn't reached by July 9. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels, and restaurants, allowing ICE to continue worksite enforcement operations targeting unauthorized immigrants. This decision follows concerns among industry leaders about the impact of immigration crackdowns on their foreign-born workers. Despite acknowledging the reliance of these industries on immigrant employees, the administration reaffirmed its commitment to safeguarding public safety, national security, and economic stability through worksite enforcement.
