          <h2>Apple to Appeal Court Ruling That Found Company Lied in Epic Games Trial</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 10:18:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A judge has found Apple in contempt of court, stating the company and one of its executives lied under oath during the Epic Games trial, specifically about the timing of a 27% fee levied on some App Store purchases. The judge has referred the matter to U.S. attorneys for potential criminal contempt proceedings. Apple strongly disagrees with the decision and plans to appeal, though they will comply with the court's order. This ruling is a significant rebuke of Apple's conduct during the trial, which initially focused on Apple's App Store policies and developer restrictions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration, led by Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, has announced its commitment to dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs across the federal government, advocating for a "system of merit." Miller stated that the administration aims to prevent society from devolving into what he termed "communist, woke, DEI strangulation." This initiative includes shutting down DEI offices and leveraging federal funding to pressure universities to eliminate DEI programs. The administration argues that hiring based on merit advances innovation and economic growth, emphasizing that competence should be prioritized over demographic factors in critical sectors like healthcare.</p>

          <p>U.S. applications for unemployment benefits have risen to a two-month high, reaching 241,000 for the week ending April 26, signaling potential weakening in the labor market.

The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits has also climbed to 1.92 million, the highest since November 2021.

          <p>With persistent inflation challenging savings, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns that outpace inflation, locking in high rates for the CD term, typically insured by the FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000. Short-term CDs, particularly those with terms around six months to one year, often have higher interest rates than longer-term options due to the inverted yield curve. Online banks and credit unions generally offer more competitive rates compared to traditional brick-and-mortar banks. Investing in CDs can help savers reach their financial goals more quickly.</p>

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's decision to freeze billions in federal funding, dozens of Harvard University professors are pledging to take temporary pay cuts to support the school's legal battle. Eighty-four senior faculty members have committed to donating 10% of their salaries this year, totaling an estimated $2.5 million. This move aims to protect the university's independence and support staff and students who may be affected by the funding cuts. The Trump administration has cited alleged antisemitic incidents on campus and demanded leadership reforms as reasons for the funding freeze.</p>

Caremark negotiated a lower net price for Wegovy, offering savings to clients.

CEO Chris Kempczinski noted that economic pressures have broadened, affecting traffic from middle-income consumers. Despite the challenges, McDonald's plans to focus on value meals and menu innovations to attract customers back, including the return of snack wraps and tie-in meals with the Minecraft video game franchise.</p>

Advocates and attorneys report difficulties in accessing clients, delays in legal proceedings, and a lack of communication between BoP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), raising concerns about the violation of detainees' rights.

          <p>Financial advisors highlight a lesser-known 401(k) feature that can significantly boost retirement savings: after-tax contributions and subsequent Roth conversions. Some plans allow contributions beyond the standard $23,500 limit, up to a maximum of $70,000, including employer matches. Converting after-tax funds to Roth allows for tax-free growth, though many plans do not offer this feature. It's crucial to convert after-tax funds to Roth periodically to minimize future tax liabilities; financial advisors recommend prioritizing regular 401(k) deferrals first. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite suspending operations in Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, many Western companies, including Ikea, McDonald's, and Mercedes-Benz, are maintaining their trademark rights in the country. This strategy allows them to prevent others from using or imitating their brands and potentially re-enter the market in the future. Some companies, like Unilever and British American Tobacco, have transferred trademark rights to their former Russian subsidiaries. The move is seen as a formal procedure to avoid losing brand recognition and facilitate a potential return when the political situation changes.</p>

This move comes after Doocy has been known for challenging Trump-supporting talking points on the show. Doocy assured viewers that he will continue to speak up, and President Trump offered a congratulatory video message.</p>

Testimony also revealed that items not belonging to Nichols, including stolen credit cards, were found in his car. Another officer, Preston Hemphill, who was at the traffic stop but not the location of the beating, testified that he heard Martin say "let go of my gun" after Nichols was forcibly removed from his car.</p>

As part of the deal, Ukraine will determine where and what to extract, and the investment fund will be managed jointly by both countries.
