          <p>An Air India passenger plane, en route from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick, crashed shortly after takeoff, resulting in over 200 fatalities and several injuries. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, carrying 242 passengers and crew, crashed into a residential area near the airport, causing additional casualties on the ground. Initial reports suggest a possible issue with the plane's wing flaps during takeoff, though investigations are ongoing to determine the exact cause of the crash. Emergency services are at the scene, and authorities are working to provide support to the affected families. The crash marks a tragic event in aviation history and raises questions about flight safety protocols. Optimism for such an event is relatively low. </p>

          <p>This article explains the differences between Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds as investment options. ETFs trade like individual stocks with fluctuating prices during market hours, while mutual funds are priced at the end of the day and bought/sold directly. Both can track benchmark indices or specific sectors, but ETFs generally have lower expense ratios and no minimum investment thresholds. Financial experts often recommend beginners start with an S&P 500 index fund (either ETF or mutual fund) and then diversify with a few individual stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that it is easier for students with disabilities to sue schools for violating their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The case centered on Ava Tharpe, a teenager with epilepsy whose new school refused to accommodate her needs after moving to Minnesota. The court found that the family did not need to prove "bad faith" or "gross misjudgment" by school officials to seek compensatory damages under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. This decision lowers the burden of proof for students seeking to enforce their rights in court.</p>

          <p>Immigrant rights groups are seeking "emergency relief" from a federal judge to halt the Trump administration's increasing use of expedited removal. The groups allege that ICE officers are arresting noncitizens in courthouses after DHS dismisses their cases, denying them a fair hearing before deportation. Those targeted include asylum seekers and individuals with pending petitions for relief, creating fear in immigrant communities. A DHS spokesperson defended the courthouse arrests, stating that those without valid claims will be subject to swift deportation, while those with valid claims will continue in immigration proceedings.</p>

Despite the tensions, the Trump administration is still planning to meet with Iran for nuclear program talks.

          <p>This article discusses the rising geopolitical tensions as President Trump takes a more negative stance on nuclear talks with Iran, leading to the withdrawal of some American personnel from the Middle East. Trump's inflexibility on domestic uranium enrichment in Iran is a major roadblock to a deal, potentially leading to military action by the U.S. or Israel. The IAEA has declared Iran in noncompliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations, further complicating the situation. Despite ongoing talks, the risk of military conflict between Israel and Iran looms, with significant implications for global markets and political stability.</p>

          <p>Kenyan police used tear gas to disperse protesters in Nairobi who were angered by the death of blogger Albert Ojwang while in police custody. Protests turned violent, with reports of vehicles being set on fire, after President William Ruto acknowledged Ojwang's death occurred "at the hands of the police." Ojwang was arrested for allegedly defaming the country's deputy police chief, and police initially claimed he died after hitting his head against a cell wall. An autopsy revealed Ojwang's injuries suggested assault as the cause of death.</p>
