          <p>Germany's women's Bundesliga has expanded to 14 clubs and kicked off its season with a record attendance, signaling growing interest in the sport. The league has secured increased free-to-air broadcast coverage, aiming to boost its visibility and commercial appeal. However, despite these positive steps, concerns remain about the league's competitiveness, which is still dominated by Bayern Munich and Wolfsburg. The article contrasts its development with the more commercially advanced WSL in England and the structurally competitive NWSL in the United States.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has suspended production at key UK factories and instructed staff to stay home after a significant cyber attack disrupted its IT systems. The attack has impacted car sales during a crucial period for new vehicle registrations and is causing ripple effects through its supply chain, with parts suppliers and repair garages also affected. A hacker group known as "Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters" has claimed responsibility, though JLR states there is no evidence of customer data theft. The disruption is a major blow to the company, which is working to restore its complex systems.</p>

Dorries cited issues like rising crime and immigration as reasons for her move, expressing her belief that only Reform's leader, Nigel Farage, can address the country's problems.

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order to begin the process of rebranding the Department of Defense as the Department of War, a name it held until 1947. The order aims to "project strength and resolve" and will initially allow the new name to be used as a secondary title. Proponents argue the change refocuses the department on a "warrior ethos," away from what they term "woke ideology." The move has drawn criticism from Democrats for being a "childish idea," and a permanent change would likely require congressional approval and incur significant costs.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a preliminary ruling stating that pork and its by-products from the European Union are being dumped into its market, causing "material injury" to the domestic industry. As a result, Beijing will require importers of these products to provide corresponding deposits based on anti-dumping margins determined for each company. This move signals an escalation in trade tensions between China and the EU, potentially impacting European agricultural exporters significantly. The final determination on the tariffs is still pending further investigation.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily halted a lower court's order that would have shut down the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades. The facility, built by Governor Ron DeSantis's administration to support President Trump's immigration policies, can now continue to hold migrant detainees pending a full appeal. The original injunction was granted after environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe sued, arguing the facility was built without a required environmental review and threatens sensitive wetlands. The DeSantis administration and the Department of Homeland Security praised the stay as a win for border security.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Europe is facing a period of significant challenge, with some commentators drawing parallels to China's "century of humiliation." The continent is described as being caught between the policy pressures of the United States under President Trump and the strategic ambitions of China under President Xi. The piece reflects a growing sense of anxiety in Europe, suggesting that a difficult summer, marked by geopolitical subservience and economic strain, is extending into the autumn. It points to a pessimistic outlook on the continent's ability to assert its own interests on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has left the country just days before a Supreme Court ruling that could see him imprisoned. His departure also coincided with a parliamentary vote for a new prime minister following the court's removal of his daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, from the office. Thaksin, who had been serving a reduced sentence in a hospital, claimed he was traveling for medical reasons but diverted his flight to Dubai. The events mark a significant decline in the political power of the influential Shinawatra family and add to Thailand's ongoing political instability.</p>

The comments came after a federal judge ruled against breaking up the company, a decision that added $230 billion to Alphabet's market capitalization. President Trump congratulated Pichai on the outcome, incorrectly stating that the lawsuit was prosecuted by the Biden administration, when it was in fact initiated during his own first term.

          <p>Argentinian President Javier Milei's administration is aiming to unlock the country's vast copper mining potential to attract foreign investment and stabilize the economy. A new incentive scheme, known as RIGI, offers significant tax and trade benefits to large-scale investors, with copper projects estimated to represent $16 billion of the initial interest. Major mining companies like BHP and Glencore are exploring opportunities, with some analysts describing Argentina as one of the most exciting new frontiers for copper. The push comes as global demand for the metal is expected to surge due to the green energy transition and AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his intention to impose "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that do not move production to the United States. Speaking at a dinner with tech leaders, he clarified that firms like Apple, which have expanded domestic investments, would likely be spared. The policy is part of a broader effort to onshore the U.S. semiconductor supply chain, a goal shared by major chip manufacturers like TSMC and Samsung, who are already building plants in the country. The exact details of the tariff rates and the criteria for exemptions remain unclear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Potential buyers seeking a stake in Starbucks' China business have reportedly submitted offers valuing the unit at as much as US$5 billion, according to sources familiar with the discussions. This valuation is based on an earnings multiple of about 10 times its projected 2025 Ebitda, which is comparable to its local rival, Luckin Coffee. The sale comes as Starbucks faces significant challenges in the competitive Chinese market, characterized by sluggish growth and the rise of domestic brands. A successful deal at this valuation would represent one of the largest divestments of a China unit by a global consumer company. (not investment advice)</p>
