          <p>Spotify's stock experienced a significant drop of over 11% after the company's second-quarter results and third-quarter guidance failed to meet Wall Street expectations. The music streaming giant reported a net loss and cited rising personnel and marketing costs as contributing factors. While monthly active users and premium subscribers saw growth, advertising-supported revenue slightly declined. CEO Daniel Ek acknowledged execution challenges in the advertising business but expressed confidence in the long-term strategy, highlighting potential in programmatic ads and new AI features.

          <p>Boeing significantly narrowed its quarterly losses and reported a 35% revenue increase, driven by the highest number of aircraft deliveries since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg labeled 2025 as a potential "turnaround year," pointing to improved production stability and performance, although the company still reported an adjusted loss of $1.24 per share. The results were impacted by a charge related to a Justice Department settlement over the 737 Max crashes. While the company is stabilizing production of the 737 Max, it announced that certification for its Max 7 and Max 10 models is now delayed until 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a visit to his Scottish golf resort, Donald Trump held a meeting with Scotland's First Minister John Swinney to discuss several key issues. The conversation covered the impact of U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky, with Swinney advocating for an exemption for the vital Scottish export. They also discussed the ongoing conflict in Gaza and U.S. taxes on North Sea oil and gas production, which Trump criticized as being too high. The meeting concluded a four-day trip for Trump, who also gifted Swinney a figurine of an American bald eagle while receiving historical documents related to his mother's Scottish heritage.</p>

          <p>In accordance with his wishes for a celebration rather than a somber event, Ozzy Osbourne will be honored with a public procession in his hometown of Birmingham. The city council announced the cortège will travel along Broad Street, accompanied by a live brass band, allowing thousands of fans to pay their respects before a small, private family funeral. A source close to the family stated they are planning an intimate service that is a "celebration of his life," noting that the rock legend "would never want a mope-fest." Osbourne, who passed away at 76, had previously written that he wanted his funeral to be a time to say thanks.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk plunged 23% after the company cut its full-year sales and profit forecasts and announced a change in leadership. The maker of the popular Wegovy weight-loss drug lowered its outlook due to weaker-than-expected U.S. sales growth, citing persistent competition from compounded drugs and a slowing market expansion. Company veteran Maziar Mike Doustdar will take over as the new CEO on August 7. The significant drop in share price reflects investor concern over the company's ability to maintain its growth trajectory amid increasing market pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

The companies argue the merger would streamline national deliveries by eliminating handoff delays, but the plan faces intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators concerned about market consolidation. If approved, the deal would likely pressure the remaining major U.S. railroads, BNSF and CSX, to pursue a similar merger to remain competitive. The railroads plan to submit their application for approval within six months, hoping for a decision by early 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

For Goldman Sachs, exiting the partnership would mark the end of a challenging venture into consumer credit that was marked by high growth but also significant loan-loss provisions and regulatory scrutiny. The deal would provide Apple with a more established and disciplined partner in JPMorgan, which is expected to negotiate stricter terms for servicing the popular credit card.</p>

However, Lutnick clarified that ongoing trade negotiations with China are progressing on a separate and longer timeline. He stated that President Trump has rejected multiple offers from other nations for partial market access, insisting instead on completely open markets for American goods. The administration is moving forward with its "reciprocal" tariff plan, setting new import tax rates that are scheduled to take effect on August 1. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries has strongly criticized the Trump administration's plan to impose a 15% tariff on medicines imported from the European Union. The industry group called the tariff a "blunt instrument" that would disrupt supply chains, harm investment in research, and ultimately hurt patient access to essential drugs on both sides of the Atlantic. The move represents a departure from a long-standing World Trade Organization agreement that keeps medicines and their active ingredients tariff-free. The EU has stated that it will not reciprocate, and pharmaceutical imports from the U.S. will remain duty-free. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group issued a 2025 earnings forecast that fell short of Wall Street expectations, signaling that the health insurance industry continues to struggle with elevated medical costs. The company's stock fell as it projected its medical care ratio would remain high, driven by more seniors undergoing procedures delayed during the pandemic and increased use of emergency services. The disappointing outlook comes after the company suspended its 2025 guidance in May and announced the abrupt departure of its CEO.

The report highlights the economic challenges of the administration's trade strategy, particularly in manufacturing-heavy swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin.

          <p>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, is a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated head trauma, commonly found in athletes and military veterans. The condition gained renewed attention after the gunman in the recent Manhattan office shooting left a note claiming he suffered from it, though no evidence has confirmed he had the disease. CTE can only be definitively diagnosed through a post-mortem autopsy that looks for specific changes in the brain's tau proteins. Symptoms, which often appear years after the injuries, can include memory loss, confusion, and significant mood changes, highlighting the long-term risks of head impacts.</p>

This modern genetic research confirms long-held archaeological theories that were previously based only on female figurines found at the site.
