          <p>Snap's stock price plummeted after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue but declined to provide guidance for the second quarter, citing macroeconomic uncertainties and potential constraints on advertising demand. Snap CEO Derek Andersen noted that some advertisers reported an impact from changes to the de minimis exemption. The company lowered its full-year adjusted operating expenses range and reported an increase in daily active users. Snap's Snapchat+ subscription service reached 15 million subscribers, contributing to a 75% increase in "other revenue" (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Harvard University released two reports detailing antisemitism and anti-Muslim bias on campus, revealing widespread discomfort and alienation among students. The antisemitism report highlighted bias in coursework and social life, intensified by the Israel-Hamas war, while the anti-Muslim bias report found students feeling "abandoned and silenced," with many fearing professional repercussions for expressing political opinions. Harvard President Alan Garber apologized for the university's failures and promised to address the issues. The reports come as Harvard faces scrutiny from the Trump administration over accusations of antisemitism and potential funding cuts, with the university vowing to combat bigotry. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration dismissed scientists working on the National Climate Assessment, a federal report focused on the effects of climate change on the U.S. This action is seen as an effort to downplay the scientific reality of climate change, which contradicts the administration's pro-fossil fuel energy strategy. The National Climate Assessment is mandated by Congress and used by various entities to make decisions about planning, infrastructure, conservation, and public health. While the administration cannot legally end the assessment, it can slow down the process by limiting scientists' involvement.</p>

          <p>Representative Marcy Kaptur, a vulnerable House Democrat, is facing criticism for opposing President Trump's tariff plans, despite her long history of supporting tariffs to protect union jobs in Ohio. Kaptur has argued that Trump's tariffs will raise prices, but she previously advocated for tariffs to address trade imbalances. The United Auto Workers (UAW), a union Kaptur has supported, favors Trump's tariffs. Kaptur defends her current stance by arguing that targeted tariffs are necessary but criticizes Trump's across-the-board approach as harmful to working families.</p>

One proposal involves a $5,000 payment to mothers after giving birth, an idea Trump has expressed support for. While similar baby bonus programs exist in other countries, the proposal has sparked debate in the US, with some critics viewing it as a distraction from deeper societal investments that parents need. Concerns also exist that the policy may be intertwined with a political agenda focused on traditional gender roles and reproductive constraints.</p>

Tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, but the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports that had resulted from separate levies. Additional tariffs on auto parts that were set to start by May 3 will also still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years.</p>

The Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., is meant to honor victims of the Holocaust and preserve its history for future generations.</p>

          <p>A study comparing life expectancy from 1900 to 2000 reveals that many southern states experienced little improvement, especially for women. In contrast, northeastern and western states saw significant gains. West Virginia had the smallest increase for women, while New York had the largest. Overall, life expectancy increased more for men than women, and improvements for men plateaued around 1950. Researchers attribute these regional disparities to variations in state public health policies, socioeconomic factors, and tobacco regulations.</p>
