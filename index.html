          <p>Police in Somerset are assessing footage from Glastonbury Festival after controversial on-stage comments were made by rap-punk duo Bob Vylan and rap group Kneecap. During a live BBC broadcast, Bob Vylan led chants calling for "death to the IDF," which the government condemned and the BBC called "deeply offensive." The police will now determine if the comments constitute a criminal offense. The review also includes Kneecap's performance, whose member Mo Chara is currently facing a separate terrorism-related charge.</p>

          <p>Civil servants in parts of China are reportedly being banned from dining out due to hyper-localized austerity measures that are even more stringent than central government regulations. An official in Sichuan province described the phenomenon as "ceng ceng jia ma," or "adding extra layer upon layer of control," where department heads impose such rules to avoid scrutiny. This lifestyle change reflects the ever-shifting and intense pressure on officials to demonstrate fiscal prudence at all levels of government.</p>

          <p>President Trump's massive spending package, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate after a dramatic, hours-long vote. The measure advanced 51-49 only after several Republican holdouts, including Senators Mike Lee and Rick Scott, changed their votes to yes under pressure. This procedural victory for GOP leadership now sets up a final, contentious vote on the nearly 1,000-page bill, which Democrats are attempting to delay by forcing a full reading on the Senate floor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's recent halt on rare earth exports is accelerating efforts in Western countries to establish alternative production facilities to reduce dependency. According to an American firm in the industry, building out this new capacity will be a costly and lengthy process due to significant technical hurdles. Analysts suggest that government support, such as subsidies and protective tariffs, will likely be necessary for these new ventures to become financially viable and compete with China's long-standing market dominance.

          <h2>Explainer: The Urban Heat Island Effect and Why Cities Are Hotter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the science behind the "urban heat island effect," a phenomenon causing cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Dark, hard surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's energy, while waste heat from vehicles and air conditioning further elevates temperatures. Conversely, the countryside benefits from the natural cooling effects of vegetation and water. As climate change intensifies heatwaves, this effect makes growing urban populations particularly vulnerable to extreme heat.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched through Venice to oppose the lavish wedding of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, arguing it represents the exploitation of their city. Activists carried banners reading "Kisses Yes, Bezos No," criticizing the event as an affront to a city already struggling with overtourism, high housing costs, and the threat of flooding. The demonstration contrasted sharply with the star-studded, multi-day affair, which critics view as disconnected from the realities faced by ordinary Venetian residents.</p>
