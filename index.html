          <p>Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka was left out of the England squad for their World Cup qualifier against Andorra after only completing one full training session during the week. Head coach Thomas Tuchel indicated that Saka's omission was likely related to his fitness, as the 23-year-old had missed Tuchel's first camp due to injury. Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins was also excluded and returned home with a minor injury, while the reason for Conor Gallagher's omission remains unclear. England remains unbeaten in World Cup qualifying, having won their opening two matches. The optimism score for this article is 75.</p>
