          <p>Democratic legislators have fled Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum for a vote on a new congressional map. The proposed map, backed by former President Trump, could create five new GOP-leaning districts by redrawing boundaries in major urban areas and the Rio Grande Valley. Democrats accuse Governor Greg Abbott of leveraging disaster relief funds to force the vote, while Abbott has threatened to remove the absent lawmakers from their positions and noted they could face legal consequences for leaving. This is the latest instance of Texas Democrats using a quorum break to protest Republican legislation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is bracing for significant travel disruption as Storm Floris is expected to bring high winds, prompting the Met Office to issue an amber weather warning for most of Scotland. The warning, effective Monday, signals a potential "danger to life" from the storm, with gusts predicted to reach up to 70mph in exposed areas. Train operators like LNER and Avanti West Coast have advised against travel in affected regions, and ferry services have been cancelled. This is the sixth named storm of the season and is considered unusual for August, though not unprecedented.</p>

          <p>A tragic incident occurred off the coast of Yemen when a boat carrying approximately 150 migrants capsized in bad weather, resulting in the deaths of more than 60 people. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) confirmed that 68 bodies have been recovered, with most victims believed to be Ethiopian nationals seeking passage to Gulf Arab states for work. This event highlights the extreme dangers of the migration route through Yemen, which the IOM describes as one of the world's most perilous, with thousands having died or gone missing over the last decade.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotelier Ong Beng Seng has pleaded guilty to charges in a major corruption case that has captivated Singapore, a nation known for its low tolerance of graft. Ong is accused of providing lavish gifts, including Formula 1 tickets and a private jet ride, to former transportation minister Subramaniam Iswaran in exchange for business advantages. The case, which led to both men's arrests in 2023, has shocked the city-state, where public officials are held to strict standards. Ong, who was instrumental in bringing the F1 Grand Prix to Singapore, faces potential jail time for his role in the scandal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a stalemate in diplomatic negotiations, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly pushing for a "military solution" to rescue the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. An Israeli official indicated a growing belief that Hamas is not interested in a deal, prompting a shift toward expanded military operations.

          <p>Chinese biotech companies Innovent and BeOne are projected to reach profitability in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the country's burgeoning biotech sector. According to analysts, Innovent is expected to post its first full-year profit, largely driven by strong sales of its new weight-loss drug, mazdutide. This shift to profitability demonstrates the maturation of China's biotech industry, which has historically relied on investor funding. The success of these firms indicates they are creating substantial value for both patients and government payers within the Chinese healthcare market. (not investment advice)</p>

As of 2025, the actual starting salary for all NASA astronaut candidates is $152,258, with pay increasing upon completion of training.

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a novel upgrade to enhance the survivability of combat drones. The concept involves equipping small or medium-sized drones with side-mounted rocket boosters for "terminal evasion." These boosters would allow a drone to perform sudden, high-G maneuvers in the final moments before an anti-aircraft missile impact, making it extremely difficult to track. According to a research paper, digital simulations showed this system could dramatically increase a drone's survival rate to nearly 90 percent, a significant improvement over current battlefield statistics.</p>

          <p>Negotiations between Senate Democrats and the White House to secure the release of billions in previously approved government funds in exchange for confirming a batch of Trump administration nominees have collapsed. Sources indicate that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was seeking funds for the NIH, global health programs, and humanitarian aid. A deal was believed to be close before President Trump reportedly rejected it. The failure leaves around 140 presidential nominees awaiting confirmation, with Trump accusing Democrats of "political extortion" and Schumer blaming the president for scuttling the agreement.</p>

          <p>Approximately 3,200 unionized Boeing workers are set to go on strike after rejecting a contract offer from the company. The members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) District 837, who build military aircraft and weapons systems at facilities in Missouri and Illinois, voted against the proposed agreement. The union stated that its members deserve a contract that provides security and recognizes their expertise. Boeing expressed disappointment with the rejection of its offer, which it said included significant wage growth, and confirmed it has implemented a contingency plan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has stated that the tariff rates announced by the Trump administration for over 60 trading partners are "pretty much set." Following a recent executive order, a baseline 10% tariff will apply to all imports from these countries starting August 7, with some nations like Canada facing higher rates on certain goods. Greer indicated that while he is in discussion with trade ministers, he does not expect the rates to be negotiated down, as they are part of the president's strategy to rebalance trade relationships. This hardline stance is expected to have a notable impact on the economy.</p>

          <p>In an effort to block a vote on a new congressional map favoring Republicans, at least 51 Democratic state lawmakers have fled Texas, denying the legislature its required quorum. The lawmakers, who have traveled to Illinois, are protesting a redistricting plan backed by Donald Trump that could add five GOP seats in the U.S. House. This tactic, which could result in daily fines and threats of arrest for the absent members, aims to halt the special legislative session. The article notes the political maneuver highlights the contentious nature of gerrymandering across the U.S., including in states controlled by Democrats.</p>

          <p>China's plan to build a new, massive embassy at the former Royal Mint site in London has ignited a major controversy involving security, espionage, and human rights concerns. Opponents, including Hong Kong pro-democracy activists, fear the facility could be used to harass dissidents and that its proximity to the city's financial district poses an espionage risk via tapping into fiber optic cables. Local residents also object due to fears of protests and security risks. The UK government, seeking to balance economic ties with security, has taken over the final decision after the local council initially rejected the plans.</p>

          <p>A recent report explores the significant financial burden of egg freezing, a medical procedure growing in popularity among women seeking to preserve their fertility. The all-in cost for a single cycle, including retrieval, freezing, and storage, averages between $12,000 and $13,000, and many women undergo multiple cycles to improve their chances of a future successful pregnancy. While some employers are beginning to offer coverage, the majority of women must pay out-of-pocket for the expensive procedure. Doctors caution that despite the high cost, egg freezing does not guarantee a future pregnancy, as there are success-rate drop-offs at each stage.</p>

          <p>In an interview, prominent economist Jeffrey Sachs cautioned that the United States' confrontational stance toward China could become a self-fulfilling prophecy leading to conflict. He argued that the U.S. initiated the trade war and must show prudence, as both nations have leverage over each other and mutual gains from cooperation. Sachs also predicted that while trade frictions will persist, they will likely remain within certain limits. He advised that from a long-term perspective, China should focus on expanding exports to markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America rather than relying on hostile U.S. and European markets.</p>

The Boeing 787, carrying 219 passengers and 11 crew members, was ascending when the issue occurred. The pilot communicated the failure to air traffic control and safely returned the aircraft to Dulles. No injuries were reported, and all passengers deplaned safely at the gate. The flight was subsequently canceled, and the airline arranged alternate travel for the affected customers.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume miles into the sky. The eruption occurred just days after a massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake shook the region. Seismologists suggest the events are likely related, theorizing that the quake's seismic waves could have "shaken loose" the magma system of the volcano, which may have already been close to erupting. The eruption prompted an aviation alert, but the sparsely populated area is not under immediate threat, and reserve employees have been evacuated as a precaution.</p>

Local councilors shared a photo of the rodent, which was compared to the size of a small cat, to highlight what they describe as a "growing problem" in the area. The discovery was made by a pest control worker, and officials insist it is not an isolated incident, noting that rat populations are increasing. The story has gained national attention, which local representatives hope will spur effective action to address the community's recurring rodent issue.</p>
