          <h2>NATO Corruption Probe Highlights Defense Sector Risks Amid Spending Boom</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An unfolding corruption investigation at the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) involving contract irregularities for ammunition and drones serves as a reminder of the risks associated with increased defense spending. The probe, initiated by NATO itself, involves detentions across multiple European countries and the US, coordinated by Eurojust. With NATO countries increasing defense expenditure due to the Russia-Ukraine war, experts emphasize the need for thorough oversight and transparency to prevent corruption and ensure efficient use of public funds. The lack of transparency mechanisms in the defense sector, coupled with increased lobbying, raises concerns about potential inefficiencies and abuse of power.</p>

          <p>The father of Guy Edward Bartkus, the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, expressed shock and disbelief, stating his son "just changed" after moving to Twentynine Palms. FBI investigators believe Bartkus, who harbored anti-natalist beliefs, packed his car with explosives and intentionally targeted the clinic. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities examining Bartkus' online posts and writings. The father recalled his son's childhood fascination with how things worked, including an accidental fire, but never imagined him capable of such violence, as the FBI is now treating the case as an international act of terrorism.</p>

          <p>This article from DW examines the varying degrees of success and integration of far-right parties across Europe. While Germany considers banning the Alternative for Germany (AfD), other countries have similar parties in government or leading coalitions, such as the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÃ–), Brothers of Italy, and the Party for Freedom (PVV) in the Netherlands. The article highlights differences in ideology and approaches among these parties, ranging from anti-immigration stances to criticism of the European Union. The analysis also notes how some parties, like the Brothers of Italy, have distanced themselves from Russia due to the Ukraine war, further diversifying the European political landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill cleared a key hurdle in the House after negotiations with conservative holdouts, who initially opposed the legislation due to insufficient spending cuts. The bill, which extends tax cuts from Trump's first term and increases military and border security spending, is offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. Despite progress, the legislation still faces challenges, including conservative demands for stricter Medicaid work requirements and opposition from blue-state Republicans over state and local tax deductions.

While NATO officials state the buildup is not comparable to preparations before the 2022 Ukraine invasion, the moves reflect Moscow's perception of a threat along its longest contact line with the Western alliance. Finnish defense officials anticipate Russia will redeploy thousands of troops to the border once the high-intensity phase of the Ukraine war ends.

The system, modeled after the U.S. Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), will require travelers from visa-exempt countries to provide personal and travel information in advance. This will allow the Immigration Services Agency of Japan to examine travelers' data for criminal history or illegal stay records, potentially denying boarding to those deemed a risk.

          <p>The dragonâ€™s blood trees on the Yemeni island of Socotra, found nowhere else on Earth, are threatened by climate change, invasive goats, and conflict. Increasingly severe cyclones uproot the trees, while goats devour saplings before they can mature. Conservation efforts are hampered by Yemenâ€™s civil war and limited national support. Without intervention, scientists warn that these trees, crucial to Socotra's ecosystem and tourism industry, could disappear within centuries.</p>

Trade-war fears have receded after a meeting between U.S. and Chinese trade representatives led to a lower set of levies.

The first line of attack involves cutting off testosterone, which feeds prostate cancer, through drugs or injections. Improvements in diagnosis, such as the PSMA PET scan, also allow doctors to spot cancer earlier and improve prognosis.</p>
