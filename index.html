          <p>House Democrats are appealing to Attorney General Pam Bondi to prevent the closure of the Community Relations Service, a Justice Department office established during the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The office, known as the "peacemakers program," focuses on preventing and resolving racial and ethnic conflicts and civil disorders. The Democrats' letter emphasizes the agency's role in combating violence and ensuring the safety of places of worship, particularly after recent attacks. The Community Relations Service has a history of mediating racial tensions, including after police shootings and during the trial of Derek Chauvin, and its potential closure raises concerns about the nation's ability to address future unrest.</p>

          <p>A group of protesters mistakenly gathered outside Illinois Governor JB Pritzker's mansion, believing that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was holding a press conference there. However, the actual press conference took place more than half a mile away, where Noem addressed the state's sanctuary policies and highlighted cases of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. Pritzker responded with a statement defending Illinois' policies, creating a stark contrast between the two administrations' approaches to immigration. The protesters' efforts to disrupt the event were ultimately in vain, as they were directing their anger towards an empty target.</p>

          <p>The White House is reportedly withdrawing Dr. Janette Nesheiwat's nomination for U.S. Surgeon General following complaints from right-wing activist Laura Loomer and questions about her credentials. Loomer criticized Nesheiwat's medical degree and her pro-vaccine stance, despite her later opposition to vaccine mandates for children. The withdrawal follows scrutiny of Nesheiwat's public profile, which listed a medical degree from the University of Arkansas when she received it from American University of the Caribbean. Nesheiwat, a former Fox News medical contributor, is the sister-in-law of Mike Waltz, recently nominated as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

          <p>Three former Memphis police officers were acquitted on state charges, including second-degree murder, in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols. The jury reached the verdict after an eight-and-a-half-hour deliberation, sparking outrage from civil rights advocates and Nichols' family. Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, died three days after being brutally beaten by the officers during a traffic stop. While acquitted of state charges, the officers still face federal charges and potential prison sentences. The case has reignited calls for police reform and raised concerns about police brutality, particularly against Black individuals.</p>

Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the economic fallout from the tariffs makes it unclear what the bank should do next. The Fed typically cuts rates to stimulate a struggling economy and raises them to curb inflation, but tariffs pose risks of both economic slowdown and faster price increases. Trump has pressured the Fed to lower rates, but the central bank remains independent and is assessing the situation before taking further action.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators has sent a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., expressing concerns that cuts to the agency could negatively impact the Indian Health Service (IHS). The senators highlight the IHS's role in providing care to over 2.8 million American Indians and Alaska Natives, a vulnerable population already facing health disparities. They warn that the hiring freeze and cuts to other HHS agencies serving Native communities are exacerbating existing staffing issues. The senators urge Kennedy to ensure that IHS programs have the resources and staffing necessary to fulfill their missions.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's defense minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, expressed his support for further U.S. involvement in defusing the ongoing crisis with India, praising President Trump's call for a swift resolution. This statement comes after India claimed to have conducted strikes on Pakistani territory in response to a terrorist attack in Kashmir. Asif indicated Pakistan's willingness to refrain from further action if India also de-escalates and agrees to an independent investigation. He also reiterated his call for an international investigation and hoped U.S. officials would push India to accept such an inquiry.</p>

          <p>This article argues against consuming bagged, pre-chopped lettuce due to the heightened risk of foodborne illness and the government's lackadaisical approach to alerting the public of potential threats. The author explains that bagged lettuce increases the odds of contamination due to the chopping process and the potential for bacteria to proliferate. While acknowledging the nutritional benefits of leafy greens, the article advises consumers to buy whole heads of lettuce as a harm reduction strategy. It also criticizes the Biden administration's cuts to food inspection funding and the Trump administration's approach to food safety.</p>

          <p>The North Carolina elections board, now controlled by Republicans, ousted its executive director, Karen Brinson Bell, in a partisan move. This decision follows Republican efforts to shift control of election operations in the state, including the certification of results. Brinson Bell, who served for nearly six years, was replaced by Sam Hayes, the top lawyer for the Republican House speaker. The move has been criticized as a "shabby way to treat a nationally admired executive election director," given her role in administering elections during the pandemic and after Hurricane Helene.</p>
