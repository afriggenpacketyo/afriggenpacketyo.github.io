          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Suspending Habeas Corpus for Migrants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 18:07:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is exploring the possibility of suspending habeas corpus for migrants, a right that allows individuals to challenge the legality of their detention in court. Miller argued that the Constitution permits such suspension during times of invasion, reflecting the administration's view of illegal immigration as an 'invasion.' This consideration follows the administration's frustration with court orders blocking the deportation of undocumented immigrants, raising concerns about the potential erosion of constitutional rights. The writ of habeas corpus has been suspended only a few times in U.S. history, typically with Congressional authorization. Relevant context: The Trump administration has often taken a hard stance on immigration.</p>

          <p>Several USAID employees who spoke to reporters after receiving notices of termination from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), overseen by Elon Musk, are now facing internal investigations for unauthorized media engagement. The employees received emails accusing them of violating agency policy and threatening disciplinary action, including potential removal from USAID. The American Foreign Service Association, the union representing USAID employees, has condemned the investigations as intimidation and a violation of constitutional rights. This action comes after USAID faced significant personnel cuts orchestrated by DOGE, raising concerns about the administration's efforts to stifle criticism and silence federal workers. Relevant context: DOGE has been controversial due to its rapid and sometimes flawed workforce reduction efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to resettle white Afrikaners from South Africa in the United States as refugees, citing 'unjust racial discrimination' they allegedly face. This move comes as the South African government has approved legislation that could allow for expropriation of land without compensation under certain circumstances. Stephen Miller stated that this situation fits the definition of why the refugee program was created, characterizing it as 'race-based persecution.' The South African government has criticized the Trump administration's effort, disputing the claims of racial discrimination and questioning the political motivations behind the resettlement program. Relevant context: This decision follows increasing scrutiny of land reform policies in South Africa.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is experiencing a surge in hepatitis A cases, a highly contagious liver infection, among groups not typically at risk. Public health officials have declared an outbreak, with at least 138 cases reported in 2024 and unusually high numbers continuing into 2025. The virus, spread through the fecal-oral route, is typically associated with unhoused individuals, travelers, men who have sex with men, and drug users. However, many recent cases have occurred in people without these risk factors, raising concerns about food contamination or community circulation. The best prevention method is vaccination, and officials are reassessing how to target prevention efforts.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola has confirmed that Erling Haaland is 'ready and fit' to return from injury. Guardiola has led City to six Premier League titles since joining the club in 2016. He has had to contend with a lengthy injury list, contributing to City relinquishing their four-year hold on the top-flight trophy, and they were also knocked out of the Champions League at the play-off phase. The 54-year-old called it the "most difficult" campaign in his time in coaching. Relevant context: City beat rivals Manchester United to claim the Community Shield last summer but between October and December the side endured a run of one victory in 13 games, which included nine defeats.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. have plunged in April due to steep tariffs imposed by President Trump, making it too costly for many U.S. retailers to import goods from China. As a result, shipments of goods from China to the U.S. dropped 21% compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by the same amount, indicating a shift in trade patterns. The president suggested that the levies on China could come down to 80%.

          <p>Experts are taking a dimmer view of President Trump's new trade pact with the U.K., noting that it suggests high tariffs are set to remain in place for the long term. Although the deal offers some concessions, a 10% tariff remains in place on U.K. imports, higher than the effective tariff rate of 3% prior to the second Trump administration. Even with a slow rollout of trade deals, the effective average tariff rate is going to be in the double-digit range. Relevant context: There are concerns that the tariffs could cause Americans to tighten their wallets, a serious risk given that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 cents of every $1 in economic activity.</p>
