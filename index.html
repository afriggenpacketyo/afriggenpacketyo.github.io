          <p>A Kerrville, Texas city manager is under scrutiny for mocking the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary as "Homeland Barbie" in text messages during a catastrophic flood event. The floods claimed 137 lives, with communications revealing local and federal preparedness failures, including delays in FEMA deployment and the prior dismissal of a key weather service officer. The tragedy has prompted investigations into the response, including at a summer camp where 27 people died, raising questions about emergency protocols for vulnerable institutions.</p>

          <p>The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) is actively seeking to expand trade and investment with Africa, aiming to reduce its economic reliance on traditional partners like the U.S., Canada, and Europe. With less than 3% of its current trade directed toward Africa, the bloc's leaders see this as a crucial step toward stability in an era of growing protectionism and global economic shocks. This strategic shift builds on existing collaborations between the regions on issues like climate change compensation and reparations for slavery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent report estimates that wildfires in Los Angeles this past January resulted in $51.7 billion in damages to residential properties within the city limits. The analysis primarily focused on the 23,000-acre Palisades fire, which destroyed approximately 11,000 homes and killed at least 12 people in an affluent area. Broader economic loss estimates, including business disruptions and healthcare costs, range from $95 billion to $275 billion, making it one of the most destructive fire events in California's history.

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. Her legal team argues that a 2007 non-prosecution agreement with her late associate Jeffrey Epstein should have protected her from being charged. This legal challenge comes as Maxwell is reportedly in discussions with the Justice Department about potentially cooperating with the government, which could lead to new revelations about Epstein's network.</p>

The exemption, which allowed packages under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, was heavily used by Chinese retailers like Shein and Temu. The court ruled that the lawsuit, filed by an auto parts retailer, is covered by a broader, ongoing case challenging the administration's tariffs, meaning the exemption will remain suspended while the legal battles continue.

          <p>A 42-year-old Michigan man has been charged with terrorism and 11 counts of assault with intent to murder following a stabbing rampage at a Traverse City Walmart. The suspect, Bradford James Gille, pleaded not guilty to attacking 11 people with a knife on Saturday. The prosecutor explained the terrorism charge was filed because the act was intended to instill fear in the entire community. All victims are expected to survive, and authorities are still investigating the motive for the attack.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase alleges that financial technology "middlemen" like Plaid are "massively taxing" its systems by making an excessive number of data requests. An internal memo reveals that the vast majority of these requests, or API calls, are not initiated by customers for active transactions but for other purposes like data harvesting. As a result, the bank is preparing to charge these firms for data access, a move that could disrupt the fintech ecosystem that has long relied on free access to traditional banking infrastructure.

While Niccol quickly addressed Chipotle's singular food-safety crisis, Starbucks faces a host of complex issues, including operational bottlenecks from mobile orders, labor unrest, and intense competition in key markets like China. Analysts note that the scale and multifaceted nature of Starbucks' problems require a more expensive and prolonged turnaround effort. (not investment advice)</p>
