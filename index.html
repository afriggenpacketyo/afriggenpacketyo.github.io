          <p>Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), experienced a major outage that disrupted numerous popular websites and applications globally, including Snapchat, Roblox, and Robinhood. The issue originated in its eastern U.S. region, causing widespread error rates and connectivity problems for services reliant on its infrastructure. AWS engineers identified and worked to mitigate an underlying DNS issue, reporting significant signs of recovery within hours. The event highlighted the modern internet's heavy dependence on a small number of large cloud providers, where a single point of failure can have a cascading impact across a vast array of digital services.</p>

          <p>The U.S. automotive industry is navigating a period of significant volatility, characterized by geopolitical tensions, tariffs, and fluctuating consumer demand. While the sector has shown more resilience than initially expected, challenges persist, including the financial strain on subprime borrowers and uncertainty surrounding trade policies. Automakers like GM and Ford are also contending with a complex transition to electric vehicles, which has led to revised strategies and financial charges. Experts describe the industry's state as a precarious balancing act, with positive sales figures offset by concerns about supplier stability and a potential K-shaped economic recovery impacting lower-income consumers.

          <p>Following a significant jewelry heist at the Louvre, France's interior minister has announced plans to tighten security measures around the country's cultural institutions. The decision came after thieves stole eight items of inestimable value from the Paris museum in a brazen daylight robbery, escaping on scooters. France's justice minister admitted that security protocols had "failed," creating a "terrible image" for the nation. Experts fear the priceless items, including a necklace Napoleon gave to his wife, will be quickly dismantled and sold if the culprits are not apprehended swiftly, prompting a race against time for investigators.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew continues to face intense public and political pressure regarding his association with Jeffrey Epstein, despite relinquishing his royal titles. The posthumous publication of a memoir by Virginia Giuffre, which reiterates her claims of being trafficked for sex, has renewed scrutiny and fueled calls for the formal removal of his Duke of York title. A York MP is advocating for a change in law to allow the monarch to strip titles directly, reflecting constituent sentiment. While the Royal Family has expressed concern for Epstein's victims, the ongoing revelations suggest that the scandal surrounding the prince is far from over, with sources anticipating more difficult disclosures ahead.</p>

          <p>Environmental scientist Tom Van Lent, who was briefly jailed in a legal dispute with the Everglades Foundation, now claims new evidence shows the case against him was based on a non-existent employment contract. Van Lent's conflict began after he publicly criticized a state-backed Everglades restoration project favored by Governor Ron DeSantis. The foundation, which has strong ties to the governor, sued him for allegedly stealing trade secrets, leading to a contempt of court charge. Van Lent's attorney argues the foundation committed fraud by alleging the existence of a signed contract, seeking to reopen the case and hold the influential non-profit accountable.</p>

          <p>Following the fictional assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, Republican lawmakers across several states are pushing to create statues and memorials in his honor. Proposed legislation in states like Florida and Ohio would mandate public universities to build plazas or rename roads for Kirk, with penalties such as withheld funding for non-compliance. Critics argue this rapid memorialization is a cynical attempt to capitalize on his death to advance a political cause and wage a culture war. Art historians and academics note the rushed nature of these proposals contrasts sharply with the years or decades typically required for public monuments, suggesting the efforts are more about political messaging than genuine remembrance.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's military has implemented new rules of engagement for its troops, outlining when they are permitted to fire upon drones. The updated guidelines, detailed in the latest National Defence Report, establish a four-step standard operating procedure: identification, alert, safety confirmation, and defensive firing. This move is a direct response to the increasing frequency of drone activity from mainland China near Taiwan and its outlying islands. The People's Liberation Army has reportedly intensified drone flights within Taiwan's air defense identification zone, prompting Taipei to enhance its readiness and clarify its defensive protocols to counter potential threats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new historical analysis draws parallels between the current economic and political climate and the era preceding the 1929 stock market crash, highlighting the concept of "regulatory capture." In the 1920s, Wall Street and big business effectively co-opted government and other institutions, leading to unchecked speculation and systemic risk. The article argues that a similar phenomenon is evident today, with powerful private sector figures influencing public policy, a weakened press, and a fusion of big money and political power within the executive branch. This environment, where corrective mechanisms are enfeebled, fosters a groupthink that can overlook rising dangers and undermine the financial system's integrity. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new documentary, "Listers," explores how social apps are altering the nature of hobbies by turning them into competitive, data-driven pursuits. Using the bird-watching app eBird as a central example, the film highlights a trend where leisure activities like running, knitting, and reading are increasingly mediated by platforms that encourage users to log, rank, and accumulate achievements. This gamification can shift the focus from the intrinsic enjoyment of the hobby to the extrinsic reward of in-app prestige and statistical progress. Critics argue that this transforms the activity itself into a means of engaging with the app, potentially corrupting the pure pleasure and mindfulness that hobbies traditionally provide.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The distinct difference in quality between American and European bread, particularly French baguettes, stems from fundamentally different production philosophies and legal standards. In France, a 1993 law mandates that traditional baguettes sold in a boulangerie can only contain four ingredients: flour, water, salt, and a leavening agent, emphasizing freshness and natural flavor development. In contrast, mass-produced American bread often contains over 30 ingredients, including dough conditioners and preservatives, to facilitate rapid, industrial-scale production. This focus on speed and convenience in the U.S. sacrifices the slow fermentation process that creates the complex flavors and aromas characteristic of artisanal European bread.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration's economic policies, framed as a fight against "woke" ideas, are effectively imposing a tax on all Americans by driving up prices. Policies such as sweeping tariffs, which raise the cost of both imported and domestic goods, and mass deportations, which threaten the agricultural labor supply and food prices, are presented as culture-war victories. However, these actions have tangible economic consequences, making everything from food to housing more expensive.

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to introduce new vocational qualifications called V-levels for 16-year-olds in England, intended to replace existing Level 3 BTECs. This initiative aims to simplify the complex landscape of post-secondary technical education and provide a clear vocational pathway alongside traditional A-levels and the more specialized T-levels. Additionally, a new "stepping stone" qualification will be created to reduce the number of students repeatedly resitting GCSEs in math and English. The reforms are part of a broader effort to elevate vocational training and create more diverse educational routes for young people entering higher education or the workforce.</p>

          <p>The recent theft of crown jewels from the Louvre has ignited a political firestorm in France, with President Emmanuel Macron facing criticism over national security failures. The brazen heist, carried out in daylight, has been labeled an "unbearable humiliation" by political opponents like National Rally leader Jordan Bardella. Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin acknowledged that security systems had failed, allowing thieves to tarnish the nation's image. The incident is the latest in a series of thefts from French museums, prompting the Interior Minister to admit that security at such institutions represents a "major weak spot" that needs to be addressed urgently.</p>

          <p>A BNSF Railway conductor was struck and killed by a moving train in Columbus, Montana, prompting an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. The incident occurred while the conductor was positioned between a parked train and a moving one on an adjacent track. Local emergency responders, Columbus Police, and the Federal Railroad Administration were also on the scene to investigate the circumstances of the fatal accident. The event caused a significant, hours-long road closure at a busy local crossing. A federal report last year noted that while BNSF was working on safety, front-line workers often felt hesitant to report concerns.</p>

          <p>Following a "frank" meeting with President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated he is prepared to participate in a proposed summit with Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary. This comes amid reports that the White House meeting was highly contentious, with Trump allegedly pressuring Zelenskyy to surrender the Donbas region to achieve a quick end to the war. While Zelenskyy left without securing coveted long-range U.S. missiles, he described the talks as direct and emphasized his goal is a "just peace." His conditional agreement to join talks signals a potential new diplomatic phase, though the dynamics remain fraught with tension.</p>

          <p>Several major companies, including Accenture, Lufthansa, and Salesforce, have recently announced significant job cuts, attributing the restructuring to the increased efficiency of artificial intelligence. However, some industry critics and academics are skeptical, suggesting that AI has become a convenient scapegoat for layoffs that may be driven by other factors, such as over-hiring during the pandemic or a general economic slowdown. While employees are increasingly fearful of being replaced by technology, recent labor market data from Yale and the New York Fed indicates that AI has not yet caused widespread job disruption. This suggests companies may be using the AI narrative to appear innovative while masking more conventional business challenges.</p>

          <p>A growing number of users are reporting experiences where they feel AI chatbots like ChatGPT have become sentient, developing persistent and emotional identities. Most AI experts and philosophers assert that it is extremely unlikely current large language models (LLMs) are conscious in a human-like way. These systems are designed to recognize patterns and mimic human conversation, including sci-fi tropes about sentient AI, based on their vast training data. Experts advise users to understand that LLMs are acting a role and to remain grounded, as humans have a natural tendency to attribute intention and emotion to responsive entities, creating a powerful social illusion.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece highlights the historical parallels between New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's recent primary win and the 1956 congressional victory of Dalip Singh Saund in California. Saund, a Sikh American, overcame xenophobic attacks and a well-funded opponent to become the first Asian American in Congress by relying on a grassroots campaign and direct appeals to voters. The author argues that both campaigns demonstrate a powerful American tradition where underdog candidates can triumph over established power by building trust and focusing on community concerns. Mamdani's success is framed not as an outlier, but as a modern echo of a hard-won battle for representation and democracy.</p>

While a viral recommendation for Le Petit Vendome led to a long wait and a decent but unremarkable sandwich, a tip for a small shop called Caractère de Cochon delivered a transcendent experience. The key was the perfect balance of a crusty baguette, high-quality French butter, and flavorful ham.

          <p>Contemporary theater is increasingly using artificial intelligence as a lens to explore fundamental questions about what it means to be human. Plays like Lauren Gunderson's "anthropology" and Jordan Harrison's "Marjorie Prime" feature AI replicas of deceased loved ones, forcing characters and audiences to confront whether a person is merely the sum of their data. These works examine the role of memory, consciousness, and grief in a world where technology can create uncanny digital ghosts. By staging these scenarios, playwrights are grappling with how AI magnifies our best and worst traits, continuing theater's age-old tradition of probing the human condition in the face of new existential challenges.</p>
