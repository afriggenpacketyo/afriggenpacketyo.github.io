          <p>The director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Todd Arrington, has resigned under pressure after a conflict with the Trump administration. The dispute centered on a request from the State Department for an original Eisenhower sword from the library's collection to be gifted to King Charles III. Arrington resisted giving away a historical artifact belonging to the American people, suggesting a replica instead. Although a substitute was ultimately found, Arrington stated he was told to "resign or be fired," believing he was no longer trusted with confidential information after the disagreement.</p>

          <p>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has identified the remains of U.S. Navy Fireman 1st Class Edward D. Bowden, who was killed during the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Bowden was 29 and serving aboard the USS California when it was sunk by Japanese forces, resulting in the deaths of over 100 crewmates. His remains were among those deemed unidentifiable for decades and were buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. Through modern dental, anthropological, and DNA analysis of remains exhumed in 2018, Bowden was officially accounted for, and his family has been notified.</p>

          <p>Researchers at UCLA have found that a new treatment strategy significantly delays the progression of recurrent prostate cancer. The study combined a targeted radioactive drug with standard stereotactic body radiation therapy for men whose cancer had returned in a few isolated spots. Results presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology meeting showed this combination more than doubled the time patients remained disease-free, from seven months to nearly eighteen months. A key benefit of this approach is its potential to delay the need for hormone therapy, which often carries burdensome side effects for patients.</p>

The incident occurred on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, when an attacker drove a vehicle at people and then began a stabbing rampage before being shot and killed by police. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the attack as a vile act targeting the Jewish community, and authorities have increased the police presence at synagogues across the country. The attacker was prevented from entering the synagogue by security staff and worshippers.</p>

          <p>An immigration judge has denied a request to reopen the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was erroneously deported earlier this year despite having legal protection against removal. Abrego Garcia was later returned to the U.S. to face separate human smuggling charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers sought to reopen his immigration proceedings to allow him to apply for asylum, but the judge declined the bid. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that his final order of removal stands, though Abrego Garcia can still appeal the latest decision.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally declared that the United States is in a "non-international armed conflict" with certain drug cartels, designating them as "unlawful combatants." This determination, detailed in a memo sent to Congress, follows recent U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean that killed 17 people. The memo frames these actions as part of a sustained conflict against non-state armed groups engaged in drug smuggling, which the administration considers an armed attack against the U.S. This policy shift represents a significant escalation in the U.S. approach to combating drug trafficking in the region.</p>

          <p>Recent drops in mortgage rates have created significant savings for homebuyers, particularly for substantial loans. For a $700,000 mortgage, the current average 30-year fixed rate of 6.34% results in a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $4,351. This is about $273 less per month compared to the 6.93% average rate seen in January, translating to over $3,200 in annual savings.

Trump announced he would meet with Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, a key architect of Project 2025, to decide which agencies to cut.

Researchers used AI to generate over 75,000 variants of toxic proteins by "paraphrasing" their genetic sequences, which then slipped past the safeguards used by DNA synthesis companies to prevent the creation of dangerous biological materials. While a software fix was developed that caught most of the AI-generated variants, a small fraction still went undetected. The findings highlight a significant and growing security challenge posed by the advancement of AI in biotechnology.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Science reveals that the economic and human costs of wildfires have risen dramatically, with a significant spike occurring in the last decade. Researchers analyzed global fire loss data from 1980 to 2023 and found that 43% of the 200 most costly fires on record happened in the last 10 years. The study links this acceleration to rising global temperatures and long-term drought, which create hotter and drier conditions conducive to extreme fire weather. This trend indicates that the impacts of climate change on wildfires are not gradual but are experiencing sudden jumps in severity.</p>

          <p>Shares of chipmaker Intel have risen by more than 50% over the past month, pushing the stock price past $37 per share. This significant rally has increased the value of the U.S. government's 10% stake in the company to approximately $16 billion. The Trump administration had negotiated an $8.9 billion investment in Intel in August, acquiring 433.3 million shares at a price of $20.47 each. The surge represents a substantial paper gain for the government's investment in the semiconductor giant, which is a key player in the nation's technology and manufacturing sectors.

          <p>WNBA star Caitlin Clark has voiced her support for Minnesota Lynx player Napheesa Collier, who publicly criticized comments made by league commissioner Cathy Engelbert regarding rookie salaries. Collier stated that when she questioned the low pay for high-revenue-driving rookies like Clark, Engelbert responded that Clark should be grateful for her off-court earnings. When informed of Collier's statement, Clark expressed her respect for the veteran player, agreed with her points, and emphasized the need for strong leadership to capitalize on the WNBA's current surge in popularity. The exchange highlights growing tensions between players and league management.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a government shutdown forces hundreds of thousands of federal employees to be furloughed or work without immediate pay, members of Congress continue to receive their salaries. This is because congressional pay is mandated by the Constitution and funded through a permanent appropriation that does not require annual renewal, making it exempt from lapses in government funding. In contrast, most other federal employees, including congressional staff, will see their paychecks delayed until a funding agreement is reached. This disparity is often a point of public frustration during shutdowns, highlighting a system where lawmakers are financially insulated from the consequences of their legislative impasses.</p>

          <p>For individuals needing quick access to a significant sum like $10,000, a personal loan can be a viable option, with many lenders offering rapid approval and funding. To secure favorable terms, borrowers should first check their credit scores and take steps to improve them, such as paying down credit card balances. It is crucial to strategically compare offers from online lenders, traditional banks, and credit unions, as interest rates can vary significantly. Prequalifying with multiple lenders using a soft credit check can help applicants estimate rates without impacting their credit score before submitting a formal application.

          <p>Scientists have observed a free-floating "rogue planet" approximately 620 light-years from Earth that is consuming surrounding gas and dust at an astonishing rate of six billion tons per second. This object, named Cha 1107-7626, is five to ten times the mass of Jupiter and is growing through a process called accretion. The intensity of this growth spurt, along with the detection of magnetic activity and water vapor typically associated with star formation, blurs the conventional line between planets and stars. The discovery offers new insights into how planetary-mass objects can form and evolve in the universe.</p>

The company is working to reformulate popular items like Gatorade, Cheetos, and Mountain Dew, which currently use synthetic dyes. The process is complex, as researchers must find stable, natural ingredients like paprika, turmeric, and purple sweet potatoes that do not alter the products' familiar flavors or appearances. This multi-year initiative reflects a broader industry trend away from petroleum-based dyes as consumers become more focused on ingredient lists.</p>
