          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 12:56:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. annual inflation rate accelerated to 2.7% in June, a figure that, while meeting economist expectations, marked a notable increase from the 2.4% recorded in May. This upward trend is largely attributed to the initial effects of the Trump administration's tariff policies on imported goods, with analysts forecasting a more significant impact on consumer prices in the second half of the year. The report presented a mixed picture, with declining prices for gasoline and used vehicles being offset by rising costs for essential categories like groceries and housing, indicating complex and persistent inflationary pressures on the economy.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Citigroup announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by significant revenue growth across its key business divisions. The bank's markets division revenue climbed 16%, while its banking revenue saw an 18% increase, contributing to a 25% rise in net income compared to the previous year. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the strong performance as evidence of the company's successful transformation plan, even as the bank increased its allowance for credit losses due to a deteriorating economic outlook. The positive report led Citigroup to raise its full-year revenue forecast to the high end of its previous guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Major League Baseball Players Association is advising its members, particularly the large contingent of foreign-born players, to carry their immigration documentation with them at all times. The guidance comes in response to heightened immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, aiming to prevent potential issues that could affect players' ability to work. MLBPA Executive Director Tony Clark stated that the union has also bolstered its legal support systems, providing immigration counsel to assist players and their families in navigating the challenging and complicated current atmosphere surrounding U.S. immigration policy and enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly altered its immigration detention policy, effectively denying many detainees the possibility of being released on bond. By reinterpreting a 1990s law, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will now argue that noncitizens who entered the U.S. illegally are ineligible for a bond hearing before a judge, regardless of how long they have lived in the country. This change expands mandatory detention beyond recent border-crossers and those with certain criminal convictions, leaving parole granted directly by ICE as the only potential path to release for a much larger group of individuals awaiting deportation proceedings.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is moving forward with a White House rescissions package that seeks to cancel $9.4 billion in previously approved federal funding. The proposal primarily targets foreign aid programs, including those for global health initiatives like PEPFAR, but also includes a full elimination of federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The package, which requires only a simple majority, is facing resistance from some moderate Republicans concerned about the humanitarian and diplomatic impacts, creating a tense legislative battle as a 45-day deadline to act approaches.</p>

The existence of the leak and the subsequent secret £400m relocation scheme were concealed from the public by a super-injunction, which a High Court judge has now lifted.

          <p>Smoke from ongoing wildfires in central and western Canada has led to widespread air quality alerts across much of Canada and the northern United States. Cities like Toronto and Chicago are experiencing significantly degraded air quality, with officials advising residents, especially vulnerable populations, to limit time outdoors. The smoke, originating from fires in provinces like Manitoba and Ontario that have forced thousands to evacuate, has become a persistent issue. The situation has also created political friction, with some U.S. members of Congress complaining to Canada about the cross-border impact of the smoke.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Centre survey indicates that public opinion toward China is becoming more favorable in several Latin American countries, including Mexico and Brazil. Despite this warming sentiment, the United States continues to be viewed by many in the region as the more important economic partner. This trend sets Latin America apart from many high-income nations, where views of China remain predominantly negative. The survey, conducted before some of President Trump's most recent tariff announcements, suggests a complex and evolving geopolitical dynamic as China's influence grows in a region traditionally aligned with the U.S.</p>

After years of fueling conspiracy theories about Epstein's client list, top administration officials recently announced they found no evidence to support them, causing a backlash within the MAGA movement. The author argues that the episode is a case of political karma for President Trump, whose influence now seems to be waning as many of his own supporters and media allies refuse to drop the issue despite his attempts to dismiss it, creating a significant internal political challenge.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Michael and Kerry Ives guilty of murdering their two-year-old grandson, Ethan Ives-Griffiths, who died in 2021 from a "catastrophic" head injury.

The boy's mother, Shannon Ives, was also convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child and cruelty.

          <p>This article outlines President Trump's objective to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, a long-held conservative goal. The administration recently won a Supreme Court ruling allowing it to proceed with plans to lay off over 1,000 employees, a key step in shrinking the agency's capacity. While a complete shutdown would require congressional approval, Trump's strategy focuses on reducing its workforce and transferring functions, like the $1.5 trillion student loan portfolio, to other government agencies. The move is framed by supporters as a way to return control to states and parents and combat perceived ideological indoctrination in schools.</p>

The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by civil rights groups, which presented evidence that agents were using factors like race, language, and location to establish the "reasonable suspicion" needed for a stop. The judge found this practice likely violates the 4th Amendment. The Trump administration has immediately appealed the decision, arguing it is an untenable judicial takeover of federal immigration enforcement, setting up a significant legal battle.</p>

The canceled studies were investigating how these toxic "forever chemicals," often spread via contaminated sewage sludge used as fertilizer, enter the food supply and water sources. This decision halts critical research aimed at understanding and mitigating a widespread food safety risk, which has already caused a crisis for dozens of farms in Maine, the only state with a robust testing program for this issue.</p>
