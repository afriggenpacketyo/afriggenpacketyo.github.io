          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries conducted a marathon speech on the House floor, speaking for over five hours to protest a major spending and tax cut bill backed by President Trump. Jeffries criticized the legislation as an "immoral document," arguing it would harm millions of Americans by cutting programs like Medicaid and SNAP. He utilized a procedural tactic known as the "magic minute" to delay the final vote, reading personal stories of constituents who would be negatively affected by the proposed healthcare changes. The speech highlighted the deep partisan divide over the bill's economic and social impact.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and a new CDC advisory panel are questioning the established practice of administering the hepatitis B vaccine to all newborns. Kennedy has made unsubstantiated claims about the vaccine's risks, while the panel's new chair has suggested re-evaluating the universal vaccination policy. Infectious disease experts are pushing back, emphasizing that there is no evidence the vaccine is unsafe and that it has been instrumental in nearly eliminating hepatitis B in children.

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed President Trump's significant spending package following an overnight session where Republican leadership, with Trump's direct involvement, secured the necessary votes.

Democrats have strongly opposed the legislation, warning it will strip healthcare from millions and disproportionately benefit the wealthy.

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued resilience by adding 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' forecasts and keeping pace with the average monthly gain over the past year. The unemployment rate also saw a slight improvement, ticking down to 4.1%. Job growth was primarily driven by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, which added 73,000 positions, while healthcare also saw robust gains.

Insurers also favor the installation of monitored security systems and storm shutters in hurricane-prone areas, as these measures lower the likelihood of expensive claims.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday morning. The scheduled call follows a recent U.S. decision to halt some weapons shipments, including missile interceptors and artillery shells, to Ukraine. The Pentagon stated the pause was ordered after a review of U.S. munitions stockpiles to ensure American military readiness. The move has drawn concern from figures like former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who warned that letting Russia win would be a disaster for U.S. security, while Ukrainian officials stressed that any delay in support encourages Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a powerful Hindu nationalist organization and ideological affiliate of India's ruling BJP, is advocating for changes to the country's constitution. The RSS argues that the words "socialist" and "secular," added to the preamble in 1976, were illegitimately imposed and are foreign concepts. Proponents of the change believe that "Hindutva," or Hindu values, should be the foundation of Indian society, making the term "secular" redundant. However, any constitutional amendment would require a two-thirds parliamentary majority, which the BJP currently lacks, and critics warn the debate deepens social polarization.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, "2024: How Trump Retook the White House," details former President Barack Obama's stark warning to Joe Biden's staff about his re-election campaign. In late 2023, Obama reportedly told senior aides, "Your campaign is a mess," expressing concern over its structure and lack of presence in key districts. The book highlights underlying tensions between the two camps, with some Biden loyalists resenting what they perceived as disrespect from Obama. Following the critique, Biden reorganized his campaign leadership, though he later withdrew from the race, paving the way for Kamala Harris's unsuccessful run against Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>An American teenager attempting a solo flight across all seven continents has been detained on an Antarctic island by Chilean authorities. Ethan Guo, 19, was charged with submitting a false flight plan after allegedly making an unauthorized landing on King George Island. Guo had been documenting his journey, which aimed to raise $1 million for cancer research, on social media. Prosecutors state that his flight plan indicated he would only fly over a southern Chilean city, not continue to Antarctica, and that his unauthorized flight violated international rules and posed a safety risk to regional air traffic.</p>

          <p>Four individuals have been remanded in custody after being charged in connection with a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, a major UK air force base. The suspects, aged 22 to 35, are accused of causing Â£7 million in damage to two military aircraft by spraying them with red paint on June 20. The pro-Palestine activist group Palestine Action has claimed responsibility for the incident. The four face charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and entering a prohibited place, with prosecutors arguing the alleged offenses have a "terrorist connection."

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted the first-ever unmanned semi-submersible "narco sub" in the Caribbean, a vessel notably equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna for remote operation. Although the drone submarine was not carrying drugs, authorities believe it was a trial run by the Gulf Clan, Colombia's largest cocaine cartel. The vessel had the capacity to transport 1.5 tons of cocaine. This seizure highlights a significant technological evolution in drug trafficking, as cartels migrate toward sophisticated unmanned systems that are harder to detect and eliminate the risk of crew members being captured.</p>

          <p>An Australian man in his 50s has died after contracting Australian bat lyssavirus, an extremely rare infection similar to rabies, from a bat bite. Health officials in New South Wales confirmed this is the first case of the virus in the state and only the fourth ever recorded in Australia, all of which have been fatal. The virus is transmitted through bat saliva and has no effective treatment once symptoms appear. Officials are urging the public to avoid all contact with bats and to seek immediate medical attention if bitten or scratched, as post-exposure treatment is the only way to prevent the deadly disease.</p>

          <p>Amid shifting economic conditions, seniors are encouraged to re-evaluate their life insurance policies to ensure they still meet their financial needs. Experts suggest asking critical questions, such as whether coverage is still necessary, what type of policy is most suitable, and if beneficiaries are up to date. As financial obligations like mortgages or college tuition diminish, legacy planning, funeral costs, and charitable giving may become new priorities. Reviewing policies can prevent them from becoming misaligned with estate plans and can help families utilize life insurance as a tax-efficient tool for their long-term goals.</p>
