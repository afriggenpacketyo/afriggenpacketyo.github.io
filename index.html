        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts expressed serious concern over the increasing use of heated and threatening rhetoric against judges by politicians from both parties. Speaking at a judicial conference, he highlighted that such language endangers judges by framing them as political adversaries, which could incite violence. Roberts referenced past instances where he felt compelled to condemn remarks from both former President Trump and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, emphasizing that such statements are inappropriate and dangerous to the judicial process. He stressed that the established appellate review process, not political attacks, is the proper avenue for disagreeing with judicial decisions.</p>

          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is adopting a new strategy to prepare for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. The team is implementing a "virtual athletes' village" where swimmers live and train together to build resilience and teamwork in unfamiliar, challenging environments. This approach was trialed ahead of the world championships, with athletes staying in shared accommodations and commuting to the venue, simulating Olympic conditions. Officials and athletes reported positive outcomes, noting that the experience helped them perform well under stress and fostered a stronger sense of team spirit and motivation.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has escalated his public opposition to President Trump's major tax and spending bill, asserting it will eliminate millions of American jobs and harm future industries. In a series of posts on his social media platform X, Musk described the Senate's draft as a "disgusting abomination" that provides handouts to legacy sectors while damaging emerging ones. This renews a contentious conflict between Musk, who briefly served in the administration, and President Trump, who had previously threatened to review federal subsidies for Musk's companies. Despite a recent truce, Musk's latest attacks create new political challenges for Republicans attempting to pass the legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, this article explains the science behind the "urban heat island effect," which causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. This phenomenon is primarily due to dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorbing and retaining solar energy, which is then released as heat, especially at night. The lack of vegetation and water sources in urban environments exacerbates the problem, as there is less natural cooling from evaporation. This effect not only increases discomfort but also poses health risks by trapping pollution and intensifying the impacts of climate change on growing urban populations.</p>

          <p>The lavish wedding of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren SÃ¡nchez in Venice has sparked significant local backlash, with hundreds of protesters marching against what they see as the exploitation of their city. Critics argue the extravagant event highlights the struggles of Venetian residents, who face overtourism, high living costs, and environmental threats. Demonstrators carried banners like "Kisses Yes, Bezos No," contending that the city is being used as a playground for the ultra-rich while its own infrastructure and population suffer. While Bezos made a donation to Venetian environmental groups, many protesters dismissed it as a token gesture to appease public anger.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, UK, is teaching primary school children about sun safety to help reduce future rates of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer. The initiative, which is planned for a nationwide rollout, educates children as young as five on how to read UV indexes and apply sunscreen correctly. Health experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of developing skin cancer later in life, and with melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, preventative education is crucial. The program aims to empower children to take responsibility for their own sun protection, a measure supported by dermatologists and cancer survivors.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration for human rights in defiance of a government ban. Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government had attempted to prohibit the march, citing a controversial "Child Protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. However, Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, enabled the event to proceed by classifying it as a council-organized gathering, which is exempt from the assembly law. The massive turnout was seen as a clear rebuke to Orban's policies, with many participants motivated to attend specifically because of the attempted ban.</p>

Several Republican senators, including Susan Collins and Josh Hawley, voted to advance the bill but remained non-committal on the final vote, indicating that further changes may be necessary.

          <p>Following its 12-day war with Israel, the Iranian regime is deepening its domestic crackdown, executing several men on espionage charges and arresting hundreds accused of having ties to Israel. Human rights activists argue the executed individuals were denied due process and were day-laborers, not spies, suggesting the regime is using the conflict's aftermath to instill fear. Many Iranians and activists express concern that this is a phase of "collective punishment," as the government also introduces new laws to monitor citizens' online activities. The crackdown is seen as an attempt by the regime to reassert control and project strength after suffering significant military and infrastructure losses.</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center has begun issuing advisories for Tropical Depression 2, which formed in the western Gulf of Mexico on Saturday.

A tropical storm warning has been issued for a portion of Mexico's Gulf coast, with officials anticipating strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm is expected to bring three to ten inches of rain to several Mexican states, posing a risk of flooding as it moves inland early next week.</p>

She feels this is the only way to control the strength of the nicotine they consume and ensure the products are from reputable sources. The story highlights the ineffectiveness of the recent disposable vape ban, as young people can still access legal rechargeable vapes marketed with child-friendly features. An NHS youth vaping clinic reports treating children with severe addiction, who experience withdrawal symptoms and sleep with vapes to get nicotine hits during the night.</p>

The continued violence comes as President Trump stated that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be reached within the next week, although no official comments have been made by either side. Negotiations for a pause in the 21-month-long war have been intermittent, with a recent proposal involving a hostage and prisoner exchange failing to gain traction.

The caskets of Revolutionary Guard chief Gen. Hossein Salami and others were paraded through the streets as crowds chanted anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans. The ceremony was the first major public funeral for the high-ranking officials killed in the conflict, which Iran claims was an Israeli campaign to destroy its nuclear program. The event was a major state-organized display of mourning and defiance, though Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was not seen in attendance.</p>

          <p>In his third pitching start of the season, Shohei Ohtani delivered his best performance yet, though the Dodgers ultimately lost to the Kansas City Royals. Pitching two scoreless innings, Ohtani showcased dominant velocity, including a fastball that reached 101.7 mph, the fastest of his MLB career. His workload remains limited as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, but he effectively attacked the strike zone and kept hitters off balance. Despite his strong start, the Dodgers' bulk reliever struggled and the offense failed to capitalize, but Ohtani's outing was a significant positive step, demonstrating his potential as an impact pitcher for the team.</p>

He cited the Chinese startup DeepSeek as an example, which achieved results comparable to top U.S. models using far fewer AI chips.

The legislation makes many of the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent, introduces new temporary breaks for tip and overtime income, and includes a revised cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. Notably, a controversial "revenge tax" targeting foreign countries was removed after pushback from Wall Street, while certain industries received targeted deductions. The package also includes deep cuts to Medicaid and a $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling, which remain contentious points among some Republicans. (not investment advice)</p>

The plaintiffs sued Trump for statements he made during a 2024 presidential debate, accusing him of falsely claiming they had killed someone and pled guilty. Judge Wendy Beetlestone ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which Trump's legal team cited to protect against lawsuits targeting public expression, does not apply in federal court.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has declared that fixing the country's "broken" benefits system is a "moral imperative," following a significant backbench rebellion that forced a U-turn on welfare cuts. Speaking at the Welsh Labour Party conference, Starmer assured that the welfare safety net would remain but stated benefits cannot become a "snare" for those able to work. The government conceded on its initial plan to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip), now applying stricter criteria only to new claimants and reviewing the assessment process. Despite the concessions, some Labour MPs are still pushing for further changes. (not investment advice)</p>
