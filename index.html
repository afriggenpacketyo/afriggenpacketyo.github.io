          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 09:46:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seven of Britain's largest housebuilding firms have agreed to pay £100 million towards affordable housing to resolve a probe by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The investigation examined whether the companies illegally shared commercially sensitive information, which could have distorted market competition. As part of the settlement, the firms will not admit wrongdoing but will cease sharing such data and implement new compliance programs. This resolution allows the CMA to avoid a lengthy legal battle and a formal decision on whether competition law was broken, instead focusing on immediate benefits for the housing market.</p>

          <p>Right-wing commentators and influencers are expressing frustration after the Trump administration's Justice Department and FBI stated they found no "client list" or evidence of blackmail in Jeffrey Epstein's records. This contradicts years of speculation and promises from Trump allies to release damning "Epstein Files." The memo's conclusion that Epstein died by suicide has also been rejected by many on the right, creating a difficult situation for President Trump. The controversy highlights a deep-seated fixation on the Epstein case within some conservative circles and the political challenges it poses for the administration.</p>

          <p>This article fact-checks three viral claims circulating on social media about US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation procedures under the Trump administration. It debunks an unproven claim that deportees are being thrown from planes into the ocean, citing expert analysis of flight tracking data. The report also clarifies that a viral video uses misleading images, mixing authentic photos of ICE operations with unrelated pictures of migrant tragedies from other parts of the world. Finally, it identifies a widely viewed video of an ICE raid as a fake created with artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly utilizing sector-specific tariffs, such as those on steel, aluminum, and automobiles, in addition to broader country-based levies. President Trump recently announced plans for a 50% tariff on copper imports and significant duties on pharmaceuticals, citing national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. These targeted tariffs create complexity for businesses and are expected to have a substantial impact on the domestic market and consumer prices. Unlike country-specific tariffs currently facing legal challenges, these sector-based measures are seen as having a more solid legal foundation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new bill signed by President Trump does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, contrary to some claims. Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary "bonus" tax deduction for seniors, which can lower their overall taxable income. The deduction is up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less. Policy experts note this provides some relief but is not a full repeal of the tax on benefits, and it primarily benefits higher-income seniors while not affecting low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax.

          <p>The Danish parliament has overwhelmingly approved a Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) with the United States, granting the U.S. military broad access to Danish territory. This decision comes despite recent tensions caused by President Trump's statements about potentially occupying Greenland for national security reasons. Analysts suggest Denmark proceeded with the deal out of strategic necessity, as it relies on U.S. military support for its NATO commitments in the Baltics. The agreement, which excludes Greenland, is seen by some as a way to ensure U.S. aid in an emergency, even if NATO's structure were to weaken in the future.</p>

Freezing thresholds, a policy known as fiscal drag, pulls more people into paying tax or higher tax brackets as their wages rise.

The incident is part of a wider disaster in the region, highlighting the sudden and devastating power of the floodwaters on the Guadalupe River.</p>

          <p>Sir Brian Langstaff, chair of the public inquiry into the UK's infected blood scandal, has stated that victims are being "harmed further" by significant delays and injustices in the government's compensation scheme. In a new report, he criticized the slow pace of payments, noting that only 460 of the estimated 30,000 victims have received full compensation. The report followed extra hearings prompted by numerous complaints from victims about the scheme's management. Sir Brian made several recommendations, including allowing victims to apply directly for compensation, prioritizing the seriously ill, and addressing systemic injustices to ensure the process is more transparent and fair.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 08:34:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fertility rates across the Middle East have fallen dramatically over the past few decades, a trend experts call a "quiet revolution." The average number of children per woman has more than halved since the 1960s, with some Arab nations now below the population replacement level of 2.1. This decline is attributed to a combination of economic pressures, political instability, and significant social changes, including increased female education and employment. Experts are divided on the long-term impact, which could strain social safety nets but may also reduce environmental pressures and free up economic resources for other uses.</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in England will stage a five-day strike starting July 25 after voting in favor of further industrial action in their ongoing dispute over pay. The British Medical Association (BMA) stated that the government has refused to negotiate on pay, leaving them with no choice but to strike. The government has called the move "unnecessary and unreasonable," highlighting a 28.9% pay increase over the last three years and stating it is not willing to reopen negotiations. The BMA contends that real-terms pay is still significantly lower than in 2008 and is seeking a credible offer for pay restoration.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved significant upgrades to its national disaster plan in response to the growing threat of a major earthquake in the Nankai Trough. The move coincides with an unprecedented swarm of over 1,700 tremors hitting the Tokara Islands, prompting evacuations. While officials state the swarm is not a precursor to the feared Nankai quake, they acknowledge a major disaster is inevitable. The new plan aims to cut the projected death toll from a massive quake and tsunami by 80% within a decade through infrastructure improvements, such as taller sea walls and refuge towers, and enhanced public education on evacuation procedures.</p>

The Brumbies, despite missing key players, consistently challenged the Lions' defense and exploited weaknesses at the breakdown, preventing the visitors from achieving a dominant statement win. The performance highlighted areas for improvement for the Lions as they progress through their tour, particularly concerning turnovers and defensive consistency.</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in Texas have intensified scrutiny of the Trump administration's staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) and its parent agency, NOAA. Since February, the NWS has lost about 600 staff, leading to high vacancy rates in forecast offices across the country, including a 22% vacancy rate in the San Antonio office that covered the flood zone. While experts say the NWS performed well with the information it had, they warn that continued understaffing could compromise the agency's ability to provide timely warnings for future weather catastrophes, putting more lives at risk.</p>

          <p>Sir Brian Leveson, a former senior judge, has proposed significant reforms to the UK criminal justice system to tackle a backlog of nearly 77,000 cases, warning of a potential "total system collapse." His recommendations include using judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud and bribery, creating a new court division for less serious cases, and increasing sentence reductions for early guilty pleas. While the government acknowledges the need for reform to reduce delays for victims and defendants, some legal professionals argue that removing juries undermines a fundamental right to be tried by one's peers and could harm the justice system.</p>

The main target was reportedly airfields in the northwestern city of Lutsk, near the Polish border. This massive assault came just a day after U.S. President Trump criticized Russian President Putin for "killing a lot of people" and pledged to send more weapons to Ukraine. The Kremlin responded to Trump's comments by stating it was "quite calm" about the criticism, even as its forces escalated their attacks.</p>

This move comes as the lunchtime market becomes more competitive and follows previous customer criticism over changes to Pret's popular subscription model. The strategy targets a higher-end market segment, even as many consumers remain concerned about the rising cost of living.</p>

          <p>This article explains the toxicology of the death cap mushroom (Amanita phalloides), the fungus used in a deadly poisoning case in Australia where Erin Patterson was found guilty of murder. The mushroom contains a highly stable toxin, alpha-Amanitin, which is not destroyed by cooking and causes catastrophic liver failure, with symptoms often delayed for hours. Experts clarify that misidentification is a common cause of poisoning, but the likelihood of death caps contaminating store-bought mushrooms is virtually zero, as the fungus only grows in a symbiotic relationship with specific trees like oaks, which are not used in commercial mushroom cultivation.</p>
