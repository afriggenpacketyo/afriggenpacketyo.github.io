          <p>Two student pilots from Harv's Air training school died after their Cessna planes collided midair near Steinbach, Manitoba. The pilots were practicing takeoffs and landings and appeared to have attempted to land simultaneously without seeing each other. One victim was identified as 20-year-old Savanna May Royes by her family, who remembered her as "the essence of pure joy." The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is now investigating the tragic incident.</p>

His inclusion is the only change to the team following a significant defeat in the previous Test. Archer has been sidelined since 2021 due to persistent back and elbow injuries, making his comeback a highly anticipated event. His return to Lord's, the site of some of his most memorable career moments, marks the culmination of a meticulous recovery plan.</p>

          <p>Singapore's state investment firm, Temasek Holdings, announced its net portfolio value reached a record SG$434 billion, an 11% year-on-year increase. This growth was driven by strong performance in its Singapore-based holdings and investments in the U.S., China, and India. The firm also reported its highest level of divestments in over two decades, signaling an active strategy to reshape its portfolio for resilience in the current macroeconomic environment. Temasek remains constructive on investment opportunities, particularly in the U.S. AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six months after its implementation, New York City's congestion pricing program has led to significant environmental and quality-of-life improvements, including a 25% reduction in traffic delays and a 2.5% drop in carbon pollution. Despite initial opposition and ongoing legal challenges from the Trump administration, the scheme has become popular with residents as bus and traffic speeds have increased. The program is on track to generate $500 million this year, with funds dedicated to upgrading the city's public transportation system, including the subway and electric buses.</p>

These narratives have blurred the lines of truth amidst a real-world tragedy, diverting attention from official responses and critiques of budget cuts to weather forecasting services that may have impacted the disaster's outcome.</p>

          <p>This essay posits that the recent intellectual trend of 'anti-liberalism,' which gained traction on both the political left and right following the 2016 election, is now in decline. The author argues that the practical realities of the Trump administration's authoritarianism have caused many former critics to re-evaluate the virtues of liberalism. The piece suggests that right-wing 'postliberalism' is weakening due to its association with Trump and internal fractures, while left-wing 'anti-liberalism' was always more of a rhetorical posture than a coherent philosophical alternative to democratic principles.</p>

          <p>A series of over 37 earthquakes and aftershocks struck Guatemala, leading to the deaths of two men in the department of Escuintla. The victims were killed when large rocks, dislodged by the tremors, fell from a hillside onto their pickup truck. The seismic activity, with magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 5.6, caused landslides, minor property damage, and building evacuations, with tremors felt as far as El Salvador. Authorities have declared an orange alert and reported that at least five other people were buried by landslides.</p>

          <p>Russia launched its largest aerial assault since the 2022 invasion, firing nearly 750 drones and missiles at targets in western Ukraine overnight. Ukraine's air force reported that its defense systems successfully intercepted the vast majority of the projectiles, including 711 drones and seven missiles. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for more "biting" sanctions against Moscow, while the U.S. confirmed it would proceed with sending more Patriot air-defense systems to help Ukraine defend itself against such large-scale attacks.</p>

          <p>According to a report by think tank Strategy Risks, China is set to maintain its dominance in the global rare earth supply chain due to decades of underinvestment and a lack of coherent strategy from the United States. Despite recent U.S. initiatives to bolster domestic production, the country remains heavily dependent on Chinese mineral imports. The analysis warns that America is not doing enough to reduce this vulnerability, a critical issue as Beijing increasingly uses its supply chain leverage in trade negotiations with the Trump administration.

The erratic policy has created significant uncertainty for businesses, and separate, higher tariffs are also in place for specific goods like steel, aluminum, and automobiles to protect domestic industries.
