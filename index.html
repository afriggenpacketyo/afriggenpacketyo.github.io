          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to sue President Donald Trump over the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. Newsom argues that Trump's actions are an illegal federal overreach and a preview of potential actions in other states. The lawsuit comes in response to Trump's order to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to address the protests. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors have charged labor leader David Huerta with felony conspiracy to impede an officer following his arrest during a protest. </p>

          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort for fire coverage, faces increasing scrutiny due to its lack of transparency. A CBS News California investigation revealed that the FAIR Plan withholds basic financial data and keeps board meetings secret, unlike similar plans in other states. New rules now require all property insurance holders to cover the FAIR Plan's debts, making its operations a matter of public concern. Following the investigation, the California FAIR Plan agreed to publicly disclose more information, including the composition of its board, its reinsurance structure and the dates of cash distributions back to its member companies.</p>
