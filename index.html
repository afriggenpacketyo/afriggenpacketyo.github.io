          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel for their roles in what a deputy director called an "operational failure" during a 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. The suspensions, ranging from 10 to 42 days without pay, follow multiple reports that identified significant security lapses, such as the failure to secure a rooftop from which the gunman fired. The incident, which resulted in the death of a rally attendee, has prompted the agency to implement improvements, including the use of military-grade drones and enhanced mobile command posts to prevent future failures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that South Wales Police are examining historical sexual abuse allegations against a convicted former bishop, Anthony Pierce, and another former vicar from the Church in Wales. Victims have come forward stating that concerns about Pierce were reported to church officials as early as 1986, long before his promotion, but were ignored. The revelations have led to calls for an independent inquiry into the institution, which has been criticized for a culture of concealment and failing to act on serious allegations, leaving victims without justice for decades. The Church in Wales has apologized for its failings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Citing a decline in letter volume and rising costs, UK's Royal Mail will no longer deliver second-class letters on Saturdays and will move to an every-other-weekday schedule. The industry regulator, Ofcom, approved the changes, which are set to begin on July 28, as a necessary reform to ensure the postal service's financial sustainability. First-class mail will continue to be delivered six days a week, but delivery targets for both services have been slightly relaxed. The move has drawn criticism from consumer groups and some businesses who fear it will lead to less reliable service and higher costs.</p>

          <p>Dispatch audio from the recent catastrophic flooding in Texas' Hill Country shows that Kerr County officials waited 90 minutes to issue a CodeRED emergency alert after a firefighter urgently requested it. The initial call was made at 4:22 a.m. as the Guadalupe River began to flood, but the first alert wasn't sent until almost 6:00 a.m., with some messages arriving hours later. This delay in warning residents to seek higher ground is under scrutiny, as officials had previously touted the system's ability to notify the entire county in minutes. The county sheriff has deferred questions, promising an "after-action" review.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK Parliament's intelligence and security committee has warned that the nation faces a "rising, persistent and unpredictable threat" from Iran. The inquiry highlighted a sharp increase in Iranian state-sponsored plots, including assassinations and kidnappings, targeting opponents of the regime within the UK. The committee criticized the government for focusing too much on "crisis management" and the nuclear issue, urging a more strategic, long-term approach with better resourcing to counter Iran's wide-ranging and aggressive intelligence activities. The report asserts that the threat from Iran should not be underestimated.</p>

          <p>More than 30 construction workers were successfully rescued after a section of an 18-foot-wide industrial tunnel they were building in Los Angeles partially collapsed. The workers, located about 400 feet underground and six miles from the entrance, had to climb over a 12-foot pile of debris to reach a tunnel boring machine, which then transported them to safety. Officials reported no major injuries, and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass praised the first responders and the workers' composure during the incident.

However, the experience was saved by the empathy of two stadium employees who provided noise-canceling headphones and moved the family to a quieter area.

Whitehouse, who recently delivered his 300th Senate speech on climate change, argues that Democrats have failed to effectively call out this denial operation and should be more aggressive in highlighting the issue to voters, who he believes would be irate if they understood the full extent of the deception.</p>

          <p>Italy is hosting the fourth international conference focused on rebuilding Ukraine, bringing together political leaders, businesses, and international organizations in Rome. The meeting aims to foster public-private partnerships for modernizing Ukraine's defense, energy, and mining sectors, even as Russia intensifies its attacks on the country. The event occurs amid growing uncertainty about the future of U.S. commitment to Kyiv's defense under the Trump administration. With Ukraine's recovery estimated to cost over $500 billion, the conference seeks to lay the groundwork for a massive reconstruction effort and support Ukraine's path toward EU membership.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is concluding a three-day state visit to the U.K., marked by royal pageantry and high-level talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. While the summit focuses on joint priorities like migration and defense, it is overshadowed by the unpredictable trade policies of the U.S. Trump administration. European leaders are anxiously awaiting details on potential new tariffs, with hopes for a U.S.-EU trade deal hanging in the balance. The visit highlights the complex geopolitical landscape where traditional alliances are tested by new economic pressures from across the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>The upcoming "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, is intentionally political, framing the iconic hero as a symbol of "universal morality" rather than just American exceptionalism. Gunn described his Superman as representing an America that is "beat-up" but still stands for kindness, a concept he says some will find offensive. This portrayal, along with the character's origin as an "undocumented alien" from another planet, has drawn criticism from right-wing commentators who fear the hero has become "woke." The film taps into a long history of interpreting the superhero, created by Jewish immigrants, as a defender of the weak and an outsider.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has stopped delivering its ID.Buzz electric van to the United States, according to a report in the Handelsblatt newspaper. The decision is reportedly influenced by two key factors: the high 27.5% tariff imposed by the Trump administration on new cars from Europe, and a separate recall order. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration mandated the recall because the van's third-row seats do not meet federal safety standards. This halt in deliveries comes as VW reports a nearly 7% drop in total vehicle sales to North America in the first half of the year.</p>

U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested a decision on tariffs is imminent, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated the EU has made "significant, real offers" to open its markets. The EU is reportedly preparing for a baseline 10% U.S. tariff, a sharp reduction from the 50% Trump previously threatened.

          <p>In a significant advance for autonomous robotic surgery, a machine has performed a realistic gallbladder removal on a life-like model with 100% accuracy. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University announced that the robot, trained on surgical videos using machine learning, operated with the skill of an expert human surgeon. The system was able to identify and manipulate organs, adapt to unexpected changes like the introduction of dye, and even respond to voice commands from the research team. While the procedure took longer than a human, the achievement demonstrates that complex surgeries could one day be performed autonomously.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has stated that his fellow Democrats allowed the U.S.-Mexico border to be "under siege" and that Donald Trump "was right" on the issue. In a BBC interview, Kerry said he wished President Biden had been more vocal about enforcing border laws, arguing the party's failure to do so allowed Republicans to gain a political advantage. His comments highlight a significant internal debate within the Democratic party over its immigration policies and how to respond to the Trump administration's aggressive nationwide deportation efforts, which have been met with protests and legal challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vienna is often cited as a model for successful housing policy, largely due to its extensive social-housing stock, which accounts for 43% of all units in the city. This system, which serves not only low-income but also middle-class households, keeps rent levels significantly lower than in the private market and helps to moderate private rents as well. The stability of this sector, which has resisted the large-scale privatization seen in other European cities, is a key feature. While challenges related to accessibility exist, Vienna's long-term political commitment to prioritizing housing as a basic need offers important lessons for other cities grappling with housing crises.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that a 50% tariff on imported copper will take effect on August 1, 2025, following what he described as a "robust national security assessment." In his announcement, Trump emphasized copper's critical role in manufacturing semiconductors, military equipment, and batteries, noting it is the second most used material by the Department of Defense. The U.S. imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile, and analysts predict the tariff could cause a significant price surge for American consumers and create a wide premium between U.S. and global copper prices.

Duckworth accused him of not taking the role seriously and being unprepared for the crucial diplomatic posting.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Albanese's "campaign of political and economic warfare" would not be tolerated.

          <p>Top tennis players, including Wimbledon semi-finalist Amanda Anisimova, are speaking openly about the challenges of managing mental health on the grueling professional tour. Anisimova took a months-long break from the sport due to burnout, a decision she says was necessary and has helped her return stronger. Other players like Carlos Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka also emphasize the importance of finding joy, taking breaks, and having a strong support system to cope with the 11-month season, constant travel, and immense pressure to perform. Their experiences highlight a growing awareness within the sport of the need to prioritize mental well-being alongside physical fitness.</p>
