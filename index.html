          <p>Federal prosecutors have accused Mahmoud Amin Ya'qub al-Muhtadi, a 33-year-old living in Louisiana, of involvement in Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel and subsequent entry into the U.S. with a fraudulent visa. Newly unsealed court documents allege al-Muhtadi coordinated armed fighters to cross into Israel, sending messages to procure ammunition and a bulletproof vest for another individual. His phone reportedly pinged near Kibbutz Kfar Aza, a site of significant casualties, hours after the attack began. Al-Muhtadi is charged with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization and visa fraud, highlighting the ongoing efforts to track individuals connected to the conflict.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military live-fire exercise over Interstate 5 in northern San Diego County resulted in metal shrapnel falling onto a California Highway Patrol (CHP) vehicle, causing damage. The shrapnel originated from an explosive ordnance that detonated prematurely overhead during a Marine Corps 250th-anniversary celebration. CHP officers, who were closing traffic, reported no injuries, and the Marines promptly ceased further live-fire operations over the freeway. This "unusual and concerning situation" prompted Chief Tony Coronado to highlight the rarity of such incidents over active freeways, prioritizing the safety of California residents and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Lakers center Jaxson Hayes sustained a "light sprain" on his right wrist after a hard fall in a preseason game, but expects to be ready for the regular-season opener. He and Luka Doncic are building strong on-court chemistry, with Hayes even working to obtain a Slovenian passport to potentially join Doncic on the national team. Coach JJ Redick observed that the team missed several assist opportunities due to misfired or overly complicated passes, highlighting the ongoing adjustment period for new players like Deandre Ayton to Doncic's distinctive passing style. This developing synergy is crucial as the Lakers refine their play ahead of the new season.</p>

          <p>Several individuals disguised as construction workers executed a daring heist at the Louvre Museum, stealing at least nine pieces of jewelry from the Napoleon and French crown jewel collections. The thieves utilized a mobile freight elevator and angle grinders to breach a window on the second floor, accessing the Apollo gallery to smash display cases. Items of "inestimable heritage and historical value," including crowns, necklaces, earrings, and brooches, were taken before the perpetrators fled on motorcycles. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed recovery and justice, as police investigate the meticulously planned, seven-minute operation, which forced the museum's closure.</p>

          <p>England is set to introduce new V-level vocational courses for 16-year-olds, aiming to simplify the "confusing landscape" of post-GCSE qualifications. These V-levels will replace Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, focusing on practical skills leading to employment. The government also plans an alternative qualification for maths and English resits, addressing the demoralizing cycle of exam failures. While designed to build on the strengths of BTecs, concerns from the Sixth Form Colleges Association suggest the new V-levels might not fully bridge the gap, highlighting the importance of their effective implementation and subject scope.</p>

Qian emphasized that the rivalry extends beyond trade into technology and ideologies, stressing that continued unhealthy competition harms both nations and the world.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered X and xAI's antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI to remain in Fort Worth, Texas, despite the companies having "at best minimal connections" to the geographic area. Judge Mark Pittman, in a sharply ironic order, encouraged the tech giants to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth, even providing a city website link for the process. This ruling implicitly criticized the practice of "forum-shopping," where plaintiffs strategically file lawsuits in specific judicial districts. The lawsuit, initiated by Elon Musk's companies, alleges an anticompetitive scheme by Apple and OpenAI in the artificial intelligence market.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area frequented by Air Force One during President Trump's visits to Florida. FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed the finding, with the Secret Service sharing a photo of what appeared to be a hunting stand situated high in a tree. Sources revealed the stand, located across a highway more than 200 yards away, had likely been present for months and was only identified after construction concluded, allowing Air Force One to resume using that airport section. Despite no immediate threat, the discovery is notable given a prior assassination attempt in the vicinity.</p>

It posits that a multipolar world is already established by economic realities, urging statecraft over confrontation to avert catastrophic miscalculation. The article identifies two critical distinctions from past transitions: the irrationality of total war due to nuclear proliferation and the unprecedented costs of systemic rupture caused by technological interdependence. These dynamics, it argues, create powerful incentives for major economies to avoid breakdown and manage competition through patient diplomacy.</p>

However, the party faces internal divisions on effectively opposing Trump while in the minority, especially amidst an ongoing government shutdown tied to healthcare subsidies, which is causing increasing financial hardship for federal workers and low-income families.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight en route from Denver to Los Angeles was diverted to Salt Lake City after pilots discovered a crack in one of the multilayer windshield's layers. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is actively investigating the incident, with the Boeing 737's windshield being sent to its laboratory for thorough examination. While designed to remain functional despite damage to a single layer, investigators will seek to determine if an object struck the aircraft mid-flight and review flight voice and data recorder details. All 134 passengers and six crew members landed safely, and another aircraft transferred passengers to their destination.</p>

          <p>A spectacular robbery at the Louvre Museum saw professional thieves steal eight priceless 19th-century jewels, including diadems, necklaces, and earrings, from the French crown jewel collection. The perpetrators utilized an elevating platform and disc-cutters to breach a window into the Apollo Gallery, executing the heist in under seven minutes before fleeing on motorcycles. One of Empress Eugénie’s crowns was recovered damaged near the museum, apparently dropped during their escape. This brazen theft, the most significant since the Mona Lisa's disappearance in 1911, raises serious questions about the Louvre's security and French art protection protocols, with experts fearing the jewels will be dismantled and sold.</p>

          <p>Atlanta United has fired head coach Ronny Deila following a disappointing 5-13-16 season, his first in charge, which saw the team secure only one win in its last 18 matches. Despite initial high expectations, fueled by Deila's MLS Cup-winning past, a significant transfer fee for a new forward, and the re-signing of Miguel Almirón, the club finished 14th in the Eastern Conference. CEO Garth Lagerwey stated that the "standard of play was not met" and announced an immediate global search for a replacement. This decision underscores the club's unwavering commitment to providing a much better on-field product for its community and fans.</p>

          <p>Former Biden White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre revealed in her new memoir, "Independent," that she chose to leave the Democratic Party, feeling she could no longer "stomach" its treatment of then-President Joe Biden. She described her anger and heartbreak upon Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race, believing he was "treated poorly by members of his own party" despite his extensive public service. Jean-Pierre accused Democrats of unleashing a "firing squad" on Biden following his dismal debate performance. Her decision to become an independent reflects a personal journey to fight for her beliefs without what she perceived as blind party loyalty.</p>

The band confirmed his passing, remembering him as "pure magic" and a "true legend of legends" whose spirit would live on in their music.

Trump's remarks follow Petro's accusation that a prior US strike, which killed a Colombian fisherman, constituted "murder" and violated Colombian sovereignty.

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter, as host and musical guest on "Saturday Night Live," skillfully used her appearance to subtly address public criticism of her provocative persona. Through a QVC spoof featuring a suggestively shaped neck pillow and a "girlboss" seminar sketch, Carpenter coyly dismissed notions of being subservient or promoting misogynistic fantasies. Her opening monologue also directly referenced the controversy surrounding her album cover, "Man's Best Friend," with feigned bewilderment. The article suggests Carpenter, a former Disney star, is self-aware and strategically prefers to be "in on the joke" rather than directly confronting those scrutinizing her sexuality and artistic choices, demonstrating her evolving artistic control.</p>
