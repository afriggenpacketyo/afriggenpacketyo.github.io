          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants. The strike, which began over disputes regarding pay and unpaid work, stranded over 100,000 travelers globally during the peak summer season. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the workers back, referring the matter to the Canada Industrial Relations Board for binding arbitration to resolve the contract impasse. The airline warns that while flights will restart Sunday evening, it will take several days for the schedule to fully normalize, with some cancellations expected over the next week.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has weakened to a Category 3 storm but remains a major hurricane with maximum winds of 125 mph. The storm is currently moving west-north-west, bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, where flood warnings are in effect. While Erin is not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. mainland, its growing size will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast from Florida to New England. Forecasters anticipate the storm will turn northward, steering between Bermuda and the coast.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russia's continued refusal to accept a ceasefire is complicating peace negotiations. This comes as he prepares to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, at the White House. Following a summit in Alaska, Russia reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the entire Donetsk region, a condition Kyiv has consistently rejected without robust security guarantees. Zelenskyy emphasized that stopping the violence is a key prerequisite for any meaningful progress toward a lasting peace agreement.</p>

          <p>More than 2,500 migrants have crossed the English Channel in small boats in the 11 days following the implementation of a new "one in, one out" agreement between the UK and France. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant the UK returns to France, it will accept one person with a strong asylum case. Despite the new plan, crossings have continued at a significant pace, with nearly 28,000 arrivals this year. The UK government faces pressure to demonstrate the effectiveness of its strategy to deter people-smuggling gangs, though the deterrent effect may not be clear until deportations begin.</p>

          <p>A recent decision by South Korea's new president to reduce radio broadcasts into North Korea by 80% is raising concerns for the estimated 400,000 Christians in the isolated nation. The policy, intended to ease inter-Korean tensions, removes a crucial lifeline for Christians who secretly listen to gospel programming, as religious practice is severely persecuted by the Kim Jong Un regime. Human rights advocates and defectors argue that these broadcasts are a vital source of hope and outside information. Critics have labeled the move a "catastrophic strategic mistake," fearing it will further isolate those suffering under the authoritarian government.</p>

          <p>While Hurricane Erin has weakened to a Category 3 storm, it is growing in size after briefly intensifying into a rare Category 5 hurricane with 160 mph winds. The storm's expansion means its effects, such as tropical-storm-force winds, extend over a wider area, currently impacting the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with flooding risks. Meteorologists expect its intensity to fluctuate, but its primary threat to the U.S. mainland will be life-threatening surf swells and dangerous rip currents along the entire East Coast. The storm is forecast to turn north into the Atlantic, avoiding a direct landfall.</p>

          <p>Several Chinese universities are facing intense online criticism for hosting Darius Longarino, a research scholar from Yale Law School. The controversy stems from social media users highlighting Longarino's past posts on X that were critical of Beijing's policies in the Xinjiang region. Central South University in Changsha, along with at least two other institutions, invited Longarino to lecture on topics unrelated to Xinjiang, such as sexual harassment in Chinese courts. In response to the backlash, the universities have removed online posts related to his lectures from their websites.</p>

          <p>After nearly a quarter-century of separation, an undocumented immigrant in California was emotionally reunited with his elderly parents from Zacatecas, Mexico. The reunion was made possible through a program that helps Mexican citizens secure temporary visitor visas to see family in the U.S. For years, José Antonio Rodríguez had only connected with his parents through phone calls and letters while working as a carpenter and sending money home. The poignant event, hosted in East Los Angeles, highlights the profound personal impact of immigration policies and the deep-seated desire for family connection across borders.</p>

          <p>A commentary on Celine Song's new film, "Materialists," argues that it accurately portrays the transactional nature of modern dating, where romance is increasingly intertwined with financial pragmatism. The film centers on a matchmaker who treats relationships like a market, a perspective the article's author finds uncomfortably familiar. The piece suggests that dating apps have normalized a consumerist approach to finding partners, while economic pressures like wealth inequality and rising living costs make a partner's financial stability a crucial factor. The author concludes that the film reflects a societal reality where achieving financial security through a relationship has become a valid, if unsettling, consideration.</p>

          <p>Thousands of residents have fled the Zeitoun neighborhood in southern Gaza City due to days of continuous Israeli bombardment, which local officials describe as "catastrophic." The Israeli military announced it would resume allowing tents into Gaza for aid agencies, as it plans to displace a million people from the city to camps in the south. This military action has sparked a one-day general strike in Israel, with protesters arguing the government's plan to occupy Gaza City endangers the lives of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.

          <p>The British horse racing industry has announced an unprecedented one-day strike on September 10, canceling all four scheduled fixtures for the day. The action is a protest against a government proposal to increase the tax rate on betting on the sport, aligning it with the higher rate for online gaming. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) argues the tax hike would be catastrophic, predicting a £330 million loss in revenue and threatening nearly 3,000 jobs in the first year. The Treasury maintains it is consulting on the proposal, which it frames as a bureaucratic simplification rather than a rate increase.</p>

This trend, highlighted by McDonald's recruitment of older workers, has sparked debate on social media amid record youth unemployment. While hiring retirees helps companies cut costs, some worry it will shrink job opportunities for younger generations. The new policy, effective next month, aims to strengthen China's pension system by invalidating agreements that allow employees to forgo social insurance contributions.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on how her appreciation for Renaissance art evolved from youthful indifference to a profound connection shaped by life events. Initially dismissing the genre as unrelatable, she found new meaning in its depictions of complex human emotions after experiencing trauma, pregnancy, and motherhood. The author contrasts her early cynicism with her later ability to be moved by works like Piero della Francesca’s "Madonna del Parto" and Raphael's Madonnas.

          <p>A federal immigration agent discharged their firearm at a vehicle during a "targeted enforcement operation" in San Bernardino, prompting an investigation by local police. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers were injured when the driver refused to exit and drove his car at them. However, the driver contacted police claiming unknown masked men shot at him, and video from an immigrant advocacy group appears to show agents smashing the car's windows before shots are fired. The incident led to a standoff and a crowd forming, with local police providing support for crowd control during a subsequent arrest for assault on a federal officer.</p>
