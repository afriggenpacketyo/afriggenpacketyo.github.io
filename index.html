          <p>Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty of sexual assault in a New York retrial, adding to his previous conviction in Los Angeles. The jury convicted him of assaulting Miriam Haley but acquitted him of assaulting Kaja Sokola, and they were unable to reach a verdict on a charge of sexual assault involving Jessica Mann, leading to further deliberations. Weinstein's spokesperson expressed concerns about preconceived notions among jurors, suggesting potential appellate issues. His previous conviction was overturned due to the admission of testimony from women with allegations beyond the charges at hand. The trial involved testimony from three women accusing Weinstein of sexual abuse using his industry power, and the jury deliberated for five days amidst reported tensions. The optimism score for this article is based on the fact that the author wrote about the topic with the reality of the situation in mind.</p>

          <p>An uneasy calm has settled over Los Angeles following a night of curfew and mass arrests in response to protests over immigration raids. Nearly 400 people have been arrested, including undocumented migrants and individuals charged with assault and obstruction, while federal prosecutors have charged two men with throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers. Mayor Karen Bass declared a curfew in a small area of downtown due to vandalism and looting, prompting police to use rubber bullets to disperse crowds. The situation unfolded amidst heightened tensions between President Trump and state officials, with the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to assist with enforcement operations.

          <p>New estimates suggest that Social Security beneficiaries may see a 2.5% increase in their benefits in 2026, matching the adjustment made in 2025. This cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is intended to help monthly checks keep pace with inflation. The official COLA for 2026 will be calculated based on third-quarter inflation data and announced in October, though the estimate is subject to change depending on economic factors such as President Trump's tariff policies. A 2.5% COLA increase would be considered about average, according to analysts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein's retrial on sex crimes charges in Manhattan concluded with a split verdict: he was convicted on one count of engaging in a criminal sex act but acquitted on another count. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the third count of sexual assault, resulting in the judge instructing them to continue deliberations. The split verdict followed apparent discord among jurors during deliberations, with the foreperson expressing an inability to continue working with the other jurors.

          <p>The U.S. government's budget deficit increased in May, reaching $316 billion and bringing the year-to-date total to $1.36 trillion. The annual shortfall is 14% higher than the previous year, driven largely by surging financing costs, with interest on the national debt exceeding $92 billion for the month. Despite a rise in tax revenue, which increased 15% in May, expenditures also rose, contributing to the growing fiscal issues.

          <p>The House's policy bill would lose money, but the Trump administration has imposed tariffs that have resulted in companies paying billions more to bring goods into the country. In May, the Treasury collected over $22 billion in tariff payments, marking a record high. While inflation data has yet to fully reflect price increases from tariffs, companies may soon pass these costs onto consumers or see narrower profit margins. House Republicans have argued that the tariff revenue will offset projected losses from their tax and spending bill, currently under consideration in the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are seeking answers regarding President Trump's involvement with World Liberty Financial, a crypto firm partly owned by his family, ahead of a vote on the GENIUS Act. They have demanded details about a multibillion-dollar transaction between World Liberty Financial and a pool of investors, including foreign nationals, and questioned the firm's launch of a stablecoin. Senators Warren and Merkley expressed concerns about potential conflicts of interest and requested financial records related to the $2 billion investment in World Liberty by MGX, an Emirati firm. The GENIUS Act aims to establish a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A theory circulating on the left blames liberals for President Trump's authoritarian actions, arguing that their support for free speech and criticism of left-wing excesses have enabled his policies. This argument suggests that Trump would not be able to carry out his agenda if liberals had refrained from denouncing left-wing cancel culture and protests. However, the article argues that the left's tactics and rhetoric helped enable Trump's return to power, and liberal critics deserve credit for anticipating and trying to prevent the backlash. The article draws parallels to McCarthyism, where liberals opposed both communism and McCarthyism simultaneously.</p>
