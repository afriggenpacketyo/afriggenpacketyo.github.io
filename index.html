          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking second-quarter profit, surging nearly 61% year-over-year due to sustained high demand for artificial intelligence chips. The world's largest contract chipmaker surpassed revenue and net income estimates, with its high-performance computing division, encompassing AI and 5G applications, now accounting for 60% of its total revenue. While the company projects continued strong growth into 2025, it acknowledges potential headwinds from U.S. tariff policies and macroeconomic conditions that could impact orders from smartphone and PC clients.

          <p>Organizers of the Tomorrowland electronic dance music festival in Belgium have confirmed the event will proceed as scheduled, despite a significant fire destroying its main stage. The blaze occurred just before the festival was set to open its campsite to as many as 400,000 attendees, but fortunately, no injuries were reported. While organizers expressed devastation over the loss of the elaborate stage, they assured attendees that other areas of the venue were unaffected and that they were working on solutions. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has signed 20-year-old Canadian forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool in a landmark deal for women's football, setting a new world record transfer fee of £1 million. Smith, who has signed a four-year contract, is considered one of the sport's most promising young talents, having scored seven goals in 20 Women's Super League games last season. The transfer surpasses the previous record held by Chelsea's signing of Naomi Girma and highlights the growing financial investment and profile of the women's game, with Liverpool making a significant profit on the player.</p>

          <p>An investigation into a potential large-scale surrogacy scam is underway in Southern California after authorities took 21 children into protective custody. The children, ranging in age from two months to 13 years, are linked to a Los Angeles-area couple who were arrested earlier this year after one of their babies suffered a traumatic head injury. The couple possessed what appeared to be legitimate birth certificates listing the woman as the mother for all the children. A now-terminated business, Mark Surrogacy Investment LLC, was previously registered at their address, adding to the investigation's complexity.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party is assessing comments made by veteran MP Diane Abbott, who recently stated she does not regret a letter that led to her previous suspension from the party. In an interview, Abbott reiterated her view that racism based on skin color is distinct from prejudice faced by Jewish, Irish, or Traveller communities, arguing that the former is immediately visible. Her original letter in 2023 caused significant controversy and was condemned as antisemitic by party leader Keir Starmer, leading to a year-long suspension before her recent reinstatement just before the election.</p>

Analysts suggest that these indicators increase the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England next month.

          <h2>Welsh Rugby Faces Disappointment as No Players Named in Lions Test Squad for First Time Since 1896</h2>

          <p>The omission of Welsh captain Jac Morgan from the British and Irish Lions' squad for the first Test against Australia has been described as a significant blow to Welsh rugby. This marks the first time since 1896 that no Welsh players have been included in a Lions Test squad against a traditional southern hemisphere opponent, a statistic that underscores the recent decline of the national team. Despite Morgan's strong tour performances, the highly competitive back-row positions were filled by players from England and Ireland, leaving Wales without representation in the matchday 23.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Sands has commenced construction on a new $8 billion integrated resort in Singapore, a major expansion of its presence in Asia. The project, described as a new identity rather than an extension of the existing Marina Bay Sands, will feature a 55-story all-suite hotel, luxury retail, and a 15,000-seat arena. Designed by Safdie Architects, the development includes a public rooftop Skyloop with an observation deck and gardens. The project aligns with Singapore's long-term tourism strategy to attract high-value leisure and business travelers to the city-state.</p>

          <p>After years of stalled plans, Elon Musk's business ventures in India are finally gaining momentum, with Tesla opening its first showroom and Starlink receiving regulatory approval for commercial services. This shift comes as Musk diversifies his global strategy amid complex relationships in the U.S. and China. While Tesla's high-priced Model Y targets India's premium segment, Starlink is positioned to address rural internet connectivity gaps, likely through government and business partnerships. These moves signal growing investor confidence in India's market, though significant infrastructure and cost challenges remain for both companies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has approved a $9 billion spending rescissions package requested by the Trump administration, targeting funds for foreign aid and public broadcasting. The bill passed narrowly with a 51-48 vote, with two Republican senators joining Democrats in opposition, and now returns to the House for final approval. The package includes approximately $8 billion in cuts to foreign assistance programs like USAID and $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for greater regulation and self-discipline in the electric vehicle sector to rein in the fierce price wars that are contributing to deflationary pressures in the economy. At a high-level meeting, Li urged automakers to focus on innovation and quality rather than destructive competition, which has eroded profits despite rising sales volumes. The move reflects broader government concern about "involution" in key industries, but policymakers face the challenge of curbing excess capacity without hindering economic growth or employment, particularly amid trade tensions.

          <p>Donald Trump has lashed out at his own supporters who have criticized his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, labeling them "weaklings" who have fallen for a "hoax." The backlash stems from the Justice Department's recent confirmation that no incriminating "client list" exists and that no more files will be released, contradicting earlier promises from his attorney general. This has angered some influential figures in his base, but Trump has doubled down, accusing them of being duped by Democrats and stating he no longer wants their support.</p>

To finance the budget without increasing member state contributions, the plan includes five new revenue streams, such as duties on tobacco and a contribution from large companies, though it has already faced criticism from some members as being "too high."

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has banned New York-based quantitative trading firm Jane Street, accusing it of a "sinister scheme" to manipulate the country's stock market. Sebi alleges that the firm used different entities to simultaneously drive up bank stock prices in the cash market while betting on their decline in the derivatives market, a practice known as "marking the close." The regulator claims this manipulation led to small investors trading at artificial and misleading prices. Jane Street has denied the allegations and plans to challenge the order.</p>
