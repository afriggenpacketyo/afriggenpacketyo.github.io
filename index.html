          <p>The International Red Cross is outraged by the killing of eight Palestinian Red Crescent medics in Gaza.  While Israel claims the ambulances were "suspicious vehicles," the IFRC asserts that humanitarian workers and medical services should be protected under international law.  This highlights the ongoing conflict and the devastating impact on civilians, with a potential bias towards portraying Israel's actions negatively.</p>
