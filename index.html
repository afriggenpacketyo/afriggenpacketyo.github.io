          <p>A judge has ruled that Bryan Kohberger's immediate family, including his parents and siblings, will be allowed to attend his upcoming trial for the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students. The judge cited Kohberger's Sixth Amendment right to a public trial, balancing it with the state's interest in obtaining forthright testimony. The judge determined that the family's testimony would be narrow and unlikely to be influenced by courtroom observations, as they have already given recorded interviews. The trial is set to begin in August, with prosecutors seeking the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has invoked the state secrets privilege to withhold information in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The administration is citing attorney-client privilege and executive privileges in addition to the state secrets privilege. This move follows accusations that the administration failed to comply with a court order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. The case involves concerns about the government's use of El Salvador's prison system to house deportees.</p>
