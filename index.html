          <h2>MPs Urge Year-Long Delay for Farm Inheritance Tax Reforms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 20:17:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A committee of MPs is advocating for a year-long postponement of the proposed inheritance tax changes affecting agricultural assets exceeding £1 million, citing inadequate consultation and potential harm to small family businesses. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee's report highlights concerns that the reforms threaten vulnerable farmers, suggesting the delay would allow farmers more time to seek professional advice. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) remains critical, deeming the policy fundamentally flawed and destructive, despite government assurances that only the wealthiest 500 farms annually will be affected. Additionally, the committee criticized the sudden closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) scheme, impacting trust in the government and potentially rendering many farms unviable.</p>

          <p>A brain-dead woman in Georgia is being kept on life support to allow her fetus to develop, a decision her family says is mandated by the state's abortion law. The 30-year-old woman, declared brain-dead in February, is now 21 weeks pregnant, and doctors are reportedly unable to remove life support due to the state's ban on abortions after cardiac activity is detected. The family is distressed by the situation, especially given concerns about the fetus's health, including fluid on the brain. Bioethicists are questioning the legal necessity of maintaining life support in this case, highlighting the complex ethical and legal issues arising from abortion laws in the post-Roe era.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura, the star witness in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial, underwent a rigorous six-hour cross-examination as defense attorneys presented text messages to challenge her claims of coercion and portray her as a willing participant in sexual activities. The defense aimed to undermine Ventura's credibility by highlighting messages indicating mutual affection and her apparent eagerness to engage in Combs' lifestyle. Ventura acknowledged her love for Combs and her initial willingness to participate in "freak-offs," but testified that she later felt coerced and subjected to violence. The defense also suggested that jealousy and infidelity were mutual issues in their relationship.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a greater-than-anticipated contraction of 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, according to preliminary government data, raising concerns about the country's economic outlook. This decline, steeper than the 0.1% contraction predicted by economists, comes amidst ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. and warnings from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) about the moderating effects of global trade policies. Despite these concerns, the BOJ seems poised to continue raising its policy rate, encouraged by inflation surpassing its 2% target, although some board members urge caution due to the uncertain economic outlook.</p>

While the bill underwent revisions, including adjustments to penalties based on the age difference between the offender and victim, it ultimately garnered bipartisan support.

          <p>A 9½-month-old boy, KJ Muldoon, has become the first patient to receive a custom gene-editing treatment for a rare genetic disorder called CPS1 deficiency, which is often fatal in infants. Doctors at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia used CRISPR technology to correct a single mutated gene out of 20,000 in his body. The treatment, which built on decades of federally funded research, offers a new path for developing personalized treatments for rare genetic diseases, potentially transforming healthcare and offering hope for millions affected by uncommon genetic conditions.</p>
