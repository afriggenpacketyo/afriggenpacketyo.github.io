          <p>President Trump asserted on social media that the U.S. has "complete and total control of the skies over Iran," a statement that contrasts with previous U.S. claims of non-involvement in Israel's actions against Iran. Trump also used strong language regarding Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and suggested potential U.S. military action. Vice President JD Vance indicated the president might take further action to address Iran's uranium enrichment activities, while the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem remains closed due to the security situation.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance defended President Trump's approach to Iran in a post on X, amid criticism from conservatives regarding U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict. Vance emphasized Trump's consistent stance against Iran possessing nuclear weapons and suggested potential further action to prevent uranium enrichment. He assured that the president is focused on using the American military to accomplish American goals. Vance's comments come as some of Trump's supporters express opposition to U.S. involvement in the conflict.</p>

          <p>With Israel's attack on Iran targeting its nuclear program, speculation has arisen about the potential use of the U.S. GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, known as the bunker buster. The bomb, capable of penetrating 200 feet deep, could be used against facilities like Fordo, where Iran's centrifuges are believed to be stored. This article explains the capabilities of the weapon and its potential implications, while also noting the IAEA's warnings about the dangers of attacks on nuclear facilities. The potential use of this weapon reflects the severity of the situation.</p>

          <p>New Yorkers are using ranked-choice voting in the city's mayoral primary, allowing voters to rank their top five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the least amount of votes is eliminated, and vote tabulation continues in rounds. This system has led to unusual alliances among candidates, with some cross-endorsing each other. The full results of the primary will not be reported until a week after the election due to the complexity of tabulating ranked-choice ballots.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are considering changes to the tax bill, a key component of President Trump's agenda, which could lead to disagreements with the House. The Senate Finance Committee released a legislative text addressing issues like Medicaid and clean energy tax credits. A major point of contention is the state and local tax deductions (SALT), with the Senate maintaining the current $10,000 cap, while the House negotiated a plan to lift it to $40,000 for certain couples. These changes could threaten the delicate coalition that passed the bill in the House.</p>

The musical received two Tony nominations, but won neither award. The show's producers expressed pride in representing immigrant communities on Broadway, and the musical was adapted from Josefina López’s 1988 play and the 2002 HBO film.</p>
