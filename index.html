        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's DF-5C intercontinental ballistic missile reportedly features advanced fuel storage technology, enabling it to be "ready to launch any time" from its silo. Unlike older liquid-fuel rockets, which require lengthy fueling processes, this upgrade addresses a key vulnerability, bringing its readiness closer to solid-fuel missiles. Military experts suggest that close-up shots of the DF-5C during a recent parade were deliberately showcased to dispel doubts about China's nuclear deterrence capabilities. This development signifies a significant leap in China's strategic military technology.</p>

          <p>David Ellison, CEO of the newly merged Paramount Skydance, has swiftly initiated major strategic changes, including a $7.7 billion deal for UFC mixed martial arts rights and securing a Call of Duty film franchise. These moves, along with hiring top talent and exploring an acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, aim to redefine entertainment and boost the company's streaming service, Paramount+. Analysts note this aggressive investment phase is crucial for the company, which was "starved" under previous management, though it may initially impact stock performance. The long-term strategy includes significant cost-cutting and a return-to-office mandate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ongoing conflict and insecurity in West and Central Africa have led to the closure of nearly 15,000 schools by mid-2025, displacing over 3 million children from education, with some experts estimating the true figure closer to 5 million. Nigeria is particularly affected, with parents fearing for their children's safety, especially daughters, due to kidnappings and banditry, prioritizing basic needs over schooling. While governments have implemented some interventions like mini-camps and security patrols, these efforts are deemed insufficient. Experts advocate for re-implementing COVID-era emergency education plans, utilizing virtual technologies to ensure learning continuity amidst persistent conflict.</p>

          <p>The UN Security Council, with the rare backing of the United States, has condemned Israel's strikes on a residential compound in Doha, Qatar, which targeted senior Hamas members. This condemnation, though not explicitly naming Israel, highlights global concern over de-escalation and Qatar's crucial mediation role in the Israel-Gaza conflict. Qatar's Prime Minister expressed outrage, stating the attack jeopardizes peace efforts, while Israel defended its actions by asserting no sanctuary for terrorists. US President Trump also criticized the unilateral strike, suggesting it doesn't advance peace goals, despite also calling Hamas's elimination a "worthy goal."</p>

          <p>Labour MPs are expressing significant anger over the appointment and swift dismissal of Peter Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US, following revelations about his continued correspondence with convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein. Despite Mandelson's friendship with Epstein being known at the time of appointment, new emails led to his sacking, causing a "shambles" within the government. Critics are now questioning the judgment of Prime Minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who is increasingly blamed for the decision. This controversy, alongside a recent cabinet resignation, has created a turbulent period for the Labour government.</p>

Sociologists highlight how patriarchal norms and the lack of inclusive public spaces contribute to women's vulnerability, as public areas are often male-dominated.

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has denied having any financial stake in an £885,000 Clacton home bought by his partner, Laure Ferrari, without a mortgage. A BBC investigation questioned how Ferrari, whose company accounts show limited activity, could afford the property, leading to accusations of Farage avoiding over £44,000 in stamp duty by putting it in her name. Farage insists the money was "legally hers" and that he sought expert tax advice to confirm all actions were legal. The controversy raises questions of hypocrisy, particularly after his criticism of other politicians for similar tax avoidance claims.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to over 27 years in prison for plotting a coup, effectively ending his political career. Bolsonaro, who rose to power in 2018 as an outsider, cultivated a mass movement but faced immense challenges, particularly during the pandemic, where his vaccine skepticism and anti-lockdown stance led to a high death toll. His presidency was marked by clashes with the Supreme Court and unsubstantiated claims of election fraud, culminating in his supporters storming government buildings in 2023. Despite the verdict, allies are already seeking amnesty, hinting at his lingering influence and potential for future political maneuverings.</p>

          <p>The Dutch public broadcaster, Avrotros, has announced the Netherlands will boycott the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest if Israel participates, echoing a similar stance by Irish broadcaster RTÉ. Both cited the "ongoing and severe human suffering in Gaza" and "serious erosion of press freedom" as reasons. Irish musician Phil Coulter has also called for the UK to withdraw. The decision puts pressure on the Eurovision organizer, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which is yet to make a final ruling on Israel's inclusion.

          <p>As the US Social Security trust fund faces depletion by 2033, potentially leading to benefit cuts, discussions are intensifying on how to ensure its solvency. Raising the retirement age is a common proposal, but this approach disproportionately impacts lower-income individuals who have shorter life expectancies, resulting in a larger percentage cut to their benefits. Experts highlight the growing life expectancy gap between rich and poor, making across-the-board age increases regressive. A proposed solution involves raising the retirement age only for the top 40% of earners, combined with other progressive benefit cuts and tax hikes, to achieve bipartisan reform.

          <p>Demand for Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) is soaring, with $540 billion in new money during the first half of 2025, yet financial experts caution investors against common pitfalls. Many investors mistakenly assume all ETFs are alike, failing to "look under the hood" at underlying assets, which can range from broad indexes to narrow, risky sectors. Another frequent error is "chasing performance" based on past returns, which are not indicative of future results. Experts also warn that frequent trading, despite ETFs' intraday liquidity, can "quietly erode returns" and undermine their low-cost, tax-efficient benefits as long-term investments.

The article posits that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, with "unconditional political support" and US weapons, acts with impunity, obstructing ceasefire talks and resorting to assassinations. This attack, which killed six people, is seen as sabotaging Qatar's mediation efforts and highlighting Israel's growing "rogue state" behavior, raising concerns about regional stability and US foreign policy.</p>

          <p>American colleges are grappling with rampant grade inflation and declining academic rigor, largely fueled by the influence of teacher evaluations on professors' careers. Faculty are incentivized to lighten workloads and award higher grades to secure positive student ratings, which impact pay, hiring, and tenure decisions. Research indicates a weak or negative correlation between high student evaluations and actual learning outcomes, with evaluations often biased by factors like expected grades or instructor attractiveness. Some institutions are attempting to reform the system by incorporating peer reviews and student performance in subsequent classes, but widespread change remains challenging.</p>
