            <p>Adam Mondschein, Blake Lively's co-star in 'It Ends With Us,' has challenged her allegations regarding a 'nearly nude' birthing scene, stating that she never complained or expressed discomfort during filming. Lively had claimed the scene was 'chaotic' and lacked industry protections for nude scenes, alleging she was 'mostly nude' with limited covering. Mondschein, who played Dr. Dunbar, asserts Lively wore a full hospital gown, black shorts, and a prosthetic, and that the set was entirely professional. Lively's representatives directed Fox News Digital to specific points from her amended complaint detailing the alleged lack of standard industry protections for filming nude scenes.</p>

            <p>A federal appeals panel has expressed concern that a judge may have overstepped his authority in ordering the Department of Veterans Affairs to construct more housing on its West Los Angeles campus. While the panel acknowledged the VA's potential failure to fulfill its duty to veterans, they questioned the breadth of the judge's order, which invalidated leases with private entities and mandated the construction of thousands of housing units. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from the government, UCLA, Brentwood School, and Bridgeland Resources, raising concerns about the judge's control over the VA campus and the potential implications of upholding the injunction.</p>

Universal Destinations and Experience plans include a theme park, a 500-room hotel, and a retail complex, with construction expected to begin in 2026 pending government approval. The development promises upgrades to local infrastructure, including railway stations and road improvements.</p>

            <p>Stocks sharply declined on Tuesday after the Trump administration announced it would impose a 104% tariff on China, reversing earlier gains fueled by hopes of tariff negotiations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, adding to a three-day sell-off driven by anxieties over the economic impact of widespread tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's earlier remarks about potential trade deals were overshadowed by the White House's confirmation of the new levies. The market's volatility reflects concerns about inflation and disruptions to global trade, with corporate earnings season and upcoming inflation data adding further uncertainty.

            <p>A U.S. judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore the Associated Press's access to presidential events after the White House restricted the news agency due to a dispute over the term "Gulf of America." District Judge Trevor McFadden ruled that the administration's restriction on AP journalists was "contrary to the First Amendment," guaranteeing freedom of speech. The AP sued three senior Trump administration officials, arguing that the restrictions infringed on press freedom.

            <p>The State Department has significantly reduced foreign aid, terminating contracts supporting the delivery of food, water, and medicine to populations in Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, and Lebanon. This decision has sparked criticism, with the World Food Programme warning that it could amount to a "death sentence for millions." The State Department defended the cuts, citing concerns that funding was benefiting terrorist groups and moving away from cash-based assistance. However, some officials claim that the cuts were ordered by a USAID deputy administrator and that some inadvertently eliminated programs have been restored.</p>

            <p>The UK government is investigating claims of fraud surrounding HVO diesel, a "green fuel" touted for its ability to curb carbon emissions. Industry whistleblowers allege that significant amounts of virgin palm oil, linked to deforestation, are being fraudulently relabeled as waste materials. Data analyzed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is likely able to produce. The Department for Transport is taking the concerns seriously and gathering further information, while the ISCC certification system faces scrutiny over its ability to ensure the sustainability of biofuels.</p>

            <p>President Trump's global tariff program has caused significant market disruption, and his focus on China is adding to the uncertainty. A day of fluctuating geopolitical signals ended with the White House announcing additional tariffs on Chinese imports. Trump's contradictory messages, alternating between conciliation and confrontation, have left businesses and economists struggling to understand the administration's trade strategy. Most economists warn that the tariff program risks fueling inflation and triggering a global trade war.</p>

            <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has reiterated her opposition to potential U.S. drone strikes against cartels, amid reports that the Trump administration is considering such action. Sheinbaum emphasized that Mexico would not agree to any intervention or interference in its territory. While Mexico has agreed to increased surveillance flights, military strikes would likely damage U.S.-Mexico relations and could lead to reduced cooperation on key issues. Experts caution that unilateral U.S. strikes would face strong domestic opposition in Mexico and could undermine efforts to combat drug trafficking.</p>

            <p>New Social Security rules will require Americans seeking retirement or survivor benefits to apply online or in person, eliminating the phone application option. A report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) estimates that this change will require some 6 million seniors to travel up to 45 miles. Advocates argue that this policy creates barriers for seniors and people with disabilities, particularly those in rural areas. The Social Security Administration claims the changes are intended to combat fraud, but critics worry about the impact on vulnerable populations.</p>

Steve Witkoff will represent the U.S. at the meeting, which is scheduled to take place in Oman.

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to cut a $500 million grant for Cleveland-Cliffs, a steel manufacturing giant, despite promises to bolster the US manufacturing industry. The grant was intended to upgrade blast furnaces to be powered by cleaner energy sources. This decision has sparked criticism, with concerns raised about the impact on jobs and the environment. The potential cut is seen as aligned with Trump's support for the coal industry and opposition to clean energy initiatives.</p>
