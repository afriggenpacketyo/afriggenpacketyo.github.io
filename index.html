          <p>BP's stock price fluctuated significantly following reports that Shell was considering acquiring the oil major. The Wall Street Journal reported early-stage talks, causing BP shares to surge over 10% before retreating after Shell denied the discussions. BP's underperformance relative to Shell and U.S. competitors has fueled speculation about potential acquisition targets. BP's strategic shift towards renewable energy faced scrutiny as profits declined, leading to a strategic reset focusing on oil and gas while reducing renewable spending, highlighting the challenges in transitioning to sustainable energy sources.

          <p>Executives at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin emphasized the importance of Chinese companies relocating their entire manufacturing ecosystems to solidify overseas expansions. This strategy involves building factories in new markets for both export and local sales to enhance supply chain resilience amid rising global trade uncertainties. With increasing tariffs and trade tensions, particularly between China and the US, companies are seeking to avoid tariffs by moving a larger portion of their ecosystem abroad. This relocation trend, which began during President Trump's first term, aims to mitigate the impact of tariff increases by establishing plants in Southeast Asia, Mexico, and Morocco.</p>

He suggests the U.S. needs to balance sticks and carrots for both Ukraine and Russia to revitalize negotiations, as well as create a pressure of time to avoid endless deliberations.

Abrego Garcia is charged with human smuggling and pleaded not guilty, but his lawyers argue that concerns about deportation are a self-inflicted injury by the Department of Homeland Security.

          <p>Senators from both parties are questioning the Trump administration's plan to cut federal funding for public broadcasting and international aid programs. The White House argues the cuts are justified because the foreign aid programs are "antithetical to American interests," and federal spending on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is politically biased. Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins noted that 70% of the federal dollars for CPB support local programming and emergency communications, suggesting there are more targeted ways to address bias concerns. The proposed cuts include nearly $1.1 billion in funding for CPB, which supports local public television and radio stations, raising concerns about the impact on rural communities and children's programming.</p>

Mamdani, a 33-year-old progressive, ran an energetic campaign focused on affordability and economic issues, resonating with young voters and challenging established figures. His success has led to discussions about the need for Democrats to excite new voters, focus on economic concerns, and communicate effectively. However, Republicans are seizing on Mamdani's socialist ideas to portray Democrats as extreme, highlighting the challenges of translating local primary success into broader electoral appeal.</p>

          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider cryptocurrency as an asset in single-family mortgage loan risk assessments. This move signals a significant shift in integrating cryptocurrency into the traditional financial system, particularly within American home lending. The directive requires both housing finance giants to develop proposals that include digital assets without requiring borrowers to liquidate them into U.S. dollars prior to loan closing. This decision aligns with President Trump's vision to establish the United States as the crypto capital of the world, marking a departure from previous exclusions due to volatility and regulatory uncertainty.

          <p>The proliferation of AI chatbots poses an existential threat to news publishers and journalists, as these chatbots summarize articles and keep users within their platforms, reducing traffic to news websites. Studies indicate that Google's AI Overviews have already reduced traffic to external websites by over 34%. Publishers fear a "Google Zero" scenario, with some outlets experiencing layoffs due to traffic drops. AI companies train chatbots on stolen books and scraped news articles, intercepting audiences, subscription fees, and ad revenue. Publishers are responding with legal action and licensing deals, but negotiating power is limited, and the modest income from these arrangements may not save the industry.</p>
