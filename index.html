        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, with the latest official figures indicating a drop in vacancies and a slight decrease in the number of people on payrolls. Job openings fell by 5.8% between May and July, suggesting some firms are pausing new hires or not replacing departing employees. Despite the slowdown, the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.7%, and wage growth held at 5%. Economists suggest this gradual cooling may influence the Bank of England's future decisions on interest rates as it works to manage inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) after firing the previous commissioner over a weak jobs report. The appointment is controversial, as Antoni has previously criticized the agency's methodology and joked about its name, while some economists have called him unqualified and an extreme partisan. Trump stated the move is to ensure the numbers released are honest, but critics fear it will politicize the independent statistical agency and undermine its credibility. (not investment advice)</p>

His mother stated that since her son has been named throughout the trial, the defendant should be as well.

The integrated resort is shifting its focus from shopping to experiences, launching new attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium. Future plans include a Super Nintendo World, new luxury hotels, and a waterfront lifestyle complex, all aimed at transforming the resort into a premium destination and satisfying regulatory expectations.</p>

Zelenskyy stated that intelligence shows no indication Moscow is preparing for a post-war situation and that Putin's only goal is to claim a diplomatic victory before continuing his aggression. This comes amid Ukrainian fears that a deal could be struck without their involvement, potentially forcing them to cede territory to end the war.</p>

          <p>At a United Nations meeting, China's ambassador accused the United States of fabricating lies as a pretext to seek control over the Panama Canal. The accusation came after the acting U.S. ambassador expressed concerns about China's "outsized influence" over the canal's critical infrastructure and port operations, calling it a potential threat to global trade. The Chinese diplomat condemned the remarks as "unwarranted accusations" and urged the U.S. to engage in self-reflection rather than challenging the sovereignty of other nations.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani and his agent, Nez Balelo, are being sued by a real estate developer and broker over a luxury housing project in Hawaii. The lawsuit alleges that after being brought in as a celebrity endorser, Ohtani and Balelo used their leverage to make increasing demands before ultimately forcing the project's business partner to fire the plaintiffs. The suit accuses the pair of tortious interference and unjust enrichment, claiming they dismantled the plaintiffs' role in the project for their own financial gain.</p>

          <p>August 12th marks 40 years since the crash of Japan Airlines Flight 123, the deadliest single-aircraft disaster in history, which claimed 520 lives. The 1985 tragedy was caused by a faulty repair to the plane's rear bulkhead seven years prior, which failed mid-flight and led to an explosive decompression. The crew struggled for 32 minutes to control the crippled Boeing 747 before it crashed into a mountainside, a catastrophe compounded by a delayed rescue effort that is still deeply mourned in Japan.</p>

          <p>In the trial for California Governor Gavin Newsom's lawsuit against the Trump administration, a top general testified that he never heard the term "rebellion" used to describe the Los Angeles protests that prompted a controversial National Guard deployment. The administration had justified federalizing the troops under a law allowing for such action during a "rebellion," making the general's testimony a notable moment in the case. The trial examines whether the military's deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Colombian senator and presidential candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay has died, two months after being shot multiple times at a political rally in Bogota. The 39-year-old conservative politician had been in intensive care since the June attack, which raised alarms about a return to the political violence that plagued Colombia in the 1990s. Uribe's death was confirmed by his family, and authorities are still investigating who ordered the assassination and why, though a teenage suspect was arrested at the scene.</p>
