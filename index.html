          <p>Fifth Third Bancorp has agreed to acquire Comerica in a $10.9 billion all-stock transaction, a move that will create the ninth-largest bank in the United States by assets. The deal, expected to close in early 2026, will result in a combined entity with approximately $288 billion in assets. Executives from both banks praised the merger for combining Fifth Third's retail and digital strengths with Comerica's commercial franchise. The announcement caused Comerica's shares to rally over 11% in premarket trading, fueling expectations of further consolidation in the regional banking sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The first of three supermoons in 2025 will be visible Monday night, appearing larger and brighter than usual. This astronomical event occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest approach to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it seem up to 14% bigger. According to NASA, this proximity can make the moon appear more brilliant, though the difference can be subtle to the naked eye without a direct comparison. The phenomenon is observable worldwide under clear skies, with the next supermoons of the year slated for November and December.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will permanently continue his role as IRS commissioner, a position he took over on a temporary basis in August. This dual-hatted appointment is unusual, as no previous Treasury secretary has simultaneously led the tax agency. To manage the day-to-day operations, the administration is creating a new CEO position at the IRS, which will be filled by current Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano. The move solidifies the Trump administration's leadership over the nation's tax collection service, with Bessent also leading the search for the next Federal Reserve chair.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has entered a strategic partnership with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) that could see it acquire up to a 10% stake in the chipmaker. The deal involves OpenAI deploying 6 gigawatts of AMD's GPUs over several years, a multi-billion dollar arrangement that sent AMD's stock soaring over 35%. This move diversifies OpenAI's hardware supply chain, reducing its reliance on Nvidia, and marks a major validation for AMD in the competitive AI accelerator market.

          <p>The U.S. federal government shutdown enters its sixth day, with the Senate scheduled to vote on two competing stopgap funding measures on Monday. Democrats are backing a bill that includes an extension of health care provisions, which Republicans oppose. If that fails, the Senate will reconsider a Republican-supported 7-week funding measure that has already passed the House. Both parties continue to blame each other for the stalemate, with Democratic leaders accusing Republicans of choosing to keep the government closed, while Republican leaders urge Democrats to support a short-term, nonpartisan resolution.</p>

The company is gradually resuming production of its best-selling beer, along with some soft drinks and food products, but warns that operations are not yet at full capacity and some product launches will be delayed.</p>

This legal action represents a significant clash between the federal government and a major Democrat-led county over gun rights and public safety policies.

This mechanism acts as a crucial security check, curbing overactive immune cells that could otherwise cause autoimmune diseases.

          <p>Taiwan's ambitious Indigenous Defence Submarine (IDS) program is facing significant challenges as sea trials for its prototype vessel, the Hai Kun, have fallen behind schedule. The submarine, a key component of Taiwan's strategy to bolster its asymmetric naval defense capabilities against China, has spent an unexpectedly long time in dry dock after its initial surface navigation tests. The delays are raising questions about whether the project can meet its targets, which include shallow and deep dive trials. This setback represents a major test for one of the island's most critical and high-profile domestic defense initiatives in decades.</p>

          <p>A Milwaukee resident is facing over $60,000 in repair costs after a record-breaking storm caused severe flood damage that her insurance will not cover. The homeowner believed her sump pump coverage would apply, but the policy only covered non-flood-related water damage, a common and costly misunderstanding for many. Experts note that standard homeowners' insurance does not cover flood damage, and specific flood insurance is often under-advertised in areas not designated as high-risk. With intense rain events becoming more frequent, the incident highlights a growing gap in financial protection for homeowners facing the impacts of a changing climate.</p>

          <p>Despite economic instability for most Americans over the past five years, the wealth of billionaires has grown significantly, highlighting a system designed to funnel riches upward. Researcher Chuck Collins argues that this system involves not just acquiring wealth, but also a sophisticated "wealth defense industry" of lawyers and accountants using opaque tools like trusts and offshore accounts. This financial power translates into political influence, allowing the ultra-wealthy to shape policies that protect their assets. The final stage, "hyper-extraction" through private equity, allows this concentrated wealth to squeeze profits from essential sectors like healthcare and housing, directly impacting everyday costs for the general population.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to rescind a Clinton-era rule that has protected 58 million acres of pristine national forests from road-building and logging for over two decades. Citing the rule as "overly restrictive," the administration aims to open these areas to the timber industry, a move President Trump says will "make a lot of money." Environmental advocates argue that these roadless areas are vital for protecting clean drinking water sources for 60 million Americans, providing habitat for endangered species, and storing vast amounts of carbon. Critics warn the policy reversal is nonsensical, as it will require expensive new roads in hard-to-reach areas while threatening crucial ecosystems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court's 2024 decision granting former presidents immunity for certain official acts could have significant ramifications for international justice, potentially shielding leaders from accountability for international crimes like torture or genocide. Historically, the legal trend has moved away from absolute immunity, famously demonstrated in the case against Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. However, the Supreme Court's ruling creates a new form of presumptive immunity for a former U.S. president, a departure from the standard set at the Nuremberg trials. Legal experts worry this could undermine U.S. efforts to hold other global leaders accountable and encourage other nations to adopt similar protections for their own rulers.</p>

          <p>Shares in luxury carmaker Aston Martin dropped by 10% after the company issued a new profit warning, citing a difficult market and uncertainty over U.S. tariffs. The British manufacturer now anticipates its 2025 wholesale volumes will see a mid-to-high single-digit percentage decline and no longer expects to generate positive free cash flow in the second half of the year. The company specifically highlighted the complexity of the tariff quota mechanism in the U.S.-U.K. trade deal, which limits its ability to forecast accurately. Aston Martin is now reviewing future costs and has called for more proactive support from the U.K. government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vilnius Airport in Lithuania was forced to shut down for hours after dozens of meteorological balloons carrying contraband cigarettes floated into its airspace from neighboring Belarus. The incident led to 30 flight cancellations, affecting around 6,000 passengers. Lithuanian officials said this method of smuggling is not new, as the balloons are a cheaper alternative to drones for transporting black-market goods across the border. This airspace violation occurs amid heightened tensions in Europe over other recent incursions by drones, some suspected of being linked to Russia, which have disrupted air traffic in several countries.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla is intensifying in the Pacific Ocean off the southwestern coast of Mexico, with forecasts predicting it will strengthen into a Category 2 storm. As of early Monday, the storm was located south of Cabo Corrientes and was moving north-northwest with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph. While Priscilla's center is expected to remain offshore, its outer bands are already bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to the region. A tropical storm watch is in effect for a portion of the coast, with officials warning of a risk of flash flooding, particularly in mountainous areas.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled proposals to reform the house-buying system in England and Wales, aiming to reduce costs, shorten timelines, and cut the number of failed sales in half. The plan would legally require sellers to provide key property information upfront and introduces the option of binding contracts to prevent parties from backing out late in the process. This increased transparency is intended to reduce the risk of "gazumping" and collapsing chains, which currently cost the economy an estimated £1.5 billion annually. While the move is broadly welcomed, some experts caution it could create new delays for sellers.</p>

          <p>Paramount is reportedly negotiating a deal to acquire The Free Press, the online publication founded by Bari Weiss, for approximately $150 million. The potential acquisition would have significant implications for mainstream media, as it includes plans to install Weiss, a prominent center-right critic of "woke" ideology, in a high-level editorial role at CBS News. Since leaving The New York Times five years ago, Weiss has built The Free Press into a highly successful Substack publication by catering to an audience disillusioned with progressive orthodoxy. The move is seen by some as an attempt by Paramount to reshape CBS News to be more appealing to the right.</p>

          <p>A sudden, intense blizzard on the Tibetan slopes of Mount Everest has trapped more than 200 hikers, with at least one person confirmed dead. The storm, which began Friday and worsened over the weekend, brought relentless heavy snowfall, lightning, and thunderstorms to a popular hiking area. Rescue operations are underway, with hundreds of workers clearing snow to evacuate stranded individuals, many of whom are suffering from hypothermia. Rescuers have guided 350 people to safety so far, but the deep, wet snow is making the descent extremely difficult for those still on the mountain.</p>
