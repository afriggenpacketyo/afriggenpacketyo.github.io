          <p>Parents and health charities in the UK are raising alarms about a lack of dedicated services for children suffering from severe constipation, a condition that has led to a ten-year high in hospital admissions. The article highlights personal stories of children experiencing extreme pain and health crises due to delayed diagnoses and insufficient community-level bladder and bowel care. Experts attribute the rise to factors like delayed potty training and cultural reluctance to discuss the issue, creating a "postcode lottery" for treatment and placing immense strain on families.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited the Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis to pay respects to the victims of a recent mass shooting, where he was met by heckling from a group of protesters. While Vance met with victims' families and spoke about honoring the deceased children rather than focusing on the shooter, demonstrators across the street shouted slogans and held signs advocating for gun control. The article details Vance's emotional reflections on the visit and his call for prayers for a surviving victim, contrasting it with the protesters' vocal criticism.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 268,000 Venezuelan migrants who were covered under a 2021 designation. This move revokes their legal status and work permits, making them eligible for deportation unless they can secure other legal means to remain in the U.S. Officials stated the decision was made to discourage irregular migration, arguing that TPS acts as a "magnet," and are encouraging affected individuals to self-deport using a government app. This action is part of a broader administration effort to end humanitarian protections for migrants from various countries.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a majority of Americans continue to hold a negative view of the U.S. economy, with "uncertain" and "struggling" being the most common descriptors. Economic ratings have slightly decreased over the past month, driven primarily by persistent concerns over rising prices, which two-thirds of respondents say are still increasing. While personal financial ratings vary by income, the overall outlook remains pessimistic, with most believing the economy is worsening and a quarter anticipating a recession.

          <p>Public affairs network C-SPAN has reached agreements to be carried on YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, addressing financial pressures caused by the decline of traditional cable subscriptions. The move, which follows a U.S. Senate resolution urging streaming services to carry the network, will provide millions of new viewers with access to its unfiltered coverage of government proceedings. Facing a significant revenue drop over the past decade due to cord-cutting, these deals are crucial for the nonprofit's financial stability and its mission to offer transparent access to government.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to freeze approximately $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University, ruling that the action violated the university's First Amendment rights. The administration had cited concerns over antisemitism and "radical left" ideologies when it halted the funds in April. However, Judge Allison Burroughs determined the government used these concerns as a "smokescreen" for an ideologically motivated attack, as the freeze was not the government's "true aim." The ruling vacates the freeze orders and blocks the administration from withholding further payments on existing grants.</p>

The piece also notes that Broadcom's massive market capitalization gives its financial results the potential to influence the broader stock market, particularly the concentration of value in top tech companies.

          <h2>China's Military Parade Seen as a Direct Message to the U.S. Amid Trade Tensions</h2>

          <p>China's recent military parade, which President Trump called "very, very impressive," is being interpreted as a clear signal of its rising global power and an alternative to the U.S.-led world order. The article suggests the display of advanced weaponry, combined with diplomatic meetings between China, Russia, and India, illustrates a geopolitical realignment spurred by Trump's "America First" trade policies. While Trump's focus is on protecting U.S. industry with tariffs, the author argues these actions risk creating new international alliances that challenge American influence, presenting a scenario of "all risk, no reward" for his administration.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have identified the victim of a homicide at the Burning Man festival as Vadim Kruglov, a Russian citizen. Kruglov was found deceased in a pool of blood on the final night of the event in Nevada's Black Rock Desert. The Pershing County Sheriff's Office has launched a murder investigation and is seeking information from festival attendees who may have witnessed anything unusual. A friend described Kruglov as a kind person who had "poured his soul" into their camp community. Officials believe the killing was a singular crime but urged attendees to remain vigilant.</p>

The meeting occurred a day after the U.S. military destroyed a vessel in the Caribbean that President Trump claimed was operated by "narcoterrorists." Rubio defended the strike, stating, "What will stop them is when you blow them up," and suggested more such actions could follow.

          <p>With a government funding deadline less than four weeks away, lawmakers in Washington are already engaged in a bitter partisan dispute, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown.

The White House is unlikely to agree to any deal that weakens its signature legislative package, creating a high-stakes standoff. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The estimated cost for expanding the Los Angeles Convention Center has risen again, now reaching $2.7 billion, an increase of nearly half a billion dollars in just six months. City officials are increasingly concerned about the project's affordability and whether its first phase can be completed in time for the 2028 Olympic Games. A crucial part of the funding plan relies on revenue from large digital billboards, but the state legislation required to permit them is not guaranteed. Without that revenue, the city's general fund would face an average annual cost of $111 million, a burden some council members now call "unaffordable."</p>

          <p>Several experts in international and maritime law have raised concerns that the recent U.S. military strike that destroyed a vessel in the Caribbean may have been illegal. President Trump stated the boat carried 11 "narco-terrorists," but legal scholars told BBC Verify that using lethal force in international waters under these circumstances could violate the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Furthermore, they argue that labeling the individuals as terrorists does not automatically make them lawful military targets outside of an armed conflict, potentially making the strike an "extrajudicial arbitrary killing" under international human rights law.</p>

The attorney general concluded that the officers were justified because they were unaware of Perez's age or disabilities and believed others were in immediate danger. The family's lawyer expressed deep disappointment, arguing that the officers had a duty to retreat and that Perez's disability should have been apparent from his behavior.</p>

The strike raises legal and constitutional questions about the president's authority to order lethal force against non-state actors without due process.
