        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critically analyzes Washington's current industrial policy, which aims to reindustrialize the United States and contain China, arguing that these efforts are counterproductive. It highlights a significant contradiction between the Trump administration's anti-immigrant crackdowns and the demand for skilled labor in advanced manufacturing, as evidenced by a recent raid on a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia. The piece suggests that such policies, initiated by the previous administration and escalated by the current one, disrupt globalization and world trade, potentially harming the US and its allies. The author questions the feasibility of effective industrial policy in a post-industrial American context without addressing these fundamental inconsistencies, emphasizing the need for a more realistic approach.</p>

          <p>The Green Bay Packers commenced their new season with a dominant 27-18 victory over the Washington Commanders at Lambeau Field, achieving a strong 2-0 record. Quarterback Jordan Love orchestrated two crucial long touchdown drives, while the Packers' defense effectively contained Washington's offense, particularly second-year quarterback Jayden Daniels. Tight end Tucker Kraft emerged as a key player, leading the team with 124 receiving yards on six catches. Despite a late attempt by the Commanders to narrow the deficit, Green Bay maintained control throughout the game, demonstrating a cohesive and formidable performance early in the season.</p>

          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a prominent ally of former President Donald Trump, was fatally shot at an outdoor event at Utah Valley University in Orem. The 31-year-old was taking questions when a single shot, believed to be from a nearby rooftop, struck him in the neck. Authorities are intensively searching for the suspect, who appeared to be "college age," and have recovered a high-powered rifle along with significant forensic evidence. The assassination has elicited shock, grief, and anger across the political spectrum, with President Trump ordering flags to be flown at half-mast and condemning the act as "radical left political violence."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a stern warning to Mexico, threatening "necessary measures" if the country implements its proposed tariff hike on Asia-made cars from 20% to 50%. Mexico's Secretary of Economy Marcelo Ebrard indicated these increased duties, requiring Congressional approval, are part of a broader federal budget proposal affecting $52 billion worth of imports. China views this as a move that sacrifices third-party interests amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., urging Mexico to uphold free trade principles. The article highlights Mexico's growing importance as a destination for Chinese car exports and significant Chinese investment in its auto industry, suggesting the tariffs could impact bilateral economic cooperation.</p>

          <p>China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has sailed through the Taiwan Strait into the South China Sea to conduct scientific research trials and training missions. The Chinese navy stated this cross-regional exercise is routine and not directed at any specific target, despite China claiming the strait as its territory—a claim rejected by Taiwan. This move highlights China's ongoing expansion of its naval power, aiming to broaden its reach in the Pacific and challenge the US and its allies. The Fujian is expected to enhance the air force's capabilities with more advanced features.</p>

          <p>The California Assembly has passed the controversial Senate Bill 79, a housing initiative aimed at increasing density near public transit hubs by overriding local zoning laws. Championed by Senator Scott Wiener, the bill permits taller, denser housing—up to nine stories—adjacent to certain transit stops and impacts single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile. While proponents argue it is essential to address California's severe housing affordability crisis, critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, contend it represents an excessive state mandate that erodes local authority over urban planning.

This strategy led to a dramatic increase in five-year survival rates for various cancers. The article highlights that despite similar health spending as a share of national income, Denmark's sustained political consensus and long-term planning for cancer care offer vital lessons for England, which faces challenges in maintaining focus amidst other health priorities.</p>
