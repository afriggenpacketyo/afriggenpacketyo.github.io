          <p>On Thursday, thousands of TikTok users experienced an outage that interrupted their scrolling, with over 33,000 reports logged on Downdetector. The issues peaked around 4:30 p.m. EST before gradually easing an hour later. As of 6:15 p.m. EST, TikTok had not released a statement regarding the disruption on its main X accounts. The social media platform, which has surged in popularity due to the rise of influencer culture, is estimated to have over 2 billion users globally. The app's future in the U.S. has been uncertain due to a law signed by former President Biden, though President Trump has delayed its enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is challenging California's policies allowing a biologically male trans athlete to compete in girls' track and field, citing concerns about fairness and potential violations of Title IX. The U.S. Department of Education criticized Governor Gavin Newsom and the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) after reports emerged that CIF officials made athletes remove "Protect Girls Sports" shirts at a recent event. The CIF is already under federal investigation for its trans inclusion practices. Several athletes and schools have voiced concerns about the situation, with some students blaming the CIF for enabling the athlete's participation.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen delivered a forceful denunciation of President Trump during his “Land of Hope and Dreams” tour in Manchester, England, accusing the administration of trampling on civil rights, abandoning allies, and siding with dictators. Springsteen criticized the administration for inflicting pain on American workers, rolling back civil rights legislation, and defunding universities that don't align with their ideology. Despite his criticism, Springsteen expressed confidence that the America he has sung about for 50 years would survive this moment. This sharp critique stands out as other artists have seemingly muted their criticism of the president.</p>

          <p>Federal health officials are considering limiting COVID vaccine recommendations to older Americans and those with chronic health problems due to new clinical testing requirements. The CDC's scientific advisors are debating a shift to a risk-based strategy, similar to practices in other countries. New requirements for clinical testing of vaccines may delay the availability of updated shots. The FDA has requested additional clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine, and officials are questioning the necessity of the vaccine for children under 12. Experts fear these measures could undermine confidence in all vaccines.</p>

          <h2>Judge Dismisses Trespassing Charges Against People Crossing US-Mexico Border</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against immigrants caught in a new military zone on the US-Mexico border, citing a lack of evidence that they knew they were entering the zone. The ruling is a setback for the Trump administration's efforts to increase penalties for unlawful border crossings. While the trespassing charges were dismissed, the immigrants still face charges for crossing the border illegally. The New Mexico national defense area was established in April, authorizing US army troops to detain immigrants entering the area from Mexico.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, stated that price hikes due to tariffs could begin later this month, despite a recent agreement to lower duties on imports from China. He noted that the magnitude of the tariff increases is more than retailers or suppliers can absorb, and that consumers will likely see higher prices. Walmart beat quarterly earnings estimates but fell short on sales, and the company stuck by its full-year forecast. Rainey emphasized that tariffs are still too high, even with the temporary reduction.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly relying on officials to fill multiple positions, a practice known as dual-hatting, due to difficulties in finding qualified individuals willing to serve. Marco Rubio, for instance, holds four positions, including secretary of state and acting national security advisor. This reliance on dual-hatted officials raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the ability of these individuals to effectively manage their responsibilities. This practice is an attempt to learn from his first term, when Trump was slow to appoint people to fill administration roles.</p>

          <p>President Trump lowered his tariffs on China, and Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief. But for many businesses, especially small ones, 30 percent is still a crippling burden. Even Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States, said on Thursday that it would have to raise prices on some items in response to tariff-fueled cost increases. Smaller companies that rely on imports from China tend to have minimal leverage to negotiate with their Chinese suppliers — and relatively tight margins. Now, with the tariff rate down to 30 percent, Mr. Prior said he planned to restart manufacturing some of his most popular toys again and get them to the United States as soon as possible.</p>

There was questioning of lower courts' power to block a presidential order nationwide. And the justices also considered the merits of the birthright citizenship order itself - which critics argue violates the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution and Supreme Court precedent.</p>

At this point, AGI is largely rhetorical—a fantastical, all-purpose excuse for OpenAI to continue pushing for ever more wealth and power.
