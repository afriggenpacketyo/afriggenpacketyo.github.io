          <h2>Scientists Develop 'Unparalleled' Snake Antivenom from Man Bitten 200 Times</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have created an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Friede's blood contains antibodies effective against fatal doses from various snake species, potentially leading to a universal antivenom. Current antivenoms must match the specific snake species, but Friede's work could protect against bites from mambas, cobras, taipans, and kraits. The research, published in the journal Cell, identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that, combined with a third drug, protected mice from fatal doses of 13 of 19 deadly snake species. Relevant context is that Friede's motivation stemmed from a desire to develop better therapies for snakebite victims worldwide after early missteps nearly cost him his life.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic challenges and a complex geopolitical environment shaped by a second Trump administration. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing affordability, leading to dissatisfaction with both major parties. While Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor Party is favored in polls, opposition leader Peter Dutton has focused on economic issues like gas prices. The election also reflects a broader trend of voters shifting away from major parties towards independent candidates, indicating a desire for deeper solutions to current problems. This article summarizes the key issues and political dynamics shaping the Australian election.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to manage the Hong Kong dollar, which had exceeded its trading band against the US dollar due to increased capital inflow. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion worth of local currency, marking its first market intervention in two years. This action comes ahead of a US Federal Reserve meeting where interest rate cuts are expected, potentially increasing capital inflow to Hong Kong. The HKMA stated that the Hong Kong dollar's strength is driven by equity investment activities and regional currency appreciation, assuring it will closely monitor the market to ensure orderly operations.</p>

The papers also cover Prince Harry's comments on his relationship with the Royal Family, including concerns about King Charles' health and his legal battle over security. While some papers highlight the political implications of Reform UK's gains, others focus on the personal revelations from Prince Harry's interview.

          <p>Vietnam is implementing a sweeping administrative reform, dubbed a "revolution," to modernize the state, boost economic growth, and consolidate political power. Led by new party chief To Lam, the reforms include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media, and eliminating around 100,000 public sector jobs. The goal is to streamline bureaucracy, redirect resources to economic growth, and achieve high-income status by 2045. This overhaul is also intended to address dysfunction caused by the anti-corruption campaign and prepare the country to deal with external shocks, such as potential US tariffs. The reforms also strategically consolidate To Lam's power ahead of the Communist Party's 14th National Congress in 2026.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders over their "sanctuary" policies. The suit claims these policies interfere with federal immigration enforcement and endanger the public, citing an apartment complex in Aurora allegedly taken over by a Venezuelan gang as an example. The lawsuit challenges state laws and city ordinances that prevent local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Colorado officials maintain they are not a sanctuary state and will comply with court rulings, while Denver officials assert their right to defend their values and adherence to all laws.</p>

          <p>The US has imposed a 25% import tax on engines, transmissions, and other car parts, adding pressure to an industry already navigating significant policy changes. While President Trump eased the measure in response to business concerns, the tariff aims to encourage carmakers to increase manufacturing in the US. Analysts predict higher costs for businesses and consumers, with potential price increases despite a current sales surge driven by tariff concerns. General Motors anticipates up to $5 billion in new costs due to the tariffs, and other companies have withdrawn financial guidance due to market uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that 58 percent of Japanese citizens believe social media platforms should be regulated by law to combat the spread of unverified information during elections. The survey highlights growing concerns over partisan online posts influencing election outcomes. Support for revising Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war, is divided. The survey also indicates that 71 percent support allowing married couples to keep separate surnames, and 64 percent favor recognizing same-sex marriage, issues that remain contentious in Japan.</p>

          <p>South Africa faces the dual challenges of rising sea levels and drought due to climate change. Research suggests that water loss from drought is causing parts of the country to lift out of the ocean by two millimeters annually. Coastal cities experience erosion and flooding, while drought impacts water resources. While land uplift may offer a buffer against rising seas, scientists caution against optimism, emphasizing the need for integrated climate and ocean policies.
