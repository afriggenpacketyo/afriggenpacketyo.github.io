          <p>Residents of Starbase, Texas, the town housing Elon Musk's SpaceX facilities, have been notified that they might "lose the right to continue using" their property as they currently do. This warning comes as Starbase considers implementing a new zoning ordinance and citywide map. The proposed "Mixed Use District" would permit residential, office, retail, and small-scale service uses. A public hearing regarding the new zoning and map is scheduled for June 23, raising concerns among residents about potential changes to their property rights and the overall development of the SpaceX-dominated town.</p>

          <p>Opinion columnist David Brooks expresses his anger towards elite snobbery, particularly statements from figures like Patrick Deneen and JD Vance, who suggest soldiers are not motivated by ideals but by loyalty to their unit or home. Brooks argues that these statements reflect the moral decay at the heart of Trumpism, which he sees as an attempt to reduce humanity to its most primitive instincts. He contends that Trumpism disgraces the country by amputating the highest aspirations of the human spirit, contrasting it with the values and sacrifices of historical figures who fought for moral purposes.</p>

The White House confirmed that Israel has approved the proposal, which was submitted by special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump. While Hamas is studying the proposal, a senior official stated that it doesn't meet their demands, particularly ending the war and famine, but they are considering it in light of the ongoing crisis. The U.S. is seeking guarantees that Israel will not attack Gaza during the ceasefire period, with a deal potentially close.</p>

          <p>Andrew and Tristan Tate will return to the UK to face 21 criminal charges, including sexual assault and human trafficking, once proceedings against them in Romania have concluded, according to their lawyers. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) authorized the charges in 2024, and an extradition warrant was issued to bring them back from Romania, where they are being investigated in a separate case. The CPS believes domestic criminal matters in Romania must be settled first, making their return to the UK unlikely in the near future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit card debt forgiveness, often synonymous with debt settlement, offers borrowers a potential reduction of 30% to 50% of their balance. To qualify, borrowers typically need a minimum debt balance between $5,000 and $10,000, be behind on payments, and demonstrate financial hardship. While credit card debt forgiveness can occur through negotiated debt settlement, bankruptcy, or debt management programs, having a debt settlement agreement in place is essential. Borrowers should research various debt relief companies to find the criteria easiest to qualify for and make informed decisions to regain financial freedom. (not investment advice)</p>

The ruling centered on Trump's invocation of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, with the Trump administration appealing the decision, but ultimately the impact on the market was muted due to the uncertainty.</p>
