          <p>King Charles is set to honor the service and sacrifice of those who fought in the Far East during World War II in a recorded message for the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan (VJ) Day. The message will vow that the estimated 71,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers who died will never be forgotten, echoing a broadcast made by his grandfather, King George VI, 80 years ago. The King, alongside the Queen and Prime Minister, will attend a national service of remembrance in Staffordshire, which includes a military flypast and a two-minute silence to mark the end of the war.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, has formed off the coast of Africa and is forecast to become the season's first hurricane by Friday. The storm is currently moving west with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph and is projected to strengthen as it approaches the Caribbean's northern Leeward Islands over the weekend. While it poses no immediate threat to the U.S., its longer-term path remains uncertain, and authorities have issued tropical storm watches throughout the islands. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in the Cabo Verde islands.</p>

          <p>New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs remains noncommittal about his availability for the team's season opener as he continues to recover from an ACL injury sustained last year. Despite being medically cleared and participating in limited practice, Diggs expressed uncertainty, stating he is taking his recovery day by day. After a promising six-year streak of over 1,000 receiving yards per season, his injury-shortened run with the Houston Texans preceded his new three-year deal with the Patriots. Coach Mike Vrabel has not provided a definitive timeline for the star player's return to the field.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake in the beleaguered health insurer UnitedHealth, acquiring over 5 million shares valued at approximately $1.6 billion. The investment comes as a surprise given UnitedHealth's recent troubles, including a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook, which caused its stock to fall significantly this year. Following the disclosure, UnitedHealth's shares surged in extended trading. The move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing, and other notable investors like Michael Burry have also recently bought into the company. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit, filed by the Chinese American Legal Defense Alliance on behalf of three Chinese nationals, argued the law is discriminatory and unconstitutional. However, the judge indicated the case would be dismissed on the grounds that the plaintiffs lack legal standing to sue.

          <p>Ahead of a significant summit in Alaska, President Donald Trump stated his belief that both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are willing to make peace. While observers are skeptical, viewing the meeting as a strategic win for Putin, Trump has managed expectations by suggesting a subsequent meeting involving both foreign leaders would be more critical. The summit is seen by many as a pivotal moment for Putin to influence the U.S. administration's approach to ending the war in Ukraine. Trump emphasized that if the leaders can find common ground, it would be a great outcome.</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has experienced a dramatic rise since its 2020 public debut, with its stock surging over 1,700% and its market valuation exceeding $430 billion. A significant driver of this growth has been government contracts, particularly with the U.S. Army, which accounted for 55% of its recent quarterly revenue. While U.S. commercial revenue is also growing, the company's valuation has reached a steep premium, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio far exceeding that of tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, indicating high investor expectations for its AI-powered software.

Experts say case numbers are severely undercounted due to stigma and limited diagnostic capacity, describing the situation as "walking blind."

The plan, which would temporarily set aside the map created by the state's independent commission, aims to create up to five more Democratic-leaning districts.

          <p>According to Norwegian press reports, President Donald Trump made an unsolicited call to Norway's finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, last month to ask about a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. The conversation reportedly also touched upon tariffs and economic cooperation. Stoltenberg confirmed the call took place but declined to elaborate on its content. Trump has frequently complained about not receiving the prestigious award, which was given to his four predecessors. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, appointed by the country's parliament, is responsible for selecting the laureates each year.</p>

          <p>A former Republican candidate for the New Mexico state legislature has been sentenced to 80 years in federal prison for orchestrating a series of drive-by shootings. The attacks targeted the homes of four Democratic officials in Albuquerque following his loss in the 2020 election. Prosecutors stated the man showed no remorse and had intended to incite political fear, believing the election was rigged against him. No one was injured in the shootings, but in one instance, bullets entered the bedroom of a state senator's 10-year-old daughter, highlighting a surge in threats against public officials.</p>

Intel is the only U.S. company capable of producing the most advanced chips on American soil. This move is part of a broader trend of the U.S. government taking direct financial positions in key industries to advance national security and economic priorities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>E.l.f. Cosmetics has issued a response to public criticism over its decision to feature comedian Matt Rife in a new ad campaign. The backlash stemmed from a joke Rife made about domestic violence in a 2023 comedy special, which many found offensive. In a social media post, the company acknowledged the negative feedback, stating, "we understand we missed the mark with people we care about." A company executive expressed surprise at the response, noting that Rife was cast due to his large, predominantly female social media following, but conceded the campaign failed to deliver the brand's intended positivity.</p>

          <p>China has made significant early purchases of soybeans from South America, particularly Brazil, for delivery in September and October, a period that is traditionally the peak export season for U.S. farmers. This strategic shift, securing roughly half of China's projected demand from South American sources, effectively sidelines U.S. exporters and underscores Beijing's increasing trade reliance on the region amid ongoing tensions with Washington. The move is expected to keep downward pressure on global soybean prices, which are already hovering near five-year lows due to reduced Chinese buying from the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

The policy change allows D.C. police to share information about individuals not in their custody and to transport federal agents and detainees. This represents a significant shift from the city's previous stance, which limited such cooperation, and comes shortly after the Trump administration placed the department under direct federal control. The city's sanctuary status, which prohibits sharing information about people in D.C. custody, remains a point of contention.</p>

He argues that the central bank should implement a half-percentage-point cut to stimulate the labor market and forestall a slowdown, asserting that current monetary policy is overly restrictive. Zervos, one of nearly a dozen names being considered to succeed Jerome Powell, believes his market-focused background would be a benefit to monetary policy decisions.

He declared the move would effectively "bury the idea of a Palestinian state" by physically dividing the West Bank from East Jerusalem. The project, long frozen due to international pressure, has been condemned by the U.S., U.K., and EU, who view it as a flagrant breach of international law and a major obstacle to a two-state solution.

The Fed's own policy meeting on September 17 will be the most critical event, as any decision to cut its benchmark rate could trigger another drop in mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>
