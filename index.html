          <p>Ahmed Ebid, a 42-year-old Egyptian fisherman based in the UK, has been sentenced to 25 years in jail for his involvement in smuggling nearly 3,800 people from North Africa to Italy between October 2022 and June 2023. The National Crime Agency (NCA) stated that Ebid was part of a Â£12 million illegal boat crossing operation, with some migrants eventually reaching Britain. Ebid, who arrived in the UK on a small boat in 2022 and applied for asylum, was found to have bribed officials and threatened violence against the migrants, ruthlessly exploiting their desperation for profit. The judge emphasized the horrifying treatment of the migrants and the considerable risk to their lives, highlighting that the boats used were fishing boats, not ferries.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push for a budget package containing his legislative priorities, facing resistance from dueling factions within the party. House Speaker Mike Johnson is navigating demands from conservatives seeking steeper spending cuts and moderates wary of Medicaid reductions. Conservatives are pushing for Medicaid work requirements and the elimination of clean energy subsidies, while moderates oppose significant cuts to Medicaid and seek changes to the state and local tax deduction (SALT). The bill's passage is further complicated by concerns over its potential $3.3 trillion addition to the deficit over the next decade, making it a challenging legislative hurdle for the Republican leadership.</p>

The article quotes Ukrainians expressing exhaustion but determination to carry on, with one pharmacist saying Ukrainians must find support from allies and do what they must for themselves. Lieutenant Pavlo Velychko notes that the situation in combat zones is worsening, suggesting Russia is using negotiations as cover for an offensive campaign. Oleksandr Palii, a veteran in Kyiv, expressed that officials in distant countries do not grasp the reality of the war, but Ukraine is far more capable of defending itself now.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent power outage in Spain and Portugal has sparked debate about the reliability of renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind power. The outage, caused by an abrupt loss of power at a substation in Granada and subsequent failures, occurred when renewables accounted for approximately 70% of Spain's electricity production. While some have blamed the country's reliance on renewables, experts suggest the incident highlights grid stability issues rather than inherent problems with renewable energy sources. The article explores potential solutions, such as virtual inertia, better battery storage, and increased grid flexibility, to improve grid stability and accommodate the growing share of renewable energy.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that a majority (54%) of US companies anticipate raising prices to offset the costs of President Trump's tariffs. The Allianz survey of 4,500 companies across nine countries also reveals a decline in exporter confidence, with 42% expecting turnover to decrease. Despite Trump's claims that tariffs will enrich America, businesses and consumers are preparing for higher prices. Walmart and Mattel have already announced plans to raise prices, while many companies initially tried to stockpile goods to avoid immediate price increases. The report suggests that companies will likely pass on most tariff increases to consumers by the summer if the trade war persists.</p>

          <p>According to a veteran Chinese diplomat, Donald Trumpâ€™s aggressive trade policies have fractured Western unity, potentially reshaping the global order as allies consider alternatives. Wu Hailong, president of the China Public Diplomacy Association, stated that Trumpâ€™s global tariff war has worsened US conflicts with its partners, shaking the foundation of transatlantic ties. Wu pointed to Trump's accusations of allies exploiting US advantages, his pledges to annex Canada and buy Greenland, and his sidelining of Europe in talks with Russia over the Ukraine war as contributing factors. These actions could lead US allies to weigh fresh options in international relations.</p>

          <p>A Harvard-trained pediatrician advocates for incorporating beans into children's diets, emphasizing their often-overlooked nutritional value. As a pediatrician, the author spends a lot of time engaging with families about nutrition. Their philosophy is simple: If you empower a child to embrace healthy eating habits early on, they are more likely to carry these positive behaviors into adulthood. They note that while many parents prioritize vegetables and limiting added sugar, beans are an underrated superfood that can significantly reduce the long-term risk of chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.</p>

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, saving money can be a challenge. Investing in a certificate of deposit (CD) can help, as today's leading accounts come with higher returns than the current inflation rate.
