          <p>An article from Vox discusses the debate among Democrats regarding how to respond to President Trump's policies of deporting undocumented immigrants, specifically focusing on the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Some Democrats, like Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, advocate for publicly defending the due process rights of immigrants, while others fear that focusing on immigration issues will boost Trump's political standing by reinforcing the narrative that Democrats prioritize foreigners over American citizens. The article argues that vigorous advocacy for due process is not necessarily politically harmful and could deter abuses against detainees, emphasizing the importance of strategic messaging on economic issues. Optimism score must be between 0 and 100 and based on a general scale of stability versus panic. Be proportional with the scores. </p>

Experts in the genetics community have questioned the validity of the claim, suggesting that the animals produced are merely gray wolves with minor genetic alterations. The company's publicity campaign and website presenting the dire wolf project as the achieved resurrection of a long-extinct species could not help but shoulder any nuanced assessment of its science off the front page of some publications.</p>
