        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has confirmed that President Trump would not recommend appointing a special prosecutor to investigate the case of Jeffrey Epstein. This statement comes amid calls from some of the president's own allies for such an appointment to ensure transparency. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's comments follow Trump's recent dismissal of the controversy as a "hoax" perpetrated by political opponents. The administration's handling of the Epstein files has created friction within the Republican party, with some demanding the full release of all related government records.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old man has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of residential burglary for the shooting deaths of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca. The suspect, Raymond Boodarian, was arrested after investigators used security footage and facial recognition to identify him. Police allege he entered the couple's Encino home through an unlocked door, leading to a fatal confrontation when they returned. Boodarian's arraignment has been postponed, and he remains jailed without bail as prosecutors decide whether to seek the death penalty.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has threatened to redraw his state's congressional maps in a bid to gain Democratic seats, framing it as a direct response to a Republican plan to do the same in Texas. This controversial proposal faces significant legal hurdles, as California law gives redistricting power to an independent commission, a model established by voters to prevent partisan gerrymandering. While some Democrats support the aggressive tactic, watchdog groups and other officials have condemned the idea, arguing that fighting attacks on democracy with similar measures undermines the rule of law.</p>

Critics, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, point to the enormous logistical costs that led to the prison's closure in 1963 and argue the funds would be better spent elsewhere.

          <p>This article reflects on the history of air travel, tracing its journey from a source of wonder and awe in the early 20th century to the often frustrating experience it is today. While a "golden age" of glamorous flying is often imagined, the reality was that mid-century air travel was more expensive, dangerous, and less comfortable than modern flights. The author argues that deregulation, cost-cutting measures, and increased security have contributed to its decline in quality. Ultimately, the piece suggests that flying's transformation into a mundane, everyday technology is a natural cycle for any major innovation.</p>

          <p>Uber has announced a major partnership with electric vehicle maker Lucid and autonomous driving startup Nuro to deploy over 20,000 robotaxis in the next six years. As part of the deal, Uber will invest $300 million in Lucid, which will supply the electric vehicles for the program. Nuro will provide its Level 4 self-driving technology, which allows for operation without a human driver under normal conditions. The companies plan to launch the driverless ride-hailing service in a major U.S. city next year, signaling a significant move into the autonomous vehicle market.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has recommended a one-day prison sentence for Brett Hankison, the former Kentucky police officer convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that led to her death. Hankison was found guilty of using excessive force by firing recklessly into her apartment, though none of his shots struck Taylor. Attorneys for the Taylor family have called the recommendation an "insult," arguing it sends a message that officers can violate the rights of Black Americans with impunity. A judge will make the final sentencing decision next week.</p>

          <p>A California State University professor, John Caravello, is receiving support from colleagues after being arrested and charged with assaulting a federal officer during an ICE raid on a cannabis farm. Caravello, a math and philosophy professor who volunteers as an immigrant advocate, was among hundreds arrested during the chaotic operation, which resulted in a worker's death. Witnesses claim Caravello was peacefully protesting and assisting another demonstrator when he was arrested, contradicting the official account that he threw a teargas canister at law enforcement. His case has drawn scrutiny to the tactics used during the large-scale raid.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced its intention to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 for all U.K. elections, a key promise from the Labour Party's recent campaign. The move, part of a broader package of democratic reforms, would enfranchise approximately 1.6 million teenagers. Proponents argue that 16-year-olds who can work, pay taxes, and join the army should have a say in government. While the change is likely to pass in Parliament, it remains a divisive issue, with critics questioning the maturity of younger voters and the potential political impact.</p>

          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, a major producer of high fructose corn syrup, experienced a decline after President Trump announced that Coca-Cola had agreed to use real cane sugar in its U.S. products. While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, stating it would share details on new innovations soon, the news impacted the market. The Corn Refiners Association warned the switch could cost American jobs and increase foreign sugar imports. This development is part of a broader push by the administration to influence food product ingredients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg and other top Meta executives have agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders who sought $8 billion in damages over the company's handling of user privacy violations. The lawsuit, filed in 2018 after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, alleged that executives' actions led to massive fines and legal costs for the company. The settlement amount was not disclosed, but the agreement was reached just as the trial was beginning in a Delaware court. This resolution allows the defendants, including Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg, to avoid testifying under oath.</p>

          <p>Louisiana has officially canceled a $3 billion coastal restoration project that was to be funded by settlement money from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion was designed to rebuild miles of wetlands by diverting sediment from the Mississippi River to combat land loss. However, the project faced strong opposition from Governor Jeff Landry and local fishing communities, who feared the influx of freshwater would destroy shrimp and oyster fisheries. Conservation groups lamented the decision, stating that the urgent need for action against coastal erosion remains unchanged.</p>
