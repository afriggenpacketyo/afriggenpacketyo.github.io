            <p>A 5.2-magnitude earthquake struck near San Diego, California, with its epicenter in Julian, prompting emergency alerts and shaking felt as far as Los Angeles. While there were no immediate reports of major damage or injuries, the earthquake rattled residents, some of whom described it as the worst they've ever felt. The National Weather Service confirmed that a tsunami was not expected, and authorities are assessing the situation for any potential damage and coordinating with local authorities for any emergency response that is needed. The USGS reported smaller aftershocks in the region following the quake.</p>

            <p>Free family planning clinics across the U.S. are facing potential financial collapse after the Trump administration froze approximately $66 million in federal funds earmarked for Title X programs. These programs provide essential services such as contraception, STI tests, and cancer screenings to millions of low-income individuals. The funding freeze has led to concerns about clinic closures, staff layoffs, and reduced services, disproportionately affecting women of color.</p>
