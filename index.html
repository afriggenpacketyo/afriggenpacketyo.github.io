          <p>Travis Decker, accused of murdering his three daughters, struggled with PTSD and lacked mental health resources, according to his ex-wife's attorney, Arianna Cozart. Cozart emphasized that the system failed Decker, suggesting the tragedy could have been avoided if he had received adequate help. Despite mental health issues, there were no apparent red flags before the girls' disappearance, and Decker was described as an active and loving father. Cozart and Whitney Decker are now advocating for improved mental health resources for veterans and reforms to the Amber Alert system. </p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed an amended complaint against the Trump administration's ban on foreign students with F and J visas, arguing it is unconstitutional. The university claims the ban, affecting over 7,000 students, is a "government vendetta" due to Harvard's refusal to comply with demands for ideological screening and government oversight. The lawsuit alleges the administration froze $2.2 billion in research funding after Harvard refused to meet its demands. The Department of Homeland Security maintains the administration is committed to restoring common sense to the student visa system. </p>

The appeal trial centered on whether the management's decisions on tsunami countermeasures were appropriate after a TEPCO unit estimated a potential 15.7-meter tsunami in 2008.

          <p>Victims of the Los Angeles County fires have filed lawsuits against AAA and USAA, alleging that the insurers systematically underestimated the replacement cost of their homes, resulting in inadequate coverage. The lawsuits claim fraud, negligence, and breach of contract, seeking damages and reform of the insurers' practices. The plaintiffs assert that the insurers' cost estimator software and other shortcomings led to underinsurance, leaving them unable to rebuild their homes. This legal action adds to the ongoing litigation stemming from the devastating fires. </p>

          <p>China has tested core components of quantum-based network in space to build a secure communication system. A laser module and a phase encoding device were tested on a rocket flight, to assess the components against environmental stresses. This is a step to build space-air-ground quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. QSDC sends the actual message directly through a quantum channel making the system efficient and secure. </p>

          <h2>Young Offenders Often Denied Credit for 'Dead Time' Behind Bars</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 20:54:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in detention, unlike adults in the criminal justice system. In many states, time spent in detention awaiting trial or placement in a facility does not count toward their ultimate sentence. This practice can extend their confinement, negatively impacting their rehabilitation and straining resources. Experts argue that the juvenile justice system's focus on rehabilitation has ironically led to fewer constitutional protections for young people. </p>
