          <p>In a historic, all-female boxing event at Madison Square Garden, Ireland's Katie Taylor defeated Puerto Rico's Amanda Serrano by a majority decision, concluding their celebrated trilogy. The bout was a tactical "chess match," differing from their previous encounters, with Taylor's economical and smart boxing earning her the win on two of the three judges' scorecards. Following the fight, both athletes expressed immense mutual respect, acknowledging their roles in making boxing history. Taylor's victory solidifies her legacy in what some speculate might be her final match, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship in a gripping contest.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered an eight-year legal battle between the owner of a luxury penthouse on London's Park Lane and companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed's family. The dispute, which began over a lift installation, has escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs, botched renovations, and the malicious use of a noisy lift. This conflict sheds light on the combative business practices associated with the Al Fayed empire, which appear to persist after his death. The article also notes that the BBC previously reported on allegations of sexual assault against Fayed at a neighboring property he owned.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants despite a late-game offensive surge. Pitcher Dustin May struggled, allowing seven runs and putting the Dodgers in a deep deficit that their powerful offense could not overcome. Shohei Ohtani hit his 32nd home run of the season into McCovey's Cove, a rare feat for a Dodgers player, but it wasn't enough to turn the tide. The loss marks the team's longest losing streak since 2017 and narrows their division lead, highlighting recent struggles despite possessing one of baseball's highest-scoring lineups.</p>

          <p>A fugitive named Sedrick T. Stevenson, who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May, has been recaptured and extradited back to Kentucky. Photos released by the Warren County Sheriff's Office show a smiling Stevenson on the plane, escorted by multiple officers under high-security measures to prevent another escape. Stevenson, who was originally wanted on firearm and drug charges, had been on the run for over a month before U.S. Marshals apprehended him in Seattle. Authorities coordinated with multiple agencies to ensure his secure return, with officials humorously noting he received "VIP service."</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a camp in Rafah may constitute a crime against humanity, it reflects a broader, historical failure of international law to protect Palestinians. The author, Raja Shehadeh, contends that since the 1948 Nakba, legal and institutional frameworks have been ineffective, due to a lack of enforcement and the interests of powerful nations. Hope, the author suggests, lies not in international law but in Palestinian resilience and the concept of "sumoud," or steadfastness. The piece calls for global accountability and aid to ensure Gaza can be rebuilt and remain habitable.</p>

          <p>According to Palestinian officials, ceasefire and hostage-release negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated in Doha, are nearing collapse. The talks have stalled over critical disagreements, including the mechanisms for humanitarian aid distribution and the extent of the Israeli military's withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas officials reportedly view a recent Israeli map of proposed buffer zones as a bad-faith maneuver that contradicts earlier messages. Palestinian negotiators accuse Israel of using the talks to buy time during Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit to Washington, warning that without significant U.S. intervention, the diplomatic process could fail entirely.</p>

This trend could transform some tech leaders into aggressive "tech hawks," pushing for more interventionist foreign policies.

The song, which was the final track on the band's 2015 album, gained initial traction after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017. Its popularity has since snowballed on platforms like TikTok and Spotify, where it has amassed over three billion plays. The band's frontman, Ben Schneider, reflects on the song's unexpected and enduring success, which he attributes to its universally relatable theme of wistful reflection on a past relationship.</p>

          <p>Numerous independent gift and toy shops across the UK have been left confused and financially hurt after the popular British soft toy brand Jellycat suddenly ceased supplying them. Retailers, some of whom have stocked the brand for over two decades, received a form email stating the decision was final and part of a "brand elevation strategy." The move comes after Jellycat's popularity surged on TikTok, leading to stock shortages for small stores while the brand focused on large, theatrical displays in major department stores. The affected shop owners feel abandoned by a brand they helped build, leaving a sour taste for both retailers and loyal customers.</p>

          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle a historic 123-year-old railway bridge in Prague and replace it with a new, three-track structure has ignited a fierce debate. Proponents argue the new bridge is essential to handle projected growth in rail traffic, as the current corroded structure is operating at reduced capacity. However, a coalition of architects, preservationists, and residents, backed by UNESCO, insists the iconic Vysehrad bridge can and should be repaired in place. They argue that demolishing the landmark is unnecessary and that a second, slender bridge could be built alongside it, preserving a crucial part of Prague's skyline.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off more than 1,300 civil and foreign service employees as part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration. The cuts are part of an effort to reduce the department's U.S. workforce by about 15% and eliminate what the administration calls redundant offices. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the indiscriminate cuts will undermine U.S. national security and diplomatic strength. The layoffs have disproportionately affected bureaus focused on refugees, human rights, and foreign assistance, with entire offices being eliminated, raising concerns about the future of their congressionally mandated programs.</p>

Sea surface temperatures surpassed 30°C in some areas in late June, several degrees above normal for the time of year, creating conditions that threaten species like vital seaweeds and seagrasses. Scientists warn that such prolonged, extreme heat can lead to mass mortality events, disrupt reproduction, and have knock-on effects on fish stocks. This event highlights the Mediterranean's vulnerability as a climate change hotspot, where ocean heatwaves are becoming more frequent and severe.</p>

This accusation comes amid President Trump's ongoing public pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates, a move the central bank has resisted to prevent inflation. The letter from the OMB questions the project's costs and changes, which Powell has previously defended as necessary and not extravagant. This conflict highlights the significant tension between the administration's economic demands and the Federal Reserve's traditional independence. (not investment advice)</p>
