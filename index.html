He emphasized his enjoyment in remaining involved with the sport through advisory roles, working to preserve its integrity amid the changing landscape of college athletics.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life in prison in Idaho for the murders of her two children, has been sentenced to two more life terms in Arizona for conspiring to murder her former husband and her niece's ex-husband. During the sentencing, family members delivered emotional impact statements, labeling her a "monster" and a "coward" for her actions, which prosecutors argued were motivated by extremist doomsday beliefs and financial gain. Vallow Daybell, who represented herself, claimed the cases were family tragedies, but her surviving son stated that she herself was the tragedy, concluding her extensive legal saga.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 16:49:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from The Atlantic explores the idea of intentionally creating small, joyful moments to improve daily life, moving beyond the fleeting happiness of vacations. The author shares their personal quest to "romanticize" life through simple acts like reading physical books, savoring a mocktail, and making small, pleasing purchases. The piece also includes anecdotes from colleagues who find delight in various routines, from tending to houseplants and journaling about gratitude to starting the day with group chats or listening to curated music playlists. The central theme suggests that actively seeking daily joy is a more fulfilling pursuit than simply enduring life's challenges.</p>

          <p>As President Trump visits Scotland to open a new golf course, local sentiment remains deeply divided, with many residents struggling to separate his business ventures from his politics. Some neighbors express discontent over the development transforming a natural landscape and resent Trump's past dismissive comments about their properties. Activists are planning protests, citing a clash between his policies and Scottish values, and a recent poll shows a high disapproval rating for the president among Scots. However, the golf course does provide local employment, and some, particularly within the golfing community, view his business contributions to the area positively.</p>

          <p>An Arizona woman, Christina Chapman, has been sentenced to over eight years in prison for her part in a major identity theft scheme that helped North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at hundreds of U.S. companies. The operation generated millions of dollars for North Korea's sanctioned weapons programs by using stolen American identities. Chapman operated a "laptop farm" from her home, making it appear the workers were based in the U.S., and even attempted to place them in federal agencies. While her defense claimed she was initially unaware of the illegality, she continued the scheme to pay for her mother's medical care.</p>

          <p>In a satirical column for The Atlantic, the author humorously imagines Donald Trump's perspective on his association with Jeffrey Epstein, portraying him as an oblivious figure more concerned with tariffs than his surroundings. The fictionalized narrative depicts Trump being reluctantly dragged to parties and on flights by Epstein, all while being preoccupied with reading a biography of President William McKinley to understand trade policy. The piece uses absurdity to comment on the ongoing controversy, framing Trump's presence in incriminating photos and documents as part of a convoluted conspiracy he never quite understood. This article presents a unique, non-factual take on the political scandal.</p>

The remarks increase tensions between the two closely linked economies, as Canada is among several nations facing Trump's global tariff strategy, which includes a potential 35% tax on Canadian goods if no agreement is reached.</p>

          <p>The Metro D (Purple) Line in Los Angeles is set to reopen after a 70-day closure required for a major expansion project beneath Wilshire Boulevard. During the shutdown, crews worked to connect the existing subway with the first phase of the new extension, which will add three new stations and is now 98% complete. This phase, connecting downtown to the Westside, is expected to open in 2025. The overall project aims to add seven new stations, with the full line scheduled for completion by the 2028 Summer Olympics, significantly expanding transit options for one of Metro's most heavily used routes.</p>

          <p>Tesla is reportedly planning to launch an invite-only robotaxi service in the Bay Area, a move that would place it in direct competition with established players like Waymo. According to an internal memo, the testing could begin as soon as this weekend, following a similar launch in Austin, Texas. The expansion comes as CEO Elon Musk increasingly focuses on autonomous technology to drive the company's future amid declining electric vehicle sales. The vehicles will still use human co-pilots for monitoring, as Tesla faces regulatory scrutiny and a DMV lawsuit over its self-driving claims.</p>

          <p>George Santos, the expelled former Republican congressman from New York, has reported to a federal prison in New Jersey to begin serving his 87-month sentence for fraud and identity theft. Santos pleaded guilty to a range of offenses, including faking his biography to defraud donors, stealing from campaign funds for personal luxury expenses, and running a credit card scheme. Federal prosecutors stated that he "made a mockery of our election system" to enrich himself. After his sentencing, Santos publicly appealed to President Trump for a chance to prove he is more than his mistakes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed the U.S. Education Department to release more than $5 billion in federal grant funding that had been withheld from states. The funds, which support a wide range of programs including teacher training, English language instruction, and adult education, were frozen in late June for a review of their alignment with White House priorities. The decision to withhold the money, which had already been appropriated by Congress, caused significant financial strain for school districts and drew bipartisan criticism, prompting lawmakers and states to lobby for its release ahead of the new school year.</p>

The official list of "extremist materials" is extensive and includes not only fascist literature but also works critical of the government and materials from organizations like Meta.

          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times argues that the public ridicule of the executive and HR head caught on a kiss-cam at a Coldplay concert is a healthy societal response. The author contends that the widespread humor does not stem from moral superiority but from a recognition of shared human fallibility and a societal respect for the institution of marriage. Countering arguments that the public shaming was disproportionate, the writer suggests it reflects a culture that still takes marital vows seriously. The column concludes that such jokes are a harmless reflection of these underlying values.</p>

          <p>A coroner has ruled that there were failings in the mental health care provided to former England cricketer Graham Thorpe in the months before his death by suicide in August 2024. The inquest heard that healthcare professionals did not perceive Thorpe to be in a crisis situation, even after his wife reported that he had asked for help to end his life. The 55-year-old, who had been struggling with depression after losing his coaching job, was last seen in person by mental health professionals four months before his death.
