          <p>JPMorgan Chase is introducing a new wealth management tier, J.P. Morgan Private Client, aimed at affluent Americans with at least $750,000 in deposits and investments, with a focus on those having $2 to $3 million in balances. This initiative includes refurbished brick-and-mortar bank branches in upscale locations across New York, California, Florida, and Massachusetts, acquired from First Republic. The goal is to capture a larger share of affluent households' investment dollars, currently only at 10%, despite banking relationships with half of the 19 million affluent households in the U.S. The service emphasizes personalized, concierge-level service with dedicated bankers, similar to the approach that made First Republic successful.</p>

          <p>Ambience Healthcare, an AI startup, has announced a new medical coding model powered by OpenAI that surpasses physician benchmarks by 27%. The model identifies ICD-10 codes by listening to patient encounters, reducing billing errors and improving clinician efficiency. With approximately 70,000 ICD-10 codes, the model aims to streamline administrative tasks and make healthcare safer and more cost-effective. According to Ambience's head of engineering, the model is intended to liberate doctors and coders from administrative burdens rather than replace them.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at Lemon Hill in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park resulted in the deaths of a 23-year-old woman and a 21-year-old man, with nine others, including three teenagers, injured. The incident occurred late Monday night as groups gathered in the park, with police investigating the possibility of a gun modification device, a "switch," being used to enable rapid firing. No weapons have been recovered, and no arrests have been made, as authorities continue to dissect social media posts and examine shell casings to determine the number of shooters involved. One additional person was hospitalized after being hit by a car during the ensuing chaos.</p>

Acting on a tip from Thai authorities, the National Narcotics Agency intercepted the vessel off the Riau islands, discovering 2,000 packages of crystal meth hidden in cardboard boxes. The drugs, estimated to be worth over $4 million, originated from the "Golden Triangle" region and were smuggled by an organized crime group working with Indonesian traffickers, with authorities issuing a red notice for a fugitive from Thailand believed to be behind the operation.</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates are currently offering higher returns than the inflation rate, making them an attractive savings option. The national average CD yields as of May 27, 2025, are 1.99% APY for a 1-year CD, 1.69% APY for a 3-year CD, and 1.70% APY for a 5-year CD, but top CDs offer significantly higher rates. To secure a good CD rate, consider online banks, which typically offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and explore short-term CDs, as the inverted yield curve means short-term CDs currently have higher interest rates than longer-term options.

Video footage of the event circulated online, prompting Macron's office to initially deny its authenticity before confirming it as genuine, with Macron later stating that he and his wife were joking around. Sources close to the president described the incident as a harmless "squabble" and blamed pro-Russian accounts for the negative commentary surrounding the event.

          <p>Tesla's sales in Europe experienced a significant drop of nearly 50% in April, contrasting with the overall growth in the European electric car market. The decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political views, an aging model lineup, and increasing competition from rival EV brands, particularly from China. Trump's trade war has also impacted European consumers' willingness to purchase American brands, and Tesla faced factory shutdowns for Model Y upgrades, further affecting supply. Analyst Dan Ives notes that 2025 has been a dark chapter for Musk and Tesla due to the brand damage created by Elon's role in the Trump Administration.</p>

Putin remains committed to his goals of conquering Ukrainian provinces, disregarding Trump's flattery and bullying tactics, and rebuffing Trump's proposals for ceasefires and threats of sanctions. Russia's continued attacks on Ukraine, including Kyiv, demonstrate Putin's commitment to achieving his objectives, even in the face of significant costs and casualties, leading to the conclusion that the war is likely to continue with no end in sight.</p>

          <p>NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations have filed a lawsuit against President Trump and administration officials, challenging an executive order that seeks to cut federal funding to the news organization and PBS.

The plaintiffs claim the order is "textbook retaliation" and discriminates based on viewpoint, thereby infringing on First Amendment rights.

          <p>New research based on NASA satellite data reveals that groundwater in the Colorado River Basin is declining rapidly, with the amount depleted since 2003 comparable to the total capacity of Lake Mead. Heavy pumping for agriculture, prolonged drought, and rising temperatures are driving these losses, primarily in Arizona, where groundwater is used to irrigate farms. Annual groundwater losses average more than 1.2 million acre-feet, potentially leading to severe water shortages that impact farmers, residents, and agricultural markets throughout the southwestern U.S. Climate change is exacerbating the stress on groundwater, emphasizing the need for urgent dialogue about extending groundwater management across the entire state.</p>

          <p>Yessica Rojas, a Venezuelan mother, left Missouri with her two children after hearing stories of Venezuelan mothers being deported while their children remained in the U.S. foster care system. Fearful of losing her children under President Trump's new immigration policies, she sold her belongings and traveled back to South America, joining other single mothers with similar fears. She expressed gratitude for making it safely back to Venezuela, despite the journey costing her all her savings and the uncertainty of the situation in her home country. The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to restrict benefits for immigrant families, leading to increased anxiety and self-deportation among some immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Businesses are using the "first sale rule," a decades-old piece of legislation, to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions, potentially reducing the duty price by stripping out the cost associated with the middleman's profit. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving an overseas producer and an intermediary, the sales must be carried out at arm's length, and there must be proof that the item was destined for the U.S.</p>

As well as playing a key role in England's Euro 2022 victory, she was vice-captain as they reached the 2023 World Cup final, saving a penalty in their defeat by Spain. She used her platform to speak out, discussing her personal mental health struggles while collecting her award at the Fifa Best event in 2023. Her most notable intervention came when she called out Nike for failing to sell England women's goalkeeper shirts before the World Cup, which led to a petition gathering more than 150,000 signatures and the sportswear giant making a U-turn.</p>
