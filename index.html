          <p>South Korea has halted its propaganda broadcasts along the border with North Korea, fulfilling a campaign promise by President Lee Jae-myung to reduce cross-border tensions. In response, North Korea appears to have ceased its own loudspeaker broadcasts targeting the South. The broadcasts, which included propaganda messages and K-pop music, had resumed after North Korea sent trash-filled balloons into South Korea, leading to retaliatory broadcasts from Pyongyang featuring irritating sounds. President Lee aims to reopen communication channels with North Korea, though Pyongyang has been rejecting diplomatic overtures amid closer ties with Russia. The discontinuation of the broadcasts is viewed as a proactive step toward de-escalation. </p>

          <p>U.S. officials have been informed that Israel is prepared to initiate an operation in Iran, raising concerns about potential Iranian retaliation against American sites in neighboring Iraq. The U.S. State Department has already advised non-emergency government personnel to leave Iraq due to these heightened regional tensions. Despite the looming threat, U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff plans to proceed with a sixth round of nuclear program talks with Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long been skeptical of any deals with Iran, while President Trump has urged Netanyahu against striking Iran during ongoing negotiations. </p>

Wilson was born and raised in California, and brought surf-rock to the world with songs like I Get Around, Surfin' USA and Good Vibrations. The Beach Boys were one of America's biggest bands, whose success rivalled the Beatles in the 1960s. </p>

          <p>Tensions are escalating between President Trump and California Governor Newsom as protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement continue to grip Los Angeles and spread to other cities. Mayor Karen Bass issued an overnight curfew for about one square mile in downtown LA, the site of clashes between police and protesters. Trump deployed 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines to LA against the wishes of Newsom and Bass, leading to a lawsuit from Newsom, who claims the federal government unlawfully "trampled over" California's sovereignty. The protests are a response to increased immigration enforcement actions. </p>

          <p>An immigration raid at a Los Angeles car wash illustrates a significant escalation in the White House's strategy to round up and deport undocumented migrants. The raid, which resulted in the arrest of several workers, is part of a broader effort to increase daily arrests from approximately 660 to 3,000. These actions have sparked protests across the country, with many criticizing the targeting of workplaces where undocumented workers contribute to the economy. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to inquiries about the legal status of those arrested. </p>
