          <p>Late-night television icon David Letterman has strongly criticized ABC's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show, calling the move "ridiculous" and a form of "managed media." Speaking at The Atlantic Festival, Letterman argued that media corporations should not capitulate to pressure from what he termed an "authoritarian criminal administration." He compared the situation to CBS's recent cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show, suggesting a pattern of silencing administration critics and an inexcusable manipulation of media franchises for political reasons.</p>

          <p>A significant earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck off the eastern coast of Russia's remote Kamchatka region, as reported by the U.S. Geological Survey. The powerful tremor prompted a brief tsunami threat for the area, which was later lifted by the Pacific Tsunami Warning System. Fortunately, there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties following the quake and its subsequent aftershocks, which is notable given the region's history of powerful seismic activity.</p>

          <p>The House Foreign Affairs Committee has unanimously passed a bipartisan amendment to increase congressional oversight of the Trump administration's efforts to combat human trafficking. This action follows a report revealing a more than 70% staff reduction in the State Department's key anti-trafficking office and a failure to publish a legally mandated annual report on the issue. The amendment requires the State Department to detail the impact of these changes, reflecting a rare bipartisan move to hold the administration accountable on this critical human rights issue.</p>

          <p>During a state visit to the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump advised Prime Minister Keir Starmer to "call out the military" to control the country's borders and stop illegal migration. At a joint press conference, Trump drew parallels between the UK's situation with Channel crossings and the US southern border, stating that such measures are necessary because illegal immigration "destroys countries from within." The two leaders also discussed other topics, including a disagreement over the UK's plan to recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>First Amendment experts are expressing alarm over the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!", suggesting it may be a case of illegal government pressure known as "jawboning." The concerns stem from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's public call for ABC to "take action" against Kimmel, which was followed hours later by the show's removal. Legal scholars argue this creates a direct link between a government threat and the suppression of speech, potentially setting a dangerous precedent and creating a chilling effect on political commentary in broadcast media.</p>

          <p>A key advisory committee for the CDC has voted to change U.S. vaccine policy, recommending that children receive separate vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and for chickenpox (varicella). This guidance moves away from the combined four-in-one MMRV vaccine, which the panel noted carries a slightly higher risk of causing febrile seizures, though these are typically harmless. The decision has sparked debate among some health experts who worry that requiring more individual shots could lead to lower overall vaccination compliance among children.</p>

          <p>California State Parks has announced the reopening of the beloved Pfeiffer Falls Trail in Big Sur, a popular hike that has been closed for over a year. The trail's signature pedestrian bridge was destroyed in a 2023 storm when a massive redwood tree collapsed on it. This latest repair marks another chapter in the trail's challenging history, which includes a nearly 13-year closure following a devastating 2008 wildfire, highlighting the ongoing struggle to maintain access in the region's fragile and beautiful landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers from the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus has warned that President Trump's tariffs are severely harming businesses owned by Asian-Americans. They stated that small "mom and pop stores" are facing skyrocketing import costs, forcing them into an impossible choice between raising prices for their customers or closing their businesses permanently. The lawmakers shared constituent stories, such as a medicinal oil importer whose shipping costs increased from $500 to $13,000 overnight, and urged the administration to reverse the duties.</p>
