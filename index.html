          <p>A large wildfire near Athens, Greece, has resulted in at least one fatality and the destruction of several homes and farmlands. Over 260 firefighters have been battling the blaze, which was intensified by strong winds that also caused the deaths of two tourists in a separate incident on the island of Milos. While the main fire has weakened, authorities remain on high alert due to forecasted high winds, with similar fires reported in other parts of Greece and neighboring Turkey. The events highlight the increasing risk of destructive wildfires in the Mediterranean, attributed by scientists to climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid catastrophic hunger in conflict zones like Gaza and Sudan, health experts are highlighting the dangers of "refeeding syndrome." This potentially fatal condition can occur when severely malnourished individuals resume normal eating too quickly, causing a rapid electrolyte shift that can lead to organ failure. Aid organizations use specially formulated, low-nutrient therapeutic foods like Plumpy'Nut to slowly stabilize patients and prevent this outcome. Experts stress that safe access for aid agencies is crucial to properly manage re-nutrition and avert a wider humanitarian crisis in these regions.</p>

          <p>A Kenyan immigrant and father of three in Michigan, Samuel Kangethe, has decided to self-deport after 16 years in the U.S. due to his precarious immigration status. Despite having a master's degree and a stable job, an old, unresolved immigration case makes him deportable under the current administration's policies. Fearing detention and forced removal, Kangethe is choosing to leave on his own terms, a decision that is devastating his American wife, children, and community. His story reflects a broader trend of immigrants opting for voluntary departure amid heightened enforcement.</p>

          <p>This opinion article analyzes recent statements by Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has begun publicly criticizing her own party's leadership and media allies like Fox News. The author notes Greene's unusual alignment with some progressive talking points, such as acknowledging a genocide in Gaza and denouncing U.S. foreign wars, though attributes these shifts to internal party discord rather than a change in ideology. The piece suggests that this infighting, rather than Democratic opposition, could ultimately lead to the fracturing of the MAGA movement within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reportedly informed Pfizer that it may not renew the emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine for children under five. This potential move could leave a significant gap, as it is the only vaccine available for all children in this age group. While Moderna's pediatric vaccine is approved, it is currently restricted to children with underlying health conditions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is now in discussions with Moderna to potentially increase its supply to cover any shortfalls, addressing concerns about vaccine access for the youngest demographic.</p>

          <p>With the implementation of new tariffs, the U.S. now faces its highest average tariff rate since 1933, raising questions about the economic impact. Economists anticipate that the costs will be shared among foreign exporters, U.S. companies, and consumers, likely leading to higher prices for goods like clothing and shoes. While overall inflation is expected to rise, it may not reach the severe levels seen in 2022. However, the tariffs could also lead to slower hiring, a weaker job market, and reduced economic growth, though most forecasters do not currently predict a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article offers etiquette advice for being a considerate houseguest to ensure a pleasant visit for both guest and host. Expert Elaine Swann suggests that visits should ideally be kept to about four days and that guests should communicate their plans clearly in advance. Key recommendations include being self-sufficient, respecting the host's space and schedule, and not overpacking. Rather than interpreting "make yourself at home" as a license for total freedom, guests should be mindful, offer to help with chores, and present a thoughtful gift by the end of their stay.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved the revival of a long-stalled project to construct the Strait of Messina Bridge, which would connect Sicily to the mainland. With a projected cost of €13.5 billion, it is designed to be the world's longest single-span suspension bridge. Despite decades of cancellations due to financial and practical concerns, construction is now slated to begin in 2026. Proponents believe the project will boost the economy of southern Italy, while critics and local opponents raise concerns about seismic risks, environmental impact, and the misallocation of public funds.</p>

          <p>The term "grifter" has become a prevalent insult in modern political discourse, used to accuse opponents of making money through dishonest or shady means. This opinion piece explores why the label, which suggests someone is a con artist profiting from their beliefs, has gained such traction. The author connects its rise to the influence of online personalities, high-profile scam stories, and a general decline in public trust in politicians. In an atmosphere of widespread suspicion, accusing someone of "grift" has become a shorthand way to question their motivations and integrity.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Mayor Shiro Suzuki delivered a peace declaration urging an end to global conflicts. He warned that the world is on a dangerous trajectory that could lead to another nuclear war. The solemn ceremony included a moment of silence and the ringing of cathedral bells to commemorate the estimated 74,000 people killed in the 1945 attack. A 93-year-old survivor also spoke, recounting the horror of the bombing and its aftermath, reinforcing the city's appeal for a world free of nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Southern California, named the Canyon Fire, has spread rapidly, prompting evacuation orders for thousands of residents near the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Igniting on Thursday, the blaze grew from 30 acres to nearly 5,400 acres in just over a day, fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions. A firefighter sustained major injuries when their truck overturned. While favorable weather has since allowed firefighters to achieve 28% containment and reduce evacuation orders to warnings, the fire remains active with high temperatures forecasted for the coming days.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated matchup between two future Hall of Fame pitchers, Clayton Kershaw led the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over Max Scherzer and the Toronto Blue Jays. Both veteran aces delivered strong six-inning performances, but Kershaw was slightly better, allowing only one run. The key moment came when Mookie Betts hit a go-ahead two-run homer off Scherzer in the fifth inning. The game celebrated the enduring excellence of two of the sport's most decorated pitchers, who first competed against each other on the same field nearly two decades ago.</p>

          <p>One year after a deadly garbage landslide at the Kiteezi landfill near Kampala, Uganda, victims are still awaiting compensation and the country is struggling with a broader waste crisis. The 2024 disaster, which killed 34 people and left over 200 homeless, highlighted the dangers of the overflowing dump. Although the Kiteezi site is now officially closed, the city's new disposal site in a forest reserve is embroiled in legal controversy. Authorities have plans for modern recycling and composting facilities, but a lack of funding and investment has stalled progress.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the complex trade dynamics between the EU, India, and the U.S. following recent sanctions. While the EU's recent sanctions targeting an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude are seen as largely symbolic, the greater threat of high U.S. tariffs on Indian goods could inadvertently benefit the EU. Experts suggest that pressure from Washington may increase India's motivation to finalize a long-delayed free trade agreement with the European Union as a way to diversify its economic partnerships. This shift could provide India with a more predictable and stable trade relationship amid global volatility.</p>

          <p>Reforms to a major UK civil service summer internship program, which now restrict applications to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds, have sparked debate. The government aims to make the civil service more representative, a move praised by some students who now feel they have a fairer chance. However, other students from state schools with parents in professions like nursing feel unfairly excluded by the specific criteria, arguing it creates a new barrier for those who are not wealthy but do not fit the narrow definition of "working class."</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created high-purity hexagonal diamond crystals in a laboratory, a breakthrough for a material first discovered in a meteorite in 1967. This rare form of diamond, also known as lonsdaleite, has a different atomic structure from common cubic diamonds and is believed to be even harder. While other teams have attempted to synthesize it, previous efforts resulted in impure or mixed-phase samples. The Chinese team's success in creating macroscopic crystals, detailed in the journal Nature, provides definitive proof of the material's existence and opens possibilities for new applications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) showed zero growth in July compared to the previous year, while producer prices continued to fall, signaling persistent weak demand in the nation's economy. The flat CPI reading slightly exceeded market expectations of a minor decline, with a modest month-on-month increase attributed to policies aimed at boosting domestic demand. However, the ongoing deflation in producer prices underscores the challenges facing the manufacturing sector amid turbulent global trade conditions. Food prices fell, while service prices saw a slight increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article highlights the powerful story of Sumiteru Taniguchi, a survivor of the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki, through a series of striking photographs. Taniguchi, who was 16 at the time of the blast, lived for 70 years with severe, web-like scars covering his back, which he would show to visitors as a visceral warning against nuclear warfare. The images document the permanent physical toll of the bomb, including a permanently bent arm and chronic pain. Taniguchi, who died in 2017, was a leading activist for nuclear disarmament, and his legacy endures through this unforgettable visual testimony.</p>
