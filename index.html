        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential strike by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) could halt New Jersey Transit commuter trains and MTA Metro-North West of Hudson service, impacting 350,000 commuters. The union is seeking equal pay for its engineers, who currently earn an average of $113,000 annually, demanding an increase to $170,000, while NJ Transit claims engineers already average $135,000 with top earners exceeding $200,000. NJ Transit warns that accepting BLET's terms would cost taxpayers $1.363 billion, and a strike would cost $4 million per day for limited alternative bus service. Commuters are advised to work from home or limit travel to essential purposes, as expanded bus service would only accommodate about 20% of current rail customers.</p>

          <p>Patrick Spencer, the Conservative MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, has been charged with two counts of sexual assault stemming from alleged incidents at London's Groucho Club in August 2023, prior to his election. The Crown Prosecution Service authorized the charges following a police investigation, leading to Spencer's suspension from the Conservative Party. Spencer, who was elected in July 2024, previously emphasized the importance of moral probity in politics. The case is ongoing, and Spencer is expected to appear in court next month. Sexual assault took place at London's Groucho Club.</p>

          <p>Everton's women's team will relocate to Goodison Park, the club's historic stadium, after plans to demolish the 132-year-old site were abandoned.

With a capacity of nearly 40,000, Goodison Park will become the largest dedicated women's football stadium in the UK. The move underscores Everton's commitment to investing in women's football and preserving Goodison Park's legacy.</p>

          <p>A federal court is hearing arguments in a case challenging President Trump's tariffs, questioning the legality of the import taxes imposed on over 180 countries. Five domestic businesses argue that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to issue sweeping duties, claiming the declared national emergency is unfounded. The Department of Justice defends the tariffs, asserting that IEEPA authorizes the president to regulate importation through tariffs. The outcome could significantly limit Trump's ability to unilaterally impose import taxes.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Thomas B. Edsall discusses Donald Trump's strategy of attacking adversaries to mask his own violations of law and the Constitution. Experts argue Trump uses populist framing to portray institutions as corrupt, employing identity politics and weaponization of government. Trump's shamelessness and self-enrichment are seen as tools to mobilize supporters, who view his defiance of norms as a sign he can dismantle a rigged system. The essay explores the Democrats' vulnerability to these attacks and the broader implications for American politics.</p>

          <p>Nvidia will sell over 18,000 of its advanced artificial intelligence chips to Saudi Arabian company Humain, according to CEO Jensen Huang. The Blackwell chips will be used in a 500 megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia. The announcement was made during a White House-led trip to the region that includes President Donald Trump and other top CEOs. This underscores the importance of Nvidia's chips as a bargaining tool for the Trump administration as countries seek access to advanced AI technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists and policymakers anticipate a resurgence of inflation as companies adapt to President Trumpâ€™s trade war, despite a slight cooling in April. The better-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report is viewed as a temporary lull, with prices expected to rise in the coming months due to import taxes. The Fed is concerned that tariffs will cause a more persistent inflation problem and is prioritizing ensuring that long-term inflation expectations do not shift significantly higher. A temporary trade deal with China has reduced the odds of a severe economic shock, but economists still warn of potential inflation and growth impacts.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life following fires at two properties linked to Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a car fire. The first fire occurred at Starmer's private home in Kentish Town, and the second was at a house converted into flats in Islington, which is also linked to Starmer. Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation and treating the fires as suspicious, due to the property's previous connections with a high-profile public figure. Starmer still owns the Kentish Town property, but currently resides at Downing Street.</p>

          <p>For Americans nearing retirement, home equity can be strategically used to bolster retirement savings. Options include taking out a HELOC as a financial safety net, downsizing and investing the proceeds, refinancing the mortgage to take out cash, or using a reverse mortgage to create steady income. Experts advise homeowners to carefully consider the terms and potential drawbacks of each option, such as variable interest rates or potential foreclosure risks. Financial advisors can help individuals assess their assets and develop a plan to meet retirement goals.</p>

          <p>Inflation retreated in April, driven by lower prices for consumer staples like groceries and gasoline, yet economists warn that tariffs imposed by President Trump may reignite inflation. The consumer price index rose 2.3% annually, the smallest increase since February 2021. Experts note that tariffs could add up to 1 percentage point to the consumer price index within six to nine months. The recent trade deal with China is expected to mitigate some of the near-term inflation pressures, but long-term uncertainty remains.</p>

The Fed is taking a cautious approach to rate cuts, assessing the impact of trade policies.
