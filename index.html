          <p>An architect in Phoenix is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and cost-effective housing solutions for the city's unhoused population. The project, developed with Steel + Spark, features "X-WING" shelters that can be constructed in just one week and are equipped with solar panels and air conditioning. This initiative provides residents with their own private, cool space, which is crucial in Phoenix's extreme heat. The architect's long-term goal is to expand this model to address the broader affordable housing crisis, including building a 105-unit complex for low-income seniors.</p>

Activists and protest groups, particularly in places like Portland, Oregon, believe their efforts may be contributing to this slowdown. In Oregon, a combination of nightly protests outside the ICE field office and a "rapid response" legal aid system complicates large-scale enforcement actions. The state's "sanctuary" law, which limits cooperation between local and federal authorities, is also cited as a significant factor in the lower arrest numbers observed in the region.</p>

          <p>In their first head-to-head 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson defeated American Olympic champion Noah Lyles at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record, while Lyles finished second at 9.90 seconds. This victory serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who narrowly lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by five-thousandths of a second a year ago. Despite the loss, Lyles expressed confidence, viewing the performance as a positive step toward the upcoming world championships in Tokyo.</p>

The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his climbing lines, trapping him. A search was initiated after he failed to return to his car, and a dive and rescue team located him using a drone.

          <p>President Trump's recent pivot from demanding an immediate ceasefire to advocating for a direct peace agreement with Russia has generated significant concern in Ukraine and among its European allies. This new stance aligns more closely with Russia's position, which suggests a comprehensive settlement that could imply Ukrainian capitulation. While the Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin concluded without a deal, Trump's change in rhetoric buys Russia more time on the battlefield. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, who is scheduled to meet with Trump, has reiterated that the killing must stop before any broader negotiations can proceed.</p>

The technology involves building large solar arrays in orbit that convert sunlight into electricity and transmit it to Earth via microwaves or lasers. Unlike ground-based solar, space-based systems can generate power continuously without being affected by weather or nighttime. The academic argues for a top-down national strategy to overcome the current limitations of university-led research and close the technological gap with the U.S.</p>

          <p>This article collection explores the concept of "Lighthouse Parenting" as a healthier alternative to the prevalent trend of intensive, hands-on parenting. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, guiding presence, offering support and safety without controlling every aspect of a child's life. While the instinct to solve every problem for a child is strong, experts argue that this can be exhausting for parents and detrimental to a child's development of confidence and resilience. The articles suggest that allowing children to navigate their own struggles, with the parent as a reliable beacon, fosters greater independence.</p>

Hardin stated that lax security in the prison kitchen, where he worked, allowed him to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform to simply walk out. He fashioned a badge from a can lid and used markers to color laundry, hiding his materials in a trash can. Two prison employees have been fired and others disciplined for procedural violations that enabled the escape, including a guard who opened a gate without verifying Hardin's identity.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Census Bureau paper reveals a significant decline in the number of young adults aged 25 to 34 achieving traditional life milestones compared to previous generations. In 1975, nearly half of young adults had moved out, secured a job, married, and had a child; today, less than a quarter have reached all four milestones. Researchers attribute this shift to economic barriers, such as rising costs of living, and changing societal attitudes toward family formation. Economic stability and education are now often prioritized over marriage, which is increasingly viewed as a capstone achievement rather than a foundational step.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that President Donald Trump's diplomatic efforts have brought the world "closer than ever before" to ending the war in Ukraine. The comment came after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, which concluded without a formal ceasefire agreement but set the stage for further talks. Starmer welcomed the U.S. commitment to providing robust security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any future peace deal. He emphasized that the path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is scheduled to meet with Trump in Washington D.C. on Monday.</p>

          <h2>Samsung Gains U.S. Market Share on Apple Amid Growing Popularity of Foldable Phones</h2>

          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's long-held dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter as Apple's declined. This shift is largely attributed to Samsung's innovation in foldable screen technology and its strategy of offering a wider range of devices at various price points. The popularity of models like the Z Fold 7 is pressuring Apple, which has maintained a similar form factor for years. Analysts expect Apple to respond with a slimmer iPhone and potentially its own foldable device by 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fugitive drug and weapons trafficker, Jamie Rothwell, was identified and located after he took a selfie on his supposedly secure EncroChat phone. International law enforcement had hacked the encrypted network, giving them access to conversations that exposed Rothwell's criminal enterprise, which he ran from a Barcelona apartment. The messages linked him to trafficking AK-47s and orchestrating a gangland shooting. The selfie, along with a picture of the view from his apartment, provided police with the crucial evidence needed to confirm his identity and location, leading to his arrest and a 43-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell and her former bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, have been federally charged with fraud and corruption. Prosecutors allege the two were engaged in an intimate relationship and misused public funds to facilitate it, including taking personal trips while Vappie claimed to be on duty. The indictment accuses them of using a city-owned apartment as a personal residence and communicating via an auto-deleting messaging app to conceal their activities. The alleged fraud scheme cost the city over $70,000, and both face charges that could result in multi-year prison sentences if convicted.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy offers three powerful steps to develop emotional endurance, which is the ability to withstand stress without being overcome by negative feelings. First, she suggests using a visual aid to remind yourself that learning is a process that occurs in the often-frustrating space between not knowing and knowing. Second, engage in positive self-talk to reframe difficult moments as part of the learning journey. Finally, undertake small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which builds tolerance for discomfort and boosts confidence over time.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is exploring a mid-decade redrawing of the state's congressional maps, a move that could significantly favor Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections. Bolstered by a recent state supreme court ruling that approved his previous manipulation of districts in northern Florida, DeSantis is now targeting districts in the south held by prominent Democrats. Critics accuse the governor of a blatant power grab aimed at silencing Democratic voters and rigging future elections. This effort aligns with a national Republican strategy to maintain control of the House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>A recent Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level recorded since the question was first asked in 1939. The data also shows that those who do drink are consuming less, driven by growing concerns about the health impacts of alcohol. This trend is even more pronounced among underage individuals, with teen drinking rates dropping significantly over the past few decades. While a decline in socializing may be a contributing factor, the overall reduction in alcohol consumption points to positive public health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Health officials are alerting hundreds of recent visitors to Grand Teton National Park about potential rabies exposure from bat-infested cabins. Up to 500 guests who stayed in a specific row of eight cabins at Jackson Lake Lodge between May and late July may have come into contact with bats. Although the few bats tested were negative for rabies, officials are taking precautions because a bat bite or scratch can go unnoticed, especially during sleep. Rabies is nearly always fatal once symptoms appear, so authorities are recommending prophylactic shots for those who may have had direct contact.</p>
