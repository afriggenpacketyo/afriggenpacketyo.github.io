          <p>Two Israeli Embassy staff members, identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was apprehended after allegedly chanting "Free, free Palestine" and revealing the location of the weapon. Law enforcement officials are investigating the incident as a potential targeted attack motivated by antisemitism. President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu condemned the shooting, with officials emphasizing that such acts of violence and hatred will not be tolerated in the city. The victims were a young couple about to be engaged.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has temporarily blocked the UK government from finalizing a deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius due to a last-minute injunction filed by two Chagossian women. The agreement would allow the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years, with the UK potentially making substantial payments to Mauritius. The legal action highlights the ongoing dispute over the islands' sovereignty and the Chagossian community's desire to be consulted on the territory's future. Representatives of the Chagossian community are meeting with Foreign Office mininster Stephen Doughty, for discussions on the sovereignty of the territory.</p>

          <p>The Ostok Sanctuary in Culiacán, Mexico, was forced to evacuate hundreds of animals, including tigers, elephants, and lions, due to escalating cartel violence and threats. The sanctuary's staff faced intimidation and gunfire from rival factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, leading to a breakdown of law and order. Some animals suffered from stress and lack of food, and two big cats died during the ordeal. The director of the sanctuary reported unprecedented levels of violence and a lack of government support, prompting the difficult decision to relocate all animals to a safer location in Mazatlán.</p>

A Justice Department lawyer, Erez Reuveni, was fired for advocating Abrego Garcia's return. The documents highlight the Trump administration's efforts to circumvent the American judicial system in deportation cases, and the article states that Abrego Garcia remains in El Salvador despite court orders for his release.</p>

          <p>UK borrowing figures for April were higher than expected, reaching £20.2bn, putting pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Experts predict that taxes will likely need to rise in the autumn to meet the government's economic rules. Tax receipts increased due to higher National Insurance contributions, but government expenditure also rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increased pension and benefit costs. Borrowing for the financial year ending in March is estimated at £148.3bn, less than initially thought but still more than expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p>

          <h2>Violent Criminals Could Be Released Early Under New Proposals</h2>

          <p>A landmark review proposes that violent criminals, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, could be released after serving just a third of their sentence to ease prison overcrowding. The Independent Sentencing Review also recommends managing more offenders in the community and expanding a voluntary chemical castration pilot program for some sexual offenders. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood is considering making chemical castration mandatory. The review calls for shorter custodial sentences, greater use of suspended sentences, and increased funding for the Probation Service.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has appointed Freddy Lim, the frontman of the heavy metal band Chthonic, as its envoy to Finland, a country known for its vibrant metal scene. Lim's appointment is based not only on his musical fame but also on his human rights work and international exchange experience. He served as a national legislator and chairman of Amnesty International in Taiwan. Opposition legislators have expressed doubts, citing Lim's past exemption from military service, but his appointment reflects Taiwan's efforts to strengthen its international relations.</p>

Russia's economy is slowing, with rising inflation and high costs, leading to predictions of a technical recession.
