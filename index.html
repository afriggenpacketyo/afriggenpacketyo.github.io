          <h2>OPEC+ Alliance Announces Larger-Than-Expected Oil Production Increase for August</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 07:06:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eight key OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to increase their collective oil output by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This hike is larger than the previously anticipated 411,000 barrels per day. The decision is part of a gradual rollback of voluntary production cuts implemented earlier. The OPEC Secretariat cited a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, such as low oil inventories, as the primary reasons for accelerating the production increase. This move aims to balance the market amid rising summer demand and geopolitical tensions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Doctors are examining the popular belief that drinking soda, particularly Coke, can relieve migraine headaches. The primary active ingredient is caffeine, which can act as a nerve disruptor and constrict blood vessels in the brain, potentially offering temporary relief for some individuals. However, medical experts caution that caffeine can also be a migraine trigger for others and that relying on sugary drinks is not a recommended long-term solution. They suggest healthier alternatives for caffeine and electrolytes, such as organic coffee or watermelon with salt, and note that the combination of salt, sugar, and caffeine in fast food may explain some anecdotal remedies.</p>

          <p>Reverend William Barber is leading a revived Poor People's Campaign, a national 'moral movement' using nonviolent protest to challenge systemic poverty and injustice. The movement directly confronts the Trump administration's agenda, which includes significant cuts to social services like Medicaid and food assistance, which Barber terms 'policy murder.' Rooted in a tradition of religious protest, the campaign frames justice as a sacred obligation, arguing that the current political climate represents an unholy alliance between nationalism, capitalism, and religion that harms the most vulnerable. Barber's fusion movement aims to unite poor and working-class people across all demographics to create a moral force for political change.</p>

          <p>FICO, the most widely used credit scoring company in the U.S., has announced it will begin incorporating 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) loan data into its credit score calculations starting in fall 2025. This change could allow consumers who use services like Affirm and Afterpay to build their credit history through responsible, on-time payments. However, it also means that late payments or accumulating too much BNPL debt could negatively impact scores. The move reflects the growing prevalence of these short-term loans, especially among younger consumers and those with sub-prime credit, who are also more likely to miss payments.

          <p>A Guardian investigation has revealed the existence of the Old Glory Club (OGC), a network of at least 26 far-right, men-only clubs operating across 20 U.S. states. The organization reportedly includes hundreds of members, among them current and former military personnel, lawyers, and civil servants. Key figures within the OGC use podcasts and other platforms to promote antisemitic and racist ideologies, while the network aims to build an offline social community before attempting to influence society more broadly. Experts warn that the group, which pushes violent ideologies and has links to prominent far-right influencers, represents a new and alarming breed of extremist organization.</p>

          <p>Michigan's tart cherry farmers, who produce 75% of the U.S. crop, are facing a severe crisis that threatens their livelihood and a key state industry. A combination of climate change-induced weather volatility, including late frosts and unusual wind patterns, has devastated crop yields this year. In addition to environmental challenges, farmers are grappling with labor shortages, rising land prices due to development, and the financial impact of tariffs. This confluence of factors has pushed many multigenerational farms to the brink, with production costs far exceeding the prices they receive for their cherries, endangering the future of the state's signature fruit.</p>

It uses President Trump's recent one-night strike on Iran as an example of a showy tactical attack that failed to achieve its strategic goal, undermining a more methodical Israeli campaign. The author contends that this faith in overwhelming force has repeatedly led to optimistic but flawed approaches, from Vietnam to Iraq.

While the strikes significantly damaged Iran's enrichment facilities and killed key military and scientific personnel, experts believe Tehran retains the knowledge and materials to reconstitute its program. Iran has already signaled its defiance by suspending cooperation with the IAEA. The conflict is viewed less as a resolution and more as an intermission, setting the stage for a protracted game of cat-and-mouse as Iran likely moves its nuclear activities to more concealed, fortified locations.</p>

          <p>The appointment of Vicky Pebsworth, a registered nurse with a decades-long history of anti-vaccine activism, to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has drawn sharp criticism from the scientific community. Pebsworth has long argued, contrary to overwhelming scientific evidence, that vaccines caused her son's autism and has been a research director for a prominent anti-vaccine organization. Her appointment is part of a broader overhaul of the committee by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who fired all previous members and stacked the panel with ideological allies. Experts warn this politicization of a critical public health body is a deeply concerning development.</p>

          <h2>From Tehran: Western Support for Israeli Strikes Has Shattered Trust and Fostered Unity</h2>

          <p>Writing from Tehran, a social researcher argues that the West's support for Israel's recent 12-day military campaign has had a profound impact on Iranian society. Initially, views on the attacks were divided, but as civilian casualties mounted, a sense of national pride and patriotic unity against foreign aggression began to grow. The article contends that the West's perceived double standards and indifference to Iranian lives have destroyed any remaining trust, disqualifying it as a credible peace broker. This has led to a dangerous shift where the idea of developing a nuclear weapon as a deterrent is gaining traction among ordinary Iranians.</p>

          <p>Democrats are gearing up to make President Trump's recently passed tax-and-spending bill a central issue in the 2026 midterm elections. They plan to focus their attacks on the legislation's nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, a widely popular program that provides health insurance to millions of Americans. Polling data shows strong public support for Medicaid and opposition to the overall bill. While Republicans will argue the legislation was necessary to prevent a tax increase, Democrats hope to capitalize on the tangible impact of the healthcare cuts, echoing past midterm cycles where healthcare proved to be a highly salient and motivating issue for voters.</p>

Meanwhile, a UK intelligence update confirmed the death of a high-ranking Russian naval commander in a previous Ukrainian strike, highlighting the significant toll the war is taking on Russia's senior military leadership. Following the escalation, President Trump had a call with President Zelenskyy, after which he stated Ukraine would need additional air defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes showcased the blockchain's increasing integration into the architecture of traditional finance. Major financial players like Robinhood, Deutsche Bank, and BlackRock are now building on or integrating with Ethereum and its ecosystem to tokenize assets, manage funds, and offer new services. Robinhood, for instance, launched on-chain tokenized U.S. stocks for European users. Despite price volatility, institutions are reportedly choosing Ethereum not for hype, but for its stability, security, and decade-long track record, solidifying its position as a foundational layer for the future of Wall Street.

          <p>President Trump's announcement that he plans to host a UFC fight on the White House grounds has been criticized in an opinion piece as more than just a stunt. The author argues it represents 'authoritarian theatre,' the culmination of a long-standing partnership between Trump and the UFC that merges entertainment with confrontational politics. The article draws parallels to the use of sport and spectacle by fascist regimes to project strength, masculinity, and nationalism. It contends that by bringing the UFC to the White House, Trump is further eroding political norms and replacing them with a cult of personality and a celebration of violence.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement agencies across the U.S. are issuing warnings about a viral social media trend known as the 'door-kicking challenge,' where teens kick strangers' doors and flee. Police are concerned that the prank could have deadly consequences, as a homeowner might mistake the act for a break-in and respond with defensive force, especially in 'stand-your-ground' states. The trend, which elevates the classic 'ding-dong-ditch' to a more destructive level, can also lead to criminal charges like vandalism or burglary. Experts and police are urging parents to discuss the severe risks of such online challenges with their children.</p>

          <p>Following last month's military strikes on Iran by Israel and the U.S., Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for a 'new international agreement' to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over regional tensions and emphasized the need to place Iran's nuclear activities under strict IAEA supervision. The call for a new pact positions China as a potential mediator in the escalating crisis. It reflects Beijing's strategy of criticizing the U.S. and Israeli actions while simultaneously styling itself as a responsible global power seeking a diplomatic resolution to prevent further conflict.</p>

The article delves into the bizarre yet serious world of elite eating, highlighting Chestnut's intense training regimen, which includes neck exercises and breathing techniques.

          <p>Recent studies on visual illusions are reigniting the long-standing debate over whether people from different cultures perceive the world differently. One study found that people from 'carpentered' Western environments tend to see rectangles in an illusion where rural Namibians see circles. However, another study convincingly argues that the famous Müller-Lyer illusion is not culturally dependent, as it even works on non-human animals. This article explores the complexities of perceptual diversity, suggesting that our experience of the world is always an active construction by the brain, and that differences in perception likely exist within cultures as much as between them.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has officially reopened sections of the Seine River for public swimming. The historic move follows a massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort, a legacy project of the Paris 2024 Olympics, which aimed to make the river safe for athletes and residents. Swimming had been banned since 1923 due to severe pollution and safety hazards. Three supervised swimming zones have been established with amenities like changing rooms and lifeguards, allowing Parisians and tourists to cool off in the iconic river amid a summer heatwave.

          <p>The 90-day pause on President Trump's aggressive 'liberation day' tariffs is set to expire, raising fears of a new global trade assault that could exacerbate inflation. When the plan was paused three months ago, officials promised dozens of new trade agreements, but few have materialized. Businesses and economists are now bracing for the possibility of steep new tariffs on numerous countries, with rates as high as 47% on some nations. Even if the tariffs are not fully implemented, the existing duties from Trump's first term are already contributing to higher costs for U.S. businesses and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>
