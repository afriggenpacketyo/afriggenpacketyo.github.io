          <p>Authorities in New Orleans employed facial recognition technology, operated by Project N.O.L.A., to aid in the recapture of inmates who escaped from Orleans Justice Center, raising concerns about privacy and civil liberties. The New Orleans Police Department's use of this technology, despite internal pauses for legal compliance, has drawn criticism from the ACLU and some members of Congress, who argue it poses a threat to fundamental rights. Project N.O.L.A. operates approximately 200 facial recognition cameras across the city, scanning faces, clothing, and license plates, stirring debate about the balance between public safety and individual privacy.

          <p>This New York Times guest essay reflects on the life and legacy of Sarah Milgrim, an American Jew who was murdered in Washington, D.C., in what authorities have called a politically motivated, antisemitic attack. The author, Yasmina Asrarguis, emphasizes Milgrim's dedication to peace-building and cross-cultural dialogue, particularly between Jews and Muslims. The essay calls for Milgrim's legacy to be honored through continued efforts towards mutual respect and understanding, rather than being exploited for political gain in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This article underscores the importance of remembering individuals for their ideals and striving for peace in the face of violence. </p>
