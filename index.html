          <p>As the UK prepares to ban disposable vapes starting June 1st, many vapers are panic-buying to stock up, fearing the transition to rechargeable devices. Concerns include forgetting to recharge, taste differences, and the inconvenience of refillable systems. The ban aims to reduce environmental impact and curb youth vaping, though some argue it undermines public health by removing a successful smoking cessation tool. Retailers report sales spikes as consumers stockpile, while some worry about a return to smoking if disposable vapes become inaccessible. This article highlights the perspectives of vapers, retailers, and health experts on the upcoming ban and its potential consequences.</p>
