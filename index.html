          <p>The restaurant chain Chili's is facing online outrage from diners after making changes to its menu that eliminated several popular items, including the Kids Cheese Quesadilla and the Mini Molten dessert. Customers took to social media platforms like Reddit to express their frustration and confusion, questioning why the chain would remove simple-to-make dishes and a well-loved smaller dessert option. A Chili's spokesperson stated that the changes are part of the company's ongoing efforts to streamline its menu offerings.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly terror attack on a Manchester synagogue, the UK's home secretary stated she was "disappointed" that pro-Palestinian protests continued, describing the demonstrations as feeling "un-British" and wrong. The comments came as police clashed with some demonstrators in London, leading to 40 arrests. The UK's Chief Rabbi echoed concerns, stating that such marches often contain antisemitism and that one cannot separate the rhetoric on the streets from the violence that ultimately occurred.</p>

          <p>During his sentencing hearing for two counts of transportation for the purposes of prostitution, Sean "Diddy" Combs' children made emotional pleas to the court for leniency. Federal prosecutors are seeking a sentence of at least 11 years, arguing the public must be defended from his history of violence, while Combs' defense has requested no more than 14 months. The judge noted that he does not believe Combs has shown full remorse for his conduct but allowed his children to speak on his behalf.</p>

          <p>Rabbi Daniel Walker provided a harrowing first-hand account of the terrorist attack at his Manchester synagogue, describing the moment he and others held the doors shut as the assailant tried to force his way inside. He stated, "I saw evil, I saw hate," as the attacker used heavy plant pots to batter the entrance. The rabbi also praised the "genuine heroism" of the security guards and congregants whose quick actions to secure the building prevented what could have been a much larger massacre during the holy day of Yom Kippur.</p>

The storm has already caused power outages and is expected to lead to widespread travel chaos, with numerous ScotRail train services and ferry crossings cancelled in anticipation of its arrival.</p>

          <p>This article offers crucial advice for individuals contacted by a debt collector, emphasizing that one should not rush to pay without taking protective steps first. Experts recommend a three-part strategy: first, formally request written validation to confirm the debt is legitimate and that the collector legally owns it. Second, carefully weigh all options, such as negotiating a lower settlement or a payment plan. Finally, ensure any agreement is documented in writing before any money is exchanged to prevent future disputes.</p>

          <p>This article examines the structural reasons why the United States frequently experiences government shutdowns, a crisis rarely seen in other Western democracies like the United Kingdom. The key differences lie in the U.S. system's separation of powers, where Congress holds significant control over the budget independent of the president, unlike parliamentary systems where the executive branch typically controls the legislature. Additional factors include complex voting thresholds in the Senate and specific appropriation rules that mandate a halt in government spending without a budget deal.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Predict 2026 Will Be the 'Year of the Used EV' as Prices Fall</h2>

          <p>The price gap between used electric vehicles and their gasoline-powered counterparts has shrunk to a record low, prompting analysts to forecast a surge in their popularity. A significant number of EVs returning to the market after their leases end is boosting supply and driving down prices, making them an affordable option for mainstream consumers for the first time. Even with the expiration of a federal tax credit, this trend of increasing affordability is expected to make 2026 a breakout "year of the used EV." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant move toward normalizing diplomatic and economic ties, India and China are set to resume direct flights at the end of October for the first time since 2020.

          <p>In his first speech as leader of the UK's Green Party, Zack Polanski called for a new tax on the assets of the wealthiest 1% to fund a range of public services and end what he termed "rip-off Britain." He argued that the revenue generated could pay for universal free childcare, special needs education, and improved rural bus routes. Polanski also positioned his party as a staunch defender of migrants and refugees, while accusing the opposition Labour Party of capitulating to the right-wing agenda of Reform UK.</p>

The delay fuels uncertainty and hinders the ability to make informed decisions, while the Trump administration has so far defied calls to release the already-collected data.
