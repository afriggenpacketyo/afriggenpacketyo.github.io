          <p>Six activists from a Gaza aid boat intercepted by Israeli forces were deported from Israel after being held for over 72 hours. The activists, part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, aimed to deliver aid to Gaza in defiance of Israel's blockade and highlight the humanitarian crisis. Israeli authorities intercepted the yacht Madleen approximately 185km west of Gaza, dismissing it as a "selfie yacht" with minimal aid. The Israeli foreign ministry stated that unauthorized attempts to breach the blockade were dangerous and unlawful, while Adalah, a human rights group, alleged mistreatment and punitive measures against the activists during their custody. The remaining activists are expected to be deported soon, as the situation highlights ongoing tensions and differing perspectives on humanitarian efforts in the region. Optimism here is tempered due to the ongoing conflict.</p>
