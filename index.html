          <p>Fans will have an opportunity to honor the late heavy metal icon Ozzy Osbourne, who died at 76, as his funeral cortege travels through his hometown of Birmingham. The procession is scheduled to pass along Broad Street, concluding at the Black Sabbath Bridge, a site that has become a memorial for the singer. The city's Lord Mayor praised Osbourne as a "son of Birmingham" who brought global recognition to the city, and the event is being funded by the Osbourne family to allow for public tribute.</p>

          <p>A recently brokered ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia is already under strain after five days of deadly border clashes that killed over 30 people. The Thai military has accused Cambodian forces of deliberately violating the agreement by opening fire at multiple locations after the truce began. Cambodia's defense ministry has denied these claims, stating that no armed clashes have occurred since the ceasefire took effect. Despite the accusations, local commanders from both nations have met to reinforce the agreement to halt troop movements and shooting.</p>

          <p>Automotive conglomerate Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep and Fiat, has reinstated its financial guidance for the second half of the year, signaling a gradual recovery. This comes after the company reported a significant net loss of 2.3 billion euros for the first half of 2025, a stark contrast to the profit recorded in the same period last year. CEO Antonio Filosa acknowledged that 2025 is a "tough year" but expressed confidence that the new leadership team is prepared to make difficult decisions to restore profitable growth.

          <p>Shares of Singapore Airlines experienced their largest single-day drop since 2024 after the carrier announced a 59% fall in net profit for the first quarter. The company attributed the significant decline to lower interest income and, notably, to losses from its 25.1% stake in Air India, which were not a factor in the previous year's results. Analysts suggest that Air India's deep losses are likely to continue affecting SIA's bottom line in the near term as the Indian airline undergoes a complex restructuring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of bribery and witness tampering, a verdict that could tarnish the legacy of the once-powerful conservative leader. The case stemmed from allegations that Uribe, who governed from 2002 to 2010, conspired to influence imprisoned former paramilitary members to retract testimony linking him to armed groups. Uribe, who faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal, remains a deeply polarizing figure in Colombia for his hardline security policies.</p>

          <p>In his first official phone call with South Korea's new foreign policy chief, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi encouraged Seoul to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling." The conversation reflects Beijing's efforts to reset relations with the new South Korean administration under President Lee Jae-myung, who is viewed as more open to China than his predecessor. Both ministers affirmed a shared commitment to advancing their strategic partnership in a stable and mature manner, aiming for tangible cooperative outcomes.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address its looming demographic crisis, the Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy program to encourage more births. The policy will provide parents with an annual payment of 3,600 yuan (about $500) for each child under the age of three, a move expected to benefit around 20 million families. This national initiative follows various pilot programs by local governments and comes as official data shows China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, despite the abolition of the one-child policy.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed to block a new Trump administration policy that mandates detention without bail for immigrants in the U.S. illegally while they await deportation hearings. This policy reverses the long-standing practice of granting release on bond to individuals not considered a flight or safety risk. Immigrant advocacy groups argue the new interpretation of the law is a violation of due process rights and is causing "catastrophic" harm by separating families and detaining people with deep community ties for extended periods.</p>

          <p>A boating accident on Biscayne Bay near Miami Beach has resulted in the deaths of two children, a 7-year-old and a 13-year-old girl. The children were part of a summer sailing camp when their small sailboat, carrying five children and a camp counselor, collided with a barge. All six were thrown into the water, with some reportedly trapped under the barge. Two other children remain in critical condition, while one child and the adult counselor were rescued with less severe injuries as a major emergency response was launched.</p>

The article also notes that U.S. President Donald Trump's recent comments about "real starvation" in Gaza contradict claims made by the Israeli prime minister, adding to the international pressure for more aid access.</p>

          <p>Following intense international pressure, Israel has reversed its policy and is allowing more humanitarian aid into Gaza, including food convoys and airdrops. However, the United Nations warns that the current volume is far from sufficient to address the widespread hunger, with over 500 trucks needed daily compared to the 120 currently arriving. The desperation is so severe that starving residents are resorting to "self-distribution" by taking supplies directly from aid trucks. The UN agency UNRWA reports that one in five children in Gaza City is malnourished.</p>
