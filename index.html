          <p>A photo taken during a cabinet meeting reveals that former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was using the Signal app to communicate with other Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This occurred after President Trump had discouraged the use of the encrypted messaging app due to security concerns and a recent leak controversy. A White House spokeswoman stated that Signal is an approved app for government use, however, Waltz previously used Signal to discuss pending military strikes which triggered a controversy earlier in the year. This incident raises questions about adherence to security protocols within the administration. </p>

          <p>Venmo is showing momentum in the peer-to-peer payments market, while Cash App is experiencing difficulties. PayPal, Venmo's parent company, reported strong earnings, while Block, the parent company of Cash App, saw its stock plummet after missing revenue targets. Venmo revenue jumped 20% in the first quarter, driven by the adoption of features like debit cards and instant transfers. PayPal is focused on monetizing Venmo as a key part of its turnaround plan.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that a majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will be manufactured in India, while most iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods will be produced in Vietnam. This shift is aimed at mitigating the impact of President Trump's tariffs on its supply chains. Despite the move, China will remain a key manufacturing hub for Apple products sold outside of the United States. Apple's sales in China have declined due to increased competition from domestic brands.</p>

          <p>Cambodia continues to struggle with the deadly threat of landmines, a legacy of decades of conflict stemming from the Vietnam War. Millions of mines and unexploded ordnance still litter the countryside.

Many Cambodians have been killed or maimed by landmines, including Poy, who lost his arm and eyesight in two separate explosions.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz has implemented a soda tax, adding a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on sweetened beverages, despite a statewide ban on such taxes. Voters approved the tax in November, framing it as a battle against the American Beverage Assn. The tax applies to nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners and 40 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces. Proponents argue the tax will combat the dangers of sugary drinks, while opponents claim it unfairly burdens working families.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to ending the war in Ukraine has been inconsistent, shifting his frustration from Ukraine's leader to Vladimir Putin. After a strained meeting with President Zelensky, Trump accelerated diplomacy with Putin, drafting a peace plan that offered major concessions to Moscow. However, Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Putin's demands, leading to a more friendly meeting with Zelensky. Analysts caution against drawing firm conclusions, as Trump's tactics and blame-shifting have confounded observers.</p>

Both countries are attempting to save face while seeking a mutually beneficial resolution to the conflict. Experts characterize the situation as a game of chicken, where neither side wants to appear weak by initiating discussions first.</p>

          <p>New York is considering an increase in the film tax credit to remain competitive with New Jersey and other states. Since 2017, New York has spent over $5.5 billion in incentives to attract film and television productions. The article explores the costs and benefits of these tax credits, as a new state budget agreement nears. Each New York household has contributed about $16 in taxes, on average, toward producing the drama series “Billions” since 2017.</p>

Transgender rights advocates criticized the report as an ideological statement. The American Academy of Pediatrics continues to endorse these treatments as effective.</p>
