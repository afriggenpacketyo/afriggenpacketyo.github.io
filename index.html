          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed Asian military officials at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, warning of China's "imminent" threat to Taiwan and its ambition to become a "hegemonic power." He urged Asian countries to increase their defense spending and collaborate with the U.S. to deter war, emphasizing that the U.S. does not seek conflict with China but will not allow China to dominate its allies. Hegseth also cautioned against economic ties with China, suggesting Beijing would exploit them to exert "malign influence" and complicate U.S. defense strategies; his remarks followed a similar appeal from French President Emmanuel Macron for Europe to be Asia's ally. The Chinese Embassy responded by calling the U.S. the biggest "troublemaker" for regional stability. </p>

          <p>Kylie Landolfi, a North Carolina resident, discovered her iPhone in the debris of her home seven months after it was destroyed by a landslide during Hurricane Helene. Landolfi and her boyfriend had narrowly escaped their rental home in Bat Cave when the storm triggered the disaster, forcing them to flee without shoes or supplies. The couple aided injured neighbors before firefighters arrived, and Landolfi returned to the site several times without success before finding her phone during a search with Bat Cave Disaster Relief. The phone contained cherished photos of their ferrets and their home, which they thought were lost forever, making the discovery feel like a miracle. </p>

          <p>Psychiatrist Mathilde Ross, drawing from her work with over 3,000 young adults, offers five simple rules for parents seeking to raise successful children. These rules emphasize trusting parental instincts, following cultural traditions, observing and understanding individual children, prioritizing enjoyment over strict development, and being authentic rather than striving for perfection. Ross encourages parents to focus on creating a loving and attentive environment where children can learn and grow through playful activities.

          <p>Elijah Heacock, a teenager, died by suicide after being blackmailed with an AI-generated nude photo of himself, prompting his family to advocate for change. Sextortion scams, where perpetrators threaten to release explicit images, are on the rise, with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reporting over 500,000 cases targeting minors in the past year. The "Take It Down" Act, signed into law, aims to combat this by making it a federal crime to post sexually explicit images without consent and requiring social media companies to remove such images within 48 hours. Elijah's parents hope the law will make a difference and prevent other families from experiencing similar tragedies. </p>

The procedure involved facial plastic surgeon Dr. Kalpesh T.

The guidance identifies soldiers suspected of having gender dysphoria based on various criteria, including social media activity and commander's private conversations. Transgender troops will receive an honorable discharge but are ineligible to rejoin the military without a waiver, with officers receiving a separation code that may complicate future security clearance applications.
