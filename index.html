        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, his previously articulated strong support for the death penalty has drawn renewed attention. Kirk had argued for its broad application in murder cases, even suggesting executions should be public and televised to deter crime. This context emerges as Utah officials, including Governor Spencer Cox, announce their intention to seek capital punishment for Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect arrested in connection with the killing. The article highlights Kirk's belief in "blind justice" and his view that taking one life is as morally significant as taking many.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified and arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The capture was facilitated by Robinson's own father, who recognized him from released images and coordinated with a pastor to ensure his surrender after a 33-hour manhunt. Investigators discovered a high-powered rifle and shell casings engraved with messages, including an anti-fascist Italian song lyric and taunts. Officials noted that Robinson, who was not a student at the university, had reportedly become more political in recent years and had expressed dislike for Kirk's views.</p>

However, he also reiterated his critique of their pricing, calling Palantir's enterprise software the "most expensive" he has ever encountered and humorously suggesting he might not be charging enough. This exchange follows recent remarks where Benioff highlighted Salesforce's ability to offer a competitive product at a lower cost. The rivalry underscores the different growth trajectories and market perceptions of the two major software companies.</p>

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fatally shot a man, identified as Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, during an attempted arrest in Franklin Park, Illinois. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the incident occurred when Villegas-Gonzalez resisted a vehicle stop and drove his car into the agents, striking and dragging one of them. Fearing for his life, the officer discharged his weapon, and the suspect later died at a hospital after crashing his vehicle. The injured agent was also hospitalized but is in stable condition, and the FBI is assisting with the investigation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has placed agent Anthony Pough on administrative leave and revoked his security clearance following a controversial Facebook post about the late Charlie Kirk. In the post, Pough suggested Kirk had "spewed hate" and that his fate was a form of "karma." Secret Service Director Sean Curran addressed the incident in a staff memo, emphasizing that agents must conduct themselves without political bias and that such distractions will not be tolerated. The agency has launched an investigation into the matter, stating it will not tolerate behavior that violates its code of conduct.</p>

          <p>Citing a slowdown in North American demand for battery-electric trucks, Stellantis has officially canceled the development of its all-electric Ram 1500 pickup. The company, which had already delayed the truck's launch, will now pivot its focus to an extended-range electric model that includes a gasoline engine as a generator. This vehicle, previously known as the "Ramcharger," will be rebranded as the "Ram 1500 REV" and is expected to launch next year. The decision reflects a broader strategic reassessment within the automotive industry as consumer adoption of EVs faces challenges.</p>

          <p>A significant water supply disruption at the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay has necessitated the relocation of migrants housed at the Migrant Operations Center. The failure, caused by structural damage to an underwater pipeline, has forced officials to move migrants to a different part of the base. This development fuels skepticism from critics who argue that Guantánamo's infrastructure is inadequate to support the thousands of migrants the Trump administration intends to detain there.

          <p>This article argues that in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Democratic leaders from across the political spectrum were united and unequivocal in their condemnation of the attack and all political violence. The author contrasts this with efforts by some right-wing commentators to amplify isolated, offensive social media posts from private citizens to suggest widespread approval on the left. The piece posits that this narrative is necessary to justify Donald Trump's own rhetoric, which frames political violence as an exclusively left-wing problem. It concludes that the Democratic Party has a healthier culture of marginalizing violent sentiments compared to its counterpart.</p>

Through his organization, Turning Point USA, Kirk transformed campus conservatism from a fringe movement into a mainstream cultural identity, making it "cool" and socially relevant. He expertly utilized the modern attention economy, building a powerful personal brand through viral debate clips and a network of young influencers. The analysis suggests Kirk successfully tapped into a Gen Z counterculture that values free speech and skepticism toward established institutions, leaving a lasting mark on the political landscape.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, alleging the ride-sharing giant engages in systemic discrimination against passengers with disabilities. The lawsuit claims Uber violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by routinely denying service to individuals who use service animals or stowable mobility devices like wheelchairs. The DOJ alleges that disabled riders have faced significant delays, missed appointments, and have been charged improper fees. Uber has disputed the allegations, stating it has a clear zero-tolerance policy for service denials and invests in training and technology to ensure accessibility.</p>

          <p>The European Union plans to accelerate its review of the 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine vehicles, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The decision comes in response to significant pressure from European automakers, who argue the target is "no longer feasible" due to numerous challenges. Carmakers cite high manufacturing costs, dependency on Asia for batteries, insufficient charging infrastructure, and intense competition from Chinese electric vehicles. They are calling for a more flexible approach, including allowing for low-emission technologies and hybrid cars beyond the 2035 deadline.</p>

The exercises are causing significant concern as the 2021 Zapad drills were used as a staging ground for Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

While some market experts believe lower yields on cash-equivalent accounts will prompt a significant outflow into the stock and bond markets, others are skeptical. Data suggests that money fund assets have historically only declined when interest rates approach zero during severe economic downturns. For now, the high yields relative to bank deposits may keep much of this institutional and retail cash right where it is. (not investment advice)</p>

This article advises that timing is crucial, as lenders often adjust rates in anticipation of Federal Reserve actions, meaning the best window may occur before an official rate cut. It also emphasizes the importance of a high credit score to secure the most favorable terms and the wisdom of prioritizing the right home over waiting for the perfect rate, as refinancing is always an option later. Finally, securing a mortgage pre-approval remains essential to demonstrate seriousness to sellers. (not investment advice)</p>
