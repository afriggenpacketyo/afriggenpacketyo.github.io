          <h2>China's Exports Surge in April Despite Plunging Shipments to the U.S.</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports unexpectedly jumped 8.1% in April, despite a 21% plunge in shipments to the U.S. due to tariffs, while imports declined slightly. The surge in overall exports may be attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. President Trump has imposed tariffs of 145% on all imports from China, leading to retaliatory tariffs from Beijing. The Chinese government is encouraging exporters to shift sales to the domestic market, which could exacerbate deflationary pressures.</p>

          <p>President Trump terminated Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden via email, a move criticized by top Democrats as an assault on American values. Hayden, the first woman in the role, was appointed in 2016 and had a term set to expire next year. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries condemned the firing as an effort to ban books and whitewash history. Trump is expected to announce Hayden's replacement soon, while Democratic lawmakers plan to introduce legislation ensuring congressional appointment of the Librarian of Congress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump unveiled the broad terms of a trade deal with the U.K., potentially easing the impact of tariffs and providing a political win for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal aims to increase U.S. access to the U.K. market, including agricultural products, and reduce non-tariff barriers. While a 10% tariff on U.K. imports remains, the first 100,000 vehicles imported annually will be subject to this rate, with additional vehicles facing higher tariffs. Rolls Royce engines will not be subject to tariffs, and a British airline will buy $10 billion in Boeing planes.</p>

          <p>A Southern California Edison transmission tower being dismantled as part of the Eaton fire investigation was damaged when the top portion contacted power lines during a helicopter lift. No injuries were reported, and the extent of the damage is still being assessed. The incident occurred while removing the second of two towers for examination, following the successful removal of Tower 208, suspected of sparking the fire. The official cause of the Eaton fire is still under investigation, with induction being a leading theory.</p>

Civilians in Dobropillya express similar sentiments, citing the sounds of explosions as evidence of the ceasefire's ineffectiveness. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected the ceasefire, calling for a longer 30-day truce.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new trade pact with the UK reveals a limited rollback of import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel, in exchange for increased access for American agricultural products in the UK. The 10% import tax on most UK goods, announced last month, remains intact. Experts say the substantive benefits are limited, with the deal seen as a political win for Trump. The announcement has drawn criticism from American carmakers, while British steelmakers and car firms expressed relief.</p>
