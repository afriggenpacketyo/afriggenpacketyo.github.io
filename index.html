        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has partially lifted nationwide injunctions that blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for certain children born in the U.S. The ruling does not decide the constitutionality of the order itself but limits the power of single district judges to issue universal injunctions, stating they should only provide relief to the specific plaintiffs involved. This allows the Trump administration to begin developing implementation plans for the policy, which targets children of undocumented immigrants or those on temporary visas. The decision marks a significant development in the ongoing legal battles over executive power and immigration policy.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 in favor of Maryland parents who sought to opt their elementary school children out of lessons involving books on gender identity and sexuality. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, stated that the school district's policy, which denied opt-outs, placed a substantial burden on the parents' rights to direct their children's religious upbringing. This decision reverses lower court rulings and requires the school board to provide advance notice and allow students to be excused from the instruction. The case is a significant victory for religious rights advocates and impacts how public schools handle curriculum objections from families with diverse religious beliefs.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are set to sign a peace agreement in Washington, aimed at ending years of violent conflict in the African Great Lakes region. The conflict, which has displaced millions, was fueled by Rwanda's alleged support for M23 rebels. While hailed by the Trump administration, the deal is criticized for overlooking key issues like justice for victims of sexual assault and the displacement crisis.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has adjusted his government's welfare reform plans following significant pressure from within his own Labour Party. The original bill aimed to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to reduce costs, but faced a rebellion from about 120 MPs. In a concession, the stricter criteria will now apply only to new claimants, not the 3.7 million existing recipients. While this has satisfied some backbenchers, a faction of MPs on the party's left still plan to vote against the bill, highlighting ongoing internal divisions over the government's approach to disability benefits and social welfare.</p>

          <p>During closing arguments in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering trial, his defense team accused the government of fabricating a case by focusing on his private sex life. Attorney Marc Agnifilo argued that the prosecution failed to provide evidence of a criminal enterprise, instead sensationalizing the seizure of personal items like baby oil from the rapper's homes. The defense claimed the case was motivated by money, stemming from a lawsuit filed by his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura. Prosecutors had earlier contended that Combs ran a criminal enterprise for decades, using his power and wealth to commit and conceal crimes.</p>

          <p>A decline in the U.S. birth rate to below replacement level is sparking a wide-ranging cultural and political debate about its potential consequences. Experts point to several risks, including the instability of social safety nets like Social Security, which rely on a growing workforce, and potential economic stagnation. Discussions are emerging between different ideological camps on how to address the issue, with some advocating for enhanced social services and others for a return to traditional family structures. Conversely, some welcome the trend for environmental reasons, though this view is contested by those who argue technological progress can mitigate the impact of population size.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has sued Fox News for at least $787 million, alleging the network defamed him by falsely reporting on a phone call with President Donald Trump. The lawsuit, filed in Delaware, centers on comments made by Fox News anchor Jesse Watters, who claimed Newsom lied about the conversation. The damages sought are nearly identical to the amount Fox News paid to settle the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit. Newsom's legal team stated they would drop the suit in exchange for an on-air retraction and apology, accusing the network of deliberately distorting facts on behalf of the president.</p>

The lawsuit was brought by businesses with religious objections to covering PrEP drugs.

The challenge, brought by a conservative group, argued that Congress had unlawfully delegated its legislative power to the FCC.

          <p>New York State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani has likely secured the Democratic nomination for New York City's mayoral race, positioning the 33-year-old to become the city's youngest mayor since 1914. Running on a platform focused on affordability, Mamdani has proposed policies like free public transportation and a rent freeze, funded by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. His victory in the primary, where he defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo, signals a significant progressive shift in the city's politics. Mamdani's win has been met with alarm by some on Wall Street but celebrated by supporters as a move toward a more equitable city.</p>

          <p>Following his victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, candidate Zohran Mamdani has faced a wave of online misinformation, including allegations of antisemitism and Islamist extremism. A fact-check by DW found these claims to be false. The article notes that while Mamdani is a vocal critic of Israeli government policies and supports the BDS movement, his positions do not align with codified definitions of antisemitism and he has a history of working with Jewish politicians. Claims that he wants to implement Sharia law are contradicted by his progressive platform, which includes strong support for LGBTQIA+ rights and reproductive freedom.</p>

The Commerce Department report also revealed that consumer spending fell by 0.1%, the first decline since January, as households pared back after a period of higher spending.

Some participants, like Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, called the event a major success, praising the vehicles' smooth maneuverability. However, other reports highlighted significant issues, including a vehicle driving on the wrong side of the road and another stopping abruptly in traffic. The launch underscores Tesla's unique approach to autonomous driving, which relies on cameras rather than the lidar and radar systems used by competitors like Waymo, a strategy that continues to be debated by industry experts.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's decision to weaken lower court injunctions against President Trump's birthright citizenship order has created significant uncertainty and potential chaos for immigrant families. The ruling allows the administration to proceed with implementing the policy in states not covered by more narrowly defined injunctions. This could leave an unknown number of U.S.-born infants of immigrants in legal limbo, potentially denied citizenship documents like Social Security cards and passports. Advocacy groups warn this will create a two-tiered system where a child's citizenship status could depend on the state they are in, causing immense harm and administrative confusion.</p>

          <p>The United Nations reports an unprecedented surge in methamphetamine production and trafficking in Southeast Asia, with seizures hitting a record 236 tons last year. The majority of the meth originates from the "Golden Triangle," particularly Myanmar's Shan State, where the ongoing civil war has created a lawless environment for drug producers. The military junta that seized power in 2021 is accused of using the narcotics trade to finance its war effort.
