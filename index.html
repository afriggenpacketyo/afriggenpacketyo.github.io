        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives moved forward with voting on President Trump's domestic policy bill, following an all-night session and the unveiling of an updated version aimed at appeasing Republican holdouts. The legislation, which includes tax, defense, and energy priorities, has faced numerous setbacks due to internal party disagreements over Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, and renewable energy credits. Speaker Mike Johnson negotiated changes, including adjustments to Medicaid work requirements and renewable energy tax credits, to secure enough votes for passage in the House. However, the bill is expected to encounter significant resistance in the Senate, where Republicans are likely to seek further modifications, potentially disrupting the delicate balance achieved in the House.

          <p>Two members of the Israeli embassy staff were killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, was taken into custody and is being questioned by authorities. Early indicators suggest the shooting was a targeted attack, with Rodriguez shouting "free, free Palestine" after the shooting. The victims, a couple about to get engaged, were exiting an event at the museum when the incident occurred. Officials have condemned the act as antisemitism, with President Trump posting a statement expressing condolences and denouncing hatred and radicalism in the USA. The FBI is working with local police to investigate, and security has been increased at Israeli missions worldwide.</p>

The country aims to address trade imbalances by increasing agricultural exports to China. This stance reflects Mexico's broader "universal mentality" of seeking cooperation and business opportunities with multiple countries, rather than choosing sides in geopolitical conflicts.

          <p>Juan Soto, the New York Mets' $765 million slugger, has faced scrutiny despite a generally solid start to his career with the team. After signing a lucrative 15-year contract, Soto's performance has been subject to viral stories and negative rumors, including concerns about his hustle and clubhouse demeanor. While his adjusted on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS+) remains above the league average, it hasn't met the extraordinary expectations set by his past performance. Despite the pressure, analysts suggest that Soto's underlying statistics indicate he will soon return to his elite form, and that fans should remain patient as he adjusts to playing in New York.</p>

Scientists from Stanford University and Japan’s Kyushu University collaborated, collecting DNA samples from hundreds of cat owners to pinpoint the specific alteration near the ARHGAP36 gene. The mutation activates this gene in pigment cells, leading to the orange hue. This discovery sheds light on hormonal signaling pathways and has broader implications for understanding cell behavior in various animals, including humans.</p>

          <p>President Trump is hosting a dinner for the top 220 investors in his $TRUMP meme coin, raising ethical questions about the intersection of cryptocurrencies and presidential influence. The $TRUMP coin, launched shortly before the inauguration, saw its market cap surge before plummeting, and has since recovered. Critics, including former ethics advisors, argue that the event could violate the Emoluments Clause, potentially allowing foreign entities to influence policy decisions through the meme coin. While the White House denies any ethical conflicts, some Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns about the appropriateness of the event. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts say that the curbs reduce U.S. companies' access to the Chinese market and accelerate innovation within China.

The collapse occurred after renovations were completed last year to fix falling roof tiles, prompting questions about the use of public funds and the legality of the 1995 reconstruction.

          <p>Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish language hip-hop group Kneecap, has been charged with a terror offence for allegedly displaying a flag in support of the proscribed organization Hezbollah at a London gig. The charge follows an incident at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town in November 2024. Kneecap denies the offence, calling it "political policing" and a "carnival of distraction." The Metropolitan Police's counter terrorism command is investigating, and the Crown Prosecution Service has authorized the charge.</p>

          <p>Despite appearing reluctant to pursue peace negotiations with Ukraine, Russia may eventually be driven to the negotiating table by increasing economic and military pressures. Limited stockpiles of military equipment, the need for forced mobilization, and tighter sanctions on revenue-generating exports are all contributing to the economic slowdown. While the Russian economy is currently focused on defense manufacturing, experts predict a continued slowdown, with potential for a recession. These factors, combined with declining oil prices, could force Moscow to reconsider its stance on negotiations.</p>

Collaborative government is the way Britain has to be governed now. This week’s council may seem a sideshow to some.
