          <p>SpaceX's latest Starship test flight reached space, marking progress over previous attempts that ended in explosions during ascent. The upper-stage vehicle experienced a propellant leak and spun out of control, causing it to break up during re-entry into the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean. While several planned tests were not conducted due to the anomaly, the company appears to have resolved issues that caused earlier explosions. Elon Musk noted improvements in heat shield tile performance during ascent, with the next test flights scheduled to occur more frequently, though past schedules have proven unrealistic.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employees access to a sensitive Treasury Department system controlling federal payments. Judge Jeannette Vargas permitted four DOGE employees access to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service after the Trump administration established a system to train employees to prevent improper disclosures. The ruling is a victory for the Trump administration, which faced legal challenges from Democratic attorneys general who initially blocked DOGE's access.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly considering military action against Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, creating tension with President Trump's efforts to negotiate a nuclear deal. Israel, not a participant in the negotiations, fears that Trump's eagerness for a deal will allow Iran to maintain its enrichment capabilities. Israeli officials have met with U.S. officials to discuss their concerns and potential covert actions, but U.S. military officials remain skeptical about the effectiveness of a unilateral Israeli strike. The Trump administration appears more open to an interim agreement to deter an Israeli strike, though Israel remains suspicious of any deal that leaves Iran's facilities intact.</p>

          <p>The EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, stated that Israeli strikes in Gaza exceed what is necessary to fight Hamas, as the death toll continues to rise. This follows criticism from Germany, the UK, France, and Canada, with the UK suspending trade talks with Israel. The EU is one of the largest aid donors to Gaza, but Kallas said most aid is blocked by Israel, causing untenable suffering. The EU has launched a formal review of its trade agreement with Israel and will consider options at an upcoming foreign ministers meeting. Israel plans to relocate Gaza's population to a "sterile zone" and facilitate "voluntary emigration," a plan viewed by many as forcible expulsion.</p>

          <p>Joel Le Scouarnec, a former French surgeon, has been sentenced to 20 years in jail after admitting to sexually abusing hundreds of patients, mostly children, between 1989 and 2014. The ex-surgeon, already in jail for previous sexual assault convictions, admitted to the charges during a closed-door session. The trial has sparked outrage over how Le Scouarnec evaded detection for over fifteen years, despite a prior conviction for downloading child exploitation images. Victims testified about the lasting impact of the abuse on their lives, with some relatives attributing suicides to the trauma caused by Le Scouarnec's actions.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has agreed to relinquish ownership of daguerreotypes of an enslaved man, Renty, and his daughter, Delia, to the International African American Museum in Charleston, S.C., after a legal battle with Tamara Lanier, who claims to be their descendant. The images, commissioned by a Harvard professor to support discredited theories of Black racial inferiority, will be transferred along with images of five other enslaved people. Lanier sued Harvard in 2019, arguing the school profited from the images, but the case took on broader significance as universities grappled with their ties to slavery.

Foreign-born individuals make up a significant portion of the STEM workforce in the US, and restricting their access to American universities would exacerbate existing weaknesses in the K-12 education system.

The judge found that Musk's reach extends throughout the executive branch without known limits, and that the states made a credible argument that he "occupies a continuing position" and "exercises significant authority" without Congressional approval.

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics indicates that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty finding employment, accounting for 12% of the rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023. The unemployment rate among recent graduates is nearing 6%, surpassing the national average. This is largely attributed to a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates in fields where business demand has waned, particularly in the tech industry. Economic uncertainty driven by tariff policies is also contributing to slower hiring, and artificial intelligence may be impacting lower-level computer science jobs.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk criticized the Republican spending bill, saying it counters the work he's been doing to reduce wasteful government spending as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk expressed disappointment with the "big, beautiful bill," which he believes will increase the budget deficit. DOGE claims to have saved $170 billion in taxpayer money by targeting areas of government waste and redundancy. The legislation, however, is projected to raise the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years. Musk has pulled back from his DOGE work to focus on running his companies, citing the federal bureaucracy as "much worse than I realized."</p>

          <p>A Reuters poll suggests the S&P 500 will finish the year near current levels, with many strategists cutting their 2025 forecast due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. The median forecast of 51 equity strategists puts the year-end target for the S&P 500 at 5,900, down from 6,500 in February. Strategists anticipate a choppy market, with earnings impacted by tariffs. Trade developments have whipsawed the stock market, particularly after Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on imports globally (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Actor and reality TV star Paul Danan's death was ruled as misadventure after he took a combination of drugs, including cocaine and heroin. The 46-year-old was found unresponsive at his home in Bristol, and a coroner determined that the combined effect of the drugs resulted in fatal respiratory depression. Danan, known for his role in Hollyoaks and appearances on Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity Love Island, had struggled with addiction since his early 20s. The hearing was told there was no evidence that Danan had intended to take his own life.</p>

The article contrasts Trump's actions with past presidential scandals, arguing that no previous president has used the office to gain improper wealth on such a scale.
