          <p>An American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Phoenix was compelled to make an emergency diversion to Washington-Dulles airport following reports of smoke emanating from a passenger's electronic device. The flight, carrying 160 customers and six crew members, executed a safe landing, with the cabin crew effectively containing the smoking item, preventing further escalation. Emergency services were on standby upon arrival, and all passengers disembarked without any confirmed injuries or arrests. This incident, whose exact cause remains under investigation, highlights the critical role of swift and professional crew response in ensuring the safety and security of air travel, minimizing disruption to airport operations.</p>

          <p>A bus carrying the Aliquippa Junior High football team crashed in Economy Borough, Pennsylvania, leading to the hospitalization of at least 21 children and the driver. The incident occurred when the bus reportedly rounded a bend, veered off-road, struck a hillside, and then a utility pole, briefly tipping before landing upright. While most child patients admitted to UPMC Children's Hospital have been discharged, one required surgery, and two adults were also treated. The cause of the crash is still under investigation, as the community rallies with support, including a scheduled vigil.</p>

          <p>Over 50 million Americans across the Western United States are under extreme heat alerts this weekend, with record-challenging temperatures affecting major cities from Arizona to Washington. This dangerous heat wave is exacerbating fire weather concerns and fueling monsoon thunderstorms, some with dry lightning risks. Concurrently, Tropical Storm Fernand has formed in the central Atlantic, becoming the sixth named storm of the season. While Fernand is expected to strengthen and pass east of Bermuda, it is forecast to remain over open waters, though it could generate rough surf along parts of the East Coast.</p>

          <p>The governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut are challenging a Trump administration order that halted construction on the nearly complete Revolution Wind project. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cited national security concerns and a directive from Trump's second term to review existing wind energy leases. Developers Ørsted, with 45 of 65 turbines installed, are evaluating financial impacts and considering legal action. Critics link the decision to alleged political favors for the oil industry, jeopardizing state climate goals and raising questions about energy policy shifts.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Tamil Nadu, India, in collaboration with the UK's Face Lab, have digitally reconstructed the faces of two 2,500-year-old skulls found at an ancient burial site. These reconstructions offer insights into the early inhabitants of the Keeladi civilization, revealing features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries. The findings challenge traditional narratives of Indian urbanization, suggesting an independent ancient civilization existed in southern India and highlighting the region's diverse ancestral migration routes.</p>

          <p>Brothers Erik and Lyle Menendez were denied parole after separate hearings, marking their first opportunity for release since their 1989 murder convictions. The proceedings were significantly disrupted by the unexpected, inadvertent release of an audio recording from Erik's Thursday hearing, which a TV station published. This disclosure led to anger and accusations of a "spectacle" from the brothers' legal team and relatives, who argued it jeopardized the fairness of Lyle's Friday hearing. Despite the controversy, the parole board rendered its decision, with both brothers becoming eligible for parole again in three years.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new sentencing reforms allowing courts to impose non-custodial penalties such as bans from pubs, concerts, sports matches, and travel restrictions. These changes aim to toughen community punishments and deter reoffending, aligning with recommendations for fewer custodial sentences for minor offenses to address prison overcrowding. Offenders released on probation could also face similar restrictions and increased mandatory drug testing, as part of a broader strategy to cut crime and ensure prison space for dangerous individuals.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from denying federal funding to Los Angeles and 30 other "sanctuary" cities and counties.

Mayor Karen Bass praised the decision, while the White House vowed to appeal.
