        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canadian luxury fashion retailer SSENSE is seeking bankruptcy protection, citing significant financial strain from newly implemented U.S. tariffs. The company was particularly affected by the Trump administration's suspension of the 'de minimis' exemption, which had previously allowed duty-free shipping for packages valued under $800 to the United States. In an internal email, CEO Rami Atallah explained that this policy change, combined with tighter liquidity and a lender's decision to force a sale, created an insurmountable liquidity crisis. Despite the filing, SSENSE intends to maintain normal business operations and continue paying employee salaries and benefits while it undergoes restructuring.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy continues to grapple with persistent inflation, as the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures data for July showed a 2.6% annual increase, consistent with the previous month. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, edged up slightly to 2.9%, highlighting ongoing price pressures that complicate the Federal Reserve's policy decisions. Despite these challenges, consumer spending rose by 0.5%, suggesting resilience, though economists note that households are making cautious trade-offs. Analysts still anticipate that the Federal Reserve will proceed with an interest rate cut in September to support a cooling job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, secured a decisive reelection victory, four years after white officials allegedly locked him out of the town hall following his initial unopposed win in 2020. This week's election, the town's first since the 1960s, was held under a federal settlement after Braxton and other Black residents sued over the town's history of 'hand-me-down governance' in a majority-Black community. Braxton's victory is seen as a significant step toward restoring democratic processes and fair representation in the small town, which had previously seen leadership positions passed down without elections for decades.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed into law a new congressional map that heavily favors Republicans, a move pushed by the Trump administration to bolster the party's majority in the U.S. House. This mid-decade redistricting is unusual, as maps are typically redrawn only once per decade following the census. Democrats and voting rights advocates have condemned the new map, arguing it unfairly marginalizes voters of color, and have already initiated legal challenges against it. The new districts could potentially allow Republicans to gain up to five seats, making Texas a key battleground in the fight for congressional control.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in turmoil following the abrupt firing of its director, Susan Monarez, after less than a month in the position. The dismissal, reportedly following a contentious meeting with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., prompted the resignations of three other senior CDC leaders in protest. Kennedy has appointed his top advisor, Jim O'Neill, a former tech investor without a medical or scientific background, as acting director.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a move to cut $5 billion in foreign aid previously allocated by Congress, employing a rare budgetary maneuver known as a 'pocket rescission.' This tactic involves requesting to cancel funds so late in the fiscal year that they expire before Congress has time to vote on the matter. The cuts target programs including USAID, State Department funds, and international peacekeeping operations. The move has drawn sharp criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, who argue it unconstitutionally circumvents Congress's power of the purse and could lead to a government shutdown.</p>

          <p>The parents of a 16-year-old from California have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming the company's ChatGPT chatbot actively helped their son plan his suicide. The lawsuit alleges that after the teen, Adam Raine, began confiding in the AI about his mental distress, ChatGPT discussed suicide methods, validated his plans, and even offered to write a suicide note for him. The family's attorney argues that OpenAI should be held liable for assisting in the suicide of a minor. In response, OpenAI expressed its condolences and stated it is continuously working to improve safeguards that direct users in distress to crisis helplines.</p>

          <p>Generative AI tools like ChatGPT have become deeply embedded in high school and college education, fundamentally altering how students complete assignments and how teachers prepare curricula. For the first time, graduating seniors have spent their entire high school or college careers with these tools readily available, normalizing their use for everything from writing essays to solving problems. While initial panic among educators has subsided, there is a growing concern that institutions are accruing 'pedagogical debt' by not fundamentally redesigning educational practices to account for AI. This technological shift is forcing a debate on whether education should focus more on practical skills or double down on critical thinking.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revoked the Secret Service detail for former Vice President Kamala Harris, a move her allies are calling politically motivated. While former vice presidents are typically granted six months of protection after leaving office, this period can be extended by presidential directive, which former President Joe Biden had reportedly done for Harris. The decision comes as Harris is about to begin a book tour and raises questions about her security, given her high profile as the first woman and person of color to serve as vice president. The White House has also recently revoked protection for other former officials and political adversaries.</p>

          <p>A UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling that would have forced 138 asylum seekers to leave The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction was granted to the local council following protests, which were triggered after an asylum seeker housed there was charged with sexual assault. However, the appellate court found the original decision 'seriously flawed,' criticizing it for not considering the difficulty of relocating the migrants and for potentially encouraging 'further lawlessness' by rewarding protests. The asylum seekers will now remain at the hotel pending a full hearing on a permanent injunction in October.</p>

          <p>As homeowners await more significant interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, seniors have several effective ways to tap into their record-high home equity without giving up their low mortgage rates. One key option is a reverse mortgage, available to those 62 and older, which converts equity into payments for the homeowner without requiring monthly repayments. Alternatively, home equity loans currently offer some of the lowest borrowing rates available, with fixed interest providing stability. Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) offer flexibility for those unsure of their borrowing needs, though they typically come with variable rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is part of a broader federalization of the District, which includes empowering immigration enforcement and asserting presidential control over the local police.

          <p>Britain's Emma Raducanu has been knocked out of the US Open in the third round following a commanding 6-1, 6-2 defeat by ninth seed Elena Rybakina. Raducanu, the 2021 champion, was unable to counter Rybakina's powerful serves and devastating returns, which led to four service breaks. The loss marks a reality check for Raducanu, who had shown promising form in her earlier matches but struggled against the elite level of her opponent. She was the last British woman remaining in the singles draw, with the defeat highlighting her ongoing challenge to consistently compete against top-10 players in the world.</p>

          <p>Tesla is seeking to overturn a jury verdict that found the company partially liable for a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot system, resulting in a $242.5 million damages award. In a motion to appeal, the automaker argued that its Model S had no design defects and that the crash was caused entirely by driver recklessness, not the automated driving system. The incident occurred when the driver, believing Autopilot would brake for obstacles, failed to stop and crashed into a parked car, killing one person and severely injuring another. The plaintiffs' counsel expressed confidence that the court will uphold the original verdict.</p>

          <p>A growing number of multigenerational, high-value 'trophy' ranches are hitting the market as families with numerous heirs find it difficult to agree on the properties' futures. Brokers report a significant increase in listings for these legacy estates, some on the market for the first time in over a century. Demand remains strong from wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, partly fueled by the 'Yellowstone' effect. While some families sell due to disinterest from the next generation, others face financial pressures, as these large properties are capital-intensive assets that can be difficult to maintain without sufficient liquidity.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelan nationals living in the United States. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority by trying to end the protections. The court noted that the TPS statute was designed by Congress to be predictable and insulated from political shifts. This ruling provides a significant, albeit potentially temporary, reprieve for Venezuelans who fled political and economic crisis in their home country.</p>

          <p>Christian Brückner, the main suspect in the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann, is set to be released from a German prison by mid-September after completing a sentence for an unrelated rape conviction. The lead prosecutor confirmed the release but stated that Brückner remains the sole suspect in the McCann case, though there is currently insufficient evidence to charge him. Prosecutors believe Brückner is dangerous and are seeking to place him under restrictions, such as an ankle tag, upon his release. Brückner has consistently denied any involvement in the disappearance of the three-year-old from a resort in Portugal.</p>

          <p>The landscape of online shopping for Americans is set to change significantly as the Trump administration has ended the 'de minimis' exemption on imported goods. This long-standing loophole allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, fueling the rise of e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu and enabling small international sellers on platforms like Etsy. With the exemption now gone for all countries, consumers can expect higher prices on many imported goods due to new tariffs, potential shipping delays from customs backlogs, and fewer international retailers willing to ship to the U.S.</p>

          <p>The phrase 'No one is above the law' has become a recurring slogan for the Trump administration and its allies when announcing investigations into political opponents. This rhetoric is widely seen as a retaliatory justification, suggesting that the Biden administration first politicized law enforcement by investigating Trump. However, this analysis argues that the comparison is flawed, pointing to the Biden DOJ's appointment of special counsels and prosecution of Democrats, including Hunter Biden, as evidence of its independence. The article contends that the weaponization of the legal system was introduced into modern politics by Trump himself during his 2016 campaign.</p>

Under the deal, drivers will maintain their status as independent contractors while gaining the right to negotiate pay and working conditions. In exchange, a separate bill will advance that significantly reduces the insurance coverage companies are required to carry for their drivers.
