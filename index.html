          <h2>New Law Overhauls Student Loan System, Potentially Increasing Costs for Borrowers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 12:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law signed by President Trump significantly alters the U.S. student loan system, a move that experts warn could make higher education more expensive and less accessible. The legislation consolidates repayment plans, eliminating options like the SAVE plan and potentially raising monthly payments for lower-income borrowers under the new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). It also introduces new borrowing caps for graduate and professional degrees, which may not cover the full cost of programs like medical or law school, possibly worsening shortages in critical fields.

          <p>In a private meeting with campaign donors, former President Trump reportedly claimed he had threatened to "bomb the s--- out of Moscow" to deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to audio obtained by CNN, Trump also recounted making a similar threat to Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding Taiwan, though he noted Xi "thought I was crazy." The alleged threats, made while he was out of office, underscore his candid and aggressive rhetoric behind closed doors. A White House spokeswoman responded by stating that Russia did not invade Ukraine during his presidency.</p>

          <p>The United States has confirmed 1,288 measles cases this year, marking the worst outbreak since 1992 and surpassing the significant total from 2019. According to the CDC, the majority of these infections are linked to a large outbreak in West Texas, which resulted in the deaths of two children. Health experts attribute the resurgence of the nearly-eliminated virus to declining MMR vaccination rates, which have fallen below the 95% threshold required for herd immunity. The highly contagious virus spreads through the air and can lead to severe complications.</p>

          <p>Tim Leiweke, the CEO of Oak View Group, faces a federal criminal conspiracy charge for his alleged involvement in a bid-rigging scheme for a University of Texas arena project. The indictment accuses Leiweke of conspiring to eliminate a competitor from the bidding process by promising them lucrative sub-contracts, a promise he later allegedly broke. As part of the broader case, the Department of Justice is expected to announce non-prosecution agreements with Oak View Group and Legends Hospitality.

The primary driver for the active forecast is warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures, though there is still uncertainty regarding the El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycle.

However, agricultural experts and economists have long warned that such measures are not realistic substitutes for the immigrant workforce that underpins American farming.

Speculation on potential successors ranges from his son Mojtaba to past reformist presidents, but the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps may also seek to influence the outcome.

          <p>In a podcast discussion, attorney and Trump critic George Conway argues that the American legal system is structurally ill-equipped to save democracy from a president determined to ignore the law. Conway explains that while courts have pushed back, they ultimately rely on the executive branch to enforce their orders, creating a paradox when the executive itself is the problem. He asserts that the true constitutional remedy for a lawless president is impeachment and removal, but this has failed due to political loyalties in Congress, leaving the nation's core principles vulnerable.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is conducting a two-day tour of South Carolina, meeting with Democratic voters and leaders in what is widely seen as early groundwork for a potential 2028 presidential campaign. While Newsom has not commented directly on a future run, he is using the visit to urge local Democrats to be more assertive against the Trump administration and focus on the 2026 midterms. His trip to the pivotal early primary state has drawn praise from local Democrats like Congressman Jim Clyburn and criticism from South Carolina Republicans, who reject his "twisted version of America."</p>

          <p>Dzaleka, Malawi's largest refugee camp, is facing a severe crisis as a major funding shortfall has forced the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) to drastically scale down its operations. The camp, which houses over 56,000 people, is now seeing layoffs of essential staff and a halt to community programs, leaving refugees with inadequate access to basic services like healthcare. With the UNHCR having received only 12% of its required budget, concerns are growing for the welfare of the camp's residents, particularly women and children. The situation has prompted discussions of repatriation, which rights advocates fear could be forced.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Nvidia's market capitalization exceeded $4 trillion for the first time, making it the first company ever to reach this milestone. The stock's surge is fueled by immense investor demand for its hardware, which is critical to the booming generative artificial intelligence industry. Nvidia has established itself as the dominant producer of the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power large language models. The company's value has soared past that of Microsoft and Apple, and its shares have risen more than fifteenfold over the past five years despite geopolitical tensions and chip curbs impacting sales to China.</p>

          <p>Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who served as former President Joe Biden's White House physician, declined to answer questions during a closed-door deposition before the House Oversight Committee. His attorneys stated he was asserting his rights under the Fifth Amendment and doctor-patient privilege. The Republican-led committee is investigating Biden's health and mental acuity, an inquiry that has intensified following his withdrawal from the 2024 race and a separate investigation ordered by President Trump. The committee chairman called the move unprecedented and suggested it was part of a cover-up, while Democrats defended the doctor's decision.</p>

          <p>Russia launched its largest air assault of the war, firing nearly 750 drones and missiles at western Ukraine, though Kyiv reported that its air defenses intercepted most of them. The attack prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to call for more "biting" sanctions against Moscow's energy sector. In a separate development, the European Court of Human Rights found Russia guilty of widespread human rights abuses in Ukraine, including the abduction of children and the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.

          <p>A budget debate in Germany's Bundestag turned contentious, with sharp personal attacks dominating the session. Alice Weidel, leader of the far-right AfD party, called Chancellor Friedrich Merz a "lying chancellor" and accused his government of electoral fraud and pursuing left-wing policies, particularly on migration. In response, the Bundestag President called for a more measured tone. The debate highlighted deep divisions within the new coalition government, with representatives from the SPD, Greens, and Left Party also criticizing the government's policies on social welfare, defense spending, and climate protection.</p>

          <p>The White House invitation to leaders from five African nations—Senegal, Mauritania, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, and Liberia—signals a strategic policy shift under President Trump. Analysts suggest the focus is moving from development aid to transactional diplomacy centered on security, migration, and access to strategic resources like minerals and oil. The U.S. is reportedly concerned about the spread of Islamist insurgencies and migration routes, while also competing with China and Russia for influence. The meetings are expected to be based on a "give and take" approach, reflecting the administration's "America First" agenda.</p>

Trump is expected to travel to his golf resort in Aberdeenshire to open a new course. The visit would be his first to Scotland since his election victory and follows a 2018 trip that drew major protests. While a full state visit to the UK is anticipated for September, this trip is focused on his private business interests, with the Scottish government working to support police preparations for the event.</p>

          <p>Carlo Ancelotti, the current manager of the Brazilian national team, has been handed a one-year prison sentence by a Spanish court for tax evasion, though he will not serve jail time. The former Real Madrid coach was found guilty of failing to pay approximately €1 million in taxes on his salary between 2013 and 2015. Under Spanish law, non-violent sentences under two years are typically suspended for first-time offenders. Ancelotti, who has since paid back the debt, will be required to pay a fine of over €386,000.</p>
