            <p>Auto workers in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, are bracing for the impact of new U.S. tariffs on foreign-made vehicles, which have created anxiety and fear in the region. Windsor, a major automotive hub, is heavily reliant on the industry, and workers worry about potential job losses and economic recession. The tariffs, viewed as a 'stab in the back' by Canada's closest ally, could disrupt the deeply integrated North American auto supply chain. Canadian political parties are proposing plans to support the sector, but the future remains uncertain for the thousands of workers and their families. Optimism score: 40 (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Amidst renewed interest in acquiring Greenland for its untapped natural resources, a Greenlandic geologist warns that the prospect of a mineral bonanza is a mirage. Minik Rosing argues that assumptions about quickly getting rich from Greenland's resources are based on a lack of knowledge about geology and mining. He asserts that rare earth elements are not particularly concentrated in Greenland and are easier to obtain elsewhere. Rosing suggests that the focus should be on developing facilities for processing raw materials and fostering a competitive market to reduce reliance on China, rather than acquiring more territory.

            <p>The Trump administration is considering new semiconductor tariffs after recently lifting reciprocal tariffs on certain electronics. President Trump and Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett have stated that semiconductors are crucial for national security and that the administration is launching an investigation into the industry. The move comes days after the U.S. Customs and Border Protection lifted reciprocal tariffs on certain electronics, including smartphones and computers. China is America's top source of electronic products, followed by Mexico, Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia. Optimism score: 40 (not investment advice)</p>

Provisional Home Office figures indicate that over 8,000 people have crossed in 2025 so far, surpassing previous records. The government has announced a series of measures to tackle people smuggling, including a new criminal offence of endangering lives at sea. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp described the figures as a "national disgrace," while a Labour spokesperson pointed to similar figures during Philp's time as immigration minister.

            <p>Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese studies, suggests that the Trump administration's approach to trade negotiations may have surprised China. Brown believes that Trump's lack of caution and understanding of how China negotiates is a misstep. He argues that threatening and presenting China with zero-sum options is likely to make China stand its ground even more, given its strong narrative of resisting victimization. China, according to Brown, has been preparing for this scenario by diversifying its markets and addressing its technology deficit with the U.S. Optimism score: 50 (not investment advice)</p>
