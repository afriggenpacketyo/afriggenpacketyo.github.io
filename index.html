          <p>Jeannie Seely, the Grammy-winning country singer known as "Miss Country Soul," has passed away at the age of 85 due to complications from an infection. A trailblazer in country music, she was celebrated for her hit "Don't Touch Me" and for challenging conventions, such as wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage. Seely remained a beloved and active member of the country music community, hosting a SiriusXM show and performing nearly 5,400 times at the Opry, where she had been a member since 1967. Colleagues like Dolly Parton remembered her as a dear friend and one of Nashville's greatest singers.</p>

          <p>President Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, following a jobs report that was weaker than expected and included significant downward revisions for previous months. Trump alleged the data was manipulated for political reasons, a move that sparked alarm among economists about the potential for White House interference with federal data. The decision coincided with a global stock market decline attributed to Trump's plans for widespread tariff hikes. Experts defended the integrity of the agency's data, warning that questioning its credibility could create significant economic problems.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has scheduled a major case for its next term to determine if Louisiana's creation of a second majority-Black congressional district constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The court has requested briefs on whether the new map violates the 14th or 15th Amendments, setting the stage for a ruling that could significantly impact the Voting Rights Act and future redistricting efforts nationwide. The case stems from a yearslong legal battle over Louisiana's congressional map, which was redrawn following the 2020 Census. The decision will likely have major implications for the balance of power in the House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>A tractor-trailer crash on Interstate 83 in Pennsylvania resulted in a massive spill of hot dogs, causing significant traffic delays. The incident occurred when the truck experienced mechanical issues and struck another vehicle, tearing open the trailer and scattering its contents across the roadway. Four individuals were treated for non-life-threatening injuries sustained in the collision. First responders worked to clear the unusual and slippery debris, with the local fire chief noting that he learned hot dogs are surprisingly slick when spilled on pavement.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Link Increased Flooding in Northern China to Solar Cycle Activity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 22:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have attributed the decadal pattern of increased summer rainfall and flooding in northern China to the solar magnetic cycle. A study published in the Journal of Climate suggests that changes in solar activity influence the positioning of the monsoon rain belt, leading to a climate pattern of "south drought and north flooding."

          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was expected to attend a $25 million fundraiser for a pro-Trump super PAC, just one day after President Trump publicly demanded that pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, lower their drug prices. Trump sent letters to 17 drug company CEOs, urging them to match the lower prices paid in other countries for Medicaid patients and new drugs. The president has made reducing prescription drug costs a key issue, while pharmaceutical companies argue that price controls could stifle innovation. This event highlights the complex relationship between the administration and the drug industry.</p>

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board hearing revealed critical details about the January mid-air collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a regional jet that killed 67 people near Washington, D.C. Investigators found the helicopter's altimeter may have been off by as much as 80 feet, a discrepancy the Army considered within tolerance. The hearing also highlighted that air traffic controllers at the busy airport were under pressure to "make it work," and that the FAA had previously been warned about the risks of the helicopter's flight path but did not act. These findings point to significant systemic safety issues.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are reporting a significant increase in stingray-related injuries, rising from one to as many as 15 per day. Officials attribute the spike to calm, warm waters and low surf, which draw stingrays closer to the shore where more people are swimming. The area known as "ray bay" is a particular hotspot due to warm water discharged from a nearby power plant. To avoid stings, beachgoers are advised to shuffle their feet in the sand to alert the camouflaged fish. If stung, soaking the wound in hot water is recommended to break down the venom.</p>

          <p>A CBS News review of the Environmental Protection Agency's own regulatory analysis reveals that the Trump administration's plan to roll back greenhouse gas emission standards would likely lead to higher gasoline prices and nearly half a million job losses by 2035. This contradicts the administration's public claims that the deregulation would save Americans money. The analysis, citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, shows that disincentivizing electric and fuel-efficient vehicles will increase demand for gasoline, thereby driving up its cost for all consumers. The rollback would also lower future fuel efficiency standards for new vehicles.</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order to increase tariffs on imports is expected to raise consumer prices and extend economic uncertainty for businesses, according to trade experts. With a new baseline tariff of at least 15% for most countries, the average U.S. tariff rate has risen to its highest level in decades, potentially costing the average American family over $2,000 annually. Economists warn that prices for everyday goods like appliances, clothing, and cars are likely to increase as companies can no longer absorb the costs. The lack of clear implementation details is also creating a challenging environment for businesses to navigate.</p>

The attacks came after the Fed held rates steady and coincided with a weak jobs report, which Trump used to amplify his case for lower rates.

Palestinian officials see it as a serious move toward a two-state solution and a correction of historical injustices, while Israeli leaders condemn it as a reward for terrorism. For many Palestinians living under occupation and facing settler violence, the declaration feels disconnected from their daily struggles. As one resident noted, while the support is welcome, it may be too late to change the facts Israel has established on the ground.</p>

          <p>All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons has formally requested a trade from the Dallas Cowboys, expressing his frustration with contract negotiations in a public social media post. Parsons, who is seeking a long-term extension, stated he no longer wants to play for the team, citing a lack of direct negotiations with his agent and what he perceives as negative narratives being spread about him. The 26-year-old superstar has been a dominant force for the Cowboys but is now seeking a contract that would place him among the NFL's highest-paid defensive players.</p>

          <p>A North Korean defector has provided a rare look into a clandestine scheme where the regime sends thousands of IT workers abroad to earn foreign currency by using fake identities. The defector, identified as Jin-su, explained how he used fraudulent IDs to secure remote work with Western companies, earning thousands of dollars a month, with 85% of his income sent back to North Korea. This operation, which generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually for the sanctioned nation, boomed during the pandemic. The workers are closely monitored and operate under oppressive conditions.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia is suing the Trump administration, alleging it is conducting an "unconstitutional pressure campaign" to stop hospitals from providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth. The lawsuit argues the administration is using threats of criminal prosecution and demands for patient data to create a de facto national ban on such care, even without a federal law. This legal pressure has led several prominent children's hospitals to close their gender clinics, creating an atmosphere of fear and forcing families to travel farther for necessary medical services.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has found Tesla partially responsible for a 2019 crash that killed a pedestrian and severely injured another while a Model S was using its Autopilot software. The company was ordered to pay up to $243 million in damages after plaintiffs argued the driver-assistance system should have alerted the driver and applied the brakes. Tesla, which maintained the driver was solely at fault for being distracted, called the verdict "wrong" and plans to appeal. The case marks a significant legal setback for the company and its self-driving technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has issued a ruling that significantly narrows the scope for millions of motorists to claim compensation for mis-sold car finance deals. The court did not uphold a finding that hidden commission payments were inherently unlawful, closing off a major avenue for mass claims. However, the judgment still allows for individual claims based on unfairness, particularly where large, undisclosed commissions were paid to dealers. While a win for one of the claimants in the case, the decision greatly reduces the potential multi-billion-pound liability that lenders were facing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner is part of a broader, long-standing effort to reject objective data that contradicts his preferred narrative. The author posits that Trump treats economic numbers, like his personal statistics, as things to be manipulated or discarded if they are not sufficiently loyal or flattering. By attacking the integrity of federal data, the administration risks creating an environment where policy is based on "vibes and misinformation" rather than facts. This could leave policymakers and the public unable to understand or address real economic challenges.</p>

Manager Dave Roberts expressed confidence that the additions will "raise the floor" for the first-place team. Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage reliever, while Call provides a versatile right-handed bat for the outfield. The front office hopes these moves, combined with improved performance from their existing stars, will position the team for a deep playoff run.</p>

Psychotherapist Gillie Jenkinson, a former cult member herself, highlights tactics like "love bombing" and providing simple answers to complex life problems as red flags. Cults are not always religious and can be built around any ideology that fosters an "us-versus-them" mentality and a high barrier to exit. Survivors and advocates are calling for greater mental health support for those who leave these coercive groups and for legal changes to address coercive control in group settings.</p>

          <p>TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, disclosed at an internal meeting that the median service length for its current 120,000 employees is 2.9 years. This figure was shared by CEO Liang Rubo to counter online speculation that the company had a much higher turnover rate. The data suggests that ByteDance is a relatively attractive employer within China's competitive tech industry, which is known for its demanding work culture. The company notably abandoned the infamous "996" work schedule in 2021 in favor of a more standard five-day work week.</p>
