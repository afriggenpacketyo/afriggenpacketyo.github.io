          <p>Bubba Wallace made history by becoming the first Black driver to win a NASCAR Cup Series race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. His victory in the Brickyard 400 on Sunday marked his third career win and snapped a 100-race winless streak. Wallace had to endure a late rain delay and two overtime restarts, holding off a charging Kyle Larson to secure the win. The triumph is a significant achievement for Wallace and the 23XI Racing team, co-owned by Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the celebrated American musician, satirist, and Harvard-trained mathematician, has passed away at the age of 97. Known for his darkly humorous and politically charged songs in the 1950s and 60s, he gained a cult following with tracks like "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park" and "The Elements." Despite his popularity and influence on later comedians, Lehrer largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to teach mathematics. In 2020, he famously placed all of his work into the public domain, relinquishing all copyrights.</p>

          <p>The New York Yankees have placed star slugger Aaron Judge on the 10-day injured list due to a right flexor strain. An MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament, calming fears that he might require Tommy John surgery and a much longer recovery period. Judge, who received a platelet-rich plasma injection, could return to the lineup in as little as 10 to 14 days. The team is hopeful for a swift return, as Judge was having another MVP-caliber season, leading the majors in several offensive categories.</p>

          <p>White House budget director Russell Vought clarified that President Trump's recent pressure on the Federal Reserve is driven by a desire for lower interest rates, rather than a direct implementation of Project 2025's proposals. In an interview, Vought distanced the President's actions from the conservative blueprint's chapter on overhauling the Fed, stating he was unfamiliar with its specific contents. He emphasized that the administration's focus is on what it views as fiscal mismanagement at the Fed and the need to lower rates to align with global trends, not on an existential challenge to the institution's structure.

          <p>A 42-year-old man is facing terrorism and assault charges following a mass stabbing at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, that injured eleven people.

Authorities stated that the terrorism charge is being pursued because the act was intended to instill fear in the community. All victims, who range in age from 21 to 84, are expected to survive, with their conditions improving at a local medical center.</p>

          <p>Jordan and the UAE have resumed aid airdrops into Gaza during a "tactical pause" in fighting announced by Israel, but the World Health Organization warns that malnutrition has reached alarming levels.

          <p>Despite the historic victory of England's women's football team at Euro 2025, Downing Street has indicated there are no plans to announce an extra bank holiday to celebrate. The decision aligns with the precedent set after the Lionesses' 2022 win and the men's 1966 World Cup victory. While a homecoming parade with an open-top bus tour is scheduled in London, the government appears to be foregoing a national day off, likely considering the economic cost. This comes despite previous suggestions from Prime Minister Keir Starmer that such a victory should be marked with a national celebration.</p>

While Pogačar's overall victory was never in doubt on the final day, the new course element added a different challenge for the sprinters.

          <p>Despite outcry from some prominent right-wing figures, many of Donald Trump's supporters in middle America appear unfazed by the controversy surrounding the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Interviews conducted in several states reveal that while some voters are concerned, many others remain loyal, prioritizing issues like the economy and border security. These supporters often express distrust in the media's coverage and believe the president is being held to a different standard. This nuanced reaction suggests the issue may not be as damaging to Trump's core base as some political observers have predicted.</p>
