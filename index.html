          <p>Young Chinese entrepreneurs are increasingly relocating to Southeast Asian nations, such as Malaysia, in pursuit of more accessible venture capital opportunities compared to their homeland. This article highlights the story of Kent Cai, who chose Malaysia for his PhD, believing it would significantly boost his chances of attracting investors' attention. This growing trend signifies a notable strategic shift among ambitious individuals, moving away from traditional Western destinations like the United States or Europe. They aim to leverage Southeast Asia's burgeoning and dynamic economic landscape, which is perceived as offering a more fertile and less competitive environment for startup growth and innovation. This movement presents new avenues for wealth creation and career development for a generation seeking new frontiers.</p>

          <p>As China rapidly advances its military capabilities, significantly narrowing the gap with the United States, a new front has emerged in the global security race: economic warfare. This article explains that while the PLA showcases impressive hardware, Washington is strategically leveraging its commanding lead in technology and its position as the world's largest consumer market. The US is creating powerful economic choke points to weaken potential rivals, effectively utilizing its "exorbitant privilege" within the global financial system. This strategic shift underscores the increasing importance of economic weapons as a primary tool in geopolitical competition, aiming to maintain American dominance by controlling crucial global supply chains and financial flows.</p>

Beyond this, investors are closely monitoring developments in India-China relations, following an agreement between leaders to act as development partners during a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting.

This article details how this policy prevents Palestinians from traveling to the US for essential purposes like medical treatment, attending college, and business, according to unidentified officials. The State Department confirmed halting visitor visas for Gaza residents for a review and also denied or revoked visas from members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and Palestinian Authority ahead of a UN assembly meeting.

Justice Sparkle Sooknanan's temporary restraining order provides 14 days for further discussion and prevents any children from being removed during this period.

          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha, fueled by its superfood reputation and social media popularity, has led to significant supply shortages and soaring prices in Japan. This article details how Japanese tea producers and cafe owners, like Chitose Nagao, are struggling to meet the unprecedented demand, with exports quadrupling in a decade. The Japanese government is considering subsidizing farmers to increase tencha production, the labor-intensive tea used for matcha, to address the strain on aging farming communities. However, a lack of hands for harvesting and processing, coupled with a delicate milling process, creates bottlenecks. This intense competition and potential future heatwaves threaten next year's harvest, further pushing prices higher and leading to rationing by retailers.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles have achieved a historic "three-peat" in 'The Hundred' cricket tournament, dominating for three consecutive years with their consistent performance. This article attributes their success to expert team building by coach Tom Moody and maintaining a core group of players who deeply understand their specific roles. Their strategy includes a varied bowling attack, featuring prominent leg-spin and left-arm seamers, and an explosive batting approach in the late innings, leading to a 78% win rate. However, the article also discusses the looming uncertainty for the team's future, as new investment and potential format changes for 2026, possibly transitioning to T20, could lead to a significant squad overhaul, potentially ending this remarkable era of dominance.</p>

          <p>China's navy is expanding at an extraordinary pace, now boasting the world's largest fleet by number of warships and significantly outpacing the U.S. in shipbuilding capacity. This article explores Beijing's ambition to "rule the waves," fueled by its economic growth and a desire to overcome historical humiliations, as evidenced by President Xi Jinping's emphasis on a strong navy. While the U.S. Navy still holds advantages in overall tonnage and technological sophistication, China is rapidly catching up, investing heavily in naval bases and advanced technologies like unmanned underwater drones. This rapid buildup raises concerns among neighbors and allies about China's increasing assertiveness in regions like the South China Sea, despite assurances from Chinese experts of peaceful intentions.</p>

Intense gunfire was reported south of Hebron, and settler attacks on Palestinian homes in Kisan village also led to injuries and looting, reportedly under Israeli army protection. The Palestinian Authority condemned unauthorized excavation and demolition operations at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem, alleging deliberate attempts to erase Muslim history and build a Jewish temple.

          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has emphatically stated that captain Marc Guehi must remain at the club for them to achieve a successful season, despite an improved £35 million bid from Liverpool. This article reports on Glasner's firm stance, emphasizing Guehi's crucial role as captain and the impossibility of finding a suitable replacement before the transfer window closes on Monday. Guehi, 25, who recently scored in a 3-0 victory against Aston Villa, has only one year left on his contract. The manager and chairman have a clear agreement that a sale would only occur if the right replacement was already secured, a condition that has not been met, underscoring the player's importance to the team.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck southeastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border late Sunday, with its epicenter located 22 miles north of Bāsawul and a depth of 6.2 miles. This article reports that the quake resulted in 15 people being injured and transported to a local hospital for treatment. A second, smaller quake of magnitude 4.5 followed approximately 20 minutes later in the same province. Afghanistan is highly susceptible to seismic activity due to its location near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The event tragically recalls a deadly 6.3 magnitude earthquake in October 2023 that resulted in thousands of fatalities, predominantly women and children, making it the deadliest natural disaster in recent memory.</p>

          <p>Chicago endured a violent Labor Day weekend with at least 35 people shot and 5 fatalities, including a drive-by attack that wounded seven, according to police reports. This article reports these incidents occurred amidst renewed threats from former President Donald Trump to deploy federal agents and National Guard troops to the city, despite strong objections from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson. Both officials condemned Trump's plan as an "invasion" and "unconstitutional" power-grab, with Mayor Johnson signing an executive order to legally challenge any federal overreach. The city's violent crime rates had seen significant drops in the first half of the year, with shootings down 37% and homicides by 32%, adding complexity to the political rhetoric surrounding public safety.</p>
