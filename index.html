          <p>Political leaders and Glastonbury Festival organizers have condemned UK punk duo Bob Vylan for leading chants of "death to the IDF" during their performance. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it "appalling hate speech," and the festival expressed that the statements "very much crossed a line." In response to the controversy, the BBC, which broadcast the set live with a warning, announced the performance will not be made available on its iPlayer service.

          <p>Residents in rural communities, such as Dresden, New York, are raising concerns about the negative impacts of large-scale Bitcoin mining operations. The Greenidge Generation plant, a natural gas facility that also powers a Bitcoin mine, is criticized for constant noise, discharging hot water into Seneca Lake, and significant carbon emissions. While these facilities promise jobs, locals argue the environmental and quality-of-life trade-offs are not worth the limited economic benefits.

          <p>Despite being officially outlawed by the Taliban, the ancient and brutal blood sport of cockfighting persists in the Afghan capital of Kabul. A new photo essay captures the raw intensity of these underground events, where men gather in secret to bet on fights between prized roosters. The article portrays cockfighting not just as a pastime but as a desperate gamble and a livelihood for many in a city grappling with poverty and unemployment, where fortunes can be won or lost on a single bout.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced in a television interview that he has a group of "very wealthy people" prepared to buy the social media platform TikTok. The statement comes as the deadline approaches for its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations under a 2024 law. Trump, who has extended the divestiture deadline, suggested a deal could be revealed in about two weeks but acknowledged that any sale would likely require approval from the Chinese government.</p>

          <p>A family from Cumbria has successfully won a six-month dispute with tour operator Tui, securing a full Â£3,500 refund for a 'dream' holiday to Lapland that had no snow. Despite Tui having a "no snow you don't have to go" policy, the family was initially denied a cancellation, only to find all snow-related activities were called off upon arrival due to rain. An independent adjudicator ultimately ruled in the family's favor, stating the essential purpose of their trip was defeated and ordering full compensation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has drawn criticism for his recent comments regarding potential new tariffs on Japanese automobiles. During a Fox News interview, Trump appeared to forget the name of Japan's Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, instead describing a hypothetical letter addressed to "Dear Mr. Japan" that would threaten a 25% tariff. Critics not only highlighted the gaffe but also questioned the effectiveness of such a tariff, as the majority of Japanese-brand cars sold in the U.S. are already manufactured domestically.</p>

However, the agreement has drawn sharp criticism from the National Farmers' Union, which argues that the UK agricultural sector was used as a bargaining chip, making concessions on US ethanol and beef imports to secure the automotive benefits.
