          <p>This article analyzes the interest-earning potential of placing $50,000 into either a Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account in the current economic climate. It breaks down scenarios for different time frames, showing that while CDs offer fixed, guaranteed returns, high-yield savings accounts can sometimes earn more due to their variable rates. The analysis concludes that savers must weigh the stability of CDs against the potentially higher but more volatile returns of savings accounts, especially with potential interest rate cuts on the horizon.

          <p>England is currently facing its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures exceeding 30°C in several regions, officially meeting heatwave criteria. This prolonged period of dry, warm weather has led to significant water shortages, impacting agriculture, wildlife, and increasing wildfire risks. The national drought group has highlighted the widespread environmental effects, while rail services face disruptions and millions are under hosepipe bans, sparking criticism of water companies over infrastructure leaks. The conditions are causing widespread challenges for both the public and essential services.</p>

          <p>According to reports from Ohio labor leaders, former three-term Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown is planning to run for his old Senate seat in 2026. Brown lost his re-election bid in 2024 to Republican Bernie Moreno in a state that has been trending increasingly conservative. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has reportedly been encouraging Brown to run for the seat, which will be contested in a special election to serve out the remainder of Vice President J.D. Vance's term. The potential race sets the stage for another high-stakes political battle in the key swing state.</p>

Their bodies were found by a landowner in a rural clearing, and investigators believe they were killed elsewhere before being moved. An autopsy confirmed McAbee died from a gunshot wound, while Grissom's cause of death is pending. Police have stated the women knew each other and the incident appears to be isolated with no broader threat to the public, as the investigation continues.</p>

He survived by building a makeshift shelter, drinking pond water, and carving "HELP" on a rock, which helped a rescue helicopter locate him. Barber, who had an above-average understanding of wilderness survival, was found severely dehydrated with a leg injury but has since been released from the hospital. Rescuers noted he was lucky to be found and might not have survived another day.</p>

          <h2>US Inflation Remained Steady in July, But Underlying Data Shows Policy Impacts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 14:57:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. consumer price index for July showed a 2.7% annual increase, holding steady from the previous month as falling gas and grocery prices offset other costs. However, economists point to rising "core" inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy, as a sign of underlying price pressures. Some analysts suggest that the Trump administration's tariff and immigration policies are beginning to contribute to higher prices for certain goods and services, an effect that may become more pronounced in the coming months.

          <p>Based on the latest government inflation data, policy experts are estimating a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security beneficiaries in 2026. This projected increase, which is slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment from 2025, is intended to help benefits keep pace with rising consumer prices. The official COLA is calculated using inflation data from July, August, and September, so the final figure could change, but current trends point toward this moderate increase for retirees and other beneficiaries.

          <p>This article explores whether reverse mortgages are a safe financial option for seniors seeking to supplement their retirement income by tapping into their home equity. It explains that while most reverse mortgages are federally regulated and insured, offering protections, they are not without risks. Homeowners must continue to pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and failure to do so can lead to foreclosure. The loan's growing balance also reduces home equity over time, making it a complex decision that requires careful long-term planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has asked a judge to consider jailing former congressman Beto O'Rourke for allegedly violating a court order. The order blocked O'Rourke's political group from fundraising to support Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to prevent a Republican-led redistricting effort. Paxton's filing claims O'Rourke continued to solicit donations after the ruling and requests that he be fined and jailed until he complies. The legal and political battle centers on Republican efforts to pass a new congressional map that would heavily favor their party.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants who have crossed the English Channel in small boats has exceeded 50,000 since the Labour Party took power in the UK last summer. The milestone has drawn criticism from the opposition Conservative party, which claims the government's plan to "smash" smuggling gangs has failed. The government acknowledged the challenge and pointed to its new returns deal with France as a measure to address the issue. The news was accompanied by a report of a woman dying on a French beach while attempting to make the crossing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore rule changes that would allow 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative investments like private equity and cryptocurrencies. The move aims to give American workers access to asset classes that have the potential for high returns but also carry higher risks and less transparency than traditional stocks and bonds. While proponents say this could boost retirement savings, experts caution that adoption by employers may be slow due to concerns about complexity and costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his pressure on the Federal Reserve, threatening to allow a "major lawsuit" against Chairman Jerome Powell and demanding an immediate interest rate cut. In a social media post, Trump claimed the potential lawsuit would relate to alleged mismanagement and cost overruns on renovations at the Fed's headquarters. The president has repeatedly criticized Powell for not cutting rates more aggressively, a move he claims would save the government money. The Fed has held rates steady throughout 2025 after several cuts in 2024.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has reportedly made an unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome browser. This move comes after the U.S. Department of Justice proposed that Google divest Chrome as a remedy in the antitrust lawsuit the company recently lost. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, has investor backing for the deal, which would give it control of a critical gateway to the internet.
