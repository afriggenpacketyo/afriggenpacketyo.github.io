          <p>A growing number of Democrats are aligning with former President Trump's objective to expand the use of civil commitment, a legal process to compel homeless individuals with severe addiction and mental illness into medical care. This bipartisan consensus reflects increasing frustration over the homelessness crisis in cities like Portland, Oregon. While supporters argue for necessary intervention before situations escalate, critics raise concerns about civil liberties, the potential for long-term institutionalization, and the significant funding required for adequate facilities and support systems.</p>

          <p>The United States is falling behind other major markets like China and Europe in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, despite recent sales growth. Analysts attribute this lag to comparatively weaker government support, including the recent expiration of a $7,500 tax credit. While former President Biden pushed for increased EV adoption, former President Trump has advocated for market-driven choices, potentially further impacting investments. High tariffs on Chinese-made EVs also limit affordable options, leaving carmakers and consumers facing significant challenges in the transition.</p>

Scientists warn that much future melt is already "locked in," but limiting global warming to 1.5C could preserve half of the remaining ice.

Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a historic milestone. Curry, a former social worker and public schoolteacher from Chicago, succeeds Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, the ELCA's first woman leader. His appointment signals a significant step towards greater diversity within the predominantly white denomination, which has actively invested in congregations of color. Curry aims to foster a more connected and welcoming church, addressing challenges like declining membership and theological disputes.</p>

          <p>Thousands of individuals participated in a banned Pride march in Pecs, Hungary, defying a police prohibition on LGBTQ+ rallies. The demonstration protested Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which has restricted LGBTQ+ rights and passed a law allowing such bans under the pretext of "protecting children." European Parliament members joined in solidarity, highlighting concerns over fundamental human rights restrictions. Attendees risked fines, but the large turnout, estimated between 7,000 and 8,000, underscored strong public opposition to the government's policies.</p>

Dr. Zania Stamataki explains that students are exposed to many new viruses, and their immune systems are often compromised by factors like stress, poor diet, and lack of sleep. This "mixing pot" of infections means students can be exposed to multiple viruses, leading to prolonged symptoms or even secondary infections like bronchitis, despite their immune systems being "quite powerful."</p>
