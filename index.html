        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey from Caixin/S&P Global revealed that China's factory activity unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official government data that showed a contraction. The Caixin Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.4, driven by increased production and new orders, particularly among smaller, export-oriented firms. However, the report also highlighted challenges, including a decline in new export orders, weak employment, and an intense price war that is squeezing profit margins. This divergence from official PMI is attributed to differences in survey timing and company coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a prolonged series of votes on President Trump's major legislative package, which combines tax cuts with new spending on border security and defense. Democrats are using the "vote-a-rama" procedure to propose numerous amendments, aiming to highlight controversial aspects of the bill, such as cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. Republican leadership remains optimistic about passing the bill, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will significantly increase the national deficit, despite some internal party opposition.

          <p>Tropical Storm Flossie has strengthened into a hurricane off the southwestern coast of Mexico, while another storm, Barry, made landfall as a tropical depression on the country's eastern coast.

Panelists argued that current AI models are predominantly English-based, and nations, particularly in regions like ASEAN, should build their own systems. They highlighted open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services as key tools to democratize AI development and prevent a few large companies from dominating the technology.

State education officials have condemned the action as illegal, warning it will immediately harm students and disrupt school systems that had already budgeted for these funds.

          <p>A group of six Republican state legislators in California has sent a letter to President Trump, requesting that federal immigration raids focus on violent criminals rather than non-criminal workers. The lawmakers argue that recent sweeping enforcement actions by ICE are causing widespread fear, disrupting communities, and creating labor shortages in critical industries like construction and hospitality. While supporting the deportation of violent criminals, the letter suggests the current tactics are counterproductive to the state's economy and urges a more targeted approach.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has successfully pushed through significant housing legislation by tying it to the state budget, a move that compelled reluctant lawmakers to approve the measures. The new laws, AB 130 and SB 131, aim to accelerate housing construction by exempting many urban projects from the lengthy review process mandated by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). While proponents hail this as a transformative step to address the state's housing crisis, the strategy drew criticism for sidelining the typical legislative process and the concerns of some labor and environmental groups.</p>

          <p>The White House has asserted that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to pressure from President Trump by agreeing to rescind a proposed 3% digital services tax on large U.S. technology firms. After Trump threatened to raise tariffs and halted trade talks, Canada announced it would scrap the tax, which was set to affect companies like Amazon and Google. Canadian officials framed the decision as part of a broader negotiation, and trade talks between the two countries have since resumed. The tax was projected to generate significant revenue for Canada but was labeled a "blatant attack" by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A family in North Carolina fears that proposed cuts to Medicaid in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" could force them to ration treatments for their 6-year-old daughter, Kennedy. Kennedy has Noonan syndrome, a genetic condition requiring extensive therapy, and relies on a state Medicaid waiver program that covers over $4,000 in monthly medical costs not paid by their private insurance. State officials warn that the federal funding cuts could put this waiver program, which serves children with significant medical needs, at risk. The family's situation illustrates the potential real-world consequences of the legislation for vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Beachgoers and weather experts along the coast of northern and central Portugal were treated to a rare and spectacular meteorological sight: a "roll cloud." This unusual phenomenon, a long, tube-shaped arcus cloud, appeared in the sky on Sunday amidst a regional heatwave. Many people captured images and videos of the stunning formation as it moved across the horizon. Roll clouds are relatively uncommon and form in specific atmospheric conditions, often associated with weather fronts, making this sighting a notable event for those who witnessed it.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that a naturally occurring compound called betaine, produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, plays a key role in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine prevents inflammation and the aging of multiple organs by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This finding helps explain the molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity. The discovery could also lead to new anti-aging strategies that simulate the effects of exercise, offering insights into promoting longevity and health.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new wave of younger investors is significantly influencing the stock market by favoring companies with bold, innovative ideas over established giants. He argues these investors are rewarding companies like Robinhood and Reddit for their disruptive potential, while punishing more traditional firms that focus on stock buybacks. This has created what he calls an "idea market" or a "story-dominated market," where the narrative and growth potential of individual stocks are valued more highly than broad market indices or Federal Reserve policy. This shift in focus is credited with driving rallies in a host of newer, growth-oriented stocks. (not investment advice)</p>
