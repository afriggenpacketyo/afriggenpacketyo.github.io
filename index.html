          <h2>White House Official Says Trump 'Not Interested' in Call with Musk Amid Feud</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a senior White House official, President Donald Trump is currently "not interested" in engaging in a phone call with Tesla CEO Elon Musk to resolve their ongoing public dispute. This follows a series of escalating exchanges between the two billionaires, sparked by Musk's criticism of Trump's proposed tax bill. Trump had previously accused Musk of going "crazy" and threatened to cancel federal contracts with his companies, including SpaceX, while Musk claimed Trump couldn't have been elected without his financial support and initially threatened to decommission the Dragon spacecraft. However, Musk later reversed his decision regarding Dragon's decommissioning. Optimism score is proportional to the nature of these two individuals who seem to be constantly having a new conflict every day.</p>

          <p>Health experts are issuing a warning about the rising cases of measles in Europe and other regions, urging families traveling abroad to ensure they are up to date with their vaccinations. Measles infections in Europe have reached a 25-year high, with surges also reported in countries like Pakistan and Nigeria. The UK Health Security Agency reports an ongoing outbreak in England, with the majority of cases affecting unvaccinated children aged 10 years and under, and London accounting for nearly half of all cases. The UKHSA emphasizes that vaccination is essential to prevent the spread of this highly contagious disease, which can lead to serious complications. The tone of the article is cautious, yet emphasizes the importance of vaccination to mitigate risk.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's recent meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump was largely overshadowed by the public spat between Trump and Elon Musk. Despite the distraction, the meeting is considered a success for Merz, who is relatively new to his chancellorship. Merz's agenda included strengthening U.S.-German relations, addressing tariffs, and securing U.S. support for Ukraine, and he seemingly addressed most of these points with Trump. Merz also gifted Trump his grandfather's birth certificate, highlighting the family's connection to Germany, and emphasized Germany's commitment to increased defense spending, which are all positive notes in the discussion.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a rebound in premarket trading following a substantial $152 billion decline triggered by escalating tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The stock's initial drop was fueled by verbal exchanges between Musk and Trump, which stemmed from Musk's criticism of Trump's proposed tax bill. Analysts suggested that a potential truce between the two figures could provide relief for Tesla shares, and the premarket gains reflect some investor optimism. However, the situation remains fluid as the White House has indicated that Trump is not interested in a call with Musk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation revealed that Meta's platforms showed hundreds of ads promoting "nudify" apps, which use AI to create sexually explicit deepfakes from real people's images. Meta has since removed the ads and blocked the responsible pages, but the spread of such content remains an ongoing problem. The ads were often targeted at men and some redirected to websites that animate real people's images for sex acts. Experts are calling for cross-industry cooperation to combat the issue, citing concerns about user consent and online safety for minors. The article emphasizes the challenges of moderating AI-generated content and the need for stricter regulations.</p>

          <p>Smoke from wildfires in Canada is once again causing unhealthy air quality in parts of the United States, reminding us of the growing dangers of wildfires. Wildfire smoke contains harmful gases and particles that can lead to various health problems, including strokes, heart attacks, and asthma attacks. Climate change, increasing populations in fire-prone areas, and decades of fire suppression are contributing to the problem. The article highlights the need to address the root causes of wildfires and take precautions to protect public health.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has admitted to BBC Verify that it conducted a previously unacknowledged strike on the al-Mawasi area of southern Gaza, which reportedly killed at least one Palestinian and injured 30 others. The strike occurred on Sunday - hours after 31 Palestinians were killed in an incident near a new aid distribution center in the city of Rafah, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defense agency. The Israeli army at first said it did not fire on Palestinians near the site, but a military source later told BBC Verify that troops had fired warning shots.</p>
