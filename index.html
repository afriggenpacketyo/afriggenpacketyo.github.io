        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has reportedly concluded an investigation into Tom Homan, former President Trump's 'border czar,' regarding allegations of accepting cash in an FBI sting operation. Sources claim Homan was recorded accepting $50,000 from undercover agents posing as executives in exchange for potential help with government contracts if Trump were re-elected. The probe, which began under the Biden administration and was closed early in the Trump administration, has raised concerns about the potential politicization of the DOJ, though officials stated they found no credible evidence of wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue investigations into his political rivals, including former FBI Director James Comey and other Democratic figures. In a social media post, Trump expressed frustration over a perceived lack of action, stating delays are harming the country's reputation and credibility. This direct pressure on the Justice Department has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who argue that such actions undermine the department's independence and resemble the tactics of authoritarian regimes. The president's comments follow his repeated campaign promises to seek retribution against his perceived enemies.</p>

          <p>A man has been arrested following a shooting at a country club in Nashua, New Hampshire, that left one person dead and two others wounded. The incident occurred on Saturday while a wedding was taking place in an adjacent room. Witnesses reported that the suspect shouted "free Palestine" before opening fire, though authorities have not yet determined a motive and stated there is no known connection between the suspect and the deceased victim, Robert Steven DeCesare. The 23-year-old suspect was subdued by attendees at the scene and now faces a charge of second-degree murder, with additional charges expected.</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, who served as the National Economic Council director during the first Trump administration, has stated that the U.S. job market is showing signs of degradation, a view he says is shared by the Federal Reserve. Speaking on Sunday, the IBM vice chair pointed to recent data showing a significant slowdown in job creation, from over 100,000 to under 50,000 jobs per month. He attributes this cooling to companies aggressively managing labor costs in response to rising input costs and their inability to pass price increases to consumers. This analysis comes as the Fed recently cut interest rates, partly in response to the cooling labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

President Donald Trump, who called Kirk "a great man," is scheduled to speak at the event, along with other high-profile conservative figures. The Department of Homeland Security has designated the memorial as a top-level security event, equivalent to the Super Bowl.

          <p>President Trump appeared to dismiss the severity of new Pentagon restrictions that require journalists to pledge not to report on unauthorized information. When asked about the directive, Trump stated, "No, I don't think so," when questioned if the Pentagon should control reporting, adding that "nothing stops reporters." The new rules, issued by the recently rebranded Department of War, have been condemned by press freedom advocates as a direct assault on independent journalism. The policy shift under Secretary Pete Hegseth also limits reporters' physical access within the Pentagon, a move that has been criticized as an attempt to control the flow of information.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strongly condemned the United Kingdom's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, labeling it an "absurd prize for terrorism." He argued that such a move rewards Hamas for its October 7th attack and will be interpreted by Palestinians as a direct result of that violence. The Israeli government has vowed to fight against what it calls slanderous propaganda and the push for a Palestinian state that it believes endangers Israel's existence. The recognition has deepened political divides within Israel, with opposition figures blaming Netanyahu's policies for the country's growing international isolation.</p>

While many pedestrians welcomed the car-free environment, the proposal has faced criticism over concerns about accessibility for people with mobility issues and the potential for traffic congestion on smaller side streets.

          <p>Nēv Schulman, the host of MTV's "Catfish: The TV Show," has embarked on a new career as a licensed real estate agent in New York City. He states that the most valuable skill he is transferring from his television work is the ability to truly listen to people and help them articulate their core needs and values. Schulman likens finding a home to finding a partner, a process that requires understanding compromises and priorities. He also credits the show with teaching him persistence and how to find workarounds when faced with obstacles, which he now applies to securing appointments for his real estate clients.</p>

          <p>Nineteen immigrant detainees held at a facility within Louisiana's Angola prison have entered the fifth day of a hunger strike to protest what they describe as unsafe and degrading conditions. The detainees are demanding access to medical care, prescription medications, clean drinking water, and basic hygiene products. Advocacy groups report that the facility, which the Trump administration opened in a former prison camp known as Camp J, lacks required services like a law library and religious programming. The strike highlights ongoing concerns about the treatment of detainees in the expanding network of immigration detention centers.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests President Trump's increasing pressure on Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute his political adversaries is a sign of his weakening political position. The author argues that as public support for Trump declines amid economic pressures like rising grocery prices and stalled job growth, he is racing to consolidate power before the 2026 elections. This creates a difficult calculation for officials like Bondi, who must weigh the benefits of pleasing the president against the potential future legal risks if his power fades. The analysis concludes that Trump's project resembles a dangerously over-leveraged deal, vulnerable to his administration's mistakes.</p>

Development Minister Reem Alabali Radovan acknowledged the reduction of €910 million comes at a time of increasing global crises, but stressed that German policy remains far from the massive aid cuts seen under the Trump administration in the U.S. However, aid organizations have warned that the cuts will have drastic consequences, with one NGO estimating that over 4 million people worldwide will lose food aid as a direct result.</p>

          <p>Rail travel is experiencing a significant boom in the United States, challenging the nation's long-standing preference for cars and planes. Amtrak, the national railway corporation, is capitalizing on this trend with popular social media engagement and the launch of its new "next-gen" Acela trains for the busy Boston to Washington, D.C. corridor. The new, more European-style trains signal a shift in perception and investment in passenger rail. This resurgence reflects a growing interest among Americans for alternative modes of transportation that offer a different travel experience.</p>

The historic announcement marks a significant shift in policy for these key Western powers and increases the international pressure on Israel.

          <p>For the first time in almost 100 years, hundreds of swimmers plunged into the Chicago River for an organized one-mile swim, an event symbolizing decades of environmental progress. The river, once notoriously polluted with sewage and industrial waste, has been significantly cleaned up since the passage of the Clean Water Act in the 1970s. The event, long championed by organizer Doug McConnell, aims to change the public's perception of the waterway and celebrate its transformation from a toxic channel to a recreational asset. The successful swim highlights a broader trend of cities reclaiming their urban rivers for public enjoyment.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, stock markets surged to new record highs, prompting some Wall Street strategists to predict the rally could continue. Optimism is fueled by easier financial conditions and the ongoing boom in artificial intelligence technology, which analysts believe justifies higher stock valuations. While some experts see room for further growth, comparing the current market to past equity bubbles, others caution that rate cuts could fuel speculative excess and a potential 'melt-up' that may lead to a sharp correction.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to aging and well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can significantly accelerate the aging process at a cellular level. She explains that stress shortens telomeres, the protective caps on the ends of our chromosomes, which naturally shrink as we age. This process can be slowed, and even potentially reversed, by adopting daily practices to manage stress and promote cellular restoration. Epel recommends simple lifestyle changes such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, incorporating Omega-3s into one's diet, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork.</p>

However, many party members remain deeply concerned about civil liberties, data security, and the potential for abuse by an authoritarian government, with veteran MP Alistair Carmichael calling a policy change "ocean-going nonsense."</p>

By demonstrating a fresh mandate, the party hopes to protect Ozel and other senior figures, including the jailed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, from legal challenges they contend are part of a broader government crackdown on political dissent.

          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with strong social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices include talking openly about emotions, modeling empathy in daily life, and treating mistakes as learning opportunities rather than failures. The article emphasizes that authentic social skills are built on a foundation of emotional safety at home. Parents who validate their children's feelings and allow them to navigate minor conflicts independently help them build the confidence and resilience necessary for healthy real-world relationships.</p>
