            <p>The Department of Justice responded to a motion for relief by attorneys for Kilmer Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to El Salvador. The DOJ stated that federal courts lack the authority to direct the executive branch in foreign relations. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys requested the court to demand action from the El Salvadoran government, dispatch personnel, and send an aircraft to extract their client, actions the DOJ argues involve potential violations of sovereignty. The DOJ asserts the court would be exceeding its authority by granting the plaintiffs' requests.</p>

            <p>China's exports saw a larger-than-expected jump of 12.4% in March, driven by businesses accelerating shipments to avoid upcoming U.S. tariffs, however, imports declined by 4.3% due to weak domestic demand. Analysts anticipate weakening exports in the coming months as U.S. tariffs take effect, potentially causing supply chain disruptions and inflation in the U.S. The Chinese leadership aims for a 5% annual growth target amid escalating trade tensions and sluggish domestic consumption. The U.S. has imposed cumulative tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory measures from China. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The exemption of smartphones, laptops and other electronic products from import tariffs on China will be short-lived, with Donald Trump warning that no one was “getting off the hook.” He said these products are subject to existing fentanyl tariffs and are moving to a different tariff "bucket." He promised to launch a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector and the electronics supply chain. China's leader Xi Jinping said protectionism “leads nowhere” and that a trade war would have “no winners”.</p>

            <p>Amid stock market volatility, investors are seeking safety in bonds. A surge in U.S. treasury bond yields has sparked questions about the role of bonds in diversified portfolios. The bond ladder strategy involves investing in a range of treasury maturities, holding them to maturity, and providing regular income. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) implements this approach, investing in treasuries from 30-day issues to 10-year bonds, with a fixed monthly income distributing roughly 11% to investors through 2035.

After a shaky start, McIlroy navigated challenges, including a difficult shot on the 5th hole, to contend for the lead. His journey included four double bogeys, the most by any Masters champion in 40 years. McIlroy's win, after 15 years of trying, was marked by boldness, luck, and a crucial second chance at a five-foot putt, culminating in a sigh of relief that seemed to bend the trees around the 18th green.</p>
