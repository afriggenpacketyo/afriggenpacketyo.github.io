          <p>Morgan Stanley announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street forecasts, driven by a significant increase in trading revenues. The bank's net income rose 15% to $3.54 billion, with revenue climbing 12% to $16.79 billion. Both the institutional securities and wealth management divisions showed strong performance, benefiting from higher client activity and asset management fees. Despite the positive report, the company's stock experienced a minor dip in trading following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies, a company focusing on an ether treasury strategy, surged after billionaire Peter Thiel's venture capital firm, Founders Fund, disclosed a 9% stake. The investment caused the company's stock to jump as much as 29%, sparking a rally in other firms with similar Ethereum-related strategies. This move by a prominent tech investor highlights growing interest in the Ethereum ecosystem, which has been buoyed by recent developments in stablecoins and tokenized asset trading.

          <p>President Trump stated it is "highly unlikely" he will fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite his continued public criticism of Powell's performance and interest rate policies. The statement came after reports that Trump had discussed the possibility with Republican lawmakers, causing brief market instability. The article explores the legal ambiguity surrounding a president's authority to remove a Fed chair for policy disagreements, a move that would break with historical precedent and could undermine the central bank's independence.

          <p>A new YouGov poll indicates that Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has gained significant support, closing the gap with the leading conservative CDU/CSU bloc. The AfD's support rose to 25%, just two points behind the conservatives, while parties in the current governing coalition, like the Social Democrats and Greens, have seen their support stagnate or decline. This polling trend reflects a notable political shift in Germany and growing strength for the far-right ahead of future elections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-standing debate over Germany's staggered summer vacation schedule has intensified, with several states demanding a fairer rotation system. Currently, the southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg always receive the latest holiday slots, which critics argue gives their residents an unfair advantage with better weather and lower travel costs. While most states rotate their schedules to manage tourism and traffic, the southern states have refused to change their traditional rhythm, leading to an annual interstate political dispute.</p>

          <p>A recent survey conducted by TD Cowen suggests that Netflix retains significant pricing power, even after a price hike earlier this year. According to the poll of U.S. consumers, 54% of current Netflix subscribers indicated a willingness to pay more for the service, an increase from the previous year. While a notable portion of respondents said they would cancel if prices rose, the overall trend is seen by analysts as a positive signal for the company's long-term financial health and ability to generate more revenue.

However, optimism is tempered, as fewer than half of the firms are positive about the future due to concerns over policy uncertainty and insufficient domestic demand in China.</p>

          <p>A Colorado dentist, James Craig, is on trial for the first-degree murder of his wife, Angela Craig, who he allegedly killed by lacing her protein shakes with cyanide. Prosecutors argue that financial troubles and an extramarital affair motivated the crime, presenting evidence of online poison purchases and suspicious internet searches. The defense contends that while Craig was unfaithful, the evidence does not prove he was responsible for his wife's death, suggesting she may have died by suicide, a claim her family disputes.</p>

New York officials accuse Tesla of a "bait-and-switch," as the change was made shortly after shareholders approved the company's reincorporation to Texas, effectively insulating directors and officers from accountability.</p>
