          <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is considering supporting the use of weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound to address the global obesity epidemic, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where 70% of the over one billion obese individuals reside. The agency plans to issue new recommendations by August or September 2025, detailing how these medications can integrate into chronic care models that include lifestyle interventions. WHO experts are also evaluating whether to include GLP-1 drugs on the list of essential medications for obesity and type 2 diabetes, while advocating for cost-effectiveness studies across different income levels. This move reflects a shift towards incorporating pharmacological interventions alongside traditional methods for managing obesity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple plans to shift a significant portion of its iPhone production to India to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, according to CEO Tim Cook. He stated that a majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will originate from India, while most iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods will be produced in Vietnam. Despite this shift, China will remain the primary manufacturing location for Apple products sold outside the United States. This strategic move aims to reduce the financial burden of tariffs, which could add $900 million to the company's costs in the upcoming quarter.</p>

          <p>Cambodia is still grappling with the deadly legacy of landmines from past conflicts, particularly stemming from the Vietnam War era, with millions of mines and unexploded ordnance remaining in the countryside. Despite efforts by organizations like Cambodia Self Help DeMining, the goal of being mine-free by 2025 is no longer feasible, as nearly 700 square miles of minefields remain. Many Cambodians have been killed or maimed by these explosives, including Poy, who lost an arm and his sight in separate mine explosions.

          <p>Santa Cruz has implemented a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on sweetened beverages, defying a statewide ban on such taxes. The tax, which applies to nonalcoholic drinks with added sweeteners and a high calorie count, aims to combat the consumption of sugary drinks. Proponents framed the initiative as a battle against the American Beverage Association, while opponents argue it unfairly burdens working families. The American Heart Association supports the tax, while the American Beverage Association warns of potential price increases for consumers. This move reignites the debate over soda taxes and their impact on public health and consumer costs.</p>

Stitt opposes the idea, stating that he has never heard President Trump express a desire to collect immigration information on children. The governor has replaced three board of education members due to Walters' proposal.

          <p>Mike Waltz, President Trump's former national security advisor, was photographed using Signal during a Cabinet meeting the day before his removal. The photo revealed that Waltz was texting with Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. White House Communications Director Steven Cheung defended Waltz's use of the app, stating that Signal is an approved app on government phones. Waltz had previously faced scrutiny for inadvertently including a journalist in a Signal group chat discussing a U.S. attack on terrorists in Yemen.</p>

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking to dismiss the state murder indictment, citing double jeopardy and other alleged violations. They argue that concurrent state and federal prosecutions violate Mangione's constitutional rights. The attorneys also seek to suppress statements Mangione made to authorities in Pennsylvania, claiming he was not provided with Miranda warnings. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges, the latter of which could result in the death penalty.</p>

          <p>BBC Verify has tracked a people smuggler, Fadi Gujjar, responsible for a deadly Atlantic migrant crossing where approximately 50 people died. Gujjar falsely promised safe and legal routes to Europe, but survivors recounted a harrowing journey with beatings, starvation, and dehydration. The investigation uncovered Gujjar's activities across three continents, including his presence in Mauritania, the starting point of the perilous voyage. Survivors paid Gujjar an average of $13,000 for the journey, which ended in tragedy with many migrants dying at sea.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting is facing criticism for watering down funding levels for maternity safety, leading to accusations of betrayal. Following a report into poor care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust, almost £100m was invested annually to improve maternity safety, but changes mean only £2m is guaranteed for maternity care this year. Campaigners and the Royal College of Midwives have condemned the decision, warning that it could undermine efforts to improve maternity services. The Department of Health argues that local health leaders will have the flexibility to decide how best to spend the money.</p>
