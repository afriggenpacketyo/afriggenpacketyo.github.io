        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A four-year-old wedding mystery in South Ayrshire has been solved, revealing the identity of a man who appeared in Michelle and John Wylie's wedding photos as a complete stranger. Andrew Hillhouse, the unexpected guest, mistakenly arrived at their venue, believing it was another wedding two miles away. He realized his error only when the bride walked down the aisle but felt unable to discreetly leave, even posing for group pictures while trying to "hunch down." This amusing mix-up, caused by his partner providing the wrong location, became a persistent puzzle for the couple until an internet sleuth finally identified Hillhouse, who recounted his mortifying experience of trying to blend in despite his towering height. He eventually made it to the correct wedding, where his mishap became a humorous tale.</p>

          <p>Football legend Wayne Rooney discussed his most memorable Manchester derby moments on his BBC podcast, including Manchester City's dominant 6-1 victory over United in 2011, which he described as a "horrible" and statement-making defeat. Rooney revealed the awkward situation of having to host his birthday party that same night, attended by several Manchester City players, admitting he should have cancelled it. He also reminisced about his iconic overhead kick goal in 2011, surprisingly stating he played "so bad" in that game despite the spectacular finish. Additionally, the article touches upon the unique pressures faced by children of famous footballers, like Rooney's son Kai, highlighting the intense public scrutiny they endure.</p>

          <p>The BBC has launched an interactive tool titled "Cooler Than Me?" that allows users to compare their current local weather forecast with conditions in various cities across the world. This engaging feature taps into Britain's long-standing national pastime of discussing and complaining about the weather, offering a playful yet informative way to determine if the sun truly shines brighter in other locations. The tool aims to provide a unique and personalized perspective on global climate patterns and forecasts, inviting users to engage with meteorological data in a fun and accessible format. It leverages the comprehensive data available on the BBC Weather website to deliver these comparisons, potentially inspiring users to become "star meteorologists."</p>

          <p>New UK Housing Secretary Steve Reed has reaffirmed the government's "absolute commitment" to building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, a central Labour manifesto pledge for the next Parliament. Reed, who took over the housing brief following Angela Rayner's resignation, stressed a "build baby build" philosophy and warned of potential sanctions for developers delaying construction, though specific penalties were not detailed. Industry leaders, however, caution that this target presents a "huge challenge" amidst mounting pressures like rising material costs and processing delays for planning applications. The article also notes Reed's exploration of various options to house asylum seekers without exacerbating existing housing market pressures, and his personal connection to Rayner's "painful" resignation.</p>

She hopes individuals holding information, who may have been unable to speak previously, will now feel empowered to assist the process. The review will also scrutinize BBC reports that publicly named a sixth suspect and exposed a series of police failings, with the ultimate goal of bringing all responsible parties to justice for the long-unresolved crime.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debate Proportionality of Israel's Military Actions in Gaza</h2>

          <p>This article analyzes the proportionality of Israel's military operation in Gaza, which has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and widespread destruction since the October 2023 Hamas attacks. While Israel asserts its inherent right to self-defense and aims to destroy Hamas, a vast majority of international law experts contend its actions are disproportionate. They cite the staggering civilian casualty count, including women and children, and the extensive damage to civilian infrastructure. The analysis delves into two legal interpretations of proportionality: the overall military response relative to the threat and the expected civilian harm from individual military actions. It also examines the severe restrictions on humanitarian aid, accusations of using starvation as a weapon, and the contested legal basis of Israel's self-defense claim given Gaza's status as occupied territory.</p>

          <p>Over two million people have been evacuated in Pakistan's Punjab and Sindh provinces as deadly monsoon floods sweep the eastern region, with authorities warning that these numbers are expected to increase in the coming days. More than 900 individuals have tragically died nationwide since late June, exacerbating a severe humanitarian crisis in a country where 40% of the population lives below the poverty line. Critics attribute the worsening floods to climate change and a lack of adequate government investment in disaster mitigation infrastructure and alert systems. The UN has allocated $5 million, and the US State Department has deployed response personnel. Pakistan, highly vulnerable to climate change with melting glaciers and extreme weather, has declared a climate emergency and initiated a 300-day plan to address these challenges.</p>

          <p>A report by the National Audit Office (NAO) reveals that the cost of residential care for vulnerable children in England has nearly doubled in five years, reaching an average of £318,400 per child annually. Despite this massive expenditure, the report concludes the system does not offer value for money, with many children, like Ezra Quinton who experienced up to 60 placements, still receiving inappropriate care. The NAO highlights a "dysfunctional" market driven by a record number of children in care, their increasing complexity of needs, and profit-driven private providers, which constitute 84% of children's homes. The Department for Education acknowledges years of "drift and neglect" and is planning reforms, including new legislation to curb profiteering, while charities urgently call for immediate steps to address these failures impacting children's futures.</p>

The Sparks, already short-handed, struggled to contain the Aces' scoring, a challenge further exacerbated by an injury to Cameron Brink, who left the game with a nose injury.

          <p>China has emerged as the leading foreign investor in Thailand's state-fostered Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), committing a substantial US$8.4 billion between 2019 and 2024. This significant investment accounts for 16% of all projects within the three-province cluster, encompassing participation in a 220km high-speed railway line, plans for an "aerotropolis," and potential property development. Notably, only Thailand itself has invested more in the corridor, with Japan ranking third. This substantial Chinese involvement underscores Beijing's strategic interest in Southeast Asian infrastructure and economic integration, particularly as part of its broader Belt and Road Initiative, aiming to enhance regional connectivity and economic ties, even as the railway project, initiated seven years ago, faced suspensions during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>A controversial Assisted Dying Bill is set for a two-day debate in the UK House of Lords, following its backing by MPs in June. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill proposes allowing terminally ill adults in England and Wales, with a prognosis of less than six months to live, to apply for an assisted death. This process would require approval from two doctors and a panel comprising a social worker, senior legal figure, and psychiatrist. Opponents, such as Baroness Luciana Berger, argue the legislation is "underdeveloped" and lacks proper scrutiny, tabling an amendment for further evidence collection from professionals and ministers. Supporters, like Lord Falconer, urge peers to respect the Commons' decision, expressing confidence that the bill has sufficient time to clear all parliamentary hurdles before spring.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Washington's attempts to contain China and reindustrialize America are proving detrimental to the US and its allies, simultaneously disrupting global trade and globalization. The author highlights a significant contradiction between former President Trump's anti-immigrant policies and his administration's industrial policy goals, exemplified by a recent raid on a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia. Hundreds of South Korean technicians were detained for alleged work visa irregularities, despite working for contractors unable to find suitable American workers. The article suggests that efforts by both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, to reshore manufacturing and create high-paying jobs are undermined by the ongoing crackdown on undocumented workers, exposing the inherent futility of industrial policy in post-industrial America without a pragmatic approach to its workforce needs.</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers, detained in a massive immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia last week, are now returning home on a chartered flight. Their departure was reportedly delayed by a White House order to ascertain if the workers, many of whom had various visas or were under a waiver program, were willing to remain and train Americans. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung criticized the situation as "extremely bewildering," warning that such actions could deter future foreign investment in the US. Hyundai's CEO confirmed the raid would delay the factory's opening by at least two to three months. This incident highlights growing trade tensions and the complexities of immigration enforcement impacting international business relations, prompting South Korea to seek new visa options from the US Congress.</p>

          <p>The Philippines is expressing grave concern over Beijing's new plan to bolster its claims in the South China Sea, with national security adviser Eduardo Ano explicitly calling it a "clear pretext towards eventual occupation" rather than an environmental protection measure. The Philippine foreign ministry announced its intention to issue a "formal diplomatic protest against this illegitimate and unlawful action by China." In response, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian defended the move as being within China's sovereignty to "safeguard the diversity, stability and sustainability" of Scarborough Shoal's ecological system, while urging Manila to cease "infringing and provocative actions." This latest escalation highlights the ongoing territorial disputes and growing tensions in the vital South China Sea waterway, with significant regional implications.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk at an outdoor event at Utah Valley University has intensified concerns over security and the balance of free speech on college campuses. University police chiefs are now re-evaluating security protocols for events featuring controversial speakers, grappling with the challenge of ensuring safety while upholding the principle of open democratic debate. Despite the presence of university officers and Kirk's personal security detail, some attendees felt the security was insufficient. Experts like Richard Beary and Robert Shibley warn of a potential "assassin's veto" threatening democratic discourse, especially in light of recent survey data indicating a rise in student acceptance of violence to silence certain speech. While campus police leaders anticipate a heightened level of diligence, they do not foresee an end to large outdoor events involving politically contentious figures.</p>

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison after being found guilty of plotting a military coup aimed at keeping him in power following his 2022 election loss. A panel of five Supreme Court justices handed down the sentence, with four voting for conviction, ruling he led a conspiracy. Bolsonaro, already under house arrest and barred from public office until 2033 on separate charges, now faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison. His lawyers have called the sentence "absurdly excessive" and plan to file appeals, though legal experts suggest this may be difficult. The ruling, as emphasized by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, underscores Brazil's narrow escape from a return to authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) offers a crucial remedy for the current fragilities and "ailments" of the global order. It argues that the multilateral system, including the United Nations, is faltering due to a rise in unilateral actions, escalating trade wars, and the increasing marginalization of the Global South in decision-making processes. The article suggests that the SCO, by embodying principles of cooperation among countries with diverse cultures, ideologies, and political systems, provides a vital platform for negotiation and reform. It contends that the SCO can effectively counteract the dangerous trend of fragmentation, where tariffs and sanctions frequently replace diplomatic dialogue, thereby playing a critical role in safeguarding international law and fostering global stability and cooperation.</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump last September, began with an unusual and at times uncomfortable first day, marked by the defendant's philosophical and frequently interrupted opening statement. Routh, representing himself, invoked figures like Adolf Hitler and Vladimir Putin, and mused on human nature, leading Judge Aileen Cannon to suspend his remarks for "making a mockery of this court." Prosecutors presented compelling evidence, including cellphone data, security footage, a handwritten note from Routh stating his intent to kill Trump, and eyewitness testimony, arguing Routh "decided to take the choice away from the American people." Witnesses, including a Secret Service agent who fired at Routh after discovering him armed near Trump's West Palm Beach golf course, detailed the confrontation, while Routh strangely told a witness, "You're my hero."</p>

          <p>A moment of silence on Capitol Hill for the assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk quickly devolved into a partisan shouting match between Republicans and Democrats, highlighting deep political divisions. Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert's request for prayer for Kirk prompted objections, leading to Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna accusing Democrats of "hateful rhetoric" that she claimed contributed to Kirk's killing. House Speaker Mike Johnson struggled to restore order amidst the commotion, repeatedly banging his gavel. The incident underscores the profound political polarization in Washington following Kirk's death, with leaders across the spectrum denouncing violence but also leveraging the event to advance partisan narratives, as President Trump explicitly blamed the "radical left" for the violent act.</p>

          <p>Child and baby nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed offers five expert tips to help parents manage fussy eating, a common developmental phase affecting over half of children, emphasizing that parents should not blame themselves. She advises prioritizing enjoyment at mealtimes to shift negative associations. Key strategies include allowing children autonomy in choosing what they want to eat and when to leave the table, avoiding labeling foods as "good" or "bad" to foster a healthy relationship with food, and being mindful of their naturally fluctuating appetites. Additionally, involving children in food preparation and exposing them to a wide range of quick, nutrient-dense foods can build familiarity and encourage more adventurous eating habits. Consulting a GP is recommended for persistent concerns or suspected sensory issues.</p>

UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting confirms that policymakers are incorporating aspects of this Danish model into a new long-term cancer plan for England.
