          <p>Ukrainian officials have implicated Russia in the assassination of Andriy Parubiy, a pro-Western member of parliament who was shot and killed in the city of Lviv. A suspect, disguised as a courier, was arrested in connection with the carefully planned attack. Parubiy was a significant figure in Ukraine's pro-European movements and had been a vocal supporter of Ukrainian independence and language. The killing adds to a series of accusations between Kyiv and Moscow regarding the targeting of political and military figures since the 2022 invasion.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has reported that an aircraft carrying President Ursula von der Leyen experienced significant GPS jamming, with Bulgarian authorities suspecting Russian interference. The incident occurred as the plane was approaching southern Bulgaria, but it landed safely. The Commission condemned the event, describing threats and intimidation as a regular part of Russia's hostile actions and stating it would reinforce the EU's commitment to bolstering its defense capabilities. This event is part of a rising number of GPS jamming and spoofing incidents reported by aircraft operating near Russian territory.</p>

          <p>The iconic American denim company Levi's has warned that rising anti-Americanism, potentially stemming from President Trump's tariff policies, could negatively impact its brand in the United Kingdom. In its UK financial accounts, the company listed the risk of British shoppers preferring national or European products as a key uncertainty for its future sales. This marks one of the first instances of a major U.S. brand openly acknowledging the potential for political blowback from the administration's trade policies. The concern is listed alongside other market pressures like inflation and competition.</p>

          <p>A fragile trade truce between the European Union and the United States is under threat after President Trump warned of new tariffs targeting the EU's digital services taxes and technology regulations. Trump claims these measures unfairly discriminate against American tech giants like Google and Amazon, demanding their immediate removal. The EU has defended its right to regulate its digital markets, with a spokesperson calling the threat "extraordinary and unexpected." This renewed dispute places pressure on EU policymakers to formulate a response, potentially deploying new anti-coercion tools to counter economic intimidation.</p>

          <p>David Warburton, who formerly represented the Somerton and Frome constituency in Somerset, has died suddenly at the age of 59. Warburton resigned as an MP in June 2023 after admitting to cocaine use, following a suspension from the Conservative Party over allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied and were later withdrawn. The Metropolitan Police are treating his death as unexpected but not suspicious. Colleagues remembered him as a talented and passionate individual who was a steadfast defender of his constituents and community.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has dealt a significant blow to President Trump's trade policy, ruling that he exceeded his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs. The court found it unlikely that Congress intended to grant a president unlimited authority to set tariffs under this law. However, the ruling will not take effect immediately, giving the Trump administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. The decision stems from legal challenges by states and businesses arguing that the tariffs, justified by declaring trade deficits a national emergency, are unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>Ethan Pritchard, a freshman linebacker for the Florida State Seminoles football team, is in critical but stable condition after being shot on Sunday evening.

          <p>Germany is actively pursuing deeper trade and strategic ties with India as a response to global economic uncertainties, including President Trump's tariff policies. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is visiting India to explore expanded cooperation in areas like technology, defense, and migration. While bilateral trade hit a record $33 billion in 2024, it remains small compared to Germany's trade with China. Both nations are pushing to finalize an EU-India free trade agreement, though challenges remain, as they seek to build a more resilient economic partnership.</p>

          <p>An 85-year-old man has died after he, his wife, and their dog were trampled by a herd of cows while hiking in the Austrian Alps. The incident occurred near a mountain hut in the province of Styria when a herd of nine cows, including calves, charged the couple. Despite receiving first aid from other hikers and being airlifted to a hospital, the man succumbed to his severe injuries. Fatal cow attacks are rare in Austria, but the government previously issued a code of conduct for hikers to minimize risks.</p>

          <p>Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have activated the "snapback" mechanism within the 2015 Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA), a move that could reinstate all previously lifted UN sanctions. The decision comes in response to Iran's ongoing violations of the agreement's terms. If a resolution is not reached within 30 days, the sanctions will automatically resume, placing significant diplomatic and economic pressure on Tehran. Iranian officials have stated they will not bow to pressure, while some political factions are now demanding a complete withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>

The firm alleges its contract was terminated just before it could submit its final report.

Arguing that it would be "insulting" to ban them, Trump stated the policy benefits smaller universities and helps maintain a good relationship with China. This stance represents a reversal of his administration's previously hardline approach and has been met with anger from allies who view the students as potential security risks and competitors for educational opportunities for American students.</p>

          <p>Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has announced an ambitious plan for the country to become a fully digital, cashless society by 2030. However, the vision faces considerable challenges, including a large informal economy, particularly in agriculture, and a population that overwhelmingly prefers cash transactions. Financial and cybersecurity experts express skepticism, pointing to the country's vulnerability to cyberattacks and a lack of digital infrastructure. Critics argue that a forced transition could harm small businesses and that the goal is unrealistic without first addressing fundamental issues of financial education and security.</p>
