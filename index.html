          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, moving beyond treating female athletes as "mini-men." Researchers are studying the unique effects of elite sports on the female body, including breast biomechanics and the impact of sports bras on performance. The article also explores the complex relationship between the menstrual cycle and athletic ability, as well as the higher risk of certain injuries like ACL tears in women. This growing body of research aims to improve performance, health, and retention of women in sports by addressing previously taboo or overlooked topics.</p>

          <p>A family is suing two funeral homes for allegedly sending their deceased son's brain to them in an unmarked, leaking cardboard box. The parents discovered the gruesome contents after the box, left in their car, began to emit a foul odor and leak fluid, which the father touched. The lawsuit accuses the Georgia and Pennsylvania funeral homes of negligently mishandling human remains and inflicting severe emotional distress. The family seeks compensation and answers, hoping their lawsuit prevents similar incidents from happening to others in the future.</p>

          <p>Following his dismissal from the show "MasterChef," former host Gregg Wallace has issued an apology to anyone he offended but has denied more severe allegations of misconduct. An independent inquiry upheld 45 claims against him, including inappropriate language and one instance of unwelcome physical contact. In an interview, Wallace attributed some of his comments to his background but insisted he is not a "sex pest." He also defended his former co-host, John Torode, who was also fired over a racism allegation, stating Torode is not a racist.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has stalled, with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff announcing the withdrawal of the American negotiating team, citing Hamas's lack of good faith. The talks are deadlocked over Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the war in exchange for hostages, a condition Israel rejects. Amid the diplomatic failure, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is intensifying, with the UN reporting that children are starving to death due to the blockade. International organizations are calling for urgent access to deliver food and prevent a wider famine.</p>

          <p>Amid a growing starvation crisis in Gaza, an analysis of the food boxes distributed by the U.S. and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) reveals significant nutritional concerns. While the boxes may provide enough calories for basic survival, experts report they are deficient in essential vitamins and minerals like iron, calcium, and vitamin C. The aid, consisting mostly of dried goods, also requires clean water and fuel for preparation, both of which are critically scarce in the territory. This raises questions about the effectiveness of the current aid strategy as malnutrition soars.</p>

The article argues that watching unscripted interactions can help audiences grasp social cues, while shows tackling health or disability can reduce stigma and isolation.

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers from Texas met with California Governor Gavin Newsom to strategize against what they call a Republican effort to "rig" the 2026 midterm elections. The meeting comes after Texas Governor Greg Abbott, at President Trump's urging, called a special session to redraw congressional maps in a way that would favor the GOP. In response, Governor Newsom is exploring options to redraw California's own maps to favor Democrats, a controversial move that would upend the state's independent redistricting process.

Retailers in Japan are limiting purchases, and importers are struggling to keep up with orders from cafes.

          <p>Bill Essayli, the interim U.S. attorney for the Los Angeles region, has drawn significant criticism for using his powerful office to advance a partisan, pro-Trump agenda. Since his appointment in April, Essayli has pursued federal lawsuits challenging California's sanctuary city policies and protections for transgender athletes, pleasing the administration but alarming critics. His tenure has been marked by mass departures of career prosecutors, who cite his belligerent style and politically motivated decisions. With his temporary appointment expiring, his future remains uncertain, raising questions about the politicization of the U.S. attorney's office.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight bound for Las Vegas executed an abrupt 500-foot descent shortly after taking off from Burbank, California, to avoid a possible collision with another aircraft. Passengers described moments of terror as the plane went into what felt like a free fall. Flight data shows the plane dropped suddenly while a jet was approaching at a similar altitude in the opposite direction. Southwest confirmed the maneuver was in response to onboard traffic alerts and stated that two flight attendants sustained injuries. The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese voters are participating in a large-scale and controversial recall vote targeting more than 30 opposition lawmakers accused of being overly aligned with China. The "Great Recall" movement emerged from protests against the opposition-led legislature, which has blocked bills from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Pro-recall activists believe the opposition Kuomintang party is pushing Beijing's agenda, a charge the party denies. The vote has the potential to shift the balance of power in the legislature and has deeply divided society, with both sides claiming to be defending Taiwan's democracy.</p>

          <p>The New Orleans jail, already under scrutiny for a recent mass escape, has mistakenly released another detainee. Authorities reported that 30-year-old Khalil Bryan, held on multiple charges including home invasion, was let go due to a clerical error where deputies failed to properly verify an inmate's identity during a bond process. The local sheriff's office has taken full responsibility, attributing the incident to human error and promising an internal investigation. This latest failure highlights what the district attorney's office called "ongoing systemic issues" at the facility.</p>

          <p>Despite escalating U.S.-China tensions and parental fears about instability, Chinese students continue to pursue higher education in the United States, though they are becoming more selective. Applicants are now prioritizing highly-ranked programs, the reputation of specific schools, and the availability of financial aid. The article profiles one student who, despite his mother's concerns, chose to attend Brandeis University for its academic freedom and five-year master's program. This trend suggests that while the appeal of an American education persists, students are carefully weighing the perceived risks against the opportunities offered by top institutions.</p>

Prosecutors detailed how he misused campaign funds for personal luxury expenses, illegally claimed unemployment benefits, and lied to federal election officials. His conviction and expulsion from Congress marked a swift downfall for the first-term New York politician whose fabricated background and criminal activities became a national scandal.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already serving life for murdering her two children in Idaho, received two additional consecutive life sentences in Arizona. An Arizona court found her guilty of conspiring with her late brother to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019, and attempting to murder her niece's ex-husband. Prosecutors argued her motives were financial gain and a desire to be with her current husband, Chad Daybell, using "twisted" religious beliefs as justification. During the hearing, emotional victim impact statements were delivered by family members, who described the devastating wake of destruction her actions caused.</p>

The payments, which can range from thousands to over £100,000, require firefighters to "buy back" their contributions.

A major point of contention is the increasing use of AI-powered self-service kiosks, which workers fear will eliminate their jobs and diminish the fan experience.
