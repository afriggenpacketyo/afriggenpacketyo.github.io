            <h2>US Chip Export Restrictions May Bolster Chinese Nvidia Competitors</h2>

            <p>Tightened U.S. controls on Nvidia's chip sales to China are expected to benefit domestic AI chipmakers like Huawei. New regulations require export licenses for Nvidia's H20 GPUs, impacting the company's revenue. Analysts believe this creates opportunities for Chinese firms to grow and enhance their chip solutions, particularly Huawei's Ascend series, though challenges remain in software maturity and supply chain dependencies, as TSMC cannot ship advanced chips to China.

            <p>China has cautioned other nations against entering into trade agreements with the United States that could be detrimental to Beijing's interests. This warning comes as several countries are in negotiations with Washington following President Trump's tariff announcements. China's Commerce Ministry stated that it would retaliate against any deals that sacrifice China's interests, emphasizing its determination to protect its economic rights. The ministry described the U.S. tariffs as economic bullying, asserting that appeasement would not bring peace.</p>

Economists suggest that African nations should negotiate collectively and leverage platforms like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to strengthen their economic position.

The White House maintains that no classified information was shared, but critics argue that such discussions could jeopardize U.S. personnel.</p>

            <p>Prison officers in the UK are requesting electric stun guns to protect themselves in high-security prisons following an attack by Hashem Abedi, one of the Manchester Arena bombers, on prison staff. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) is advocating for the tactical use of tasers by specially trained staff to neutralize threats. Currently, officers only carry extendable batons and incapacitant spray. The POA is also renewing calls for all staff to have stab vests and for "Supermax"-style rules to be imposed on the most dangerous inmates.</p>

            <p>The article argues that the UK, emboldened by global trends, is exhibiting colonial impulses through its immigration policies, particularly towards former colonies. It criticizes the tightening of visa restrictions on African and Caribbean nations, citing the example of exorbitant visa fees imposed on Trinidadians. The author contends that these policies reflect a historical pattern of discrimination and exploitation, contrasting them with the welcoming attitude towards Ukrainians. The piece calls for the Caribbean and African nations to emancipate themselves from "mental slavery" and forge new alliances based on mutual respect.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry has attributed the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month to "professional failures," including an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders." The IDF stated that troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat, but the report also cited "poor night visibility" as a factor. While one officer has been dismissed and another reprimanded, a spokeswoman for the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) dismissed the report as invalid. The incident occurred after a convoy of PRCS ambulances, a UN car, and a fire truck came under fire.</p>

The Emergency Housing Vouchers program, launched in 2021, is facing a funding shortfall due to rising rent costs. Without congressional action, this could lead to a significant increase in evictions and push many back into homelessness or abusive situations.

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for China's Xiamen Airlines has been returned to Boeing's production hub in Seattle due to the impact of tit-for-tat tariffs between the U.S. and China. The jet, painted with Xiamen livery, had been waiting at Boeing's Zhoushan completion center for final work and delivery. Increased tariffs have made it economically unviable for Chinese airlines to take delivery of new Boeing jets. Confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airlines considering deferring deliveries rather than paying duties.</p>

            <p>Gatwick Airport has been identified as the worst airport in the UK for flight delays for the second consecutive year, with departures averaging over 23 minutes behind schedule in 2024. Air traffic control (ATC) disruption, both in Europe and at Gatwick's own control tower, contributed to the delays. Stansted and Manchester Airports also had significant delays. Belfast City Airport recorded the best punctuality performance. Passengers affected by ATC issues are generally not entitled to compensation.</p>
