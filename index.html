            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, pending further review. This action comes in response to an emergency appeal from the ACLU, which argued that immigration authorities were attempting to restart removals under the wartime law. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented from the order. The ACLU expressed relief, emphasizing the imminent danger faced by the individuals who could be deported to El Salvador without due process, highlighting concerns about their safety in a brutal prison environment.</p>

            <h2>Trump's Tariffs May Encourage Corporate Profiteering, Experts Warn</h2>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Economists are concerned that potential tariffs imposed by Donald Trump could lead to corporate profiteering, allowing companies to raise prices beyond what is necessary to cover tariff costs. This 'greedflation' could be fueled by consumer expectations of rising prices due to the tariffs. Even companies in non-tariffed markets might increase prices, citing the complexity of international supply chains during a trade war. Experts warn that US consumers could face a significant rise in living costs, with some economists predicting inflation could hit 4% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Chinese museums are being directed to promote ethnic unity and counter 'wrong historical views,' according to Pan Yue, director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission. Museums should avoid portraying the Han ethnicity in confrontational contexts with ethnic minorities and focus on telling the 'China story' through archaeological findings. The goal is to cultivate a sense of community and represent China as 'diverse but unified,' emphasizing respect and accommodation of differences. This initiative aims to ensure that all cultural relics and historical narratives align with the overall development of the Chinese nation.</p>

            <p>US airstrikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal in Yemen, controlled by the Houthi movement, reportedly killed dozens and wounded many more, according to Houthi-run health authorities.

The Houthi-led government condemned the attack as a war crime, claiming the terminal was a civilian facility. The US military said the strikes were meant to degrade the Houthis' economic power and prevent illicit smuggling of fuel and war material.</p>

            <p>President Trump stated that the US will 'take a pass' on brokering further Russia-Ukraine talks if no progress is made soon. This comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the US would abandon talks unless there were clear signs of progress within days. Trump expressed his desire for a quick resolution to the conflict, citing the loss of life. Despite initial confidence, attempts to reach a full ceasefire have been unsuccessful, with Washington blaming both sides for the lack of progress.</p>

            <p>A divided panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused an effort by District Court Judge James Boasberg to investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by defying his order to return deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members. The order does not rule on the merits of Boasberg's inquiry but sets deadlines for the government and petitioners to file replies. Boasberg found probable cause that the Trump administration acted in contempt of court when it defied his order.</p>

The rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell, suggesting investors were losing confidence in the US economy. This could affect budgets, public spending, and interest rates for mortgages and loans. President Trump introduced a 90-day pause for the higher tariffs on every country except China following the ructions in the bond markets. (not investment advice)</p>

The study, led by Chinese scientists, analyzed soil samples and found that up to 1.4 billion people worldwide are affected by toxic heavy metal pollution. The findings raise concerns about global food safety, as cadmium is a carcinogen linked to kidney damage, bone disorders, and respiratory diseases. Vietnam is also a major rice exporter, but its levels of heavy metal pollution are relatively low, according to the study.</p>
