          <p>President Donald Trump announced he will personally host this year's Kennedy Center Honors, a departure from presidential tradition. He stated he was heavily involved in selecting honorees like Sylvester Stallone and KISS, while rejecting artists he deemed "too woke." This move is part of a broader effort to reshape U.S. cultural institutions, which includes replacing the center's board with loyalists and proposing renovations to make it a "crown jewel."</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1%, while large-cap technology stocks saw a decline. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Lower rates are expected to particularly benefit smaller companies, which often rely on borrowed capital for operations and expansion, potentially boosting economic activity and consumer spending.

          <p>This opinion article analyzes President Trump's decision to place Washington D.C. police under federal control and deploy the National Guard, suggesting the motives are political. The author argues the move aims to distract from other issues and appeal to his base by stoking racist fears about crime in multiracial, Democratic-run cities. It frames the action as part of a broader authoritarian agenda to personalize state power, urging media and political actors to recognize and challenge this pattern.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking volume of containers in July, a direct result of shippers front-loading goods to get ahead of Trump administration tariff deadlines. The port handled over one million twenty-foot equivalent units, the highest in its 117-year history, with imports also hitting an all-time high. However, industry experts note this early peak season has been uneven, with sectors like retail pulling back, and freight rates have dropped significantly from their June peak.

          <p>This opinion article supports President Trump's decision to federalize police and deploy the National Guard to combat crime in Washington, D.C. The author frames the move as a common-sense plan to restore safety, drawing parallels to successful crime reduction strategies in 1990s New York City. The article dismisses criticism as politically motivated and argues that ensuring public safety is a government's primary duty, an effort it claims most Americans will support.</p>

          <p>Florida's wildlife commission has unanimously approved the state's first black bear hunt in a decade, drawing strong condemnation from conservation groups. The decision permits the culling of 187 bears in December, with regulators citing a rising bear population and increased human encounters as justification.

          <p>President Trump visited the Kennedy Center to announce the 2025 honorees: country star George Strait, actor Michael Crawford, actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Gloria Gaynor, and the rock band KISS. In a break with tradition, Trump, who now serves as the center's chairman, will also host the annual awards gala. The announcement follows a recent overhaul of the cultural institution, where Trump replaced board members with allies and outlined plans to renovate the venue.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the parent company of the Zelle payments network. The suit alleges that EWS designed Zelle without critical safety features, which enabled scammers to steal over $1 billion from users between 2017 and 2023. The lawsuit seeks restitution for victims and a court order requiring Zelle to implement stronger anti-fraud measures, while Zelle's spokesperson dismissed the suit as a "political stunt."</p>

Masters noted that while the concept was considered over a decade ago, the league has since found other ways to grow its international presence, making overseas games unnecessary.</p>

          <p>This article explores the feasibility of negotiating credit card debt relief directly with creditors instead of using a professional service. While a DIY approach avoids fees and keeps the borrower in control, it requires significant preparation, persistence, and knowledge of debt law. Success depends on understanding legal rights, recognizing valid settlement offers, and navigating potential negative impacts on taxes and credit scores, areas where professional debt relief companies often provide crucial expertise.</p>
