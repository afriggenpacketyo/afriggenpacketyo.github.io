          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, the fifth named storm of the Atlantic season, is forecast to intensify into the season's first hurricane by Friday. Currently located east of the Caribbean's Leeward Islands, the storm is projected to become a major hurricane over the weekend, though its long-term path toward the U.S. remains uncertain. Authorities have issued tropical storm watches throughout the islands as the system approaches, which has already caused deadly flooding in Cabo Verde, highlighting the potential danger to the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly increased federal control over Washington D.C.'s law enforcement, appointing the head of the DEA as the city's "emergency police commissioner." Attorney General Pam Bondi directed that the Metropolitan Police Department must now seek federal approval for its orders, a move that effectively sidelines the city's current police chief. This action is part of a broader federal crackdown on crime in the capital, which includes rescinding local "sanctuary" policies that limited cooperation with immigration agencies.</p>

          <p>The UK division of fast-fashion retailer Shein reported a significant 32.3% increase in sales for 2024, reaching £2.05 billion and boosting pre-tax profits. The growth comes as the Singapore-headquartered company pursues a long-delayed initial public offering, having shifted its focus from London to Hong Kong. Despite its success, the company acknowledged potential risks from supply chain issues, currency fluctuations, and weakening consumer confidence due to inflation, which could impact future performance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed signs of faltering in July as key indicators like retail sales and industrial output failed to meet forecasts. Retail sales grew by 3.7%, slowing from the previous month, while industrial output saw its weakest increase since last November, reflecting persistent weak domestic demand. The ongoing contraction in property investment and a high youth unemployment rate are adding to the economic headwinds, prompting calls for new policy support to ensure the country meets its annual growth target.

          <p>Mali's ruling military junta announced it has foiled a coup attempt, arresting several military officers, civilians, and a French national alleged to be a foreign agent. The government claims the plot was supported by unspecified "foreign states" and aimed to destabilize the country. This development occurs amid a broader crackdown on dissent by the military, which seized power in coups in 2020 and 2021 and has since pivoted away from Western allies like France in favor of a closer relationship with Russia.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, exceeding analysts' forecasts despite trade pressures from U.S. tariffs. The growth was primarily driven by resilient exports, which helped offset some of the negative impacts on key sectors like the automobile industry. However, economists remain cautious, predicting a potential slowdown in the coming quarters as investment spending softens and the full effects of global trade policies become more apparent, possibly threatening a recession.

          <h2>California Governor Newsom Launches Redistricting Effort to Counter Texas GOP Plan</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a plan to redraw his state's congressional maps in direct response to a Republican effort in Texas to create more GOP-favorable districts. Newsom is calling for a special election to allow voters to approve the new maps, which could add Democratic seats to neutralize potential Republican gains in Texas. This move escalates a national partisan battle over mid-decade redistricting, which could significantly impact control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Youngstown, Ohio, a city once devastated by the collapse of the American steel industry, is experiencing a steady economic revival. Entrepreneurs are repurposing old industrial spaces, like abandoned factories, into new businesses such as breweries and flea markets, injecting new life into the city. While the comeback is not dramatic, the city's population has stabilized, and the unemployment rate is now only slightly above the national average. This gradual revitalization demonstrates a shift from its industrial past toward a more diverse and resilient local economy.</p>

          <p>The state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against the online gaming platform Roblox, accusing the company of failing to protect children from sexual predators. The suit, brought by Attorney General Liz Murrill, alleges that Roblox prioritizes profit over safety, creating an environment where harmful content and predators can flourish. The legal action points to a lack of effective safety protocols and age verification, citing multiple cases in the state, including one where a 13-year-old girl was allegedly kidnapped and sexually assaulted after meeting a predator on the platform.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, believe that expectations for tipping have grown in recent years. While many view tipping as a way to show appreciation or supplement service workers' income, others see it as an obligatory added cost. The survey found that few people who noticed the trend considered it a positive development, which may be linked to broader concerns about rising prices and the overall cost of living that have been prevalent across various income levels.</p>

          <p>The UK government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to educate the public about the dangers of traveling overseas for cosmetic procedures. This initiative is part of a broader campaign to address the rise in so-called "medical tourism," which often leads to botched surgeries that the NHS must later fix. Content creators will advise viewers on crucial safety measures, such as consulting a UK doctor beforehand and avoiding package deals that bundle holidays with surgical procedures, aiming to help people make more informed decisions.</p>

          <p>Four years after famously adopting an entirely plant-based menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park will begin serving animal products again. Chef Daniel Humm, who had championed the vegan shift as an ethical and creative imperative, cited a desire to be more inclusive and acknowledged a decline in business, particularly for corporate events and wine sales. The decision reflects the broader challenges faced by plant-based fine dining and the persistent consumer preference for meat, even amid growing environmental concerns about its sustainability.</p>

          <p>Nearly two years into the war in Gaza, Israel is experiencing profound internal divisions that have fractured society along political and religious lines. While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains a consistent message of total victory, his government faces pressure from hostage families demanding a deal, ultranationalists pushing for annexation, and a secular population protesting his leadership. Opinion polls show that while most Jewish Israelis support the military's actions, the nation is far from the unified front Netanyahu proclaimed, with deep disagreements over the war's purpose and endgame.</p>

          <p>Barack Obama joined a virtual meeting with Texas House Democrats to praise their efforts in blocking a Republican-led plan to redraw the state's congressional maps. The former president commended their courage for leaving the state to deny a legislative quorum, an action he said was critical in the fight against partisan gerrymandering. His involvement highlights the national significance of the standoff, which has prompted California Democrats to propose their own redistricting plan as a countermeasure to the potential GOP gains in Texas.</p>

          <p>As President Trump and Vladimir Putin prepare for their summit in Alaska, their objectives appear to be distinctly different, though both are focused on the war in Ukraine. Putin seeks international recognition and a validation of Russia's territorial gains, using the meeting to signal an end to his diplomatic isolation. Trump, driven by a desire to be seen as a global peacemaker, aims for a swift resolution but has shown vacillating positions on the conflict. The meeting's outcome remains uncertain, with Putin negotiating from a strategic position and Trump seeking a tangible diplomatic victory.</p>
