          <p>A review by The Associated Press found that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) repeatedly granted appeals to remove buildings at Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp, from its 100-year flood map. These exemptions, granted between 2013 and 2020, loosened safety oversight as the camp expanded in a notoriously flood-prone area. In a catastrophic flood on July 4, at least 27 campers and counselors died when the Guadalupe River swelled. Experts find it disturbing that a camp responsible for children would seek exemptions from basic flood regulations, especially as other risk models showed a clear and present danger.</p>

          <p>An Australian woman, Erin Patterson, has been found guilty of murdering three of her former in-laws by serving them a beef Wellington containing deadly death cap mushrooms. The incident occurred in July 2023 when she invited four family members to her home for lunch, with only one surviving the poisoning. Prosecutors argued that Patterson intentionally poisoned her guests and then attempted to cover up the crime by disposing of a food dehydrator, which was later found with traces of the toxic fungi. Despite her claims that it was an accident, the jury convicted her, and she now faces a potential life sentence.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Announces 30% Tariffs on Imports from European Union and Mexico</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced new 30% tariffs on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, set to take effect on August 1. In letters to leaders, Trump cited the U.S. trade deficit with the EU and insufficient efforts by Mexico to stop fentanyl trafficking as the primary reasons for the new duties. The move targets major trading partners, with the U.S. importing significant amounts of vehicles, machinery, and pharmaceutical products from these regions. Both the European Commission and Mexican officials have expressed disagreement, with the EU stating it is ready to implement "proportionate countermeasures" if necessary. (not investment advice)</p>

The foreign minister emphasized that any new negotiations must begin with an assurance that such actions will not be repeated.

          <p>Russia has significantly escalated its aerial assaults on Ukraine, utilizing thousands of domestically produced drones and missiles in combined attacks on cities like Kyiv and Odessa. Military experts suggest this intensification serves two strategic goals: to destroy Ukraine's military-industrial complex and to demoralize the Ukrainian public, thereby pressuring the government. The expanded Russian drone production, supported by parts from China and missiles from North Korea, enables these massive strikes. Analysts view this as a potential prelude to a new summer offensive, aiming to cripple Ukrainian air defenses and force the nation into submission by year's end.</p>

Panelists noted that while past presidents often used such visits to connect emotionally with victims, President Trump's approach focuses more on mobilizing resources and touting his administration's response. The discussion highlighted a shift toward relying more on state and local officials rather than a large-scale federal presence. This reflects a different philosophy of governance during national emergencies, emphasizing administrative efficiency over personal expressions of empathy on the ground.</p>

This article notes that while IonQ had a tepid first quarter, it projects significant growth for 2025. Conversely, D-Wave's strong first quarter may have been an anomaly. Given the high valuations of both stocks and uncertainty about which technology will prevail, experts suggest waiting for second-quarter earnings before investing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The newly signed 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' significantly reforms the U.S. federal student loan system, reducing the number of repayment plans from seven to two and introducing new borrowing caps. Beginning in 2026, new borrowers will choose between a standard 10-25 year plan or a new income-driven option, the Repayment Assistance Plan, which extends payments up to 30 years. The law also phases out existing plans like SAVE, tightens eligibility for Pell Grants, and eliminates Grad PLUS loans for new students. While the White House touts the changes as simplifying a broken system, some advocates worry about the extended repayment timelines. (not investment advice)</p>

These services analyze conversation screenshots and provide tailored advice, acting as a 24/7 'AI wingman.' While some users find the technology to be a confidence booster and a useful tool for breaking the ice, the trend also raises questions about authenticity and the risk of over-relying on AI for human connection.</p>

          <p>With Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner having stepped back from the political spotlight, Eric and Lara Trump are increasingly positioning themselves for future political roles. Eric Trump has hinted at a potential presidential run after his father's term, while Lara Trump's political ambitions are more concrete. After a stint as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, she is now widely seen as a likely candidate for a North Carolina Senate seat in 2026, with strong backing from the party establishment. Lara has also taken on a role similar to Ivanka's, working to soften Donald Trump's public image and championing him as a supporter of women.</p>

          <p>According to negotiation expert Kathryn Valentine, successfully securing a higher salary is rarely accomplished in a single meeting. The process often requires several weeks of discussions, follow-ups, and documentation. She advises initiating the conversation during a mid-year check-in rather than an annual review, as budgets are often set by then. The goal of the first meeting should be to start the dialogue and set the stage for success, not to finalize a deal. Valentine emphasizes the importance of patience, clear documentation, and scheduling follow-up meetings to hold both parties accountable, framing negotiation as an ongoing, collaborative process.</p>

          <p>A sex therapist with over two decades of experience highlights four common intimacy blockers that often hide in plain sight. These include constant phone use, which signals a lack of presence, and unresolved feelings about an ex-partner, which can prevent new connections from forming. The article also points to a person's own negativity bias, where fear-based assumptions prevent vulnerability, and an unmanaged stress response, which can shut down desire. The therapist emphasizes that intimacy is more than physical and advises couples to communicate openly about these issues and establish healthy boundaries to foster a thriving connection.</p>

          <p>An explosion in unregulated rare earth mining in Myanmar's Shan state is causing a severe environmental disaster with cross-border consequences. Rivers flowing into Thailand, such as the Kok and Sai, have become contaminated with hazardous metals like arsenic at levels far exceeding safety limits, posing a threat to local communities and ecosystems. Activists attribute the problem to the global demand for rare earths, critical for modern technology, which has fueled a mining boom in an area of Myanmar controlled by an armed ethnic militia. With China as the primary buyer of these minerals, environmental groups are urging Beijing to use its influence to address the pollution.</p>

The book details the internal dynamics of both campaigns, including the Biden team's frustration with his disastrous debate performance and the Harris campaign's surprise at their loss despite some positive public polls.

This type of 'wild movement'—climbing, running, and tumbling—is crucial for developing healthy bones, muscles, and cognitive skills, while also reducing the future risk of chronic disease and injury. The article argues that modern society, with its emphasis on safety and structured activities, often suppresses this natural behavior, potentially hindering a child's physical and neurological development.

This climate of fear has intensified since state highway patrol officers were granted authority to detain individuals based on immigration status.
