          <p>The Trump administration is considering requesting emergency relief from the Supreme Court to pause a federal court ruling that blocked many of President Trump's tariffs, citing irreparable national security and economic harms. This action follows criticism from top aides like Stephen Miller, who called the ruling "judicial tyranny," and Peter Navarro, who accused the court of being "globalist." The ruling invalidated dozens of country-specific tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which the court found did not grant the president such broad authority. The administration is also asking the trade-court judges to pause enforcement of their ruling while the case is appealed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report revealed strong sales growth, driven by its data center division and demand for GPUs in AI applications. However, U.S. export controls are hindering the company's potential in China, a $50 billion market, as restrictions on its H20 chip are causing developers to use homegrown alternatives like Huawei. Despite these challenges, cloud providers remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for half of its data center revenue. Looking ahead, Nvidia sees significant growth potential in AI inference, where its Blackwell chips can serve AI models to millions of customers by improving AI answers through reasoning.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a letter giving Harvard University 30 days to challenge the revocation of its certification to enroll international students, walking back its initial stance. This decision came ahead of a federal hearing, with the administration previously accusing Harvard of fostering an unsafe campus environment hostile to Jewish students and promoting antisemitism. A judge plans to issue a preliminary injunction preventing the administration from revoking Harvard's SEVP certification without due process. Harvard alleges that the administration's actions violate the school's First Amendment rights and are retaliatory for its refusal to comply with government demands.</p>

          <p>Seven oil and gas companies are being sued for wrongful death after Juliana Leon died during a 2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, marking the first case of its kind.

The suit argues that the extreme heat event, which would have been virtually impossible without man-made climate change, directly contributed to Leon's death. The case is a significant escalation in efforts to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for climate change impacts.</p>

Ben Wang's performance as the young martial artist is a highlight, but the movie ultimately relies too heavily on familiar tropes and sacrifices originality for the sake of including multiple "legends." The pacing is rushed, and the fight sequences are difficult to follow, diminishing the overall impact.</p>

Judge Allison Burroughs stated her intention to issue the injunction and extend a temporary restraining order, protecting Harvard's ability to enroll international students.

Despite Zsa-zsa's questionable morality, the film celebrates the act of ambition itself, honoring artisans who create masterpieces. The movie is dedicated to Andersonâ€™s late father-in-law, Fouad Malouf, a businessman and engineer, and is a riff on oil baron Calouste Gulbenkian.</p>

The time away allowed her to focus on her mental and physical well-being, seek counseling, and rediscover her passion for the sport.
