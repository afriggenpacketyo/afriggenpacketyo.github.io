          <p>Elon Musk has publicly condemned President Trump's tax and spending bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" due to its potential to significantly increase the national debt and burden American citizens. Musk's criticism reflects a growing rift between him and Trump, especially after his recent departure from the administration. The bill, which includes substantial tax breaks and increased defense spending, is currently under Senate consideration after passing the House. Musk hinted at supporting challengers to politicians who voted for the bill, reflecting his strong stance against policies he views as fiscally irresponsible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As people age, maintaining bone strength is crucial, and nutritionists recommend incorporating specific foods into the daily diet to support bone health. Tofu, rich in calcium and protein, is highlighted, along with prunes, which contain vitamin K and manganese, essential for bone formation. Yogurt, high in calcium, vitamin D, and protein, is also recommended, with the advice to opt for regular yogurt over Greek yogurt for more calcium. Fatty fishes like salmon and sardines offer vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, and leafy greens such as kale and beans and seeds provide magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium, all vital for bone remodeling.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is facing repeated judicial setbacks as judges continue to rule against his administration's policies and executive orders. Critics accuse Trump of flouting the law and misinterpreting legal statutes, leading to a high number of unfavorable rulings. Trump and his supporters denounce these rulings as "judicial activism" and claim the judges are biased against him. The article argues that Trump's actions are often illegal and that he is undermining the separation of powers by attacking the judiciary.</p>

          <p>Patricia Krenwinkel, a former follower of Charles Manson, has been recommended for parole after serving 56 years for her involvement in the Tate-LaBianca murders. The parole board recognized Krenwinkel's growth and rehabilitation over the decades, concluding that she no longer poses a threat to society. However, her release is not guaranteed, as the governor has the authority to veto the decision, and some victims' family members are strongly opposed. Supporters emphasize Krenwinkel's remorse, her history of abuse, and her dedication to personal growth and helping others during her incarceration.</p>

          <p>A recent State Department Substack post titled “The Need for Civilizational Allies in Europe” sparked controversy with its radical critique of European governments. The author, Samuel Samson, a young and relatively inexperienced advisor, accused Europe of abandoning democracy in favor of repressive liberalism. Samson's views reflect a broader strategy of "entryism," where right-wing radicals infiltrate institutions to promote an illiberal Christian government. This incident highlights the success of radical right-wing movements in entering the political mainstream and influencing US foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has successfully implemented a public, universal pre-kindergarten program, providing free child care and early education to all 4-year-olds, regardless of income. The program's success is attributed to motivated individuals who carefully navigated the challenges of funding, curriculum development, and integrating with private child care providers. One key figure, Joe Eddins, closed a loophole in state law and created an official 4-year-old program, and also allowed public elementary schools to hire existing qualified providers to teach the voluntary pre-K program, easing the concerns of private facilities. Other states can learn from Oklahoma's focus on the "how" rather than the "why," emphasizing the importance of keeping the child care industry afloat while developing an appropriate curriculum and building enough facilities.</p>

          <p>Despite efforts to reduce reliance on Russian energy, the EU has increased its imports of Russian fertilizer since the invasion of Ukraine. Russia's share of EU fertilizer imports has risen significantly, prompting the European Parliament to endorse tariffs on fertilizers from Russia and Belarus. The EU's reliance on Russian fertilizer is due to Russia's specialization in nitrogen-based fertilizers produced with cheap gas. The EU plans to gradually eliminate Russian fertilizer imports by 2028, seeking alternative markets and promoting organic fertilizer production.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the increasing use of military equipment and tactics by local police forces poses a growing danger to communities. The author contends that blurring the lines between police and military erodes the civilian character of policing and can lead to the targeting of American citizens. The piece highlights the 1033 Program, which funnels military-grade equipment to local agencies, and the "warrior mindset" that encourages officers to view themselves as combatants rather than community servants. The author suggests that this trend undermines civil liberties and contributes to a more militarized and less accountable law enforcement system.</p>

          <p>Air quality regulators in Southern California are considering new rules to phase out the sale of gas-powered furnaces and water heaters. The proposed regulations aim to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, a key component of smog, by setting zero-emission sales targets for manufacturers. While the rules would not ban gas-powered appliances outright, they would impose surcharges on manufacturers for those units. The plan has drawn support from environmental groups but faces opposition from gas-appliance manufacturers and others concerned about costs and grid reliability.</p>

          <h2>California Freshwater Fish Found Teeming with Parasites</h2>

          <p>Researchers have discovered that over 90% of popular freshwater fish in Southern California are carrying human-infecting parasites, posing a health risk to those who consume freshly caught fish. The parasites, called trematodes, can cause gastrointestinal problems and other health issues. To protect against infection, health officials advise thoroughly cooking freshwater fish or freezing it before consumption. The parasites were likely introduced to the U.S. by the red-rimmed melania, or Malaysian trumpet snail, which is host to a number of parasitic species.</p>

          <h2>Brain Research Reveals How Experiences Lead to Emotions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Stanford University have identified a process in the brain that explains how experiences lead to emotions. The process involves a signal that lingers in the brain after a positive or negative experience, creating a broader emotional state. The study suggests that this sustained signal is crucial for emotions to generalize and interact with other experiences. This discovery could potentially help explain emotional differences seen in some neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>
