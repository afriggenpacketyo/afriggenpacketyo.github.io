          <p>China is considering initiating trade negotiations with the United States after receiving overtures from senior U.S. officials. However, China insists that the U.S. must first demonstrate sincerity by removing all unilateral tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. A spokesperson for the commerce ministry stated that failure to remove the tariffs would compromise mutual trust and indicate a lack of sincerity from Washington. This announcement follows a period of conflicting statements from both sides regarding potential talks, as both countries seek to avoid appearing to back down first.</p>

          <p>Marine biologists with the Tennessee Valley Authority are conducting fish population surveys in Douglas Lake, Tennessee, to assess the impact of debris from Hurricane Helene. The surveys, the first since the hurricane seven months ago, aim to determine if the excessive debris has affected the sport fish population. The collected data will be compared to previous surveys to identify any abnormalities, such as fewer fish or deformities. Douglas Lake relies heavily on sport fishing for tourism revenue, making the health of the fish population crucial for the local economy.</p>

          <p>The Senate has voted to overturn an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule under the Clean Air Act that limits emissions of seven hazardous air pollutants from heavy industry. The 52-46 party-line vote marks the first time Congress has moved to weaken the Clean Air Act in its 55-year history. Republicans argue that the rule disincentivizes companies from adopting new pollution reduction technologies, while Democrats and environmental groups contend that the move will endanger public health by allowing industrial facilities to release toxic air pollutants, including dioxins, mercury, and PCBs. The joint resolution now goes to the House, where it is also expected to pass.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to escalate tariff negotiations, with the goal of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement as early as June. Following meetings in Washington, Japan's chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa announced that ministerial discussions would intensify from mid-May after working-level talks. While Japan aims to protect its national interests, the possibility of a deal between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump in June is being considered. Discussions included non-tariff barriers and economic security cooperation, though defense spending and currency rates were not addressed.</p>

This response comes after the U.S. levied high tariffs on Chinese products, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. While U.S. officials have expressed hope for progress in easing trade tensions, China remains firm in its demand for the removal of unilateral tariffs as a prerequisite for meaningful dialogue.</p>

          <p>Japan's average unemployment rate in fiscal year 2024 decreased to 2.5%, marking the first improvement in two years, driven by a labor shortage. The number of employed individuals reached its highest level since 1953. The job availability ratio remained above 1.00, indicating a tight labor market despite a slight decrease. While some sectors experienced growth in new job openings, others saw declines, reflecting shifts in the economy. Economists suggest that the labor shortage is likely to persist, despite the dip in job openings data.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio has taken on multiple roles within the Trump administration, including Secretary of State, Acting Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Acting Archivist for the National Archives and Records Administration, and Interim National Security Advisor. This accumulation of titles raises questions about his ability to effectively manage all responsibilities, especially given President Trump's unconventional approach to governance. The sudden appointment to multiple roles highlights the trust placed in Rubio by Trump and his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, but also raises practical concerns about delegation and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor and nominated him as ambassador to the United Nations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily replace Waltz, continuing as America's top diplomat. Waltz faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed, potentially affecting his confirmation hearings. Sources indicate that Trump respects Waltz but decided to give him a "soft landing" with a high-profile new post, while others suggest the administration believed Waltz might struggle to be confirmed by the Senate.</p>

The results were mixed compared with Wall Street’s expectations, leading to a drop in Amazon’s stock price after hours. The online sales of products it offers directly to customers grew 5 percent to $57.4 billion, and the services it provides to sellers who list products on its site grew 6 percent to $36.5 billion.</p>

          <p>Apple is shifting the production of iPhones sold in the U.S. from China to India in response to President Trump's tariffs. The tech giant says devices sold in the US will no longer come from China, as the tech giant tries to mitigate the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs. Most iPhones will be sourced from India instead, with iPads coming from Vietnam, to prevent dramatic price rises for American consumers. Apple CEO Tim Cook believes the tariffs will add significant costs during the current quarter if Trump's policies don't change, despite limited impact so far.</p>

The administration seeks to overturn a lower court ruling that blocked the termination of TPS, which would affect hundreds of thousands of immigrants. The administration argues that the law creating the TPS program bars judicial review of executive branch decisions regarding the designation or termination of a foreign state's protected status.
