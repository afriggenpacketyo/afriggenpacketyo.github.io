          <h2>German Military Survey Finds Limited Extremist Attitudes Among Soldiers</h2>

          <p>A new internal survey by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences found that fewer than 1% of German soldiers harbor right-wing extremist attitudes. While the report offers some relief amid recent stories of far-right networks within the military, it also found that 6.4% of soldiers have chauvinist attitudes and 3.5% have xenophobic attitudes. Some researchers are skeptical of the survey's safeguards and whether the Bundeswehr is doing enough to keep extremist attitudes out of the military, especially with the rise of right-wing attitudes in society. The German military has stronger anti-extremism measures in place than most NATO countries.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that 87.1% of respondents believe the Japanese government's measures to control the surge in rice prices are insufficient. This comes amid growing concerns about the impact of rising food costs on households and businesses. The survey highlights public dissatisfaction with the current strategies to address the issue. The Japanese government is expected to consider additional measures to stabilize rice prices and mitigate the impact on consumers.</p>

          <p>A survey indicates that 74% of respondents in Japan do not anticipate a favorable outcome from the ongoing Japan-U.S. tariff negotiations. This reflects widespread skepticism about the potential for these talks to yield benefits for Japan. Concerns likely stem from previous trade disputes and the perceived imbalance in economic power between the two countries. The results suggest a need for the Japanese government to manage expectations and address public concerns regarding the tariff discussions.</p>

          <p>While Europe is revitalizing its sleeper train network to compete with short-haul flights, the United States faces transportation challenges with slashed funding and decaying infrastructure. The author contrasts Europe's investment in rail with America's car-centric culture and focus on unproven technologies. The article suggests that revitalized railways in the US could offer a more sustainable and connected way forward, fostering community and shared purpose. The author points to the secrets to China's fantastically successful matrix of high-speed railways which are clear: consistency of vision, courage of conviction, a successful nationwide rollout and, crucially, adequate funding.</p>

The front-runners are RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski, a pro-EU Warsaw Mayor, and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian. Trzaskowski supports abortion rights and LGBTQ protections, while Nawrocki champions conservative values and national sovereignty. The election is also testing the strength of far-right candidate SÅ‚awomir Mentzen, who blends MAGA rhetoric with libertarian economics.

          <p>A bloody, bare footprint found at the 1993 Minneapolis murder scene of Jeanie Childs led to a decades-long search for her killer. Investigators initially suspected Arthur Gray, Childs' roommate, but he had an alibi and his footprints didn't match. In 2015, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile found throughout the crime scene. Investigative genetic genealogy linked the DNA to Jerry Westrom, who was arrested in 2019. Despite Westrom's denial, his DNA matched semen found on a comforter and towel at the scene, and a forensic scientist confirmed that a bloody footprint belonged to him.</p>

          <p>China is shifting its approach to funding infrastructure projects in Africa by using public-private partnerships (PPPs). This model grants Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, moving away from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. Projects such as Nairobiâ€™s mega-highway and Zambiaâ€™s Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are now being funded through PPPs. During Kenyan President William Rutoâ€™s visit to China, he sought funding to extend the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to Uganda, with Chinese contractors gaining exclusive rights to operate the railway for at least 25 years.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to delay expanding Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and charge current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" a monthly fee of $100 starting in 2027, citing budget deficits. These changes are part of Newsom's May revision to address a $12 billion state budget deficit, partly attributed to tariffs from President Donald Trump and rising healthcare costs. The plan aims to suspend access to comprehensive Medi-Cal services for undocumented adults over 19, though children and those already enrolled would not be affected. The proposed policies are expected to save California $5.4 billion by the 2028-29 fiscal year.</p>

          <p>Germany is planning to make its military the "strongest conventional army in Europe" and is considering increasing its defense spending to 5% of GDP. Other EU countries, including France and Poland, also have ambitious plans to modernize and expand their armed forces amid rising security concerns. Poland aims to have 500,000 troops, while the UK focuses on high tech like drones and AI. Despite these increases, the global firepower ranking is unlikely to change significantly in the medium term.</p>

          <p>China announced anti-dumping duties on imports of POM copolymers, a type of engineering plastic, from the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Taiwan, with rates as high as 74.9%. This action follows a probe launched in May 2024 after the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese goods. The highest duties were levied on imports from the United States, while European shipments face 34.5% duties. The move comes amid hopes that the U.S.-China trade war is easing, with both sides agreeing to reduce tariffs in a 90-day truce.</p>

This change reflects a desire for stability and economic opportunities in the region, even if it means diverging from Israel's preferred policies.</p>
