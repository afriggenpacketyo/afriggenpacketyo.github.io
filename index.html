          <p>Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha lauded the new Champions League format, highlighting the exciting and unpredictable nature of the competition after PSG's win. He noted that teams playing each other only once added a unique dynamic, allowing lesser teams to showcase their energy and skill. Journalist Nicky Bandini emphasized that the format allowed PSG to develop throughout the season, providing a more entertaining journey for viewers. The article suggests that the new format benefits teams by allowing them to find form at the right time, as demonstrated by PSG's late resurgence and eventual triumph.</p>

          <p>The United States has presented Iran with a proposal for a nuclear deal, confirmed by the White House after a report by the UN nuclear watchdog highlighted Iran's increased enriched uranium production. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated he received "elements of a US deal" from his Omani counterpart. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized that accepting the deal is in Tehran's best interest, with President Trump determined to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The IAEA report indicated Iran possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, raising concerns about its potential use for nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have criticized Hamas's response to the proposed Gaza cease-fire, stating that it "only takes us backward." Hamas is reportedly seeking changes regarding guarantees for a permanent end to the conflict, which has long been a significant point of contention with Israel. The U.S. has been working to mediate a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas to bring an end to the ongoing hostilities in the region. The core sticking point remains the establishment of a permanent end to the war, which both sides have struggled to agree upon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Singapore-based scientist has warned that Chinaâ€™s quantum satellite, Micius, could be vulnerable to hacking due to slight delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could be exploited by eavesdroppers during quantum key distribution (QKD), a method of information transfer relying on quantum physics-based cryptography. Quantum researcher Alexander Miller analyzed data from Micius and found that these time delays compromise the security of quantum keys distributed from the satellite. While QKD is theoretically unhackable, flaws in experimental implementation can create vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S. draft ceasefire proposal for Gaza, requesting amendments while reiterating demands for a permanent truce, complete Israeli withdrawal, and continuous humanitarian aid flow. Steve Witkoff, the U.S. envoy, deemed the response "totally unacceptable," urging Hamas to accept the original framework. Hamas proposed releasing 10 living Israeli hostages and 18 dead hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The group is facing pressure from both the international community and the dire conditions of Palestinians in Gaza, struggling to accept a proposal seen as less generous than previous offers.</p>

          <p>A confidential report by the United Nations nuclear watchdog reveals that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. The report, issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), urges Tehran to urgently change course and comply with the agency's probe. As of May 17, Iran has amassed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, a significant increase since February, bringing it closer to weapons-grade levels. The IAEA has warned that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, raising serious concerns about proliferation implications.</p>

          <p>UFC Hall of Famer B.J. Penn was arrested for the third time in six days in Hawaii due to his failure to appear in court, violating his bail agreement. This arrest is connected to his ongoing claims that his family has been murdered and replaced with imposters. Penn's mother, Lorraine Shin, filed a temporary restraining order against him, alleging extreme psychological abuse and stating her belief that Penn suffers from Capgras syndrome. Shin claims that Penn has accused her of being an imposter who "killed his family" to gain control of their assets.</p>

Critics point to the use of short-term land access for communities, the cultivation of single cash crops, and the clearing of native forests.
