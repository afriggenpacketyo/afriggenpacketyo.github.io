          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa will not run for a third term in 2026, according to a senior GOP official familiar with her plans. First elected in 2014 as the first female combat veteran in the Senate, her departure is expected to set off a highly competitive race for the open seat. Representative Ashley Hinson is reportedly preparing to launch a campaign, while several Democrats have already announced their intention to run. This development creates a significant political contest in a state that has increasingly favored Republicans in recent federal elections.</p>

Jordan was a cornerstone of the team's famed "Doomsday Defense" and a key player on their first Super Bowl-winning team in 1971. A five-time Pro Bowler and a member of the Cowboys' Ring of Honor, he remains second on the team's all-time tackles list. The announcement mourns the loss of a franchise icon who was celebrated for his leadership and fearless play throughout his career from 1963 to 1976.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned reports of a potential Trump administration plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the idea an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his office has not been consulted and suggested the move may have ulterior motives beyond crime reduction, possibly related to influencing future elections. The statement comes amid reports that the Pentagon is drafting plans for a National Guard deployment. The White House responded by criticizing Pritzker for deflecting from the city's crime issues, escalating the political tensions between state and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to global diplomacy. As a leader of an economic powerhouse that bridges competing ideologies, Indonesia is not confined to a single political camp. The article argues that Prabowo's philosophy of "constructive pragmatism" could serve as a model for an international system often paralyzed by competing national interests. This approach emphasizes practical cooperation over ideological confrontation, potentially offering a new road map for middle powers to navigate complex global challenges.</p>

          <h2>Chicago Mayor Issues Executive Order to Counter Potential Federal Deployment</h2>

          <p>In response to potential federal intervention, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights. The largely symbolic "Protecting Chicago Initiative" seeks to bar federal agents from wearing masks, require them to display identifying information, and prevent the deputization of local police for federal actions. Johnson stated the order makes it clear that the city will resist any attempts to deploy armed forces or conduct operations that could violate civil liberties. The move formalizes the city's opposition to federal deployments, which the mayor described as a looming militarized action.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of 'Frankenstein' has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, drawing a range of critical responses. The Netflix-produced film, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as the creature, is described as an ambitious, large-scale project that del Toro has wanted to make for decades. While some critics praised it as one of the director's finest works for its artistry and emotional depth, others found it lengthy and lacking substance. The film explores the story from both the creator's and the creature's perspectives, reflecting del Toro's signature empathy for monstrous characters.</p>

For decades, it was believed she was killed in an ambush intended for him, but modern forensic analysis revealed inconsistencies in Pusser's account. Evidence suggests the crime scene was staged and that a gunshot wound to Pusser's cheek was likely self-inflicted. Officials now believe Pauline Pusser was killed by an act of intimate partner violence, a conclusion that brings closure to her family after 58 years.</p>

Police said the 23-year-old shooter fired a rifle through church windows during a school Mass, using legally purchased firearms. Investigators are exploring a motive, noting the shooter had an obsession with past mass shootings and posted a manifesto-style video online as the attack unfolded.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Ruling Voids Many of Trump's 'Reciprocal Tariffs'</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's broad "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on most countries are illegal, stating he overstepped his authority. The court found that the power to implement such widespread levies resides with Congress, not the president under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The decision puts tariffs affecting a majority of U.S. goods imports on uncertain legal ground, though sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum remain unaffected. The Trump administration has announced its intention to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, child development experts generally agree on precautionary principles for children's screen time. For the first few years, they recommend minimal to no screen time to allow for crucial exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. As children age, the focus shifts from time limits to content quality and parental supervision, with recommendations gradually increasing to about two hours for older teenagers. Experts stress that excessive screen time can negatively impact language skills, motor development, and social interaction, urging parents to foster a balanced digital life.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor and former Bridgewater strategist Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, such as his move to fire Governor Lisa Cook, could threaten the central bank's crucial independence. Patterson argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy, leading to negative long-term economic consequences like higher inflation and weaker market performance. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, she believes the damage to institutional integrity would ultimately harm the U.S. economy and its global standing.

The call for resignation follows the firing of the CDC director and the subsequent resignation of four other top officials in protest.
