          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 19:23:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has initiated a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, and The Wall Street Journal. The suit alleges the newspaper falsely reported that Trump sent a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which included a hand-drawn naked woman. Trump vehemently denies authoring the letter, labeling the story as malicious and a failure of journalistic ethics. The legal action targets the media conglomerate's leadership and the two reporters who wrote the article, escalating the conflict between the former president and the media outlet.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has revised its internal policies to prevent engineers based in China from providing technical support for its U.S. defense and government cloud clients. This change follows a ProPublica report detailing national security risks associated with the previous "digital escort" system, where U.S. staff supervised more technically proficient engineers in China. The move impacts Microsoft's Azure cloud division, a significant revenue generator, and aims to bolster cybersecurity for sensitive government contracts. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the old system unacceptable and announced a broader review of similar vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is receiving criticism for amplifying a story about a woman allegedly kidnapped by ICE, which federal authorities now claim was a hoax. The Department of Homeland Security publicly corrected the mayor, stating the woman, an undocumented immigrant, fabricated the story and has been charged with conspiracy and making false statements. The incident involved the woman claiming she was abducted and pressured to self-deport, leading to a large-scale investigation. The case has drawn mockery from political opponents and highlights the tense political climate surrounding U.S. immigration enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pest control experts and entomologists in the United Kingdom report that wasp populations appear to be unusually high this summer. The increase is attributed to favorable weather conditions, specifically a very warm and dry spring, which has allowed wasp colonies to thrive. While official scientific data is not yet available, anecdotal evidence points to larger nests appearing earlier in the season. Despite their unpopularity, experts emphasize the crucial ecological role of wasps as apex predators and natural pest controllers, and they offer advice on how to coexist with the insects without getting stung.</p>

          <p>The popular cooking show 'MasterChef' is in crisis following the dismissal of both its presenters, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, due to misconduct allegations. An internal inquiry upheld over 40 claims against Wallace, including unwelcome physical contact, while Torode was fired after a complaint of using a racist term was substantiated. The BBC News investigation reveals a tense backstage environment, a breakdown in the presenters' relationship, and a production team initially trying to downplay the issues.

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein case continues to be a focal point for many Donald Trump supporters, who view it as evidence of a corrupt "deep state" protecting a global elite. This fixation presents a challenge for Trump, who has tried to dismiss the case as "boring" while also feeling pressure from his base to release more files. The narrative is fueled by conspiracy theories like QAnon, which posited that a cabal of powerful figures engages in child trafficking. Recent developments, including a report about a letter from Trump to Epstein, have forced the former president to re-engage with the issue.</p>

The play, written by a "Motherland" co-creator, is a spoof inspired by "The Lord of the Rings" and a tabloid myth about Coleen throwing away her engagement ring. The production affectionately portrays the couple as heroic fantasy characters on a quest, celebrating their resilience through public highs and lows. The show is characteristic of the Royal Court theatre's focus on original, locally relevant comedies designed to entertain its audience.</p>

          <p>The announcement that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will end in 2026 has ignited questions about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format. CBS cited financial pressures, as declining ad revenue and viewership in key demographics make the expensive productions difficult to sustain. However, the timing has raised concerns about political motives, as the cancellation followed Colbert's criticism of parent company Paramount's legal settlement with Donald Trump. Analysts note that changing media consumption habits, with audiences preferring viral clips on social media over nightly broadcasts, pose a fundamental threat to the genre's existence.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between gut bacteria and a genetic variant that may trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study, published in Science Immunology, found that a molecule produced by certain gut bacteria can over-activate an immune protein called STING in individuals with a faulty "brake" gene, OTUD3. This unchecked immune response leads to chronic inflammation in the colon. The findings help explain the unpredictable nature of the disease and why treatments vary in effectiveness, opening the door for more personalized, targeted therapies for the chronic condition.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has struggled to manage the intense and persistent focus on the Jeffrey Epstein case from its own supporters, who demand transparency and believe in widespread conspiracies. Internally, officials debated various strategies to quell the furor before President Trump, frustrated by what he saw as disloyalty, reversed course and ordered the DOJ to seek the unsealing of grand jury records. This move was prompted by a Wall Street Journal report about an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, underscoring the political difficulty of distancing himself from his past association with the disgraced financier.</p>

          <p>A $50 million civil lawsuit accusing sports media personality Shannon Sharpe of sexual assault has been settled out of court.

The attorney for the accuser announced that a "mutually agreed upon resolution" had been reached after respectful negotiations, and the lawsuit will be dismissed. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, and Sharpe's legal team confirmed the matter is now considered closed. Sharpe had previously denied all the allegations.</p>

          <p>Facing stiff competition from rivals like OpenAI and Google, Meta is overhauling its artificial intelligence efforts with a new division called Meta Superintelligence Labs. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been personally recruiting top researchers with the goal of building "personal superintelligence for everyone," a significant pivot after its initial Llama models struggled to lead the market. This new push involves massive investment in data centers and a more focused, cloistered team, but it also raises questions about the company's commitment to its original open-source AI strategy. The restructuring aims to integrate AI more deeply into Meta's core products.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is cautiously navigating trade talks with the United States, having so far avoided steep tariffs that the Trump administration threatened earlier this year. The U.S. had paused proposed tariffs, including a 32% rate for Taiwan, to allow for a 90-day negotiation period with major trading partners. While multiple rounds of talks have occurred, the absence of a final agreement leaves Taiwanese officials on edge. Analysts believe both sides are actively working towards a deal to keep tariffs manageable, given Taiwan's crucial role as a supplier of advanced semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>

They are questioning whether the move was politically motivated, noting it came just days after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount for a legal settlement with Donald Trump. The politicians suggest the cancellation could be an attempt to curry favor with the Trump administration, especially as Paramount seeks federal approval for a major merger. CBS maintains the decision was "purely a financial" one, a claim met with skepticism.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor, viewing him as a flight risk ahead of his trial on charges of plotting a coup. The court also imposed a curfew and barred him from contacting foreign diplomats after alleging he sought U.S. interference to undermine Brazil's judiciary. The move escalates a feud with the U.S., as President Trump has demanded the case be dropped and threatened tariffs. Brazilian President Lula da Silva has rejected the threats as "blackmail," vowing not to bow to foreign pressure.</p>

          <p>The latest animated "Smurfs" movie is receiving a negative review, described as a "messy, strained" and incoherent film that fails to capture the charm of the original characters. The reviewer criticizes the plot, which involves a convoluted multiverse-style adventure, as feeling random and beholden to modern superhero trends rather than enchanting storytelling. The voice cast, including Rihanna and James Corden, is described as "phoned in," and the film's reliance on fast-paced, noisy gags is seen as a weapon of mass distraction. Ultimately, the movie is panned for failing to sell its message of togetherness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of recent congressional votes reveals a pattern of Republican lawmakers publicly criticizing legislative proposals from the Trump administration, only to vote in favor of them. Senators like Josh Hawley and Lisa Murkowski have lamented measures such as Medicaid cuts but ultimately provided the votes for their passage, with some hoping the House would alter the bills they just approved. This "Vote Yes, Hope No" tendency is seen as an abdication of legislative responsibility and a surrender of congressional power to the executive branch. The dynamic allows the White House to advance its agenda despite reservations in its own party.</p>
