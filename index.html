          <p>Nationwide protests in Kenya against President William Ruto's government have resulted in at least 16 deaths and 400 injuries, according to Amnesty Kenya. Protesters, some chanting "Ruto must go," clashed with police, who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds. The government initially banned live TV and radio coverage of the demonstrations, but the High Court overturned this decree. President Ruto urged protesters to maintain peace and stability, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding the nation amidst the unrest. The injured included three police officers, with some requiring specialized treatment for gunshot wounds. </p>

          <p>The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against the entire Maryland federal judiciary regarding a standing order that prevents the deportation of undocumented immigrants for at least one day after they file a legal challenge to their detention. The DOJ argues that this order constitutes an unlawful use of equitable powers to restrain the Executive branch. The standing order was issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland amidst a surge of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's deportation policies. As a result of the lawsuit, no judge in the district can oversee the case, prompting the DOJ to request recusal from all judges and a referral to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. </p>

This arrest follows previous backlash Johnson faced for admitting he lied about steroid use, after building his brand around an "ancestral lifestyle."

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's apparent victory in the New York mayoral primary election is seen by some as a potential turning point for the Democratic party, which has struggled to find its footing since November. Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, defeated Andrew Cuomo, a figure representing the old guard of the party. His campaign focused on grassroots organizing, digital engagement, and substantive policy proposals, resonating with voters concerned about affordability and economic inequality. While some in the Democratic establishment are wary of Mamdani's progressive platform, his victory highlights the potential for a new generation of leaders to connect with voters and offer solutions to pressing issues. </p>

          <p>Arsenal has reportedly reached an agreement with Brentford to sign midfielder Christian Norgaard for an initial fee of Â£10 million, potentially rising to Â£15 million with add-ons. This move comes as Thomas Partey's contract with Arsenal nears expiration, with no agreement yet reached on a new deal. Manager Mikel Arteta is said to have preferred Norgaard due to his Premier League experience. The 31-year-old Danish international is expected to undergo a medical before finalizing the transfer. </p>
