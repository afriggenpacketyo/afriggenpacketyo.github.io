          <p>France is grappling with significant economic instability, as Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's government faces a likely no-confidence vote over its budget-cutting proposals, which are crucial for reining in the nation's substantial public debt. With sovereign debt reaching 113% of GDP and projected to rise, alongside the EU's largest budget deficit, financial markets are responding with increased risk premiums on French bonds. Experts warn that if the eurozone's second-largest economy loses control of its finances amid political destabilization, it could trigger a broader debt crisis. The article also notes the EU Commission's past leniency towards France and the challenge of implementing reforms due to strong political opposition, further complicated by upcoming union strikes.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Angela Rayner's resignation has prompted a significant reshuffle within the UK Labour government, with newspapers describing the situation as a "Nightmare on Downing Street" and the party in "meltdown." The extensive changes, occurring just over a year after a landslide election, reflect deep concerns about the government's declining poll numbers and the rise of Reform UK. Critics question the effectiveness of merely moving ministers to new roles, while some lament the loss of Rayner's ability to connect with diverse voter bases. The article suggests Downing Street hopes the new team can counter political threats and challenge Nigel Farage, aiming to restore order and regain momentum.</p>

          <p>A man has tragically died on Long Reef Beach in Sydney following a suspected attack by a large shark, leading to the immediate closure of popular Northern Beaches areas. Emergency services recovered the man from the morning surf, but he succumbed to his critical injuries at the scene, with two sections of a surfboard also found for expert examination. Authorities are actively working to confirm the victim's identity and determine the specific shark species involved in this rare incident, which marks the first fatal shark attack in the Sydney area since 2022. While Australia records about 20 shark attacks annually, fatalities historically remain uncommon.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting in Beijing, Vladimir Putin reiterated Russia's uncompromising stance on the Ukraine war, warning that any Western troops, including peacekeepers, would be "legitimate targets for destruction." His remarks, met with applause in Vladivostok, highlight the Kremlin's confidence, fueled by perceived battlefield initiative and diplomatic successes with allies like China. The article notes Putin's dismissal of peace proposals from leaders like Donald Trump, indicating Russia's vision for peace involves a victory on its own terms and a new global order. This analysis suggests a continued divergence in peace expectations between Russia and Western allies, making a resolution seem distant.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has proposed a compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could make him the world's first trillionaire if the company achieves rigorous benchmarks over the next decade.
