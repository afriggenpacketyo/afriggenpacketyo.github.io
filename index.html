            <p>Gold prices have surged to a record high, exceeding $3,400 per ounce, as President Trump's policies, including threats to the Federal Reserve's independence and imposition of tariffs, erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy. Investors are flocking to gold as a safe haven asset amid a weakening dollar and concerns about U.S. economic growth. Trump has intensified pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, further destabilizing markets. Analysts predict gold prices could reach $3,500 in the coming months due to strong central bank demand and tariff-related growth concerns.</p>

            <p>As major tech companies like Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia prepare for first-quarter earnings reports, they are grappling with significant uncertainty due to President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies. These tariffs impact manufacturing costs, advertising spending, and consumer behavior, making future planning difficult for businesses. Tesla faces challenges with suppliers in Mexico and China, while Alphabet is concerned about ad spending and cloud infrastructure costs. Meta worries about the impact on digital ad revenue, especially from Chinese advertisers like Temu and Shein, and Microsoft is assessing the impact on its customer base. Amazon faces headwinds due to its reliance on third-party merchants sourcing products from China, and Apple's manufacturing in Asia is heavily exposed to tariff risks. Nvidia's AI server costs could rise due to tariffs, affecting its sales and profit margins. (not investment advice)</p>

The company also discussed a potential revenue run rate of $1 billion or more on the call. This follows reports that xAI was raising up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation to acquire Nvidia chips.</p>

Boorman details in her new book that Biles had difficulty twisting in 2016 after the 2015 world championships, causing her to fear getting lost in the air. Biles eventually regained her ability to twist in time for the 2016 Olympics, where she won four gold medals.</p>

            <p>The growing friendship industry, comprised of ventures aiming to combat loneliness, faces criticism for its simplistic approach of merely connecting people without addressing the underlying issues. While these startups facilitate social gatherings, they often fail to foster the consistency, positivity, and vulnerability needed for genuine intimacy. Experts argue that loneliness is more about the quality of relationships than the quantity, and that structural issues like affordability and access to mental health treatment also contribute to the problem. The article suggests focusing on nurturing existing friendships and addressing societal factors that contribute to loneliness rather than relying solely on fleeting social events.</p>

            <p>Stocks fell sharply as President Trump renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, branding him a "major loser." The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all experienced significant declines. Investors are grappling with ongoing tariff uncertainty and awaiting earnings reports from major technology companies. Trump's pressure on Powell to lower interest rates has fueled investor concerns about the Fed's independence and potential impacts on economic activity.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump "stands strongly behind Pete Hegseth", the White House says, after reports that military attack details were shared in a group chat that included the US defense secretary's wife, brother, and personal lawyer. The controversy comes a month after a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which US cabinet officials, including Hegseth, discussed plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen. When questioned by reporters on Monday, Hegseth claimed the media was "full of hoaxsters" who "try to slash and burn people" but did not directly respond to the story about the second Signal chat, which was initially reported by the New York Times.</p>
