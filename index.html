          <p>Graham Potter's managerial career has suffered two significant setbacks with his recent dismissals from Chelsea and West Ham, following a period where he was considered a potential England successor. His tenure at West Ham lasted only eight months, marked by poor results and a failure to connect with fans, mirroring the chaotic environment he cited at Chelsea. Potter, known for meticulous coaching and building teams at Brighton, now faces questions about his future in top-flight football, having seen his reputation significantly tarnished by these high-profile failures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations has reimposed sweeping sanctions on Iran, freezing assets and halting arms deals, through a "snapback" mechanism after European nations cited Iran's non-compliance with its nuclear deal. This move further exacerbates Iran's already struggling economy, with the rial at a record low and food prices soaring, causing widespread anxiety among its populace. The sanctions come amidst fears of renewed conflict with Israel and the US, and a reported surge in executions within the Islamic Republic, highlighting a period of intense pressure and instability for the country.</p>

          <p>Swiss voters are participating in a second national referendum to decide on the introduction of electronic identity cards, after a previous proposal was rejected over privacy concerns. The revised plan ensures the system remains optional, publicly controlled, and stores data on individual smartphones rather than centrally. Supporters argue the digital ID will streamline online bureaucratic procedures, while opponents still fear potential privacy erosion and tracking, despite previous public satisfaction with a COVID ID system. The government recommends a "yes" vote, with opinion polls suggesting a greater readiness for approval this time.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United, despite having a physically imposing squad and a dedicated set-piece coach, has struggled to convert set-play opportunities into goals this season, a concern acknowledged by head coach Eddie Howe. The team, known for its height and tactical discipline, has only scored once from set-pieces in all competitions, contrasting sharply with opponents like Arsenal. While new strategies, including long throws, have been introduced, the article highlights the ongoing challenge for Newcastle to consistently exploit dead-ball situations and match their defensive set-piece strength with offensive effectiveness.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that the latest "framework consensus" for Trump's TikTok deal, while appearing to be a US victory, may ultimately serve President Xi Jinping's strategic interests by leaving China with significant leverage. Despite increasing US ownership of TikTok's American operations to 80%, ByteDance, the Chinese parent company, remains the single largest shareholder with just under 20%. The article argues that this arrangement, alongside the US paying a multi-billion dollar fee, means American data, servers, and algorithms are not entirely free from Chinese influence.</p>

          <p>This opinion article criticizes Donald Trump's recent comments on autism, which framed it as a tragedy needing a "cure," and highlights the valuable qualities often found in autistic individuals. The author contrasts Trump's "scattergun approach" and numerous false claims with the deep focus, adherence to facts, strong sense of social justice, and exceptional memory frequently observed in autistic people. The article emphasizes that autistic joy and capacity for profound empathy offer important lessons, suggesting that humanity's essence lies in love rather than the divisive rhetoric often employed by political figures.</p>

This shift, while in its early stages, indicates a potential redefinition of global power dynamics and international relations, where ideological differences become less central.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their quirky yet inventive study on smelly shoes and the design of a UVC light-equipped shoe rack. Their research, sparked by observing students leaving footwear outside hostel rooms due to odor, scientifically identified bacteria as the culprit and proved that short bursts of UVC light could effectively sterilize shoes and eliminate the stench. The award celebrates their "make people laugh, then think" approach to an everyday problem, combining humor with scientific inquiry.</p>

          <p>Starbucks workers are conducting nationwide rallies, including in Los Angeles, to pressure the company to resume stalled contract negotiations that broke down in December. These protests coincide with Starbucks' announcement of closing hundreds of stores and laying off nearly 1,000 employees, and recent legal actions by workers over a new dress code without reimbursement. The union, Starbucks Workers United, accuses the company of implementing policies without bargaining and warns of potential strikes, while Starbucks asserts the union is to blame for the impasse and highlights its competitive benefits.</p>

          <p>A long-standing and violent 25-year feud between Scotland's Lyons and Daniel crime families has escalated with the recent arrests of four major figures in Dubai, highlighting the global reach of their drug trafficking and gangland activities. The feud, rooted in a 2001 cocaine theft, has involved multiple murders and brutal assaults, intensifying after the death of Jamie Daniel in 2016. Recent violence across Scotland, orchestrated from Dubai, prompted a police crackdown, culminating in these significant international arrests, though the exact charges and extradition prospects remain unclear.</p>
