          <p>A 41-year-old employee at a Tallahassee Chuck E. Cheese was arrested while wearing the mouse mascot costume for allegedly stealing a customer's debit card. The arrest, which occurred in front of children, followed an investigation aided by the victim, who tracked fraudulent charges and obtained security footage identifying the suspect. The employee, Jermel Jarreau Jones, faces felony charges for larceny and using the stolen card multiple times, though he claimed he had just found the card. The company has stated it has taken appropriate action regarding the employee.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, transferring control of assets like CBS and Paramount Pictures. The decision has drawn criticism due to its timing, following Paramount's $16 million settlement of a lawsuit from Donald Trump and the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert." FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, welcomed Skydance's commitment to eliminate DEI initiatives and address perceived conservative grievances. The lone Democratic commissioner dissented, arguing the deal erodes press freedom and was linked to the settlement.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major technology companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are not overspending on artificial intelligence, but are in fact underspending. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, justifying massive capital expenditures to secure a market-leading position. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased investment in cloud infrastructure, Cramer suggests that spending is both urgent and necessary to develop the most accurate AI models. He believes the company with the best chatbot could achieve a near-monopoly, leading to hundreds of billions in profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia escalated into deadly border clashes, involving artillery, rockets, and Thai airstrikes on what it called military sites. The conflict, which reportedly killed at least 12 people in Thailand, most of them civilians, was triggered by a landmine explosion that injured five Thai soldiers. Both nations have offered conflicting accounts of who initiated the violence, with Cambodia accusing Thailand of an unprovoked incursion. The United States has expressed grave concern and urged an immediate cessation of attacks and a peaceful resolution to the long-standing border disputes.</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, to be the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a move that allows her to serve in the role in an acting capacity. The decision came after a federal court declined to extend her interim appointment and instead named her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the post. Attorney General Pam Bondi sharply criticized the court's move, and the Justice Department subsequently removed Grace as first assistant. By withdrawing the formal nomination, the administration circumvents a law restricting acting appointments, creating a path for Habba to remain in charge of the office.</p>

The threat of "snapback" sanctions is the main leverage for the Europeans, but analysts warn that reimposing them could escalate tensions and close the door on future engagement.

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. In her ruling, Justice Maria Carroccia stated she did not find the complainant's testimony to be "credible or reliable," and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case. The trial centered on whether the woman, who was 20 at the time, had consented to all sexual acts that occurred. The players' lawyers argued she gave consent, while she testified she was intoxicated and fearful, consenting only to an initial act with one player.</p>

          <p>China is constructing a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river, located in Medog county in the southeastern Tibet autonomous region. This area is remote but geopolitically significant due to its proximity to the disputed border with India. The dam is a cornerstone of Beijing's strategy to develop the region, serving as both a major future energy source and a means to strengthen its security and control along the contested Himalayan frontier. The project underscores China's broader infrastructure and development goals in the strategically important Tibetan plateau.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created the world's largest barium gallium selenide (BGSe) crystal, a significant advancement for developing powerful laser weapons. The 60mm crystal can efficiently convert laser beams into mid- to far-infrared frequencies, which are ideal for long-distance transmission through the atmosphere. Notably, the material can withstand immense laser power, exceeding the damage threshold of existing military-grade crystals by an order of magnitude. This breakthrough could enable the development of ground-based lasers capable of targeting and disabling satellites in orbit, overcoming previous limitations where lasers would damage their own components.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission has approved the $8 billion merger of Paramount Global with Skydance Media, clearing the final regulatory obstacle for the deal. The approval followed a politically charged period, including a $16 million settlement paid by Paramount to Donald Trump over a "60 Minutes" interview. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr praised Skydance's commitments to address bias and cancel DEI initiatives, while the commission's lone Democrat dissented, calling the approval a blow to press freedom. The deal will see the Ellison family take control of the media giant, which includes CBS and Paramount Pictures.</p>

Maxwell's lawyer stated she answered all questions honestly during the full-day meeting, which comes amid political pressure on the Trump administration to release more information about the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The meeting's context is heightened by reports that Trump was told his name appears in Epstein-related files and by a House committee's vote to subpoena the Justice Department for those records.

          <p>The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to permit the cancellation of hundreds of National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants that it deems misaligned with its policy objectives. The administration wants to halt a lower court ruling that ordered the reinstatement of approximately $783 million in awards, many of which were tied to research on gender identity and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The grants were terminated following executive orders directing federal agencies to end funding for such programs. The Solicitor General argued that lower courts should not be allowed to elevate their policy judgments over those of the Executive Branch.</p>

Corbyn, who now sits as an independent, stated the new venture will be community-led and grassroots-focused.
