Authorities confirmed that the operation has transitioned from a rescue to a recovery mission, stating there is no hope of finding survivors. The powerful explosion, which was felt for miles, leveled a building at the 1,300-acre facility that manufactures explosives for military and commercial use.

          <p>Tensions over federal enforcement actions were highlighted as National Guard troops began patrols in Memphis, Tennessee, for the first time. Simultaneously, Democratic Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth were barred from entering an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Broadview, Illinois, which they intended to inspect. The senators criticized the lack of transparency, suggesting the agency was hiding something from congressional oversight. These events coincide with federal court rulings in Illinois and Oregon that have blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Chicago and Portland.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five British army horses that bolted and galloped through central London last year, has been retired to a sanctuary due to the severity of his injuries. The horse was spooked by construction noise and sustained a broken bone during the chaotic incident. After extensive veterinary care, it was determined that Quaker could not return to his ceremonial duties with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment. He will now live at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire, a peaceful conclusion to a highly publicised and traumatic event.</p>

Swinney presented this as the most realistic path forward, based on the precedent that led to the 2014 referendum.

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden has commenced radiation and hormone therapy for an aggressive form of prostate cancer, which was first diagnosed in May. According to his spokesperson, the treatment is part of a comprehensive care plan for the disease, which had metastasized to the bone. Biden, who will turn 83 next month, previously underwent a successful procedure in September to remove cancerous cells from his skin. His office stated that the prostate cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which generally allows for more effective management and a positive response to treatment.</p>

          <p>Spanish authorities have arrested the manager of an illegal breeding site after discovering a horrific scene of animal abuse in the village of Meson do Vento. Police found the corpses of 250 animals, mostly dogs, in various stages of decomposition inside a filthy warehouse. They also rescued 171 surviving animals, including exotic birds, which were in life-threatening condition and had resorted to feeding on the dead due to a lack of food and water. The site manager faces charges of animal abuse and illegal possession of protected species.</p>

          <p>A number of African nations are governed by elderly leaders, creating a stark contrast with the continent's median age of just 19. The article highlights Cameroon's President Paul Biya, who at 92 is the world's oldest non-royal leader and is seeking an eighth term after 43 years in power. Other long-serving, octogenarian leaders in countries like Equatorial Guinea, Ivory Coast, and Zimbabwe are also examined. This trend of gerontocracy persists despite growing frustration among younger generations who are increasingly protesting for political change and economic opportunity.</p>

          <p>A drone strike on a displacement shelter within a university in el-Fasher, Sudan, has killed dozens of people, including women and children. Local activists attributed the attack to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been besieging the city for 17 months. Eyewitnesses described horrific scenes as rescuers searched for survivors among the rubble, and already overwhelmed hospitals struggled to treat the wounded. The attack intensifies the humanitarian crisis in the city, which is the last army stronghold in the Darfur region.</p>

          <p>A potential peace deal between Israel and Hamas, reportedly brokered with the help of former U.S. President Donald Trump, is being analyzed as a possible turning point in the Gaza conflict. Political commentators suggest that pressure from Trump was a key factor in bringing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the negotiating table, given Israel's fundamental need for American support. While the details are still emerging, the agreement could represent a significant diplomatic breakthrough. The discussion now centers on the likelihood that the fragile peace will hold in the long term.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Australian soccer players are choosing to move to Major League Soccer (MLS) in North America to advance their careers and enhance their prospects for the national team. Players like Nashville SC's Patrick Yazbek have found the league to be a high-quality environment that provides more visibility than domestic or some European leagues. The trend is also creating opportunities for Australian coaches and staff within MLS clubs. The league's evolving strategy of developing younger talent alongside high-profile stars is making it an attractive destination for aspiring Australian athletes.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the recent ceasefire, Hamas has mobilized approximately 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control in parts of Gaza, raising concerns about potential internal violence. The deployment followed a deadly clash between Hamas forces and the powerful Dughmush clan, which resulted in several deaths. This move to "cleanse Gaza of outlaws" is seen by observers as an attempt by Hamas to maintain its authority. The proliferation of weapons looted during the war has created a volatile environment, with many Gazans fearing a slide into civil strife.</p>

          <p>In a recent television interview, former President Donald Trump made a series of mathematically impossible statements regarding future drug prices. He claimed that under his plans, prices for some prescription drugs would decrease by amounts such as "400 percent, 600 percent, a thousand percent." A reduction of 100 percent would make a product free, making any percentage beyond that nonsensical. He contrasted this with a one-eighth of one percent reduction achieved during his first term, which he had previously celebrated as a significant accomplishment.</p>

The company has been steadily increasing its stakes in the firms, which include Mitsui and Mitsubishi, with its ownership in some now exceeding 10%. The significant growth is due to both additional purchases and a substantial rise in the stock prices of the Japanese companies. (not investment advice)</p>
