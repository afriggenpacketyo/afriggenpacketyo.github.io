          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the mayoral race, framing the move as a necessary step to prevent Democratic Socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani from winning. During a joint appearance, Adams criticized Mamdani as a "snake oil salesman" and argued that his policies pose an "existential threat" to the city. This endorsement comes after Adams dropped his own reelection bid amidst low polling and federal charges, significantly reshaping the dynamics of the contentious election.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a larger number of California Democrats support Governor Gavin Newsom for a 2028 presidential run compared to former Vice President Kamala Harris. While Newsom maintains a positive overall approval rating in his home state, voters are more divided on whether he should pursue the presidency. The survey also explored Californians' perceptions of their state as a national model, finding positive views on technology and culture but negative opinions on housing and economic policy.</p>

          <p>The Senate has unanimously passed the IRS MATH Act, which aims to make the agency's "math error" notices clearer and more helpful for taxpayers. These notices are sent when the IRS finds simple clerical mistakes on tax returns, but critics have argued they are often confusing and don't adequately explain how to correct the error. The bill, which now goes to the president, is intended to make it easier for filers to understand and resolve these common issues without needing professional help.</p>

          <h2>Oil Prices Surge Over 5% Following New U.S. Sanctions on Russian Energy Companies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of oil jumped significantly after the Trump administration imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. The Treasury Department stated the sanctions were a response to Moscow's lack of commitment to a peace process in Ukraine and are intended to harm the Kremlin's ability to fund the war. The move, which follows the cancellation of a planned summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, caused global benchmark Brent crude to rise to $65.78 per barrel.</p>

          <h2>Key Florida Coral Species That Protect Coastlines Now 'Functionally Extinct' After Heat Wave</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 14:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in the journal *Science* reports that a record-breaking marine heat wave in 2023 has led to the "functional extinction" of elkhorn and staghorn corals in Florida. These two species are critical for building the reef's structure, which provides habitats for marine life and significantly reduces wave energy, protecting coastal communities from storm damage. The loss of nearly 100% of these corals means Florida's coastline is now more vulnerable, highlighting the severe, tangible impacts of climate change on ecosystems and human safety.</p>

          <p>The demolition of the White House East Wing is nearly complete to make way for President Trump's planned $300 million ballroom, a project the White House says is privately funded. Initially, the administration stated the project would not affect the existing structure, but now says demolition was necessary for modernization. Preservation groups have raised alarms, urging a pause until the plans undergo legally required public review, but the administration has dismissed these concerns as "manufactured outrage" from political opponents.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis notes a significant shift in President Trump's approach toward Russia, moving from diplomacy to punitive measures. The cancellation of a planned summit with Vladimir Putin in Budapest and the imposition of new sanctions on major Russian oil companies signal Trump's growing frustration with the Kremlin's lack of compromise on the war in Ukraine. This change from using "carrots to sticks" has been met with defiance from Moscow, with Putin calling the sanctions an "unfriendly act," escalating geopolitical tensions.</p>
