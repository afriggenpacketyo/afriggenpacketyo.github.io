          <h2>Study Predicts Increased Ice Jams in China's Yellow River Due to Warming</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 02:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that global warming will lead to more frequent ice jams in the Yellow River's estuary, impacting coastal cities in eastern Shandong province. Researchers analyzed 160 years of ice jam flood data and climate projections, revealing that warmer weather causes upstream ice to break and drift downstream, where it refreezes and accumulates, creating blockages. These ice jams can cause destructive flooding, damaging communities, wildlife, and infrastructure. The study highlights a shift in the geographic distribution of ice jam hotspots downstream, emphasizing the need for proactive measures to mitigate the hazard. The research was published in the journal Science Advances. </p>

          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, further aligning its policies with U.S. trade restrictions amidst growing tensions with Beijing. The two Chinese chip firms are now on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to them. Taiwan's International Trade Administration cited national security concerns and involvement in arms proliferation activities as the reason for the blacklisting. This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions and aims to tighten loopholes, potentially increasing penalties for breaches in the future. Companies like TSMC already adhere to U.S. export controls, but this action solidifies Taiwan's commitment to restricting technology transfers to these Chinese entities. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier Li Qiang has signaled further support for China's property sector, reflecting Beijing's concerns about its impact on overall economic growth and domestic demand. A State Council meeting emphasized the need to optimize existing policies and enhance systematic synergy to stabilize expectations, stimulate demand, and mitigate risks. Specific measures include a thorough stocktake of ongoing projects and land supplies, with urban-renewal projects receiving more land and financing aid. The ultimate goal is to halt the decline and stabilize the sector, which has been a drag on the economy. This intervention comes as China grapples with external turmoil and seeks to bolster domestic sentiment. </p>

          <p>Up to 100 truckloads of Scotland's waste will be moved to England daily following the implementation of a landfill ban at the end of the year. The Scottish government acknowledges that there are insufficient incinerators to handle the additional demand, creating a "capacity gap" estimated at 600,000 tonnes in the first year. This ban, covering biodegradable municipal waste, aims to reduce methane emissions from landfills by increasing recycling rates and using more energy-from-waste incinerators. Concerns are rising about the environmental impact of transporting waste to sites in England, as well as whether the logistics are fully achievable. </p>

          <p>Nesrine Malik argues that Israel's actions in Gaza have damaged its reputation, and the attack on Iran is a belated and dangerous attempt to restore it. The piece contends that Israel's response to events in the Middle East, including its actions in Gaza and attacks on Iran, have stretched justification beyond plausibility. By engaging another enemy, the Israeli government has a chance at both restoring the terms of its pact with its sponsors, and the historical narrative that it is the victim, acting in irreproachable good faith. The author questions the long-term strategy, drawing parallels to the Gaza situation with escalation and no clear end. </p>

          <p>Analysts warn that Donald Trump's proposed "revenge tax" could deter foreign investment into the U.S. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes a provision allowing the U.S. to impose higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions that levy "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. individuals and companies. This measure, known as Section 899, classifies digital service taxes and diverted profits taxes as unfair. Experts suggest that this could alienate foreign investors and undermine the dollar's safe-haven status. UK companies are particularly exposed, potentially leading some to consider moving their stock market listing to New York. </p>

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer discussed de-escalation efforts with Trump and Netanyahu, anticipating intense discussions at the summit. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney abandoned the traditional joint statement, highlighting the summit's potential for bilateral conversations rather than a unified front. Trump's presence as a wild card and threats to Canada and Greenland further complicated the meeting. </p>

          <p>Families are grieving as officials begin handing over the remains of victims killed in the Air India crash, with DNA identification proving a slow and harrowing process. The London-bound Boeing 787 crashed minutes after takeoff, killing 241 people on board and at least 29 on the ground. Hundreds of relatives provided DNA samples to help identify the victims, with the process taking between 48 to 72 hours per victim. The Indian government has set up a high-level committee to examine the causes of the crash and formulate procedures to prevent future aircraft emergencies. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed ICE to expand deportation efforts in America's largest cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. This directive comes amid anti-ICE protests in major cities, with some demonstrations turning violent. Trump stated that ICE officers have been subjected to violence and harassment but will continue to execute their mission of mass deportations. He accused these cities of using illegal aliens to expand their voter base and grow the welfare state. </p>

          <p>Following targeted shootings that left one Minnesota lawmaker dead and another injured, a suspect is in custody. Gov. Tim Walz called the shootings "politically motivated" in a news briefing on Saturday. State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, John, were fatally shot at their home in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, Walz said. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded at their home in Champlin, a suburb of Minneapolis. Investigators said the shooter was dressed as a police officer. Boelter served on a state board with Hoffman for more than six years, records show, and authorities investigating the shootings have now said they're looking into whether the suspect knew Hoffman or Hortman personally. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are facing criticism for their silence on recent ICE raids that have terrorized many parts of Los Angeles. Despite the team's large Latino fan base, the Dodgers have not issued a statement of support or solidarity with the affected communities. This silence is contrasted with statements from other local sports teams, such as Angel City FC and LAFC, which have expressed solidarity with residents experiencing fear and uncertainty. The Dodgers' lack of response is seen as ungrateful, disrespectful, and cowardly, particularly given the team's history of celebrating diversity and inclusion. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hospice staff are at the center of the debate over the assisted dying bill, which would allow terminally ill adults with six months or less to live the right to medically end their lives in England and Wales. Staff members express uncertainty over how legalizing assisted dying would affect their services and concern about funding shortages. Many in support of assisted dying say it would give terminal patients autonomy about how they die, but some worry that patients undergoing end-of-life care would feel pressured to have an assisted death. Hospices are not fully paid for by the government, and they rely on charity and donations. </p>

          <p>Alberto Alemanno argues that Europe is mirroring Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin instead of standing up to them, despite the twin shocks of "America First" policies and Russian military aggression. The author notes an ideological convergence between Trump's America and today's European political center, with parties increasingly borrowing ideas from the far-right. This shift weakens Europe's ability to respond to threats and undermines its democratic credibility. The author calls for political courage to articulate a compelling alternative to far-right messaging and make a case for EU-wide action on security, migration, and prosperity. </p>
