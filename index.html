          <p>A significant explosion and fire occurred in the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas, as reported by Iranian officials. Mehrdad Hasanzadeh, a disaster management official, confirmed injuries resulting from the blast, which originated from containers at Rajaei port. Social media footage depicted a substantial plume of black smoke rising from the area, which primarily handles container traffic and houses oil tanks and petrochemical facilities, raising concerns about potential widespread damage and disruption. The incident is under investigation to determine the exact cause and extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>Ten students at Occidental College initiated a hunger strike to protest the college's investments in weapons manufacturers with ties to Israel and advocate for greater protections for international students. Inspired by a similar action at Chapman University, the students are demanding divestment and pro bono legal support for international students facing visa revocations. College President Tom Stritikus acknowledged the students' concerns but stated that many initiatives they are advocating for are already in place.

          <p>S&P Global Ratings has lowered the bond ratings for the city of Los Angeles due to a nearly $1-billion budget deficit, reflecting concerns about the city's weakening financial position. The agency downgraded the city's general obligation bonds to AA- from AA and lease revenue bonds to A+ from AA-. The downgrade is attributed to the rapid depletion of the city's reserve fund, which fell below the recommended 5%. Mayor Karen Bass acknowledged the economic challenges and outlined proposed budget reforms, but the lower ratings could increase borrowing costs for the city.</p>

          <p>Aimee Semple McPherson, a prominent religious figure in Los Angeles during the 1920s, is examined as a pioneer of reinvention and spectacle in religion. Arriving in Los Angeles with little more than "10 dollars and a tambourine," she founded the Angelus Temple and a Christian radio station, blending theatrical performances with her Pentecostal gospel. McPherson's life was marked by both incredible success and significant scandal, including a mysterious disappearance and subsequent trial, but her ability to combine faith, fame, and spectacle remains influential in Los Angeles' spiritual landscape.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a surge in cocaine use, with the drug becoming increasingly popular across all social classes. Experts warn of a "cocaine surge" due to market saturation in North America and increased drug trade in Europe.

The increase is attributed to factors like the decline in heroin availability and the recent legalization of cannabis, with health officials concerned about the serious psychological and physical risks associated with cocaine use.</p>

          <p>At 82, Isabel Allende is one of the world’s most beloved and best-selling Spanish-language authors. Her work has been translated into more than 40 languages, and 80 million copies of her books have been sold around the world. That’s a lot of books. Allende’s newest novel, “My Name Is Emilia del Valle,” will be published May 6, and it’s about a dark period in Chilean history: the 1891 Chilean civil war. Like so much of Allende’s work, it’s a story about women in tough spots who figure out a way through. Thematically, it’s not that far off from Allende’s own story. She was raised in Chile, but in 1973, when she was 31, raising two small children and working as a journalist, her life was upended forever. That year a military coup pushed out the democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, who was her father’s cousin. She fled to Venezuela, where she wrote “The House of the Spirits,” which evolved from a letter she had begun writing to her dying grandfather. That book became a runaway best seller and it remains one of her best-known.</p>

Eubank faced a fine after initially missing weight but made the limit at a second check, while Benn comfortably made weight. The fight is a highly anticipated clash between the sons of famous boxing rivals from the 1990s. The 2022 fight was cancelled due to Benn failing a drugs test.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney flirted with Canadian politics even as he built a career overseas, rejecting offers to join cabinets at least twice. Then in January, President Trump, threatening tariffs and annexation against Canada, brewed a crisis that seemed tailor-made for one of the world’s most seasoned managers of economic turmoil. Within weeks, Mr. Carney was prime minister. Now, he is leading Canada’s Liberal Party into a federal election, vying for a full term in the top political job in his country of birth after decades of high-profile work in the public and private sectors around the world. Mr. Carney, 60, cuts a slender, athletic figure and is impeccably turned out in tailored suits. His tone can be professorial with occasional flashes of bone-dry humor.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney, former governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, is leading Canada's Liberal Party into a federal election after becoming prime minister earlier this year.

The election is largely focused on choosing a leader who can stand up to Trump, sidelining other significant issues.</p>

          <p>The melting Arctic icecap. Record-smashing wildfires across several provinces. A country that, on average, is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world. And yet, as Canadians go to the polls Monday, climate change isn’t even among the top 10 issues for voters, according to recent polling. “That’s just not what this election is about,” said Jessica Green, a political scientist at the University of Toronto who focuses on climate issues. What the election is about, nearly everyone agrees, is choosing a leader who can stand up to Donald J. Trump. The American president has been threatening Canada with a trade war, if not total annexation as the “51st state.”</p>

          <p>Despite the severe impacts of climate change in Canada, including melting Arctic ice and record-breaking wildfires, the issue has faded from the forefront of the current election. Polls indicate that climate change is not among the top concerns for voters, with the election primarily focused on choosing a leader who can effectively counter President Trump. This shift in priorities highlights the dominance of geopolitical concerns over environmental issues in the Canadian political landscape.</p>

          <p>A third round of talks between Iran and the United States over Tehran’s nuclear activities began on Saturday, raising hopes for a new accord that could avert another conflict in the Middle East. “I think we’re going to make a deal with Iran. Nobody else could do that,” President Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published on Friday. Mr. Trump abandoned a previous nuclear deal with Iran in 2018 during his first term, saying it was a flawed agreement. The talks have the potential to reshape regional and global security by reducing the chance of a U.S.-backed Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities and preventing Iran from producing a nuclear weapon. A deal could also transform Iran’s economic and political landscape by easing American sanctions and opening the country up to foreign investors.</p>
