          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, signaling persistent deflationary pressures due to weak domestic consumption and ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The National Bureau of Statistics reported a 0.1% year-on-year decline in the consumer price index (CPI), which tracks inflation, outperforming market expectations of a 0.17% drop. Despite government stimulus measures, price wars in the automotive industry and falling property prices are contributing to the downward pressure. While exports remain strong, experts emphasize the need for China to boost domestic demand to combat deflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Protests erupted in Los Angeles after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations led to numerous arrests, prompting President Trump to deploy National Guard troops to the city.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has called for the Trump administration to rescind the order and return control of the National Guard to the state.

          <p>A team led by Professor Li Hongge at Beihang University in Beijing has achieved a breakthrough in computing by starting mass production of the world's first non-binary AI chip. This innovation overcomes the power and architecture walls faced by traditional chip technologies by merging binary and stochastic logic. The new Hybrid Stochastic Number (HSN) system enables unprecedented fault tolerance and power efficiency in intelligent control applications, such as touch displays and flight systems. This development could also potentially sidestep US chip restrictions, marking a significant advancement in China's technological capabilities.</p>

          <p>Protests erupted in Los Angeles, specifically in Paramount, following rumors of an immigration raid at a hardware store, although the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) denied that a raid occurred at that location. The unrest, which included violence and property damage, led President Trump to deploy the California National Guard. While the DHS confirmed the arrest of 118 illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area, including alleged gang members, community members expressed fear and distrust due to the increased presence of immigration enforcement. The protests underscore the deep divisions and tensions surrounding immigration policies in the region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are in conflict over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, centering on interpretations of the Posse Comitatus Act. Trump deployed the National Guard following reported attacks on ICE agents during immigration raids, while Newsom has demanded the troops be returned to state command, calling the deployment unlawful. The Posse Comitatus Act generally restricts the use of the U.S. military for civilian law enforcement, but exceptions exist, such as congressional decree or the inability of state governments to maintain order. The Pentagon has also indicated it stands ready to send in active-duty Marines if necessary.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses the internal divisions within the Democratic Party regarding policy priorities, particularly the focus on abundance versus addressing concentrated corporate power. The author's book, "Abundance," has sparked debate, with some viewing it as a threat to the anti-corporate populist faction. The debate centers on whether the party should prioritize addressing bottlenecks that hinder production or focus on curbing the power of large corporations. This reflects a broader struggle within the party to define its identity and policy agenda after recent electoral losses.</p>
