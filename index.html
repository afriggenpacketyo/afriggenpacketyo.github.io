          <p>Former Salomon Brothers bond trader Howard Rubin and his personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, were arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, accused of operating a network for a decade. Prosecutors detailed allegations of Rubin discussing hiring a "hitman" against women who filed civil suits, leading to his detention without bail due to flight risk. The indictment describes a Manhattan penthouse converted into a "sex dungeon" with BDSM equipment, where Rubin allegedly engaged in conduct beyond women's consent, causing brutal injuries that sometimes required medical attention. The article highlights the severe nature of the allegations, including Rubin's prior attempts at witness intimidation, and his ongoing appeal of a $3.85 million civil judgment for sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>Shane Tamura, the gunman in July's fatal Midtown Manhattan shooting that claimed four lives, was posthumously diagnosed with low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), according to New York's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Tamura, a 27-year-old former high school football player, left handwritten notes explicitly referencing CTE and urging his brain be studied, alleging the NFL knowingly concealed brain injury dangers for profit. While the science on CTE's physical and mental manifestations continues to evolve, experts like Chris Nowinski emphasize the significant risk posed by prolonged participation in contact sports, urging greater prevention efforts for young athletes. The article underscores the tragic intersection of mental health, sports-related brain trauma, and violence.</p>

The files include itineraries suggesting Musk was expected on Epstein's private island in December 2014, along with records of scheduled meetings and lunches with Thiel and Bannon. This disclosure is part of an ongoing congressional probe examining the federal government's handling of the Epstein case, with Democrats criticizing the Trump administration for allegedly obstructing the release of related files. The article highlights Musk's previous public statements denying visits to the island, alongside mentions of Bill Gates in the documents, underscoring the broad reach of Epstein's connections.</p>

          <p>A study published in JAMA Dermatology suggests that nicotinamide, a common form of vitamin B3, could significantly reduce the risk of developing certain skin cancers. Researchers analyzed health data from over 33,000 veterans, revealing a 14% decreased risk of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma among those exposed to the supplement. Notably, patients who began taking nicotinamide immediately after their initial skin cancer diagnosis experienced a 54% reduced risk of recurrence. While not a universal recommendation, the findings are prompting a shift in medical thinking towards earlier preventive strategies for high-risk individuals.

          <p>Sara Jane Moore, infamous for her unsuccessful attempt to assassinate President Gerald Ford in 1975, has died at 95. Imprisoned for over three decades, Moore was paroled in 2007 and later expressed profound regret for her actions, stating she was caught up in the radical political movements prevalent in California during the mid-1970s. Her background was complex, involving multiple marriages, name changes, and a period as an FBI informant. In a July 2024 interview, she notably cited Ford's unelected presidency as a motivating factor. This article reflects on her controversial life and the historical context of her actions.</p>

          <p>Rafie Ollah Shouhed, a 79-year-old U.S. citizen and car wash owner in Los Angeles, is suing the federal government for $50 million after allegedly being body-slammed and detained for nearly 12 hours during an ICE raid. Shouhed reportedly suffered broken ribs and a traumatic brain injury, with his attorney claiming agents violated constitutional rights and "basic human decency." DHS stated Shouhed "impeded the operation" and was arrested for assaulting an officer, though he was released without charges.

          <p>With collective U.S. credit card debt reaching $1.21 trillion, many Americans are exploring options to regain financial control, including debt relief programs and credit counseling. Debt relief, encompassing settlement or consolidation, aims to reduce the total owed but can impact credit scores and involve fees. Conversely, credit counseling focuses on education, budgeting, and structured repayment plans, often with lower fees and a milder effect on credit, emphasizing repaying the full amount over time. This article advises evaluating financial goals, risk tolerance, and commitment to choose the most suitable path to debt freedom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennessee Governor Bill Lee announced that an influx of federal agents from 13 U.S. agencies, including the FBI and DEA, will deploy to Memphis next week. This operation, part of President Trump's broader crime crackdown, will also involve 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers. While Memphis Mayor Paul Young acknowledged community concerns, he emphasized using these resources effectively to reduce crime. The article notes the Trump administration has faced accusations of unfairly targeting Democratic-led cities with similar deployments, highlighting the political undertones of this "generational opportunity" to combat crime.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are intensifying their demands for information regarding White House border czar Tom Homan and his alleged involvement in federal contracts. This follows allegations that Homan accepted $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents, promising government action if President Trump returned to office. The probe, initiated by the prior administration, was closed by Trump appointees. Democrats express serious concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given Homan's past consultancy for a private prison company, and suggest a "weaponization of our system of justice" to protect political allies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice, represented by Solicitor General D. John Sauer, argued to the Supreme Court that President Trump's proposed firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud would not trigger a "financial market disaster." Sauer contended that Trump faces "irreparable harm" from lower court rulings reinstating Cook, asserting the President's removal power for financial misfeasance would not compromise the Fed's independence. Cook's attorneys countered that Trump's "manufactured charges" predate her service and that her removal would "eviscerate the independence of the Federal Reserve Board," risking market instability.
