        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met at the White House amidst ongoing trade disputes and speculation about Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state. Trump has previously imposed tariffs on Canadian goods and threatened to make Canada a U.S. state, while Carney, elected on an anti-Trump platform, has vowed to protect Canada's interests. The article notes that the meeting could either ease trade tensions or further strain the relationship between the two countries, with tariffs currently in place on various goods. The article mentions that one advantage for Carney is his lack of prior history with Trump, unlike his predecessor. Optimism Score: 40</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a downturn driven by companies like Ford, Marriott, Mattel, and Clorox revising their financial outlooks due to tariff implications and broader economic uncertainties. The Federal Reserve commenced its two-day meeting, grappling with whether to sustain current interest rates to combat inflation or implement reductions to stimulate economic growth amid trade-related pressures from President Trump's tariff policies. Dover's acquisition of Sikora for 550 million euros and Coterra's stock decline despite earnings were also noted as contributing factors to market activity. (not investment advice)</p>

This attack follows previous Israeli strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, alleging the Houthis use the airport for transferring weapons and operatives.

          <p>States are using taxes on hospitals and nursing homes to increase federal Medicaid matching funds, a tactic that could face curtailment by congressional Republicans seeking federal spending reductions. The article explains how these provider taxes work, allowing states to inflate Medicaid spending on paper and collect more matching funds from the federal government. Some Republican-led states are more reliant on this strategy, and the proposed changes could significantly impact their Medicaid budgets. The article notes the federal government does not know exactly how much money states have raised with these taxes and related strategies.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere uncontrolled, raising concerns about where the debris might land. The spacecraft, intended for a Venus landing, failed to leave Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction, and while most of it disintegrated years ago, the landing capsule remains in orbit. Experts predict reentry around May 10, noting the risk of impact is small but not negligible, with potential consequences for aircraft and populated areas. The article suggests that if the heat shield fails, the spacecraft will burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, but if the heat shield holds, it will reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.</p>

CEO Alex Karp remained optimistic, stating that "Palantir is on fire" and highlighting the company's investment and cultural shift in the U.S. Palantir's revenues rose 39% from $634.3 million in the year-ago quarter.</p>

The article explains that the BBC failed to properly challenge claims that the decision to downgrade the Duke's security was an "Establishment stitch-up" and an act of "spite" from the Royal Household. The BBC acknowledged it should have reflected the Home Office's statement and given the view of Buckingham Palace.

          <p>Shipments of Chinese goods to the U.S. are plunging due to high tariffs, potentially leading to shortages of various products later this year. Experts warn that back-to-school and holiday shopping could be affected, with toys, apparel, and other consumer goods becoming scarce. The article notes that American retailers rushed to import goods ahead of the tariffs, but container bookings from China to the U.S. have since declined sharply. The analysis found that the change could mean a budget hole of at least $2.7 billion for South Carolina next year — about a third of what the Medicaid program spent there last year.</p>
