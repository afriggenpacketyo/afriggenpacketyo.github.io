          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's dedication to controlling inflation, stating that policymakers are likely to maintain the current stance until there is more clarity on the impact of tariffs on prices. In his congressional testimony, Powell described the economy as robust with a strong labor market, but noted that inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target. He acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the effects of President Trump's tariffs on the economy. Powell's cautious approach could intensify criticism from Trump, who has publicly attacked Powell's leadership.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting of the New Champions in China, US scholars analyzed the US economy's outperformance, attributing it to a 'magic sauce' of factors such as capital, labor, immigration, and higher education. Panelists like Robert Koopman and Graham Allison debated whether the US or China is leading in tech and innovation. Concerns were raised that Washington's tariff and immigration policies could threaten the US economic outlook, potentially allowing China to advance more rapidly. Paul Gruenwald of S&P Global Ratings emphasized the importance of higher education as part of America's economic recipe.</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed his frustration with both Israel and Iran after an apparent ceasefire agreement he announced was quickly violated by both sides. Despite Trump's declaration that Israel would not attack Iran, Israeli officials accused Iran of launching missiles and vowed retaliation, while Iran denied these claims. Trump stated that both countries violated the ceasefire, albeit unintentionally, and demanded that Israel halt its planned bombings. The ceasefire, brokered with the help of Qatar, faltered shortly after it was supposed to take effect, with reports of Iranian missile strikes and Israeli retaliatory actions.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has declared his intention to move forward with planned welfare reforms, despite facing growing opposition from Labour MPs who are against cuts to disability and sickness-related benefits.

Starmer defended the reforms, arguing that the current welfare system is unsustainable and traps individuals on benefits. He stated that the rising number of Personal Independence Payment (PIP) claims necessitates reform to ensure the system's future viability.</p>

Rutte emphasized that President Trump and the U.S. leadership are fully dedicated to the alliance, but expect European and Canadian members to increase their defense spending. Members agreed to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035 to address these concerns, with some nations already exceeding the 2% target set in 2014.

This decision allows the administration to resume deportations while legal proceedings continue, a move criticized by dissenting Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson. Sotomayor accused the government of 'flagrantly unlawful conduct' and argued the decision undermines due process.

The author argues that Trump's actions are primarily self-serving and that other leaders should not waste time trying to interpret them as something more meaningful.

Experts suggest North Korea will likely accelerate its nuclear weapons programs and enhance its protective measures in response to the US actions.

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 11 Iranian nationals in a 48-hour operation across eight states, including one individual on a watchlist and others with prior criminal convictions. Among those arrested was a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) with alleged connections to Hezbollah. The arrests are part of the Trump administration's intensified efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, with officials claiming the individuals pose a threat to public safety. Federal agents also arrested a U.S. citizen for allegedly threatening law enforcement officers and harboring an illegal alien.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Iran's response to US airstrikes on its nuclear facilities, noting an initial glimmer of hope for de-escalation after Iran warned the US and Israel confirmed a ceasefire.

          <p>With rising natural gas prices expected to increase air conditioning costs by approximately 4% this summer, Americans can expect to pay around $186 per month on average, with New England residents potentially facing bills as high as $200. Experts recommend sealing windows and doors, using fans, managing sunlight, and using heat-producing appliances wisely to reduce energy consumption. Regular maintenance, such as changing air filters, can also optimize AC system performance and prevent breakdowns. Homeowners may also consider a professional energy audit for a comprehensive assessment of energy leaks.</p>

          <p>The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is facing significant challenges, including the exit of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, under the leadership of its new chairman, Sierra Leone's President Julius Maada Bio. The organization is grappling with security concerns, the rise of organized crime, and the need for institutional reform.
