          <p>This article explains 'freshers' flu' as a common cluster of respiratory viruses that rapidly spreads among new university students. Factors such as close living quarters, compromised immune systems due to stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, and alcohol consumption contribute to its prevalence. Experts highlight the ease of viral transmission, even during incubation periods, and the possibility of multiple infections. Students are advised to seek medical attention for persistent symptoms and prioritize recovery despite academic pressures, as the body needs time to recuperate from significant viral assaults.</p>

          <p>A Biden-appointed federal judge, Deborah Boardman, has faced conservative backlash for sentencing Nicholas Roske to eight years in prison for attempting to assassinate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Prosecutors had sought a 30-year term, but the judge cited mitigating factors, including Roske's spontaneous confession and cooperation with police. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the Department of Justice plans to appeal the "woefully insufficient" sentence, which critics also scrutinized for allegedly considering Roske's transgender identity. This Fox News article highlights the political divide surrounding judicial decisions in high-profile cases.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker announced that the Trump administration intends to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard for deployment to Chicago, despite his repeated rejections. This move follows an incident where federal agents allegedly shot an armed citizen after being rammed and boxed in by vehicles. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the deployment, while Pritzker criticized it as a "manufactured performance" for political control, not public safety. The article also details a separate incident where Border Patrol agents reportedly used a chemical agent during an ICE encounter, further escalating federal-local tensions.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback and Fox Sports television star Mark Sanchez was arrested for battery with injury, unlawful entry of a motor vehicle, and public intoxication after being stabbed in downtown Indianapolis. Police responded to a disturbance where two people were injured, with Sanchez taken to a nearby hospital in critical condition before his arrest. The circumstances surrounding the attack remain unclear, and the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office will make the final charging decision. Sanchez was in Indianapolis to call a Colts v Raiders matchup for Fox Sports, and he is presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel is "on the verge of a very great achievement" and expressed hope for the return of all hostages, living and dead, "in the coming days," while the IDF maintains control in Gaza. He indicated that initial negotiations with Hamas, mediated by the US, aim to conclude within days, focusing on the release of hostages without a full Israeli withdrawal. President Donald Trump issued warnings to Hamas, urging swift action to secure the deal and prevent further delays.

          <p>Police in Tbilisi, Georgia, used water cannons and pepper spray to disperse anti-government protesters who attempted to storm the presidential palace. The demonstrations follow the ruling Georgian Dream party's disputed parliamentary election victory and its decision to pause talks on joining the EU, which the opposition claims was a stolen election. Tens of thousands marched, with organizers calling for the arrest of senior Georgian Dream figures, reflecting widespread belief that the government acts in Russia's interests. The protest occurred amidst a crackdown on activists and independent media, with many opposition leaders currently imprisoned.</p>

          <p>A federal judge, Rudolph Contreras, has temporarily halted a Trump administration initiative that would have transferred immigrant children to adult detention centers after they turn 18. The ruling states that automatically detaining these individuals violates a 2021 court order, which requires their release to the least restrictive setting if they pose no danger or flight risk. This decision comes amid concerns about the administration's alleged plans to offer immigrant children $2,500 to self-deport and accusations of reviving family separation tactics. The article underscores ongoing legal battles over controversial immigration policies affecting minors.</p>

          <p>A recent explosion and fire at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery, one of its most perilous incidents, has renewed concerns about its extensive history of safety and environmental violations. Environmental advocates fear that the federal government shutdown, which has furloughed key agencies like OSHA and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Mitigation Board, will prevent a thorough investigation into the blast's cause. This lack of federal oversight, coupled with proposed budget cuts, raises concerns among labor unions about worker safety at California's refineries.

While ANO aligns with the Motorists on EU emissions targets, relations with the SPD may be strained due to Babis' firm opposition to referendums on EU or NATO membership and mass deportations of Ukrainian refugees.</p>

Taking inspiration from the US, the Tories also plan to expand detention facilities and restrict asylum grounds, while considering leaving the European Convention on Human Rights if judges override Parliament. This controversial plan aims to address dire poll ratings and counter Nigel Farage's Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Iran executed six death-row inmates, alleging they carried out attacks in the oil-rich Khuzestan province on behalf of Israel, marking a continuation of a surge in executions. These executions follow a recent Iran-Israel conflict and come amidst warnings from activists about Iran's reliance on coerced confessions and closed-door trials in such cases. The article notes that the men were identified as "Arab political prisoners" by a Kurdish human rights group and were detained during 2019 protests, facing severe torture. Iran's execution rate is reportedly at its highest in decades, drawing international criticism.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared that a Gaza ceasefire would commence "immediately" upon Hamas' confirmation of the new US peace plan, stating Israel had agreed to initial withdrawal lines. He asserted this would lead to hostage and prisoner exchanges and create conditions for further withdrawal, calling it an end to a "3,000-year catastrophe." However, Hamas accused Israel of continuing "horrific crimes and massacres" despite claims of reduced military operations. Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed hope for hostage release "in the coming days" and confirmed a delegation was in Egypt to finalize technical details of the plan.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that a Gaza peace deal is "very close," even as Israel continued bombing the territory. In an interview, Trump recounted telling Prime Minister Netanyahu, "Bibi, this is your chance for victory," emphasizing that Netanyahu "has no choice" but to comply with him. The White House plan calls for an immediate ceasefire, hostage-for-prisoner exchange, phased Israeli withdrawal, Hamas disarmament, and a transitional international government. Trump aims to finalize the deal in the coming days and intends to help rehabilitate Israel’s global image, which has suffered due to the high death toll in Gaza.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump and G7 nations are pressuring Turkey to reduce its significant reliance on Russian oil and gas, with Russia supplying over half of Turkey's oil imports and 41% of its natural gas last year. Turkey benefits from lower Russian energy prices due to EU sanctions, making a sudden shift challenging for its energy security. However, Turkey is pursuing a diversification strategy, signing long-term LNG contracts with US and Australian firms, alongside promoting domestic and renewable energy sources. This complex balancing act aims to improve relations with the US while navigating its substantial energy needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jack Daniel’s decision to stop providing free cattle feed to local Tennessee farmers after 45 years is causing significant economic hardship, with some fearing business collapse. The company, owned by Brown-Forman, justifies the move by citing the need to meet global environmental goals and maintain international whiskey sales, pointing to a new anaerobic digester facility for renewable energy. This shift highlights a growing tension between corporate sustainability objectives and local community survival, as companies monetize waste or cut emissions, often displacing long-standing relationships. Locals question the brand's "neighborly" values as the distillery outgrows its roots. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts are optimistic about a resurgence in piano playing, driven by a desire for musicality and emotional expression, as people become weary of screens and seek new forms of engagement.
