          <p>A significant explosion at Shahid Rajaee port, a crucial commercial hub in Iran, caused widespread damage, resulting in numerous casualties and injuries. The blast, which occurred on Saturday morning near Bandar Abbas, blew out windows and roofs of nearby buildings and destroyed cars, with residents reporting its impact from miles away. Initial reports suggest the explosion may have been sparked by a fire in a hazmat and chemical materials storage depot, although some sources suggest it was due to improper handling of solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles. Schools and offices in the region were closed due to high levels of air pollution following the incident.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is commemorating the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, an event that marked the end of the Vietnam War and the reunification of the country. Celebrations are planned throughout the nation, but there is a subtle shift in how the holiday is being framed, with the government increasingly using the term "Reunification Day" instead of more politically charged names like "Liberation Day." This change is seen as an effort to reconcile with the Vietnamese diaspora and to present a more unified national narrative. The country is also balancing its relationships with both China and the United States amid growing geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>The San Jacinto Tunnel, a 13-mile-long aqueduct bored through Mt. San Jacinto in the 1930s, is a critical component of Southern California's water infrastructure. The tunnel, part of the Colorado River Aqueduct, can deliver up to 1 billion gallons of water per day and was recently opened for a rare glimpse during annual maintenance. Groundwater constantly seeps into the tunnel, creating a stream within the passage, and workers inspect the tunnel walls for cracks and algae growth. The aqueduct system, built during the Great Depression, remains an impressive feat of engineering, providing water to 19 million people.</p>

          <p>A New York Times investigation has uncovered a series of missteps that led to a fatal plane crash at Ronald Reagan National Airport in January. The crash, involving an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet, was not caused by a single error but by a breakdown in the system of redundancies and safeguards designed to prevent such disasters. The investigation highlighted failures in executing visual separation procedures, where pilots take control of navigating around other aircraft, and emphasized the need for greater awareness of the risks associated with this practice.</p>

          <p>Shedeur Sanders, once projected as a high-round NFL draft pick, experienced a significant slide before being selected by the Cleveland Browns. Reports suggest concerns about his interviews and ability to grasp schematic packages contributed to the drop. Now, Sanders faces the challenge of proving himself in a competitive environment, adapting to a new offensive system, and demonstrating a willingness to learn. His success will depend on his ability to embrace hard work and integrate into a team dynamic where he is not the primary decision-maker.</p>
