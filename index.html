            <p>Hashem Abedi, convicted for his role in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, attacked three prison officers at HMP Frankland, leaving them with life-threatening injuries. The assault involved hot cooking oil and homemade weapons, prompting a counter-terrorism police investigation. The Prison Officers' Association is calling for a review of freedoms granted to prisoners in separation centers housing dangerous extremists. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has condemned the attack and vowed to pursue the strongest possible punishment for Abedi. This incident raises serious concerns about security protocols within high-security prisons. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus's recent visit to China resulted in Beijing committing $2.1 billion in investments, loans, and grants. This includes funding for port modernization and industrial zone development.

            <p>President Trump's rapidly changing tariff policies are causing widespread confusion and anxiety among American consumers. The imposition of tariffs on imports, particularly from China, has led to concerns about rising prices and potential shortages. While some consumers are attempting to stock up on goods, others feel paralyzed by the uncertainty and hope for policy reversals. Economists warn that the tariffs could lead to a significant increase in costs for American families and potentially trigger an economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has announced exemptions for smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from recently imposed tariffs, including those on Chinese imports. This decision is seen as a significant relief for US tech companies, which had expressed concerns about potential price increases. The White House stated that the exemptions were made to provide companies with more time to relocate production to the United States. Despite the exemptions, these goods remain subject to the 20% tariff related to fentanyl. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel using emergency legislation to prevent the closure of its Scunthorpe plant. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds indicated that nationalization is likely, as the government seeks to secure the future of the steel industry. The legislation grants the government broad powers to manage the plant and ensure continued production. This action follows concerns that owners Jingye were planning to shut down blast furnaces, ending primary steel production in the UK. (not investment advice)</p>
