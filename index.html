          <p>As official research positions are lost to budget cuts, the work of citizen scientists to preserve federal forests is becoming more valuable. Don Pike, a retiree, dedicates his time to removing invasive species from the Tonto National Forest, earning him the title of Arizona’s Weed Manager of the Year. Volunteers like Mr. Pike have become increasingly important due to the Trump administration's mass firings of federal workers. Their efforts help to reduce fire and heat risks, clear invasives, and capture data on threatened cactuses.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has become the first Australian prime minister to win a second consecutive three-year term in 21 years. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat in Saturday's election, saying, "We didn't do well enough during this campaign, that much is obvious tonight, and I accept full responsibility for that." Albanese also noted that his government had improved relations with China, which removed a series of official and unofficial trade barriers that had cost Australian exporters 20 billion Australian dollars ($13 billion) a year since Labor came to power in 2022.</p>
