          <p>The United Kingdom, particularly Scotland, is facing significant cleanup and ongoing disruption after Storm Floris brought gusts up to 90mph. The storm, described as the "most damaging summer storm in recent memory," caused power outages for about 50,000 homes and led to widespread travel cancellations. While a yellow weather warning remains, emergency crews are working to clear debris from train lines and restore electricity to affected areas. The Scottish government held an emergency meeting to address the aftermath, urging caution as recovery efforts continue.</p>

          <p>Tennessee is proceeding with the execution of Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate convicted of a 1988 triple murder. The case is notable as it may be the first time a person with a working implantable defibrillator is put to death, raising legal and ethical questions about potential pain and a "grotesque spectacle." Despite appeals citing Black's dementia, various health issues, and the potential for the device to activate during the lethal injection, both the governor and the U.S. Supreme Court have denied a reprieve. The execution highlights ongoing debates surrounding capital punishment methods and the involvement of medical professionals.</p>

          <p>Students across Scotland are receiving their exam results, but the aftermath of Storm Floris is causing mail delivery delays for physical certificates in the Outer Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland. The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) confirmed that while email and text results are unaffected, students in storm-hit areas may need to contact their schools for their marks. Officials have emphasized that support is available through a dedicated helpline, offering advice on next steps regardless of the outcomes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As England's cricket team looks ahead to the Ashes series in Australia, their chances of success appear heavily reliant on captain Ben Stokes. The article posits that without Stokes, who is recovering from a shoulder injury, the team is vulnerable, lacking both his all-around talent and tactical leadership. England has a poor recent record in Australia, having not won a Test there in over a decade, and many current players lack experience on Australian pitches. The challenge will be immense, facing Australia's formidable bowling attack, but Stokes' history of delivering in high-pressure moments provides a glimmer of hope for the team.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest, alleging he violated previous court-ordered restrictions. Justice Alexandre de Moraes claims Bolsonaro used his sons' social media to incite supporters and disrespect the judiciary during a recent rally. The decision intensifies the legal battle against Bolsonaro, who is on trial for allegedly plotting a coup to remain in power after his 2022 election defeat. This development occurs amidst heightened tensions, with the U.S. Trump administration criticizing the ruling and linking it to potential trade tariffs against Brazil.</p>

Despite tying the game in the eighth inning, the Dodgers' offense struggled against Cardinals' starter Sonny Gray, who also pitched seven impressive innings. A ninth-inning pinch-hit single by Yohel Pozo ultimately secured the victory for St. Louis at Dodger Stadium.</p>

Conversely, Serbia views it as a tragic "pogrom" that led to the forced displacement of approximately 200,000 Serbs and numerous unprosecuted war crimes against civilians who remained.

          <p>This analysis piece argues that less than two years after ousting the populist Law and Justice party, Poland's liberal democratic government, led by Donald Tusk, is losing public support and risks being a brief interlude. The author contends that post-populist governments often get bogged down in reversing their predecessors' legal and institutional damage, failing to offer a compelling future vision. Tusk's government has been criticized for adopting nationalist rhetoric on migration and failing to liberalize abortion laws, thereby losing its distinct identity. The article warns that without an imaginative, forward-thinking agenda, liberal democrats will continue to lose ground to populism.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement in a lawsuit brought by 45 California counties, which alleged the company improperly disposed of hazardous waste. An investigation found that UPS facilities were sending corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials to landfills not equipped to handle them. As part of the settlement, UPS will pay civil penalties and fund environmental projects. The company, which cooperated with the investigation, stated it has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California locations to address the issue.</p>

She explained that she used the hair removal product Nair in an attempt to eradicate a suspected facial parasite, which she has been dealing with since a trip to Morocco. Glanville joked about the incident, saying she "overdid it" by leaving the product on for too long. She has previously spoken about the mysterious medical condition, which she claims has caused facial swelling and cost her over $70,000 in medical procedures.</p>

          <p>It is currently tarantula mating season in California, a period lasting from August to December when male spiders leave their burrows in search of mates, making them more visible. Experts note that sightings are common in desert, chaparral, and mountain areas across Southern California, including popular hiking spots in Los Angeles and Joshua Tree National Park. While their appearance can be startling, native tarantulas are shy, slow-moving, and pose no serious threat to humans. They will only bite if severely provoked, and their main defense mechanism is flicking irritant hairs from their bodies.</p>

          <p>Stephen J. Cloobeck, a wealthy businessman and first-time political candidate, is launching a $1.4 million television advertising campaign for his California gubernatorial bid. The ad buy, which covers cable and broadcast markets across California and in key national locations, marks the first major media push in the 2026 election. As a self-described "conservative Democrat," Cloobeck is aiming to raise his name recognition in a wide-open field following former Vice President Kamala Harris's decision not to run. The early spending is seen as a strategic move to stand out among a large group of relatively unknown candidates.</p>

          <p>A significant and growing shortage of volunteer firefighters across the U.S. is straining a system that protects many smaller communities. The number of volunteers, who make up nearly 70% of the nation's fire crews, has dropped by over 20% since 1985, while emergency call volumes have tripled. This decline is forcing some towns to switch to paid fire departments, a move that could significantly increase costs for taxpayers. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment, as the shortage threatens the operational capacity of thousands of local firehouses.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged more than 20% after President Trump posted on Truth Social praising the company's marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The ad, which has since been removed, sparked controversy online, with some critics accusing its "genes/jeans" wordplay of aligning with nationalist messaging. Trump lauded the ad as the "HOTTEST" out there and contrasted it with what he called "woke" advertising from other brands. The presidential endorsement fueled a meme-driven rally for the financially challenged retailer, which had recently withdrawn its full-year guidance due to slow sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concludes that Taiwan's energy supplies would be exhausted quickly in the event of a Chinese military blockade. According to war-gaming scenarios, the island's natural gas reserves would last only 11 days, coal for seven weeks, and oil for 20 weeks. However, the report also suggests that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States. The analysis indicates a blockade would be a poor precursor to an invasion.</p>

In response, supporters, including the president, have defended the ad and Sweeney, whom Trump identified as a "registered Republican." American Eagle has stated the campaign was always about denim, but the controversy has fueled a debate over marketing, race, and beauty standards, while also causing the company's stock to soar.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) is issuing a warning after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were found to have blue-dyed muscle and fat tissue. Lab tests confirmed the discoloration was caused by diphacinone, a blue-dyed anticoagulant rodenticide, which the pigs likely consumed directly or by eating other poisoned animals. Officials are urging pesticide applicators to use bait stations inaccessible to non-target wildlife. They also caution hunters to avoid consuming any game animal with discolored tissue, as rodenticide exposure may not always be visible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that lowering the recommended screening age for colorectal cancer to 45 has led to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses for people aged 45-49. Following updated guidelines, screening rates in this age group rose 62% between 2019 and 2023. This uptick in testing is credited with finding more cancers at a more treatable phase, which researchers call "promising news." However, the study also highlights that screening rates remain suboptimal and inequitable, with disparities based on education and insurance status still needing to be addressed.</p>
