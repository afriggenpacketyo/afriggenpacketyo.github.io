          <p>Renowned theoretical physicist Chen-ning Yang, a Nobel Prize laureate, has died in Beijing at the age of 103. Often compared to Albert Einstein, Yang co-authored the groundbreaking Yang–Mills theory in 1954, which described three of nature's fundamental forces. This work provided the mathematical foundation for the Standard Model of particle physics, unifying forces and explaining elementary particle behavior. His passing marks the end of an era for a giant in modern physics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Severe drought conditions are causing significant challenges for pumpkin farmers across the United States, leading to smaller crops and empty fields for a second consecutive year. Approximately 38% of the U.S. is experiencing moderate drought, resulting in damaged crops and water shortages. Farmers like Stephen Freeland in Tennessee report a 15-20% drop in yield, with high temperatures causing pumpkin plants to abort fruit and affecting pollination. This situation forces farmers to consider costly adaptations like drip irrigation, potentially raising prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have significantly increased their sales volume in the South African SUV market, growing by 86% between January and August. This surge has boosted their total market share to 15%, primarily driven by Chery and Haval brands. The rising dominance of Chinese motors is cutting into the market share of established Japanese leaders like Toyota and Suzuki. This trend indicates a notable shift in consumer preferences and market dynamics within the region's automotive sector.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the prison sentence of former New York Republican Congressman George Santos, ordering his immediate release from federal prison. Santos, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft, was serving an 87-month sentence. Trump cited Santos' alleged mistreatment in prison, including solitary confinement, as a reason for the commutation. The decision has drawn criticism from some Republicans who argue Santos' crimes warrant a longer sentence, while his attorney and allies expressed gratitude.</p>

          <p>This article pays tribute to the former commander of the Chinese navy, a revered strategist and visionary technocrat who directed the comprehensive modernization of China's naval forces. Often compared to 19th-century American naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, he played a pivotal role in elevating China's navy to world-class standards. Born in 1916, he joined the Red Army at 13 and later transitioned to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952, never having seen the sea before. His career exemplifies a significant transformation in China's military capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, under the Trump administration, has terminated a consent order prohibiting Citibank from discriminating against Armenian American customers. The order, which accused Citibank of applying stricter criteria or blocking accounts for applicants with surnames ending in “ian” and “yan,” was ended three years early. Citibank had paid over $24.5 million in penalties and redress. California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff criticized the decision, stating it prioritizes corporations over people and casts a long shadow over the community, particularly in areas like Glendale with large Armenian American populations.</p>

          <p>An anti-migrant movement called Operation Dudula is actively blocking foreigners from accessing public health facilities in South Africa, demanding prioritization for South African citizens. Activists are picketing clinics and hospitals, checking IDs and turning away non-South Africans, despite the constitution guaranteeing healthcare access for everyone. This article highlights the growing xenophobic sentiment, which has led to some South Africans also being denied care due to lack of proper documents. The movement, now a political party, insists the public health system is overburdened, while human rights lawyers condemn the actions as lawlessness.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Hindu festival of Diwali, India's gold market is bustling, but soaring prices are changing buying habits.

This article highlights a clear trend: more Indians are buying gold and silver for investment rather than solely for jewelry. Investment demand's share has risen significantly, with increased interest in exchange-traded funds and digital gold, and the Reserve Bank of India also stocking up to diversify reserves.</p>

          <p>The North Pacific Ocean has experienced its warmest summer on record, with sea surface temperatures more than 0.25°C above the previous high of 2022. This mysterious marine heatwave, dubbed the 'warm blob,' spans an area ten times the size of the Mediterranean. While climate change contributes, scientists are struggling to fully explain the extent and duration of this warming. This article suggests factors like weaker winds and reduced sulfur emissions from shipping fuels could be playing a role, with potential impacts on global weather patterns, including a colder start to winter in the UK.</p>
