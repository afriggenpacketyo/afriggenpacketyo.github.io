          <p>Newly unsealed documents suggest Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, may have had more information about the dropped charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams than he initially stated during his Senate confirmation hearing.  This raises questions about his testimony and the Justice Department's decision-making process.  The mayor's lawyer claims the unsealed letter supports dismissing the case.</p>
