            <p>Senator Chuck Grassley faced heated questions from Iowa constituents regarding the Trump administration's deportation policies and tariff policies, with many expressing concerns about the administration's defiance of court orders. Simultaneously, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's town hall in Georgia was disrupted by protesters, one of whom was tased by police after being removed from the event. Grassley defended the administration's actions regarding the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, stating that the decision ultimately lies with the El Salvadorian president, while also attempting to address concerns about the impact of Trump's tariffs on Iowa farmers.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ordered Justice Department officials to testify under oath regarding the wrongful detention of Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador. The judge expressed frustration with the Trump administration's inaction in facilitating Abrego Garcia's release, despite a Supreme Court order to do so. The judge is pushing for expedited discovery to determine if the DOJ is intentionally fighting the court orders. Abrego Garcia's attorneys argue the administration hasn't taken steps to comply with orders to facilitate his release, while DOJ attorneys say they're prepared to facilitate his presence in the U.S. if he presents himself at a port of entry.</p>

            <p>A senior advisor to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Dan Caldwell, has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into an unauthorized disclosure.

            <p>Legal experts are questioning the constitutionality of President Donald Trump's proposal to send American citizens convicted of violent crimes to foreign prisons. Trump suggested this idea during a meeting with El Salvador's President, stating it would apply to "really bad people." Legal experts argue that such a move would violate numerous constitutional provisions and the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. While officials claim they are studying the laws, experts are alarmed, citing the ongoing legal battle regarding Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador.</p>

The article contrasts Perry's performance with the more serious and controlled images of artists like Beyonc√© and Taylor Swift, suggesting Perry's authenticity resonates in a world of highly curated celebrity brands.</p>

            <p>US ports, particularly those handling goods from China, are bracing for significant disruption as a result of President Trump's unpredictable tariff policies. Ports, logistics firms, and trade-dependent businesses anticipate increased uncertainty, rerouting, uneven port utilization, slowed trade, and potential job losses. The Port of Los Angeles, heavily reliant on Chinese goods, expects a "bumpy" ride. The adjacent ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which handle a third of all containerized cargo entering the US, could trigger ripple effects across global trade networks.</p>

While some fear escalating tariffs could lead to military conflict, the author believes China will not engage in confrontation but will prepare for it.

            <p>China's economic growth could be significantly impacted by soaring US import tariffs, but its deepening trade ties with Southeast Asia could help mitigate the losses. The Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) estimates that US tariffs could limit China's GDP growth this year. However, China's increasingly strong trade and investment relationships with Southeast Asian nations will help compensate for limited access to the US market. This shift highlights the growing importance of regional trade partnerships for China.</p>
