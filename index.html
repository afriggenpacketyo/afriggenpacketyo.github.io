          <p>Ukrainian President Zelensky and former US President Trump met at St. Peter's Basilica during Pope Francis' funeral, marking their first face-to-face encounter since February. The meeting follows Trump's claim of a potential Russia-Ukraine deal after discussions between his envoy and Putin in Moscow. Trump had previously accused Zelensky of risking World War Three by rejecting Washington-led ceasefire plans, which involved territorial concessions to Russia, including Crimea. Zelensky has consistently opposed these concessions, suggesting a full ceasefire is needed for meaningful discussions. </p>

          <p>Students at Occidental College initiated a hunger strike to pressure the institution to divest from weapons manufacturers tied to Israel amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Inspired by a similar campaign at Chapman University, the students are also demanding increased protections for international students facing visa revocations under the Trump administration. The hunger strikers are consuming only water with electrolytes and are sharing emotional condemnations of the Palestinian deaths in Gaza. The college has acknowledged the students' concerns and stated that many of the initiatives they advocate for are already in place.</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings lowered the bond ratings for the city of Los Angeles due to a nearly $1-billion budget deficit, downgrading its long-term rating for general obligation bonds to AA- from AA. The downgrade reflects concerns about the city's weakening financial position and the rapid depletion of its reserve fund. The agency warned of further downgrades if the city fails to promptly address its budget management. The city is considering laying off around 1,650 city workers to close the gap in the 2024-25 budget.</p>

          <p>A Pasadena-based small business, Nila, which designs specialized LED lights for stadiums, Hollywood, and Congress, faces uncertainty due to President Trump's new trade policies, including a 145% tariff on Chinese goods.

The piece emphasizes that societal progress is hindered not by a lack of free press, but by an unwillingness to believe the truth, highlighting the importance of those willing to speak out. The author references historical examples like the Watergate scandal and the play "Gas Light" to illustrate how hiding the truth enables control and manipulation.</p>

          <p>Aimee Semple McPherson, arriving in Los Angeles in 1918 with "10 dollars and a tambourine," became a founding figure of reinvention in the city's religious landscape. Los Angeles, known for embracing innovation over tradition, proved fertile ground for new religious movements, allowing identity fluidity and belief experimentation. McPherson founded the Angelus Temple, one of America's first megachurches, and a pioneering Christian radio station, combining theatrical spectacle with gospel teachings. Her life, marked by both ambition and scandal, reflects Los Angeles' enduring allure as a place for transformation and second chances.</p>

Currently, visitors must trespass along active train tracks, leading to safety concerns and near-miss incidents. Efforts to negotiate with private landowners and Union Pacific Railroad to build a safe hiking trail have been unsuccessful for decades due to property rights and bureaucratic hurdles.

          <p>A Durham University study challenges the common perception of chimpanzees as violent and unempathetic, finding that they console each other in distress as often as bonobos, which are typically considered more empathetic. Researchers observed 1,400 hours of behavior across both species, noting that chimpanzees comforted each other through embracing, holding hands, and touching. The study suggests that emotional sensitivity develops early in apes, with younger bonobos and young male chimpanzees being the most likely to offer consolation. These findings offer insights into the evolution of human social behavior.</p>

          <p>Despite the pressing issues of climate change, including melting Arctic ice and record wildfires, it is not a top concern for Canadian voters in the upcoming election. Instead, the focus is on choosing a leader who can effectively confront Donald J. Trump, whose threats of trade war and annexation have dominated the political discourse. The election is primarily centered on leadership and national security concerns related to the United States, overshadowing environmental issues.</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States have commenced a third round of talks regarding Iran's nuclear activities, raising hopes for a new agreement that could prevent further conflict in the Middle East. President Trump has expressed optimism about reaching a deal, contrasting with his decision to abandon a previous nuclear agreement in 2018. The talks aim to reshape regional and global security by reducing the likelihood of military action and preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. A successful deal could also ease sanctions and attract foreign investment to Iran.</p>

          <p>With Election Day approaching in Canada, polls indicate a tightening race between the Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, and the Conservative Party. While the Liberal Party maintains a lead, the gap has narrowed since the beginning of the campaign. Despite the tightening polls, analysts suggest that the Liberal Party is still poised to win due to the distribution of votes across the country. A victory would grant Carney a full term as prime minister.</p>

          <p>During the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attempted to reassure global economic leaders about the strength of the U.S. dollar. His efforts followed a period of financial market turbulence caused by President Trump's trade war, which led to swings in stocks and a weakening dollar. The fact that Bessent felt compelled to address these concerns underscores the increasing unease about the dollar's global standing and the potential consequences of a loss of faith in U.S. assets.</p>
