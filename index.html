          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 07:06:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered widespread tsunami alerts across the Pacific, including for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan. While some coastal areas in Russia and Japan experienced flooding, initial waves were smaller than feared in many locations, leading authorities to downgrade warnings to advisories. Officials still urged caution as the event unfolded, with transportation disruptions and evacuations occurring in numerous countries. The powerful quake is among the strongest ever recorded, prompting a significant but ultimately manageable international response.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has disclosed that grand jury proceedings for Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell involved testimony from only two law enforcement witnesses, an FBI agent and an NYPD detective. No victims testified directly before the grand juries investigating the high-profile sex-trafficking case. The DOJ stated that much of the testimony is consistent with public trial accounts and has proposed redacting victim-identifying information before potentially unsealing the materials. This revelation provides new insight into the prosecutorial process behind one of the most significant cases of its kind.</p>

          <p>Cincinnati Bengals star defensive end Trey Hendrickson is set to end his training camp holdout and rejoin the team, according to reports. The move comes despite not yet securing the new long-term contract extension he has been seeking. Hendrickson, who led the NFL in sacks last season, was the final player in the league holding out over a contract dispute. His return is a positive step for the Bengals as they prepare for the upcoming season, though negotiations are expected to continue.</p>

          <p>Industry leaders suggest that the regulatory environment in Washington D.C. has become more favorable toward cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) under the Trump administration. Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie noted a shift from an "antagonistic" to a more welcoming and innovative-friendly attitude from regulators. This change follows President Trump's signing of the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins, aligning with his goal of making the U.S. a "crypto capital." The perceived friendlier climate is encouraging for firms looking to launch new crypto-related financial products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Total mortgage application volume in the United States has fallen to its lowest level since May, dropping 3.8% in the last week. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, this decline is driven more by consumer uncertainty about the economy and job market than by interest rates, which have remained relatively stable. Applications for both home purchases and refinancing decreased, indicating that prospective buyers are hesitant to make major financial commitments. This trend suggests broader economic anxiety is a key factor weighing on the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

A study published in Nature found that as liberals' opinion of Tesla plummeted, their overall intent to buy an EV also declined into negative territory. Conversely, Musk's politics have not significantly increased interest in EVs among conservatives, who remain skeptical. This indicates the Tesla CEO's personal brand has become so intertwined with EVs that it may be hindering the broader green transportation movement.</p>

          <p>The Senate's confirmation of Emil Bove to a lifetime federal appeals court seat suggests a new criterion for judicial appointments in the Trump administration: personal loyalty. Bove, a former Trump defense lawyer, was known for his aggressive actions at the Department of Justice, including firing prosecutors and allegedly encouraging defiance of court orders. His confirmation, despite opposition from hundreds of former DOJ lawyers and even some conservatives, signals a shift away from appointments based on established legal philosophies. This development indicates that demonstrating a willingness to act as a presidential enforcer may now be a primary route to the federal bench.</p>

          <h2>The Decline of the 'Setup': Why Fewer Couples Meet Through Friends in the App Era</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meeting a romantic partner through a friend-arranged "setup," once a common practice, has become increasingly rare in the age of dating apps. While online dating was the primary way 39 percent of straight couples met in 2017, only 20 percent met through friends, a stark reversal from previous decades. Experts suggest this shift is due to the vast choice and control offered by apps, which contrasts with the limited and sometimes awkward nature of a setup. As singles grow frustrated with app culture, some are trying to revive community-based dating, but the individualistic nature of modern courtship remains dominant.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles dance community is facing a crisis following the termination of National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) grants under the Trump administration. Dozens of L.A. arts organizations have had their funding cut, forcing them to scale back programming, national tours, and artist support. Dance, already one of the most underfunded arts disciplines, is particularly vulnerable to these cuts. Arts leaders describe the situation as a "state of emergency," as companies are forced to reevaluate their operations and seek alternative funding to survive the federal shortfall.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the federal government can learn from successful state-level experiments in reducing regulatory burdens, particularly Virginia's recent efforts. Under Governor Glenn Youngkin, Virginia set a goal to cut regulatory requirements by 25% and has reportedly saved businesses and citizens over $1.2 billion annually. The state used a small, dedicated office and is now piloting AI to scan and compare regulations for inconsistencies and excessive stringency. The author suggests this targeted, tech-driven approach provides a cost-effective playbook for the Trump administration's initiative to streamline federal red tape.</p>

Educated in Switzerland alongside her brother, she is the vice director of the powerful Propaganda and Agitation Department and is one of his most trusted aides.

          <p>A new study suggests that the collective experience of living through the COVID-19 pandemic sped up the brain's aging process, even for individuals who never contracted the virus. Researchers analyzed brain scans taken before and after the pandemic, finding subtle but measurable signs of faster aging. This effect is believed to be linked to the cumulative stressors of the era, such as isolation, anxiety, and disrupted routines. While accelerated aging was seen broadly, only those who were infected with COVID-19 showed measurable declines in cognitive performance.</p>

          <p>Despite a long-standing policy limiting direct cooperation with federal immigration authorities, the Los Angeles Police Department is indirectly enabling deportations by routinely sharing fingerprint data. When individuals are arrested and booked, their fingerprints are shared with a federal database, which can alert U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This process has led to the deportation of undocumented individuals even when local charges are dropped. The practice raises concerns among city officials and civil rights advocates that the spirit of L.A.'s sanctuary policies is being undermined.</p>

This article explains that the Fed is designed to make necessary, sometimes unpopular, monetary policy decisions free from short-term political influence to maintain economic stability and public credibility. Historically, when presidents like Richard Nixon successfully pressured the Fed, it contributed to negative outcomes like the high inflation of the 1970s.

While patients should continue taking their prescribed medications, they are urged to be extra vigilant about staying cool and hydrated.
