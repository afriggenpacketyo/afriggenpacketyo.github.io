          <p>As college costs continue to rise, many students rely on federal loans, which offer borrower protections but have specific borrowing caps. This article details the annual and lifetime limits for federal student loans, which vary based on factors like dependency status, year in school, and whether the student is an undergraduate or graduate. These limits often do not cover the full cost of attendance, particularly at private universities, creating a funding gap that students may need to fill with other options like private loans. The article advises exhausting federal options first due to their favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A dispute has emerged between NHS England and the British Medical Association (BMA) over staffing levels during an upcoming five-day strike by resident doctors. NHS England has instructed hospitals to avoid canceling non-urgent care, a departure from previous strike protocols. The BMA warns this directive will stretch non-striking senior doctors too thin, compromising emergency services and patient safety. The strike stems from an ongoing pay dispute, with the BMA demanding wage restoration to 2008 levels in real terms.</p>

          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share amid economic headwinds by focusing on value, according to CEO Russell Weiner. The company reported strong U.S. same-store sales growth, attributing its success to popular deals and new products like stuffed crust pizza, which have resonated with customers across all income levels. While competitors struggle with sluggish traffic, Domino's believes its strategy of offering value on desired items gives it a competitive edge in luring diners away from both rivals and eating at home. The company's earnings, however, were impacted by a charge related to its China licensee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be a breakthrough treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder affecting women. Patients and researchers report that the drugs, known for promoting weight loss and improving insulin sensitivity, also help alleviate PCOS symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and hormonal imbalances. While there is no standard treatment for PCOS, the metabolic improvements from GLP-1s appear to indirectly address its root causes. However, more extensive research and challenges with insurance coverage remain significant hurdles.</p>

          <p>This article reviews the publicly known history of the relationship between Donald Trump and the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The two were social fixtures in New York and Palm Beach from the 1980s to the early 2000s, frequently photographed at parties and flying on Epstein's private jets. The report references a 2002 quote where Trump called Epstein a "terrific guy" and a newly reported 2003 "birthday book" message allegedly from Trump. While their friendship reportedly ended in a dispute in 2004, their long association continues to draw scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A new crypto treasury company, The Ether Machine, is set to trade on the Nasdaq, aiming to become the largest public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Unlike strategies that simply buy and hold the asset, this company plans to focus on generating yield through staking, a process that contributes to the Ethereum network's operations. The company's chairman, Andrew Keys, argues that this makes ether a more "productive" asset than bitcoin and that existing ether ETFs do not offer this yield-generating capability. The move reflects growing institutional interest in ether and tokenization. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics argue the move is a political power grab that could illegally undermine the voting power of communities of color and will likely face immediate legal challenges.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced the recall after nine children, aged 22 months to 3 years, died between 2007 and 2022. The recalled pools, which are 48 inches or taller, have external compression straps that can create a foothold, allowing children to climb in even when the ladder is removed.
