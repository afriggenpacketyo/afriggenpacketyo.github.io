            <p>Senior scientist Yi Shouliang has left his position at the U.S. Department of Energy and the University of Pittsburgh to return to China, where he will take on a new role at Sichuan University. This decision comes amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. Yi previously served as a principal scientist at the DOE’s National Energy Technology Laboratory, focusing on carbon capture and water management, before founding American Sustainable Membrane Technology LLC. The circumstances surrounding his departure from the U.S. remain undisclosed, with his name largely absent from official DOE and NETL websites despite his prior tenure.</p>

            <p>Closing arguments have been presented in the bribery trial of Nadine Menendez, accused of aiding her husband, former Sen. Bob Menendez, in exchanging his influence for personal gains. Prosecutors argued that Nadine acted as a 'partner in crime,' facilitating deals involving gold bars and cash, while the defense countered that the government's definitions were overly broad and questioned witness credibility. The former senator was sentenced in a separate trial to 11 years in prison on bribery, acting as a foreign agent, and obstruction charges. Judge Sidney H. Stein will deliver jury instructions before deliberations begin.</p>

            <p>A report by the European Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that China's 'Made in China 2025' plan has missed several key targets for technological self-sufficiency. While China has exceeded goals in the automotive sector, it lags in aerospace and high-end robotics. The plan has also fostered unhealthy industrial competition and worsened global trade tensions. Despite these shortcomings, China has made significant progress in manufacturing, driving 29% of global manufacturing value add, nearly equal to the U.S. and Europe combined.</p>

The artwork depicts domesticated brown rats with coat color variation, predating previous records by over two centuries.

Brown rats, originating in northern China and Mongolia, have become widespread, with domesticated forms including fancy rats and laboratory rats used in biological research.</p>

            <p>The U.S. has unveiled plans to impose port fees on Chinese ships to revive domestic shipbuilding and challenge China's industry dominance. The fees will be based on cargo weight, container count, or vehicle number, starting in 180 days and increasing annually. This move, less severe than initially proposed, aims to address trade imbalances but raises concerns about disrupting global trade. Experts note the tariffs could lead to cargo redirection and increased consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's upcoming state visit to the UK, dubbed a 'fest', is seen as a potential remedy for strained relations. The visit, planned for September, comes after a controversial first term and amidst disagreements on issues like Ukraine and tariffs. While Trump remains divisive in Britain, the government hopes his fondness for the Royal Family and pomp will offer vital diplomatic leverage. Despite the risks, British officials believe the visit could strengthen the special relationship.</p>

One explanation for America’s trade aggression is that it is using tariffs to pressure countries into negotiating resolutions to long-standing trade imbalances.</p>
