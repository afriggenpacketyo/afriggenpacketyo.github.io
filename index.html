          <p>Families of missing Ukrainian soldiers gathered near the Belarus border as a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine began. Relatives, holding photos of their loved ones, anxiously awaited information after years of uncertainty. The exchange, agreed upon during talks in Turkey, involves sick, wounded, and young prisoners, as well as the remains of deceased soldiers. President Zelensky acknowledged the complexity of the process, with negotiations ongoing daily. Some Ukrainian prisoners had been in Russian captivity since the war's start, enduring poor conditions and limited Red Cross visits, needing rehabilitation upon return. The article highlights the emotional toll on families and the difficult realities of prisoner exchanges in ongoing conflicts. The experience has been particularly hard on family members who have been waiting for any kind of information. </p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a reminder that Costco membership cards are not acceptable forms of identification at airport security checkpoints. Travelers need a Real ID or another approved form of ID, such as a passport or U.S. Department of Defense ID, for domestic flights and federal facility access. The TSA clarified that while a Costco card might help establish a baseline identity if all other forms of ID are lost, it is insufficient for full verification. The agency issues routine reminders about unacceptable IDs to prevent delays at airport checkpoints. Travelers should consult the TSA website for a complete list of acceptable forms of identification. </p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, his former co-star in the film "It Ends With Us". Lively had previously filed a suit against Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment on set and retaliation for reporting the incidents. Baldoni's suit claimed Lively aimed to ruin his career by falsely accusing him of sexual assault and starting a smear campaign. The judge ruled that Baldoni failed to prove Lively's threats constituted extortion or that she was responsible for defamatory statements beyond her own lawsuit, which is privileged. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a victory, while Baldoni has been given leave to amend his allegations related to interference with contracts. </p>

Seltzer garnered over 90 percent of the electronic vote, with more than 38,000 members participating. The race became a microcosm of broader pressures on the American legal system, partly due to Bondi's relation to Attorney General Pam Bondi. Seltzer focused her campaign on upholding the rule of law and ensuring lawyers feel safe to represent their clients. Bondi expressed disappointment that the election became politicized, with partisan attacks overshadowing discussions on training programs and pro bono work. </p>

Colindres, who arrived in the U.S. as a child, had his asylum case denied in 2023, but his family had been regularly checking in with ICE. Supporters say ICE agents were waiting for Colindres and gave no explanation for his detention. The Department of Homeland Security stated that those arrested had final removal orders and had not complied.

          <p>Republican leaders are attributing the ongoing Los Angeles riots to failed policies by Sacramento Democrats, claiming that a Republican effort to improve coordination between law enforcement agencies on immigration could have prevented the unrest. Assembly Minority Leader James Gallagher stated that agitators and California policies caused the chaos. Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones said Senate Bill 554, which would have allowed improved communication with federal immigration agencies, was tanked by Democrats. Republicans argue that the lack of cooperation led to broader ICE raids and collateral arrests. Governor Gavin Newsom, however, blamed President Trump for the unrest, accusing him of inflaming the situation. </p>

          <p>An inquest into the death of Rhianan Rudd, a 16-year-old who was charged with terrorism offenses after being groomed online, found that authorities missed opportunities to help her. The chief coroner concluded that police and Derbyshire County Council could have referred Rudd earlier as a potential victim of modern slavery. Rudd, who took her own life in May 2022, had become the youngest girl charged with terrorism offenses in the UK after downloading a bomb-making manual. The inquest found no organization was to blame for her death, but highlighted missed opportunities to provide mental health support sooner.

          <p>California officials announced they would file a federal lawsuit against President Trump and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the deployment of the National Guard during immigration protests in Los Angeles. The lawsuit alleges that Trump overstepped his federal authority and violated the U.S. Constitution. Attorney General Rob Bonta said the deployment was an abuse of presidential authority and a breach of state sovereignty. The move follows days of protests and clashes after ICE raids, with Governor Newsom accusing Trump of sowing chaos for political purposes. Trump officials defended the mobilization as legal under Title 10 of the U.S. Code. </p>

CEO Tim Cook is expected to deliver a keynote address, highlighting refinements in Apple Intelligence and Siri integration with Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT. Analysts anticipate a new nomenclature for the operating system, aligning the iOS version with the year of release (e.g., iOS 26 for 2026). A redesign of the operating system interface, called "Liquid Glass," is also rumored. While some analysts are underwhelmed by the slower rollout of Apple Intelligence, others believe this event will mark the start of AI monetization for the Apple ecosystem. </p>
