          <p>A minute's silence was held to honor three teenage friends, Fergus Ward, Lewis Knox, and Jordan Cameron, who died in a single-vehicle crash in the Scottish Highlands. Both Ward and Knox were regular members of the Fort William Shinty Club, which described the loss as a profound tragedy for the community. The club, along with other local sports teams and political leaders including First Minister John Swinney, expressed deep condolences to the families. The community has come together to support one another and honor the memory of the young men.</p>

          <p>On the eve of a state visit to China, Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two nations and condemned what he called “attempts to distort” the history of World War II. During his trip, Putin is scheduled to meet with President Xi Jinping and attend China's Victory Day parade as the guest of honor. He emphasized a common stance with China against discriminatory Western sanctions, signaling a unified front on key political and economic issues. The visit underscores the deepening alignment between Moscow and Beijing amid ongoing global tensions.</p>

          <p>E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding is experiencing a resurgence in its domestic market, with executives citing strong “consumer mindshare” and successful user growth. The company's recent robust earnings report, which caused its stock to jump, was bolstered by the success of its Taobao Instant Commerce initiative launched in April. CEO Eddie Wu Yongming expressed confidence that the company can achieve industry-leading efficiency long-term due to its newly achieved scale. The positive results suggest Alibaba's strategic push into on-demand delivery is effectively countering intense market competition.</p>

          <p>After a nearly five-decade career at The Washington Post covering 12 elections and eight presidencies, political correspondent Dan Balz is retiring. In a recent interview, Balz reflected on the significant shifts he has witnessed in American democracy, concluding that politics has grown progressively “tougher, coarser, and meaner.” He noted that public trust in government plummeted during the Vietnam War and Watergate eras and has failed to recover since. His observations point to a long-term trend of increasing polarization and harshness in the nation's political discourse.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Cracker Barrel's Failed Rebranding Attempt Ignored Core Customer Base</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Cracker Barrel's recent $700 million rebranding effort failed because corporate leadership ignored the preferences of its loyal customers. The author visited multiple locations and found that regulars valued the restaurant's comfortable, traditional, and Americana-focused atmosphere, which the rebrand sought to modernize. The changes, including altering the iconic logo and brightening interiors, were deeply unpopular with the patrons interviewed.

          <p>Elliott Investment Management has taken a significant position in Rexford Industrial Realty, a REIT specializing in Southern California industrial properties. The article suggests Elliott will push for changes to address what it sees as poor corporate governance, bloated expenses, and misaligned management interests that have caused the company's stock to trade at a discount to its net asset value. Historically, Rexford's prime portfolio commanded a premium valuation, but its value has declined amid concerns over its management structure and strategy. Elliott's involvement may lead to governance reforms or catalyze a potential acquisition of the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to exert influence over the Federal Reserve, including the attempted removal of Governor Lisa Cook, represent a significant challenge to the central bank's long-standing political independence.

While Trump aims to lower interest rates to boost the economy, experts warn that politicizing the Fed could erode its credibility and risk economic instability, drawing parallels to nations where dictators set monetary policy.</p>

          <p>A goal by 18-year-old Fulham midfielder Josh King was controversially disallowed after a VAR review during a Premier League match against Chelsea. The on-field referee initially awarded the goal but overturned his decision after viewing a pitchside monitor, citing a "careless challenge" by Rodrigo Muniz on Trevoh Chalobah in the build-up. The decision was widely criticized by pundits, including former players Curtis Davies and Danny Murphy, who argued the contact was minimal and did not meet the "clear and obvious" error standard required for VAR intervention.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's imposition of sweeping global tariffs was an illegal overreach of his executive authority. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the administration used to justify the levies, does not grant the president the power to impose tariffs. The decision upholds a lower court's ruling but keeps the tariffs in place until mid-October to allow for an appeal. The case is now expected to proceed to the Supreme Court, creating uncertainty for the U.S. economy and global trade relations.</p>

          <p>Groundbreaking new research indicates that beta-blockers, a class of drugs prescribed for decades after a heart attack, offer no benefit to the majority of patients and may even be harmful to some.

Furthermore, for women in this group, beta-blocker use was linked to a significantly higher risk of another heart attack, hospitalization, and death. These findings are expected to reshape international treatment guidelines and prompt a more sex-specific approach to cardiovascular care.</p>

          <p>In an interview about his book "Breakneck," author Dan Wang posits that a key difference between China and the U.S. is their governing philosophies. He describes China as an “engineering state,” run by leaders with technical backgrounds who approach societal problems as large-scale projects, resulting in rapid infrastructure development. In contrast, he characterizes the U.S. as a “lawyerly society,” where a focus on procedure, debate, and litigation often leads to paralysis and makes it difficult to build major projects. This framework helps explain why a poor Chinese province can have superior infrastructure to America's wealthiest states.</p>

          <p>Costa Coffee, one of the UK's largest coffee chains, is reportedly struggling as consumer preferences, particularly among younger generations, shift towards specialty and non-coffee beverages like matcha. The article contrasts Costa's traditional offerings with the success of newer, trendier chains like Blank Street Coffee, which have built a following through social media and a diverse menu. With Costa's owner, Coca-Cola, reportedly exploring a sale, analysts suggest the brand is caught in the middle, lacking the value of budget options and the unique experience of artisanal cafes.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing significant political headwinds as he pushes forward with his "autumn of reform," an ambitious plan to overhaul the nation's welfare state and boost its stagnating economy. The primary challenge comes from his coalition partners, the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), who oppose welfare cuts and instead advocate for higher taxes on the wealthy. With a €172 billion budget hole looming and pressure from his own conservative base, Merz must navigate a difficult path of compromise to avoid the kind of government infighting that plagued the previous administration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article defends the efficacy of direct cash transfers as an anti-poverty tool, pushing back against recent discourse that has focused on lackluster results from a few small-scale pilot programs. The author argues that while these new studies showed limited secondary impacts on metrics like health or employment, they confirmed the primary goal: giving people money reduces poverty. The piece emphasizes that decades of research on larger programs like Social Security and tax credits have consistently shown that cash transfers are one of the most effective ways to lift millions out of poverty.</p>

          <p>Five Democratic U.S. senators have sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio demanding an immediate and “massive surge” of humanitarian aid, particularly baby formula, into Gaza. The letter highlights that international monitors have officially declared a famine in Gaza City, where infants are reportedly dying from starvation. Citing a moral obligation, the senators, led by Ruben Gallego, urge the administration to use its full authority to ensure aid is delivered.

They argue the arrest was illegal and violated Department of Homeland Security policies that prohibit immigration enforcement actions at emergency response sites.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly using a rarely deployed legal tactic to keep immigrants in custody even after they have been granted bond by an immigration judge. According to lawyers, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is filing appeals and invoking an automatic stay on judges' release orders, effectively overriding the court's decision. The case of Luis Fernandez, a New York resident detained in Texas, illustrates the policy's impact, leaving families in limbo. Critics argue this is a punitive, nationwide strategy designed to maximize punishment and undermine due process for immigrants.</p>

Now, Black-led charter systems and non-profit organizations like Black Education for New Orleans (Be Nola) are working to reverse this trend.

Instead of focusing on the minutiae of nutrition, Sole-Smith advocates for ensuring children have access to enough food and respecting their bodily autonomy.
