          <p>The Chinese government has criticized the Trump administration's decision to ban international students from Harvard, stating that it will damage America's international reputation. A university in Hong Kong has extended an invitation to affected students, offering streamlined admission procedures and academic support. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning emphasized that educational cooperation with the U.S. is mutually beneficial and that China opposes its politicization, adding that China would protect the rights of Chinese students abroad. The issue of Chinese students studying overseas has been a point of tension in the U.S.-China relationship for years.</p>

          <p>Ofgem, the UK's energy regulator, has announced a decrease in the energy price cap, resulting in a typical household saving of £11 per month starting in July. Despite this reduction, Ofgem advises households to explore fixed-rate energy deals, as they may offer better value than the variable tariffs governed by the price cap. Tim Jarvis, director general of markets at Ofgem, encourages consumers to shop around and discuss options with their existing suppliers. Citizens Advice has expressed concern that the price cap reduction offers little comfort to those struggling with debt, urging the government to provide targeted support and energy efficiency measures.</p>

Trump claimed there is a lot of sense in crypto and that his administration is honored to help those in the industry, as the event was designed to promote sales of his $TRUMP cryptocurrency, a memecoin launched just days before Trump’s inauguration. </p>

The workers are not trapped but are remaining at the sub-shaft station until it is safe to proceed to the surface.

          <p>Doctors in England are threatening strike action after receiving a 4% pay rise, which the British Medical Association (BMA) deems insufficient to reverse historical pay freezes. The BMA plans to ballot members next week regarding potential strike action. The National Education Union (NEU) may also dispute the government if it does not fully fund the 4% pay rise for teachers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended the offers, noting they are above inflation, while the BMA argues doctors' pay is still significantly lower than it was 16 years ago when accounting for inflation.</p>

          <p>A House Republican tax bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," has been passed, revealing a stark contrast in financial benefits between high-earners and low-income households. The bill provides tax cuts for business owners, investors, and homeowners in high-tax areas, disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest Americans. To offset these cuts, the bill reduces social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, negatively impacting low-income earners. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bottom tenth of households will experience a 2% income decrease in 2027 and a 4% decrease in 2033, while the top 10% will see an income boost.</p>

          <p>Steven Hotze, a Republican donor from Texas, has a history of opposing LGBTQ+ rights and is now challenging healthcare coverage for HIV prevention medication (PrEP) in a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Hotze's lawsuit objects to the Affordable Care Act's requirement that his company's insurance plan cover PrEP, arguing it violates his religious beliefs. A ruling in favor of Hotze could significantly impact healthcare access for LGBTQ+ individuals and jeopardize preventive treatments for millions. Critics argue that the case is rooted in bigotry and threatens essential healthcare services.</p>

          <p>President Trump has asserted that military recruitment has reached a 30-year high due to increased patriotism following his reelection. However, military records indicate that enlistments began rebounding during former President Biden's term, driven by recruitment reforms. Experts attribute the continued improvements to changes in recruitment strategy and compensation, rather than the change in commander-in-chief. While enlistments have risen year over year, they remain below recent peaks, and recruitment reforms have helped candidates struggling with enlistment requirements.</p>

The group has grown to include relatives of 170 of the migrant men detained in El Salvador, and the members frequently make trips to Miramar, Venezuela, to pressure officials to demand the release and deportation of the men back to their country.</p>
