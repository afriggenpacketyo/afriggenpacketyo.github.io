          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim described his team as "completely lost" following a stunning Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town, a team from the fourth tier of English football. Despite fielding a team of expensive international players, United trailed 2-0 before late goals forced a penalty shootout. The Premier League club ultimately lost the shootout 12-11, marking one of the most significant upsets in the club's recent history. The loss eliminates a key opportunity for a trophy and deepens concerns about the team's direction under its new management.</p>

          <p>Susan Monarez has been removed as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention just weeks after her Senate confirmation, with the Department of Health and Human Services confirming her departure. The move coincides with the resignations of at least three other senior CDC leaders, who cited the "weaponizing of public health" and political interference as reasons for leaving. These leadership changes occur during a period of significant upheaval for the agency, which has faced budget cuts, layoffs, and skepticism from HHS Secretary Robert F.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a provocative political maneuver, California Republicans have proposed a resolution to split the state into two, separating the conservative rural interior from the liberal coastal regions. The proposal, dubbed a "two-state solution," is a direct response to a Democratic-led ballot initiative that seeks to redraw congressional districts, which Republicans argue would dilute rural representation. While the plan to divide California is highly unlikely to succeed, it highlights the intense partisan battle over redistricting and control of Congress. Democrats have dismissed the proposal as a political stunt and an example of gerrymandering itself.</p>

          <p>The Danish government has summoned the highest-ranking U.S. diplomat in Copenhagen following reports of a covert American operation in Greenland aimed at fostering a secessionist movement favorable to the U.S. The move signals significant diplomatic tension, as Denmark considers any interference in its internal affairs unacceptable. This incident follows previous statements by President Trump expressing a desire to annex the semi-autonomous Danish territory and accusations of underinvestment by Vice-President JD Vance. The situation underscores growing concerns in Denmark over the Trump administration's intentions regarding Greenland's strategic location and resources.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's penalty shootout loss to fourth-tier Grimsby Town is being ranked among the most significant upsets in the history of English domestic cup competitions. The article contextualizes the shocking result by comparing it to other famous giant-killings, such as York City's 3-0 victory at Old Trafford in 1995 and non-league Sutton United's defeat of top-flight Coventry in 1989. The defeat highlights a pattern of vulnerability for the Premier League giant in cup ties against lower-league opposition. It serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of knockout football tournaments.</p>

          <p>President Trump launched a social media attack against late-night host Seth Meyers and NBC, questioning the network's decision to extend Meyers' contract through 2028. Trump called Meyers one of the "least talented" hosts with "no Ratings, Talent, or Intelligence," continuing a long-standing feud that intensified after Meyers' critical performance at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner. The article positions this outburst within a broader context of the President's ongoing conflict with political satirists and media critics. It also notes the precarious environment for such shows, referencing the recent cancellation of Stephen Colbert's program on Paramount.</p>

Despite an estimated 35 million Chinese casualties as a key Allied power, Beijing now finds itself portrayed by Western nations as a revisionist power seeking to upend the post-war order. The article suggests that China aims to use the anniversary to assert its role as a defender of global norms established after the war.

          <p>Nvidia announced quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, projecting continued strong sales growth driven by demand for its artificial intelligence chips. Despite the positive report, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading because its data center revenue, while up 56% year-over-year, fell slightly short of analyst estimates. The results confirm the central role of Nvidia's technology in the global AI infrastructure boom, with the company forecasting massive industry spending by the end of the decade. The report also noted no sales of its custom H20 chip to China due to geopolitical restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

The CMA contends its approach is different and designed to foster innovation by requiring Apple to allow more interoperability with its mobile technology.

To avoid financial strain, experts from Edmunds advise buyers to avoid several common pitfalls, including purchasing a vehicle beyond their means and accepting dealership financing without securing a preapproved loan from a bank or credit union. Other costly errors include trading in a car with negative equity, which rolls debt into a new loan, and failing to negotiate with a dealership's internet sales team first.

          <p>The pastor and prophetess of a Hemet-based religious group, "His Way Spirit Led Assemblies," have been arrested on illegal weapons charges as police investigate the disappearance of two former members. Authorities are treating the 2023 disappearance of Emilio Ghanem as a potential homicide after he left the group and started a competing business. Police are also searching for a second man, Ruben Moreno, who vanished in 2017 while living with the group. Searches of properties connected to the sect have uncovered numerous illegal firearms, including automatic rifles and unserialized ghost guns.</p>

          <p>Universities across the United States are experiencing a sharp drop in international student enrollment as the fall semester begins, a trend attributed to a clampdown on student visas by the Trump administration. The increased scrutiny and delays in the visa process have led many accepted students to defer or enroll in other countries, with a predicted national decline of about 15%. This downturn could result in a $7 billion loss to local economies and impact campus diversity and innovation. Despite recent comments from President Trump supporting an increase in students from China, the current policy environment continues to create uncertainty for schools and applicants.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut appearing likely in September, savers have a limited window to maximize returns on certificates of deposit (CDs). Financial analysts recommend that consumers act proactively by shopping for the highest rates, which are often found at online banks due to their lower overhead costs. It is also crucial for individuals to accurately assess how much they can afford to lock away to avoid early withdrawal penalties. Securing the longest-term CD possible within one's budget can lock in current high rates for an extended period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new lawsuit alleges that New Orleans Archbishop Gregory Aymond personally covered up child sexual assault committed by priests and deacons within the archdiocese. The suit was filed not by survivors, but by a trustee for bondholders who claim the church concealed the extent of the abuse before they purchased $41 million in church debt. Citing investigative reporting, the lawsuit claims Aymond knew about abusers for years before making their names public. The archdiocese has called the allegations baseless, but the filing adds another layer of scrutiny to its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings related to hundreds of abuse claims.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners needing financing, September may be an opportune time to consider a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). With average interest rates lower than those for personal loans and credit cards, HELOCs currently represent one of the more affordable borrowing options. Furthermore, because HELOCs have variable rates, they could become even cheaper if the Federal Reserve proceeds with an anticipated interest rate cut this month. Rising home equity levels across the country also mean that homeowners may have a larger pool of funds to draw from for major expenses or projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel quickly abandoned a planned rebrand and new logo after facing widespread criticism on social media, including from President Donald Trump. The swift reversal is an example of a growing trend where legacy brands retreat from marketing changes that alienate their core customer base in the age of rapid, widespread online feedback. Marketing experts note that while some rebrands like Dunkin' have succeeded by evolving with customer behavior, abrupt changes can be perceived as inauthentic or politically motivated. The controversy highlights the challenge for established companies trying to attract new demographics without losing their traditional identity.</p>

The government states the extension was always intended to be temporary and is now reversing the policy for most individuals starting in September.

          <p>President Trump's move to oust Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has ignited a debate among liberals and progressives about the principle of central bank independence. While many liberals view Trump's action as an anti-democratic assault on a key institution, some progressives argue that the Fed's insulation from political accountability is itself undemocratic. This article explores the tension between these viewpoints, weighing the benefits of an independent Fed in ensuring price stability against concerns that it gives unelected technocrats immense power over the economy. The controversy forces a choice between defending established norms and pushing for a more politically accountable system of monetary policy.</p>
