            <p>The Supreme Court is considering a case that challenges the Affordable Care Act's provision for no-cost preventive care services, such as cancer screenings and HIV-prevention drugs. The dispute centers on the classification of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, with arguments focusing on whether its members are principal officers requiring presidential appointment and Senate confirmation. A ruling against the ACA could limit access to vital medical care for millions, as insurers may no longer be required to cover these services without cost-sharing. The court's decision, expected by late June or early July, could significantly impact healthcare access across the nation.</p>

            <p>Capital One has received approval from banking regulators for its $35 billion acquisition of Discover Financial, a move analysts believe signals a potentially more lenient regulatory environment. The acquisition is expected to boost Capital One's earnings and decrease its reliance on Mastercard and Visa by owning Discover's payment network. While broader market concerns about tariffs impacted financial stocks, analysts view the approval as a positive sign for further bank consolidation and improved earnings potential for Capital One. This is a key reason why the Club first started a position in Capital One. (not investment advice)</p>

The club now sits outside the playoff contention zone with limited games remaining, leading to the decision to relieve Mowbray of his duties. James Morrison has been appointed as interim manager.</p>

            <p>The estimated 'magic number' needed to retire comfortably has fallen to $1.26 million, yet Americans are increasingly less confident they can reach it.

            <p>Experts are divided on the likelihood of mortgage rates dropping below 6% in the near future, with some believing it's possible this year, while others are skeptical. Factors such as declining inflation and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts could contribute to lower rates. Economic uncertainty, including tariff discussions, could hinder a significant drop. The 10-year Treasury bond market's performance could also influence mortgage rates, as could a potential safe investment. Staying informed on market signals and expert insights can help borrowers make confident decisions.</p>

            <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced a decline following President Donald Trump's intensified attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all saw significant drops, while the dollar index fell to its lowest level since 2022. These developments reflect growing investor anxiety over the state of the U.S. economy.</p>
