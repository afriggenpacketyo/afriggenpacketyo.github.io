          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Clinical psychologist Diana Hill and movement specialist Katy Bowman suggest retraining your brain to crave physical activity for stress relief instead of endless scrolling. They recommend using psychological flexibility techniques from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) to build a new habit. This includes 'surfing' the urge to scroll, practicing simple movements, savoring enjoyable activities, and transforming worry into compassionate action. By making movement a value-oriented choice, individuals can reduce stress, improve mood, and boost creativity.</p>

            <h2>Distinguishing Authoritarian from Authoritative Parenting Styles</h2>

            <p>The difference between authoritarian and authoritative parenting styles is a key focus in child-rearing discussions. Authoritarian parenting is characterized by a rigid, top-down approach with high control and low warmth, while authoritative parenting involves clear boundaries, open communication, and warmth. Experts recommend authoritative parenting for raising successful children, as it fosters better communication, emotional well-being, and decision-making skills compared to the potentially damaging effects of authoritarian methods.</p>
