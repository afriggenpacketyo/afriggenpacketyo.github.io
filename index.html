          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior ice hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. The judge, in her ruling, stated that she did not find the accuser's testimony to be "credible or reliable," citing inconsistencies in her statements to police and Hockey Canada investigators. The case, which centered on the issue of consent, had attracted significant public attention in Canada, leading to a packed courtroom for the verdict. The acquittal followed an eight-week trial that examined the events following a Hockey Canada gala.</p>

          <p>The romantic comedy "Oh, Hi!" starring Logan Lerman and Molly Gordon, delves into the complexities of modern dating and the "softboy" archetype. The film follows Iris (Gordon) and Isaac (Lerman) on a weekend getaway that sours when Isaac reveals his fear of commitment, leading to a tense, hostage-like situation. The article praises Molly Gordon's comedic performance but notes the film struggles with its tone, shifting between light romance and psychological thriller. It critiques the passivity of Lerman's character while acknowledging the film's smart, if underdeveloped, commentary on gender tropes and relationship expectations.</p>

          <p>This article examines the current state of foldable smartphones, highlighting them as impressive technological achievements that come with significant drawbacks. While devices like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold and Flip offer larger screens and a novel user experience, they are criticized for their high prices, increased fragility, and bulkiness compared to traditional phones. The author also notes that battery life and software optimization still lag behind standard models. The article advises most consumers to wait on adopting the technology, suggesting that Apple is likely developing its own more refined foldable device for a future release.</p>

          <p>The parents of 22-year-old Raymond Orozco are seeking justice after their son was fatally stabbed in downtown San Jose while intervening to protect a friend from an attack. The incident occurred early Sunday morning, and the suspect fled the scene before police arrived. Investigators believe the homicide may have been recorded by bystanders on their cellphones and are urging anyone with video or information to come forward. Orozco's parents described him as a "bright light" who worked in a group home and had been accepted into a fire academy, hoping to become a first responder.</p>

The case originated from a lawsuit by two tribal nations in North Dakota challenging a state legislative map for diluting Native American voting power.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is perpetuated by maximalist desires on both sides, with many Israelis and Palestinians ultimately wishing for sole control of the land. It contends that while previous U.S. administrations constrained these impulses by pushing for a two-state solution, the Trump administration has reinforced them. The author suggests that President Trump's proposal to turn Gaza into a "Riviera" was interpreted by Israel's far-right as a green light for annexation and population displacement. The article concludes that for any lasting peace, the U.S. must disavow this vision and make it clear that neither side can vanquish the other.</p>

While the government offered a 5.4% pay rise, it rejected the BMA's call for a plan to restore pay to 2008 levels, leading to the breakdown of talks and the latest round of industrial action.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases is unconstitutional. In a 2-1 decision, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the law infringes on the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. The majority opinion stated that the state failed to prove the law was consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation, a standard set by the Supreme Court's 2022 Bruen decision. The law, which took effect in 2019 after being approved by voters, was the first of its kind in the United States.</p>

          <p>Terry Bollea, known worldwide as wrestling superstar Hulk Hogan, has died at the age of 71, as confirmed by police and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Hogan was a transformative figure in professional wrestling, credited with catapulting the sport into a mainstream cultural phenomenon in the 1980s with his "Hulkamania" persona. He was a six-time WWE champion and later reinvented himself as the villainous "Hollywood Hogan," leading the New World Order faction in WCW. Beyond the ring, he was a pop culture icon, though his career was also marked by controversies, including a sex tape lawsuit and the use of racist language.</p>

          <p>Despite predictions of runaway inflation, President Trump's sweeping tariffs have not yet led to dramatic price increases, but this article argues the effect is merely delayed. Economists suggest that companies have so far absorbed costs and used existing inventory to avoid alienating consumers, but this is not sustainable. With many tariffs delayed until August or part of temporary deals, the full impact has yet to be felt. Experts predict that prices for import-sensitive goods like electronics, apparel, and furniture will likely rise later in the year as businesses can no longer shield customers from the increased costs.

          <p>The demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills is growing significantly, according to a report from the Brookings Institution. Job postings that mention AI have increased by over 100% in the last year alone and have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the past 15 years. This growth is driven by more companies integrating AI into their operations, creating a need for roles ranging from specialized AI engineers to consultants who help with implementation. These AI-related jobs are often associated with higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar positions that do not require AI skills.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, a move seen as escalating his public pressure campaign against its chairman, Jerome Powell. The visit, the first by a sitting president in nearly two decades, comes after Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates and has even floated the idea of firing him. The White House has also been critical of cost overruns on a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed's buildings. Prior to the visit, Fed officials gave a press tour, attributing some of the increased costs to tariffs and rising prices for materials and labor.</p>

A U.S. passport now offers visa-free access to 182 destinations, compared to 193 for top-ranked Singapore. The report suggests that countries like the U.S. and U.K. have fallen in the rankings due to more restrictive entry policies.

While CEO Bob Jordan noted that travel demand has recently stabilized, the company has been grappling with weaker domestic demand and increased discounting.
