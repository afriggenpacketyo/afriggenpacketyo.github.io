          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded August with significant monthly gains, though it experienced a slight retreat in the final week, breaking a four-week winning streak. Profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a mixed reaction to Nvidia's strong earnings report contributed to the downturn. Despite a slight revenue miss in its data center segment, Nvidia's overall performance was robust, though its stock dipped. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the PCE price index, showed persistent price pressures, but markets still anticipate an interest rate cut in September.

Weiss was killed on October 7, 2023, while defending Kibbutz Beeri, and his body was subsequently taken into Gaza. His wife and daughter, who were also taken hostage, were released in November 2023. The operation also recovered the remains of a second, unidentified hostage, leaving an estimated 48 hostages in Gaza, with Israel believing only 20 are still alive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is considering deploying the National Guard to Chicago, mirroring a recent federal crackdown in Washington, D.C., that heavily focused on immigration-related arrests. President Trump criticized Chicago's leadership as "grossly incompetent" while highlighting crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. Democratic officials, including Mayor Brandon Johnson, have pushed back, arguing that such a deployment would be unlawful and could escalate tensions between residents and law enforcement. The potential action aligns with the administration's broader push for aggressive immigration enforcement and deportation efforts in major cities.</p>

          <p>The federal public defender's office in Los Angeles has filed a motion to disqualify acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, arguing his appointment is illegal. The motion contends that the Trump administration used an unprecedented legal maneuver to extend Essayli's term without Senate or judicial confirmation, circumventing congressional limits. This challenge is part of a growing number of legal actions against Trump-appointed prosecutors in other states, such as New Jersey and Nevada, who are accused of being kept in power through similar tactics to bypass the standard confirmation process.</p>

          <h2>Newly Discovered Fossils Reveal Ancient Armored Dinosaur with Fused Spikes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paleontologists have uncovered new fossils of Spicomellus, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, which lived 165 million years ago. Described as one of the "strangest" dinosaurs ever found, it featured long bony spikes that were uniquely fused directly onto its rib bones, a trait unseen in any other vertebrate. This discovery in Morocco challenges previous theories that ankylosaurs evolved their complex armor later in response to large predators like the T. Rex. The finding suggests their defensive structures were elaborate much earlier than previously understood.</p>

          <p>Canadian luxury fashion retailer SSENSE has announced its intention to file for bankruptcy protection, citing an immediate liquidity crisis. The Montreal-based company attributed its financial struggles to increased trade pressures, particularly the Trump administration's recent elimination of the "de minimis" exemption for U.S.-bound shipments. This rule had allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, and its suspension has created significant challenges for many international e-commerce businesses that rely on American consumers.</p>

          <p>The latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data revealed that inflation remained persistent in July, with the annual rate holding at 2.6%. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, ticked up slightly to 2.9%, keeping pressure on the Federal Reserve. Despite the hot inflation figures, consumer spending rose, though there are signs that Americans are becoming more cautious with discretionary purchases. Analysts believe the data still leaves the door open for the Fed to cut interest rates at its September meeting to support a weakening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

The outcome of this election is critical, as Democrats currently hold a narrow 19-18 majority in the chamber. A Republican victory would create a tied Senate, potentially allowing the GOP to block the Democratic governor's legislative agenda during her final year in office.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a $5 billion cut in foreign aid by using a rare budgetary maneuver called a "pocket rescission." This tactic involves requesting Congress to cancel funds so late in the fiscal year that they expire before lawmakers are required to vote on the matter. The move, which targets funding for USAID and international peacekeeping operations, effectively bypasses Congress's constitutional power of the purse. Lawmakers from both parties have criticized the action as a potential violation of the law.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected the idea of establishing a buffer zone with Russia as part of a potential peace agreement. He argued that such a concept is obsolete in modern warfare, where long-range drones are a primary threat. Zelensky stated that a de facto "dead zone" already exists along the front lines, as heavy artillery from both sides is vulnerable to drone strikes. His comments come as diplomatic efforts to end the war appear to be faltering, with diminishing hopes for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>Amid a leadership crisis at the CDC, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is facing intense backlash for promoting questionable health claims. He recently suggested a possible link between psychiatric drugs and school shootings and claimed he could visually identify children with "mitochondrial challenges." A former top CDC official also revealed that Kennedy has never been briefed by the agency's own experts on critical topics like measles or COVID-19, deepening concerns over his leadership and reliance on unscientific information.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., has created a surreal and tense environment, with troops performing tasks from patrols to "beautification projects." The article explores the complex reactions, noting that while some residents feel a sense of menace, particularly in immigrant communities, others see the soldiers as a curiosity. It raises critical questions about the mission's legality and effectiveness, and whether this represents a test case for using the military as a domestic police force, thereby normalizing an authoritarian presence in American cities.</p>

The loss serves as a reality check for Raducanu, who had shown improved form in the tournament's early stages but has consistently struggled to secure wins against top-10 opponents.

          <p>Tesla is appealing a $242.5 million verdict against it in a wrongful death lawsuit stemming from a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system. The company has filed a motion to have the verdict thrown out or for a new trial, arguing the crash was solely the result of driver error and not any defect in its technology. The case involved a driver who, believing Autopilot would brake automatically, accelerated through an intersection, killing a 22-year-old woman and severely injuring her boyfriend.</p>

TPS is a program authorized by Congress that grants temporary legal status to individuals from countries facing severe crises, such as civil strife or natural disasters.</p>

The exemption had been a key factor in the growth of direct-to-consumer international online retail, giving shoppers access to a wide variety of affordable and specialized products from around the globe.</p>
