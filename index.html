          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order substantially reducing the Department of Education's size and power, returning authority to states.  While some key functions will remain, the move fulfills a campaign promise and reflects concerns about the department's effectiveness and spending.  This action faces opposition from those who emphasize the department's role in providing financial aid and support for students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York's highest court struck down a law allowing non-citizens to vote in local elections, citing the state constitution's restriction of voting rights to citizens.  The 6-1 decision upholds a lower court ruling and reverses a 2021 city council law that would have granted voting rights to nearly a million non-citizens.  Opponents argued the law violated the state constitution, while supporters contended it didn't explicitly deny non-citizens the right to vote.</p>
