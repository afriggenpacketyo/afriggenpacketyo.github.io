          <p>United Airlines briefly suspended all flights across the U.S. and Canada due to an unspecified technological issue, prompting a ground stop request to the Federal Aviation Administration. This incident, which lasted about half an hour, marked the second time in less than two months the airline experienced a significant technical glitch leading to widespread operational disruptions. United later confirmed it had a brief connectivity problem but quickly resumed normal operations. This article highlights recurring technical challenges impacting a major airline's operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>London Stansted Airport faced significant disruptions Wednesday morning, primarily due to signalling issues that led to the cancellation or delay of all train services connecting to the airport. This technical fault impacted both CrossCountry and Greater Anglia services, causing considerable travel chaos for passengers. Additionally, a small fire erupted in the airport's Escape Lounge, creating a substantial amount of smoke and temporarily closing access to the security area. While the fire was swiftly extinguished by airport fire services with no reported injuries, these combined incidents underscore the vulnerabilities in airport infrastructure and the potential for cascading effects on travel.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's visit to the UN, both an escalator and his teleprompter malfunctioned, leading to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggesting the escalator incident "doesn't look like a coincidence" and hinting at an intentional act. The UN, however, stated that a videographer from Trump's delegation may have inadvertently triggered the escalator's safety shutoff. Trump jokingly linked the mishaps to the UN's perceived failings in his speech. This article highlights the differing interpretations of the technical glitches and the political tensions surrounding the UN visit.</p>

This move, which involves new equity, aligns with Tether's strategy to expand its influence and potentially return to the U.S. market, given President Trump's pro-crypto stance.

          <p>President Donald Trump made several inaccurate claims regarding Tylenol use during pregnancy, childhood vaccinations, and their links to autism, contradicting medical evidence. During a press conference, Trump asserted that Tylenol causes autism and that Amish children, who he claimed don't get vaccines, don't get autism, both statements refuted by studies. He also inaccurately claimed children receive 80 vaccines and that newborns shouldn't be vaccinated against hepatitis B. This article systematically debunks these claims, emphasizing the scientific consensus that genetics primarily influences autism and vaccines are safe and crucial for public health.</p>
