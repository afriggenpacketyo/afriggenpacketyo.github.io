          <p>A double-decker bus in Eccles, Greater Manchester, had its roof completely torn off after striking a low bridge, resulting in fifteen people being hospitalized. The North West Ambulance Service confirmed that three of the individuals sustained serious injuries in the incident, which prompted a major emergency response including an air ambulance. Witnesses reported that this was not the first time a bus has crashed into this particular bridge, raising concerns about recurring safety issues at the location. Transport for Greater Manchester is currently focused on supporting the emergency response and the passengers involved in the significant collision.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated he will obstruct any deal for a new Washington Commanders stadium in the nation's capital unless the team reverts to its controversial former name. In social media posts, Trump claimed the 'Commanders' moniker is ridiculous and that his stance has been met with positive feedback, a claim disputed by Native American advocacy groups. These groups characterized his remarks as political theater that distracts from genuine issues facing their communities. The team’s ownership has previously affirmed its commitment to the current name, indicating no plans to change it despite the political pressure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing body of anecdotal evidence suggests that GLP-1 weight loss drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, may effectively treat symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women using these medications have reported significant improvements, including weight loss, hair regrowth, and the return of regular menstrual cycles. Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity indirectly helps regulate hormones, addressing a key metabolic issue linked to PCOS. While larger clinical trials are needed to confirm these benefits and address issues like insurance coverage, the initial results offer hope for a new therapeutic approach to the common hormonal disorder.</p>

          <p>The historical relationship between Donald Trump and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which spanned from the late 1980s to the early 2000s, is under renewed scrutiny. The two frequently socialized in New York and Palm Beach, with Trump once describing Epstein as a "terrific guy." A recent report detailed a 2003 birthday book for Epstein containing a message attributed to Trump alluding to shared "secrets," a claim Trump denies and is now suing over. While their friendship reportedly ended in 2004 over a business dispute, their long association continues to fuel public speculation and political controversy, separate from the many verified victims of Epstein's criminal ring.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 25 countries, including the U.K., Canada, and Japan, has issued a joint statement demanding an immediate end to the war in Gaza and condemning Israel's actions. The statement criticizes the "drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians," highlighting the severe suffering and the dangers of Israel's aid distribution model. In response, Israel rejected the statement as being "disconnected from reality" and sending the wrong message to Hamas. The international pressure mounts as Israel expands its ground operations into new areas of Gaza, displacing thousands more and escalating concerns for hostage safety.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has demanded an immediate end to cashless bail, labeling it a "complete disaster" that he claims is driving up crime and endangering law enforcement. His statement on social media coincided with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's criticism of sanctuary city policies following the shooting of an off-duty CBP officer by a previously deported individual.

CEO Russell Weiner stated that while the industry faces headwinds, Domino's sees an opportunity to gain market share by offering deals on popular items, unlike competitors who may discount less desirable products.

In a Boston courtroom, Harvard's lawyers argued that the administration is unconstitutionally trying to control the university's internal operations and infringing on free speech.

          <p>With college costs steadily rising, federal student loans are a primary source of funding for many students, but they come with specific borrowing limits designed to prevent excessive debt. The maximum amount an undergraduate can borrow annually and over their lifetime depends on their dependency status and year in school, with aggregate limits of $31,000 for dependent students and $57,500 for independent ones. Since these amounts may not cover the full cost of attendance, especially at private universities, many students turn to private loans to bridge the financial gap.

Co-founder Andrew Keys argues this makes ether a more productive asset than bitcoin, as the Ethereum network can support a wide range of tokenized assets beyond simple peer-to-peer transactions.

Effective, evidence-based methods include reducing notifications, setting the screen to black-and-white, keeping the phone out of the bedroom, and using self-control apps. For severe cases, therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help address the root causes of the addiction, which often stem from using the phone as an escape from stress or other mental health challenges.</p>

          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight performed what he described to passengers as an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 military aircraft while on approach to land in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot explained that the military plane was on a converging course and that the airport's control tower, which lacks radar, had not warned him of its presence. The U.S. Air Force confirmed a B-52 was operating in the area for a state fair flyover. The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the incident, which highlighted a serious breakdown in communication and air traffic coordination.</p>

          <p>Veteran point guard Chris Paul is set to return to the LA Clippers after agreeing to a veteran's minimum contract with the team. Paul, who will be entering his 21st NBA season, was a cornerstone of the franchise's "Lob City" era from 2011 to 2017. The team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank, had previously stated the team was strongly considering a reunion, praising Paul as a "great player" and a "great Clipper." The 40-year-old played in all 82 games for the San Antonio Spurs last season and will now finish his career in Los Angeles, where his family resides.</p>
