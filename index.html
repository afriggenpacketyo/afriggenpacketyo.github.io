          <p>A tourist boat named Wonder Seas, carrying 53 people, capsized during a sudden storm in Vietnam's popular Ha Long Bay, resulting in at least 28 deaths with 14 people remaining missing. Most passengers were Vietnamese families from Hanoi. Rescue efforts, hampered by heavy rain, managed to save 11 people, including a 14-year-old boy who survived for hours in an air pocket within the overturned hull. The incident has prompted a large-scale search and rescue operation to continue through the night.</p>

          <p>Over 80 people have been arrested across the United Kingdom during demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act. Protests occurred in several major cities, with the Metropolitan Police arresting 55 individuals in London alone on suspicion of terrorism offenses for displaying supportive placards. The ban makes membership or support for the group a criminal offense, a move that followed a break-in at an RAF base attributed to the group's activists.</p>

The attacks utilized a combination of over 340 drones and 35 missiles, targeting cities like Odesa, Pavlohrad, and Sumy. While Ukrainian air defenses reportedly intercepted 90% of the projectiles, more than 30 got through, hitting residential buildings and critical infrastructure, causing fires and power outages.

She recounted how her social media response to the article, which she called "complete BS," led to a modeling opportunity with Sports Illustrated.</p>

The move follows President Trump's announcement of 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, which Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned as "unacceptable blackmail."

          <p>Congress has passed President Trump's request to rescind $9 billion in previously approved federal spending, impacting areas like foreign aid and public broadcasting. The approval of this rescission request, which only required a simple majority in the Senate, is seen by some analysts as a test case for a new, more partisan approach to federal budgeting. This method could bypass the traditional bipartisan process that requires 60 votes to pass appropriations bills, potentially changing how the federal government has been funded for years and allowing a single party to exert more control.</p>

          <p>While a recent survey found Americans believe they need an average net worth of $839,000 to feel financially comfortable, financial experts caution that this metric can be misleading. Certified financial planner Joy Slabaugh notes that net worth is just a snapshot in time and doesn't capture the full picture of one's financial health, such as cash flow or alignment with personal values. Experts advise focusing less on a single number and more on practical goals like paying down debt, building savings, and ensuring that spending aligns with what brings emotional, not just financial, comfort.

The government also faces significant constraints from financial markets, which limit spending and influence policy decisions to maintain economic stability.
