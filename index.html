          <p>A 16-year-old illegal immigrant from Colombia, who received probation and community service for the 2024 vehicular homicide of Kaitlyn Weaver in Aurora, Colorado, has been arrested by ICE along with his family, who were also in the U.S. illegally. The teen, who was driving a Jeep at speeds up to 90 mph, T-boned Weaver's vehicle, leading to her death after being taken off life support and her organs donated. Weaver's father expressed appreciation for ICE's enforcement action after the Arapahoe County District Attorney's office offered the teen a plea deal, which the Weaver family attorney called "abhorrent." The teen will remain in ICE custody pending an immigration hearing, despite a pending asylum claim. </p>

          <p>Gap Inc. anticipates that new tariffs could negatively impact its business by $100 million to $150 million if they remain in effect, leading to a significant drop in shares during after-hours trading. While the company beat expectations for its fiscal first-quarter earnings, its gross margin forecast came in weaker than expected due to lapping benefits from its credit card program, not tariff effects. CEO Richard Dickson said the company plans to buy more cotton from the U.S. to mitigate the tariff impact, and does not expect meaningful price increases for consumers. The company is working to diversify its supply chain and reduce its exposure to China, where it now expects to source less than 3% of its products by year-end. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Costco's shares experienced a slight decrease despite the company's announcement of quarterly earnings and revenue surpassing expectations, with an 8% year-over-year sales increase. The company's net income for the quarter rose to $1.90 billion, or $4.28 per share, compared to $1.68 billion, or $3.78 per share, in the previous year. Costco is exploring strategies to mitigate tariff costs, including expediting orders, rerouting goods, and sourcing more private-label items domestically; while some price increases have been implemented for discretionary items, the company has absorbed costs for staple goods like pineapples and bananas. The company's CFO noted that approximately one-third of Costco's U.S. sales come from imported goods, with about 8% originating from China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Best Buy has reduced its full-year sales and profit projections, citing that higher tariffs have increased the costs of consumer electronics. The company has already raised prices on some items to offset these costs, with changes implemented by mid-May, but CEO Corie Barry emphasized that price hikes are "the very last resort." First-quarter earnings reports have highlighted the disruptive impact of evolving trade policies on U.S. companies with global supply chains, and Best Buy is adjusting to current tariffs by encouraging vendors to manufacture in multiple countries and negotiating lower costs. While China remains a major source of merchandise, it now accounts for 30% to 35% of Best Buy's merchandise, compared to 55% in March. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has narrowed the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), making it easier to approve infrastructure projects such as highways, bridges, and pipelines. The court's unanimous decision, with a concurring opinion from the liberal justices, reversed a lower court ruling that required consideration of the environmental effects of oil drilling and refining related to a proposed railroad project in Utah. Justice Kavanaugh argued that courts should defer to agency determinations about environmental effects, and framed his opinion as a "judicial correction" to prevent project delays. Environmental groups have criticized the decision, while industry interests have praised it for promoting more efficient NEPA reviews.</p>

Mellencamp had apologized "on behalf of most Hoosiers" for the "poor, poor sportsmanship" displayed during the game, specifically referencing someone who called out New York fans. McAfee admitted he was the one who instigated Pacers fans to boo celebrity Knicks fans like Spike Lee and Ben Stiller.

          <p>The Trump administration has set a new goal of arresting 3,000 people a day in its anti-immigration efforts, aiming to triple previous figures. This target was conveyed to ICE leaders by Stephen Miller and Kristi Noem, prompting concerns about the strain on resources and potential for errors. The administration is implementing new tactics, such as involving federal law enforcement agents outside ICE and arresting people at courthouses. Critics argue that this aggressive agenda undermines local economies and due process, while the administration asserts it is fulfilling its mandate to enforce immigration laws.</p>

Hoover, who was serving six life sentences on conspiracy, extortion, and drug charges, still faces a 200-year jail term in Illinois for murder. The president also granted a pardon to Michael Grimm, a former New York City congressman who served seven months in prison for tax fraud. Hoover's lawyers are calling upon Illinois Governor JB Pritzker to commute his state-level sentence, arguing that there is no purpose in returning a 74-year-old man in failing health to prison after 52 years of incarceration.</p>

Trump defended his decision to slash tariffs on China and push back deadlines for tariffs on European Union countries, calling the question "nasty."

Despite his long-standing admiration for Putin, Trump is now said to feel "tapped along" by the Russian leader.

          <p>President Donald Trump has implemented a series of tariffs on goods from various countries, aiming to boost American manufacturing and protect jobs, however, these actions have created economic uncertainty. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, typically a percentage of the product's value, and are paid to the government by companies importing goods into the U.S. A U.S. trade court initially ruled that Trump lacked the authority to impose sweeping import taxes, but an appeals court allowed the tariffs to remain in place pending litigation. While the UK and US have reached a narrow agreement over tariffs on some goods, the world economy has responded with concern to Trump's protectionist measures.</p>
