        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite facing significant tariffs due to the closure of a trade loophole, experts believe Temu and Shein are well-positioned to remain competitive in the U.S. e-commerce market. These companies have been preparing for this change by accelerating localization strategies, including onboarding American sellers onto their platforms to avoid tariffs. Temu has already begun offering goods shipped from local warehouses to U.S. shoppers, while Shein is expanding its supply chain to countries like Turkey and Brazil. Experts note that Temu and Shein's ability to offer products at significantly lower prices than competitors, even with increased tariffs, will allow them to maintain a competitive edge.

          <p>The Trump administration has barred Harvard University from receiving new federal grants, citing allegations of antisemitism and criticism of its diversity policies. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that Harvard has failed its "legal obligations" and will not receive new grants until it demonstrates responsible management. Harvard has responded by vowing to fight what it calls an "illegal government overreach," arguing that the administration's demands would impose unprecedented and improper control over the university. This move follows similar actions against other universities amid ongoing debates about antisemitism on campuses and calls for policy changes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a judge to dismiss a lawsuit from GOP-led states seeking to limit telehealth access to mifepristone, an abortion medication. The Justice Department argues that the states lack the legal standing to sue, maintaining the course set by the Biden administration on this issue. The lawsuit, initiated by Idaho, Kansas, and Missouri, challenges the FDA's regulations on mifepristone access. While Trump has stated he would not restrict access to abortion medication, his administration's stance reflects ongoing legal battles surrounding reproductive rights.</p>

          <p>President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has ordered the arrest of five bus company heads for defying his directive to offer free transport following a major highway closure. Bukele accused the company heads of "sabotaging the country," after widespread chaos ensued when the free rides led to overcrowded buses and skipped stops. The National Transportation Committee expressed surprise at the arrests, citing confusion over payment arrangements for drivers as the reason for the disruptions. This action is another example of Bukele's authoritarian tactics amid criticism over his handling of gangs and democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>A sweeping purge of top military officials in China, ordered by President Xi Jinping, is raising questions about the country's readiness for a potential invasion of Taiwan. The dismissals, including high-ranking officers from the Rocket Force, suggest potential corruption, ideological differences, or a lack of trust in military commanders. While China's military has made significant advancements, this internal turmoil could weaken Xi's appetite for war and provide Taiwan and the United States with more time to strengthen their defenses. However, the article cautions against complacency, noting that China's military could still act if ordered, especially if Taiwan moves toward independence.</p>

The DOJ said that Credit Suisse falsified bank records to conceal U.S. ownership and control of accounts, documented certain American accounts owners "as non-U.S. persons," processed fictitious paperwork, maintain more than 100 accounts held by a Swiss lawyer or enable "for the benefit of undeclared clients," and services "more than $1 billion worth of U.S. accounts without full documentation of tax compliance long after the accounts should have been closed.</p>

The jury has heard that there is no dispute that the lunch contained death cap mushrooms and caused the guests' illnesses, but whether Ms Patterson intended to kill or cause very serious injury is the main issue in the case.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's first domestically built submarine, the Hai Kun, is facing doubts about meeting its November delivery deadline due to testing delays and reported piping system failures. The vessel has yet to begin sea trials, and a former navy captain has cited repeated flooding incidents that have forced foreign testing teams to suspend work. These issues raise concerns about the program's progress and its ability to strengthen Taiwan's defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Bangladesh's garment industry, a cornerstone of the nation's economy, faces uncertainty as the United States considers imposing new tariffs. The tariffs could disrupt Bangladesh's export-driven economy and impact the millions of workers employed in garment factories. Despite a temporary pause, the potential for reinstated tariffs has raised concerns about reduced orders and economic instability. The garment sector has transformed itself in recent years to improve safety and sustainability, but these tariffs threaten its progress and the livelihoods of Bangladeshi workers.</p>

          <p>Delivery companies like UPS and FedEx are anticipating a significant slowdown in shipments from China to the United States after President Trump closed a tariff loophole. The de minimis exemption, which allowed low-value goods to enter the U.S. without tariffs, has been eliminated, potentially impacting revenue for logistics companies and airlines. Temu, a major e-commerce company, has already shifted to fulfilling orders from local sellers within the U.S. This change could reshape trade flows and affect the broader air cargo industry.</p>

          <p>Sen. Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA due to ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport. Schumer cited a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, cuts at the FAA, old technology, and depleted federal funds as contributing factors.

          <p>In response to President Trump's call for tariffs on movies filmed overseas, California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to support the entertainment industry. This proposal aims to counter the trend of film and television production moving to states and countries with more generous incentives. The industry has been seeking federal assistance in the form of tax credits, with concerns that tariffs would cause more harm than good. The proposal highlights the ongoing debate over how to support domestic film production and address the challenges posed by international competition.</p>
