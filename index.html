          <p>OpenAI has named Instacart CEO Fidji Simo as the head of its applications business, where she will report directly to CEO Sam Altman. Simo, who previously served on OpenAI's board, will focus on scaling the company's traditional functions as it enters a new phase of growth. This move comes shortly after OpenAI restructured into a public benefit corporation, addressing concerns from civic leaders and former employees. Altman will shift his focus towards research, compute, and safety systems, while Brad Lightcap continues to oversee business operations and global deployment.</p>

          <p>Slovakia and Hungary have strongly criticized the European Commission's plan to phase out all Russian gas, nuclear energy, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by the end of 2027. These nations, which maintain close ties with Moscow, argue that the proposal is a serious mistake that threatens the region's energy security and economy. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico described the plan as "economic suicide," warning of higher energy prices for consumers. Despite the EU's efforts to reduce reliance on Russian energy since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, nearly 19% of the EU's gas and LNG imports still came from Russia in 2024.</p>

Timpson, known for hiring ex-offenders, acknowledges the prison system is in a state of "crisis" with limited spare capacity and rising inmate numbers.

          <p>According to The New York Times, Britain is reportedly on the verge of signing a trade agreement with the U.S., potentially making it the first country to do so after the U.S. announced "reciprocal" tariffs. While details remain uncertain, it is speculated that both sides may sign either a finalized deal or a framework for future negotiations. A U.K. Department for Business and Trade spokesperson stated that talks are ongoing and that the department aims to find a resolution to ease pressure on UK businesses and consumers. The U.K. was spared higher tariffs when Trump announced his "Liberation Day" duties but was still hit with a baseline 10% levy.</p>

          <p>A second expert witness in the Karen Read murder trial testified that Jennifer McCabe's Google search about hypothermia occurred after John O'Keefe's body was discovered, contradicting the defense's claim that it happened beforehand. Jessica Hyde presented technical evidence to support her conclusion, challenging the defense's timeline. The defense attorney questioned Hyde's credibility and methodology, leading to sparring over technical details. Read has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, manslaughter, and fleeing the scene, while prosecutors allege she intentionally struck O'Keefe with her vehicle.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are using powerful Earth-based instruments, including the world's largest radio telescope and advanced radar systems, to search for water ice at the moon's south pole. A new study suggests that lunar ice is fragmented, scattered, and buried deep beneath the surface, posing detection and extraction challenges. The team estimates that ice makes up no more than 6% of the material within the top 10 meters of lunar soil in the region, with the most promising deposits buried 5-7 meters underground. The findings will inform landing site selection and the design of China's proposed lunar research base.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that deporting noncitizens to Libya without due process would violate his existing court order, following reports that the White House was considering such plans. The ruling came after lawyers representing a group of migrants filed an emergency motion to prevent deportations to Libya or Saudi Arabia, citing safety concerns. The judge clarified that any removals to countries other than their origin would defy the preliminary injunction he issued last month.
