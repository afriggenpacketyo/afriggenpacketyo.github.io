          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>An active-duty US Army soldier was found following a neo-Nazi terrorist group on social media, raising concerns about extremism within the military. Experts point to relaxed policies under the current Pentagon leadership as a contributing factor, which has deprioritized counter-extremism efforts in favor of combating 'woke' ideologies. The army has stated it is investigating the matter and does not tolerate extremist activities, but critics argue that enforcement remains unclear. The incident highlights the potential danger of neglecting far-right extremism within the military ranks, citing historical examples like the Oklahoma City bomber. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A shift is occurring in high schools, with educators, parents, and students questioning the traditional 'college for all' mentality. Research indicates that students are increasingly evaluating the value of college, considering financial risks and social pressures.

This shift aims to provide more holistic support for students' diverse post-graduation goals.</p>

            <p>Proposed budget cuts to Medicaid are raising concerns about the impact on long-term care and family caregivers. Medicaid is the primary source of funding for long-term care for low-income disabled and elderly individuals, covering nursing home stays and in-home services. Cuts could lead to reduced services, increased burden on family caregivers, and potential institutionalization of individuals who could otherwise remain at home. While some argue cuts would encourage private long-term care insurance, others warn of dire consequences for vulnerable populations.</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened new tariffs on smartphones and electronics shortly after announcing exemptions from previous tariffs. The administration is considering a 'semiconductor tariff' as part of a national security investigation into the electronics supply chain. This announcement caused market volatility and confusion, as companies like Sony have already announced price increases on products due to economic pressures. The move casts doubt on hopes of a trade war thaw between the US and China.</p>
