        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC's MasterChef has returned with a new series filmed before hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode were sacked following misconduct allegations. Despite a backlash and calls for the series to be axed, the BBC decided to air it to recognize the participating chefs. The episodes appear to be edited to reduce the hosts' usual banter and jokes, creating a noticeably different viewing experience. The controversy stems from upheld complaints against Wallace, including unwelcome physical contact, and a racist term allegedly used by Torode, prompting calls for improved industry standards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s administration has canceled nearly $500 million in contracts for mRNA vaccine research, a decision met with strong disapproval from many public health and biosecurity experts. Critics argue this move, which includes terminating 22 BARDA contracts, severely compromises national preparedness for future pandemics and bioterrorism threats. Kennedy claims the shift is towards "better solutions" using older whole-killed virus technology, but experts counter that mRNA is proven safe, effective, and crucial for rapid response. This policy change raises concerns about undermining public trust in vaccine technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is implementing new tariffs, including a 25% hike on Indian imports, bringing their total to 50% due to India's continued purchase of Russian oil. Brazil has initiated a dispute settlement process within the WTO over a 50% tariff imposed for non-economic reasons, while Switzerland also faces a significant 39% tariff. These measures are part of President Trump's "reciprocal tariffs" policy aimed at reducing trade deficits, but experts warn of potential global market chaos. The policy marks a significant shift in US trade relations with numerous partners.</p>

Calhoun, who pleaded not guilty to earlier charges, is now accused of second-degree murder and abuse of a corpse in this latest case. Victims' families expressed emotional pleas for justice, highlighting the ongoing trauma and the pattern of bodies found in remote areas. The case has raised fears of a serial killer targeting young women, with Calhoun's trial anticipated for 2027.</p>

Once extinct in the wild since the 1960s, fewer than 200 Barbary lions remain in captivity globally. The cubs will be sent to other parks to ensure genetic diversity, while preliminary talks with Moroccan authorities for reintroduction are underway.

          <p>President Trump announced "great progress" and "highly productive" talks between his envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding Ukraine, with a ceasefire deadline approaching. The Kremlin described the three-hour meeting as "constructive," with an exchange of "signals" on improving ties. Despite Trump's optimism, he signed an executive order imposing a new 25% tariff on India for buying Russian oil, escalating pressure. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy emphasized the war must end, while Russia continues large-scale attacks, suggesting peace expectations remain low.</p>

          <p>A devastating wildfire sweeping through southern France has been declared a "catastrophe on an unprecedented scale" by Prime Minister François Bayrou, linking it to global warming and drought. The blaze has scorched 15,000 hectares, destroyed at least 25 homes, and left one elderly woman dead and another person missing. Firefighters, supported by aircraft, continue to battle the inferno, which is France's largest since 1949. The severe conditions, including strong winds and dry vegetation, suggest the fire could rage for several more days, causing widespread destruction and air quality issues.</p>

          <p>Despite a Senate vote to increase its budget, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is struggling to function due to the Trump administration's policies, including funding freezes, staff cuts, and politically motivated grant cancellations. Officials report a significant backlog in grant processing, fearing unspent funds could justify future budget cuts. The administration's interference, such as scrutinizing grants for specific concepts and reversing decisions, has created a chaotic environment, leading to widespread demoralization and staff departures. This instability threatens the NIH's capacity to support crucial biomedical research.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre, a key accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, has publicly expressed strong opposition to any potential pardon or commutation of Maxwell's sentence. Giuffre's sister-in-law, Amanda Roberts, stated that a pardon would be a "travesty" and a "slap in the face" to survivors of sexual assault, urging transparency in the Epstein case. Maxwell's attorney recently suggested she would testify before Congress if pardoned, a proposal the family views with skepticism given Maxwell's past perjury. The family emphasizes the need to prioritize survivors' voices and ensure justice is served.</p>
