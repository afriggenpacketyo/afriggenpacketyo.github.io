          <p>Industrial conglomerate Honeywell announced it is exploring strategic alternatives for its productivity solutions and warehouse workflow segments. This move, which could lead to a sale valued at an estimated $3.8 billion, aims to streamline its automation portfolio before a planned three-way company split. The decision follows pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management and is seen as part of a broader strategy to focus on higher-growth areas, with shares reaching a record high following the news.

          <p>A New York Federal Reserve survey indicates that consumer expectations for inflation have returned to levels seen before the implementation of recent trade tariffs. The median expectation for inflation in the next 12 months dropped to 3%, matching the January level and down from a peak of 3.6% in March and April. While the headline outlook has eased, respondents still anticipate price increases in specific areas like medical care, college education, and rent. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump interrupted the query directed at Attorney General Pam Bondi, questioning why time was being wasted on "this creep" amidst other national issues. The exchange occurred after the Department of Justice released a memo stating there was no evidence of an Epstein "client list" and confirming his death was a suicide.</p>

          <p>In a significant shift, the IRS has stated in a federal court filing that churches can endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This new interpretation upends the 70-year-old Johnson Amendment, which has historically barred such endorsements by nonprofit organizations. The filing was part of a motion to settle a lawsuit brought by the National Religious Broadcasters and two Texas churches, which argued the amendment violated their First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recently signed budget bill, which includes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, is expected to have a varied impact on the pharmaceutical industry. An analyst note from Leerink Partners suggests that while the overall revenue loss is a negative for drugmakers, some companies are more exposed to the Medicaid market than others. Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Gilead Sciences were identified as having higher reliance on Medicaid for their U.S. revenue, particularly for cystic fibrosis and HIV treatments.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey shows many Americans, particularly younger generations, are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," adjusting their finances based on feelings of economic anxiety. This has led to a trend of "revenge saving," a shift from post-pandemic splurging to building up emergency funds. Financial experts advise that while saving is positive, it should be intentional rather than emotional, recommending strategies like reverse budgeting, using separate accounts for goals, and periodically increasing savings rates to build financial security.
