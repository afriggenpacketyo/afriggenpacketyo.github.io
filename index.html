          <p>A federal trial concluded regarding President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, with U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer scrutinizing the extent of presidential authority and the relevance of the Posse Comitatus Act. California's lawsuit aimed to limit the military's role to protecting federal property, opposing their involvement in immigration enforcement, which the state termed an "unlawful military crusade." The Justice Department argued the Act was inapplicable and that California lacked grounds to sue, while the state emphasized the unprecedented nature of the federal government's actions. Judge Breyer expressed significant concern about the apparent absence of limits to a national police force and questioned the ongoing justification for the troops' presence.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit challenging the construction and operation of an immigration detention center, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," in the Florida Everglades concluded with a U.S. District Judge questioning who is truly in charge. Environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe allege the facility's rushed construction violated federal environmental laws, specifically the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), by proceeding without proper public input or environmental impact assessments. Concerns were raised about the impact on endangered Florida panthers, water quality, and tribal communities, as the site affects the fragile Everglades ecosystem. The plaintiffs seek an injunction to halt operations and restore the affected area.</p>

          <p>A New York man, Shane Daley, has been charged with cyberstalking a family member of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, allegedly leaving threatening voicemails that expressed glee over Thompson's recent killing. Prosecutors allege Daley placed multiple calls to Thompson's family member in the days following the December 4 shooting, conveying that the family member and Thompson's children deserved a similar fate. Thompson was fatally shot outside a New York City hotel by Luigi Mangione, who pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges, reportedly motivated by anger over corporate greed. This case underscores the disturbing extension of violence and harassment to victims' families in the wake of high-profile tragedies.</p>

          <p>A jobseeker unexpectedly received an internal email detailing an interviewer's thoughts on their performance, revealing they were perceived as lacking enthusiasm and having a "subdued" communication style. This accidental disclosure sparked an online discussion among Redditors, with many sharing similar experiences of unintended transparency from hiring processes, including biases and other confidential information. The situation highlights the often-opaque nature of job interview feedback and the potential for companies' internal communications to inadvertently become public, prompting dilemmas for the recipient. Commenters offered diverse advice, ranging from confronting the company about the unprofessionalism to using the feedback for self-improvement without disclosing the email's receipt, underscoring the awkwardness and ethical considerations involved.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, an American man who faked his death and fled to the UK to evade criminal charges, has been found guilty of one sexual assault charge in Utah. Rossi was accused of sexually assaulting two women in the state in 2008, with prosecutors pursuing the cases separately. During the trial, his accuser testified that Rossi held her down and "forced me to have sex with him." Despite his attempts to avoid justice, including using multiple aliases and appearing in court in a wheelchair, his victim identified him. Rossi is scheduled for sentencing in October for this conviction and is set to stand trial in September for the other sexual assault charge, marking a significant step in bringing him to justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans reporting alcohol consumption has dropped to a record low of 54%, matching a previous low from 1958. This decline coincides with increasing public awareness among the public of alcohol's health risks, even in moderation, a significant shift from older beliefs about potential benefits. Young people, particularly those aged 18-34, show a higher tendency to believe moderate drinking is harmful and are less likely to consume alcohol. Factors contributing to this trend include greater social acceptance of sobriety, the rising cost of alcohol, and reduced in-person social gatherings among younger generations. While women's alcohol use has seen a notable drop, experts suggest the overall trend may continue as health consciousness grows.</p>

The FDA sent warning letters to five companies, including Vacation Inc. and Supergoop!, asserting that these products are unapproved drugs and misbranded due to their misleading food-like packaging.

The move highlights China's strategic efforts to reduce reliance on foreign technology in critical infrastructure, aiming to enhance national security and self-sufficiency in key technological sectors.

Lai, a self-described "born rebel" who fled mainland China, built a media empire that became a persistent and fierce critic of Chinese authorities. His trial, which has drawn international attention and calls for his release from figures like UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, underscores the ongoing erosion of freedoms and the rule of law in Hong Kong.</p>

On the night of August 14-15, 1945, almost 90 US B-29 bombers dropped approximately 6,000 tons of napalm, killing at least 260 people and leaving nearly 75% of the city in ruins. Survivors recount the horror, with one woman born during the raid and another witnessing widespread devastation. The article explores the military's justification for the "utterly foolish" raid, the ethical debate around such actions, and the enduring quest for peace by the city's residents, who hold no animosity towards America but reflect on the war's momentum.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Rules Trump Can Continue Withholding Billions in Foreign Aid</h2>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's administration can continue to freeze or terminate billions of dollars in foreign aid earmarked by Congress. The 2-to-1 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stated that international aid groups, the plaintiffs, lacked legal standing to bring the lawsuit. This ruling reverses a lower court's preliminary injunction against the funding freeze, which Trump initiated on his first day in office, labeling such programs as "wasteful." The dissenting judge, Florence Pan, criticized the majority for dismissing the constitutional implications of the President refusing appropriated funds based on policy disagreements.

          <p>A Big Bear man was arrested after authorities busted an illegal psychedelic mushroom business operating out of the Jah Healing Cannabis Church in Big Bear Lake. Deputies, responding to citizen complaints, executed a search warrant and found about three ounces of psychedelic mushrooms on Christopher Tindall, identified as the "mushroom sales shop" owner. Tindall was arrested on a felony charge of illegal sales of psilocybin mushrooms. The church, which considers cannabis its sacrament, had previously been permanently shut down by San Bernardino County authorities in 2022 due to claims that it functioned as an illegal dispensary. This incident highlights ongoing illicit activities and legal challenges concerning such establishments.</p>

          <p>Viral photos of rabbits in Colorado with twisting black, horn-like growths have sparked online speculation about "zombie-rabbits," but authorities confirm the images are real and the animals are suffering from Shope Papilloma Virus. This relatively harmless disease, mainly found in America's Midwest, causes papillomas that typically disappear as the rabbits' immune systems fight the virus. The condition is not new and is even thought to have inspired the centuries-old myth of the "jackalope." While the growths are harmless unless they impede eating or vision, the virus does not spread to humans or other common pets like dogs or cats, though people are warned not to touch infected animals.</p>

          <p>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has declared a state of emergency in Española and surrounding Rio Arriba County due to a "significant surge" in violent crime and drug trafficking. This declaration authorizes $750,000 in emergency funding for the Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management to provide resources to the affected communities. The governor cited a doubling of police calls in the area over two years, with dispatches to businesses quadrupling, highlighting the severe impact on public safety. Rio Arriba County has the state's highest overdose death rate, predominantly involving fentanyl, despite a statewide decline in overdose deaths since 2021. This marks the second such emergency declaration by Grisham this year, signaling a proactive response to persistent crime challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rising energy costs are making it increasingly difficult for low-income Americans, like Angela Harmon in Dallas, to afford air conditioning, forcing them to seek alternative ways to stay cool. This challenge is exacerbated by President Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026, which would eliminate the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), shifting responsibility for utility assistance to states. Research by Texas A&M University indicates that climate change is directly contributing to higher electricity costs, with wholesale prices surging during peak demand. Critics warn that Trump administration policies favoring higher-cost oil and natural gas over cheaper solar power will further escalate these expenses, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and making cooling a daily concern.

          <p>Scientists are warning that UK cities face a growing threat from "firewaves," an emerging phenomenon describing multiple urban wildfires triggered by extended periods of hot, dry weather due to climate change. Researchers at Imperial College London, working with the London Fire Brigade, identified that after ten consecutive days of very dry weather, vegetation becomes highly flammable, increasing the likelihood of simultaneous blazes. This risk was evident in recent heath fires in London and Edinburgh. The research highlights the need for cities, especially those without a history of wildfires, to adopt proactive strategies and for the Met Office to consider a new "firewave" definition for public safety.</p>

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, faced record floodwaters from an "outburst flood" stemming from a basin dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier, though the immediate threat has subsided as waters receded. The Mendenhall River peaked at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record of 15.99 feet. City officials expressed relief that temporary "Hesco" barriers largely prevented catastrophic damage to nearly 1,000 structures, many of which are residences. This annual flooding, caused by the retreating glacier filling Suicide Basin, has intensified in recent years, sweeping away homes and highlighting the severe impact of climate change.

Critics argue that Biden's order, which was popular with Americans, sought to combat excessive industry concentration and corporate abuses, and its revocation could lead to higher fees and lost compensation for consumers. This action signifies a significant policy reversal impacting market regulation and consumer protection. (not investment advice)</p>

The package includes credit and tax deferrals for affected businesses, and incentives for local production to mitigate the impact. While Lula expressed a desire to negotiate rather than escalate conflict, he firmly asserted Brazil's sovereignty and condemned the U.S. for "sanctioning" Brazil for its democratic independence, highlighting ongoing trade tensions.

          <p>A TravelPerk survey indicates that over half of business travelers, and a significant 73% of C-suite executives, are now bringing family members or friends along on work trips.

While some employees initially keep these arrangements quiet, many companies are increasingly accepting of the practice, provided business objectives are met and personal and work expenses are clearly separated. This shift reflects a broader desire for work-life balance and a more integrated approach to professional and personal travel, benefiting both employees and potentially boosting loyalty and morale.</p>
