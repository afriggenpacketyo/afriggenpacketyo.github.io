          <p>China and Vietnam are scheduled to conduct their first joint army training exercise, focusing on collaborative border patrols. The drill will take place in China's Guangxi region, which shares a border with Vietnam, and is described as a move to deepen practical cooperation between the two militaries. This development occurs as the nations mark 75 years of diplomatic ties and strengthen their relationship in response to the ongoing US-China trade war, reflecting a significant regional alignment.</p>

          <p>At least 35 people, including eight children, have died after a tourist boat carrying 53 passengers capsized during a sudden storm in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay. The vessel, primarily carrying Vietnamese families from Hanoi, overturned amidst torrential rain and large hailstones. Rescue efforts were hampered by the severe weather, though ten survivors were pulled from the water, including a boy who survived in an air pocket. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the tragic accident.</p>

          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in Italy last year, has been moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The relocation follows extensive legal battles and protests from animal rights groups, which successfully overturned an initial order to euthanize the bear. The incident and its aftermath highlight the growing tensions and complex debates surrounding human-wildlife conflict in regions where animal populations have been reintroduced and are now expanding.</p>

          <p>The official X account for the Sesame Street character Elmo was recently hacked, with attackers posting racist and antisemitic content to millions of followers. The incident serves as a stark reminder that no brand, however trusted, is immune to cyber threats, and that a reputation built over decades can be damaged in minutes. Cybersecurity experts note that such attacks often exploit credentials stolen from previous data breaches rather than using brute-force methods, underscoring the need for robust and multi-layered security protocols.</p>

          <p>A rare pterosaur fossil discovered in northeastern China contains the first-ever evidence of stomach contents for this type of ancient flying reptile. The fossil of a Sinopterus atavismus revealed the presence of phytoliths, microscopic mineral deposits from plants, along with small quartz crystals likely used as stomach stones to grind tough food. This finding confirms that this species of pterosaur was herbivorous, challenging previous scientific assumptions and renewing debate about the diets of these prehistoric creatures.</p>

          <p>German goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger, who has twice battled and recovered from cancer, delivered a heroic performance in the Euro 2025 quarter-final against France. After her team played with only 10 players for most of the match, Berger made two decisive saves in the penalty shootout to secure a dramatic victory. Her journey from receiving a second cancer diagnosis during the 2022 tournament to becoming a national hero three years later is a remarkable story of personal resilience and athletic triumph.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense showed signs of breaking out of its slump, but it wasn't enough to overcome a weak pitching performance in an 8-7 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Despite scoring seven runs and hitting back-to-back home runs in the eighth inning, the Dodgers could not complete the comeback. The defeat marks the team's ninth loss in its last 11 games, continuing a frustrating stretch where pitching and hitting have failed to align.</p>
