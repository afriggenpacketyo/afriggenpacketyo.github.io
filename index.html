          <p>The Japanese government is set to initiate "blue carbon" research, focusing on capturing carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and storing it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization efforts. Coastal and ocean plants like mangroves and kelp are known to absorb and store more carbon than terrestrial vegetation, making them a key component of this initiative. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study seaweed behavior at considerable depths and assess the environmental impact of such projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon, significantly increasing its carbon capture capabilities.</p>

          <p>A family who went to court to protect their young daughter from her father, who was a convicted child sex offender, has expressed concerns about government legislation intended to help others in similar situations. The Victims and Courts Bill aims to remove parental responsibility from convicted child sex offenders, but only if they have abused their own children. This means that families in similar situations may still need to go to the Family Court to protect their children, incurring significant legal fees. The government has stated that it will continue to work to make the law as strong as it needs to be.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, the acclaimed Russian ballet choreographer and artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, has died at the age of 98. Grigorovich's productions of the Stone Flower, Ivan the Terrible, and Romeo and Juliet redefined Soviet ballet and revitalized male dance, creating roles demanding exceptional strength and artistry. His departure from the Bolshoi in 1995, amid disputes over performers' contracts, led to the first ever dancers' strike at the theatre in its 200-year history. The Stone Flower was considered his most famous piece, accompanied by settings of folk tales composed by Sergei Prokofiev.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, rose over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the booming electric vehicle market. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest offering this year globally. CATL plans to allocate 90% of the funds raised to construct its upcoming factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients such as Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. The company's expansion into Europe coincides with increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have placed punitive tariffs on EVs made in China.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Ritchie, convicted in the 2000 killing of Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney, was executed by lethal injection in Indiana, marking the state's second execution in 15 years. Ritchie, 45, had been on death row for over two decades following his conviction for fatally shooting Toney during a foot chase. Despite appeals from his attorneys, who argued his legal counsel at trial was ineffective due to a failure to fully investigate his fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and childhood lead exposure, the execution proceeded. The execution has sparked renewed debate over the death penalty, with disability rights advocates arguing Ritchie's brain damage should have excluded him from capital punishment.</p>

          <p>A Peruvian man has been arrested in Japan after allegedly driving his car the wrong way on an expressway, resulting in collisions with multiple vehicles. The 34-year-old resident of Nagahama, Shiga Prefecture, faces charges for failing to report an accident after hitting two vehicles on the Shin-Meishin Expressway. The incident led to a pile-up involving four vehicles, including a large truck, and caused minor injuries to four women. The man reportedly drove the wrong way for about 10 kilometers before reaching a roadside parking area, and police suspect he may have made an illegal U-turn on the expressway.</p>

          <p>A memorial bust of Jim Morrison, the lead singer of The Doors, which was stolen from his grave in Paris 37 years ago, has been recovered by French police. The statue was found during an unrelated investigation conducted by the financial and anti-corruption arm of the police. The bust, carved by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin, was placed at Morrison's grave in the PÃ¨re-Lachaise cemetery to mark the 10th anniversary of his death but disappeared in 1988. It remains unclear whether the bust will be returned to the grave.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.â€™s announcement that he has aggressive prostate cancer has shifted the Democratic Party's focus from internal critiques of his presidency and 2024 candidacy to expressions of sympathy and concern. The news has prompted some to question the timing of the announcement and whether his health condition was known during his time in office. While many Democrats have offered well wishes, some, like former Representative Dean Phillips, suggest the announcement was strategically timed to deflect growing criticism. Republicans have also voiced suspicions, questioning why the diagnosis was not revealed earlier.</p>

Failure to win could result in missing out on over Â£100m in revenue from tickets, broadcast money, and sponsor bonuses. This is particularly significant given United's recent financial struggles, including an annual loss of Â£113m and debts exceeding Â£1bn. While both United and Spurs stand to benefit from Champions League participation, the financial boost is arguably more crucial for United to address their debt and comply with Premier League profit and sustainability rules.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring the possibility of accepting a free luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as a temporary Air Force One, amid delays in the delivery of new planes. The plan, which involved secret coordination between Washington and Doha, has raised ethical concerns and questions about its financial feasibility. The opulent jet, previously owned by the Qatari royal family, has caught President Trump's eye, but retrofitting it for presidential use could cost over $1 billion. The arrangement has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, with some suggesting it could be a means for Qatar to curry favor with the administration.</p>

          <p>Portugal's recent general election has not provided a clear resolution to the country's ongoing political instability, resulting in another minority government led by the center-right Democratic Alliance. The outcome leaves the government vulnerable to opposition parties and adds uncertainty due to the significant rise in support for the hard-right populist party Chega. The election, triggered by a vote of no confidence in March, has failed to break the pattern of minority governments that have characterized Portuguese politics in recent years. Corruption scandals and concerns over immigration and housing have fueled the rise of Chega.</p>

The administration views the war as primarily Europe's responsibility, arguing that America's involvement is either charitable or transactional. However, the article argues that the war's outcome matters for Americans, as Putin's objectives extend beyond Ukraine and aim to undermine American influence globally. Abandoning the peace process now will only make it more difficult and costly to resist Russia in the future.</p>
