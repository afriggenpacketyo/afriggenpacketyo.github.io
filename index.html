          <p>The Trump administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and allow the dismissal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The request follows lower court rulings that blocked President Trump from firing Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. The Justice Department argues that the president has the authority to remove board members for cause and that Cook's alleged conduct renders her unfit for the role. This legal battle escalates the conflict between the White House and the Federal Reserve over its independence and personnel.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced a landmark $5 billion investment in its competitor, Intel, marking a significant collaboration between the two semiconductor giants. The partnership will focus on developing custom chips for AI data centers and personal computers, integrating Nvidia's accelerated computing technology with Intel's CPU architecture. This move is seen as a crucial lifeline for the struggling Intel, which has faced substantial financial losses and recently saw the U.S. government take a 10% stake. The deal aims to bolster U.S. technological leadership amid growing competition from China.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects, including beetles, flies, and wasps, trapped in 112-million-year-old amber in Ecuador, a first for South America. This finding provides a rare window into the Cretaceous period, when flowering plants and insects were co-evolving, a partnership that has become one of nature's most successful. The amber fragments, which also contain ancient pollen and leaves, suggest the area was once a humid, resinous forest different from today's Amazon. Researchers believe the discovery will help unravel the biodiversity of the former supercontinent Gondwana.</p>

          <p>Struggling budget carrier Spirit Airlines has announced plans to cut its flight capacity by approximately 25% starting in November as part of its bankruptcy restructuring. The airline's CEO informed employees that the significant schedule reduction will likely lead to layoffs as the company seeks to lower operational costs. Spirit has also approached its pilots' union to negotiate an estimated $100 million in annual savings. This move follows the recent discontinuation of service in a dozen U.S. cities, reflecting broader challenges faced by low-cost carriers competing with larger airlines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with seven states, has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, alleging illegal ticket resale tactics. The suit claims the companies colluded with scalpers, allowing them to bypass ticket limits and artificially inflate prices, thereby harming both consumers and artists. The FTC accuses Ticketmaster of using a "bait and switch" approach to pricing and "triple dipping" by collecting fees from brokers and consumers on both primary and secondary markets. The legal action targets the company's dominant market position, where it controls roughly 80% of ticketing for major venues.</p>

          <p>A public dispute has broken out between the founders of a new UK left-wing party, with ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana accusing Jeremy Corbyn of overseeing a "sexist boys' club." Sultana claims she was sidelined from key decisions, leading her to launch a membership portal that Corbyn subsequently dismissed as "unauthorised." The conflict, which involves control over finances and party structure, has caused confusion and frustration among supporters just as the nascent party was building momentum. This internal power struggle threatens to fragment the movement before it has even been officially named or held its founding conference.</p>

          <p>This article explores the wisdom of 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza as a guide for handling modern-day criticism and online attacks. Despite facing rejection and condemnation for his ideas, Spinoza developed a method to maintain equanimity by using reason to understand and regulate his emotions. He argued that achieving consciousness over one's feelings, a process now known as metacognition, moves emotional responses from the primitive limbic system to the rational prefrontal cortex. By observing emotions impartially, one can avoid being controlled by fear and anger, allowing for a more measured and dignified response to censure.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how policies under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could effectively dismantle the U.S. vaccine market without an outright ban. By firing experts, tightening regulations, and creating an unstable and unpredictable environment, the administration is discouraging pharmaceutical companies from investing in vaccine development. This uncertainty is causing vaccine makers to scale back and could lead to shortages of routine immunizations and a weakened ability to respond to future pandemics. Experts warn that the erosion of government support and predictable demand threatens to undo decades of public health infrastructure.</p>

They discovered specific cells in a region associated with navigation and memory that fired in a regular pattern, ticking with every few steps the animal traveled. When the environment was altered, this firing pattern became erratic, and the rats' ability to estimate distance was impaired. A similar experiment with human volunteers suggested that the human brain possesses the same internal mechanism for measuring distance traveled.</p>

          <p>Renowned football manager José Mourinho is returning to Benfica, the club where he began his managerial career 25 years ago. His appointment comes after a glittering career that includes two Champions League titles and numerous league championships across Europe with clubs like Porto, Chelsea, and Real Madrid. While his return is met with excitement by many fans who remember his early impact, it is also seen as a risk for both Mourinho and the club. The timing, just before presidential elections at Benfica, has led to speculation that the move is a political play by the current president, Rui Costa.</p>

          <p>Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper commented on the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, stating that while one or two more cuts might be acceptable, further easing could push the economy into "danger territory." Speaking on CNBC, Tepper cautioned that lowering rates too aggressively while inflation remains a concern could reignite price pressures and create asset bubbles in the market. He noted that while he remains invested due to the Fed's current easing stance, valuations are high and nothing seems cheap, creating a difficult environment for investors.

          <p>New scientific research projects a grim future where smoke from wildfires could cause up to 1.4 million deaths globally each year by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions are not significantly reduced. The studies, published in Nature, highlight that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from wildfire smoke is about ten times more toxic than other forms of air pollution. While Africa is expected to be the most severely affected, the U.S. is also projected to see over 70,000 annual deaths from wildfire smoke by 2050. Researchers stress the urgency of both emissions cuts and adaptive measures like improved forest management.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent 25-basis-point rate cut is providing financial relief to homeowners with variable-rate products like a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). With average HELOC rates falling to their lowest levels since March 2025, the monthly cost of borrowing has decreased. For a $100,000 HELOC with a 15-year draw period, the monthly payment at the current average rate of 8.05% would be approximately $959.

A farmer from South Dakota described the situation as "walking a tightrope," expressing support for President Trump's tariff policy only if it leads to a long-term agreement.

          <p>The new car market is being propped up by wealthy consumers, as automakers increasingly focus on producing expensive vehicles. According to Cox Automotive, the share of new cars sold for over $50,000 has nearly doubled since 2019, while the number of models available for under $30,000 has shrunk. This trend is driven by affluent buyers who have benefited from rising asset values and favorable credit. Meanwhile, lower- and middle-income consumers are being priced out of the new car market, creating an economic imbalance and making automakers heavily reliant on a small segment of the population.</p>

Starting in 2027, workers who earned more than $145,000 in the previous year must make their catch-up contributions on a post-tax (Roth) basis, rather than pre-tax. This change was designed to help fund the legislation by generating upfront tax revenue.
