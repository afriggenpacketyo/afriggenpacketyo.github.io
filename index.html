The firm, which competes with other AI voice generators, is backed by prominent investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. The decision on where to list will depend on its future user base, with London being a consideration if the market environment for tech firms improves.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are struggling to secure enough votes to pass President Trump's signature domestic policy legislation, facing resistance from both moderate and conservative members of the party. A key procedural vote to set the rules for debate was delayed and remained open late into the night, with several GOP lawmakers voting no. The holdouts are reportedly unhappy with changes made by the Senate to the bill, which includes spending on border security and defense, tax cut extensions, and cuts to healthcare programs. House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Trump have been actively pressuring members to support the measure to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has admitted his government failed to properly engage with its own MPs, leading to significant U-turns on its flagship welfare reform proposals. The government narrowly avoided a parliamentary defeat on changes to disability benefits after making last-minute concessions to over 120 rebelling Labour MPs. The proposed overhaul of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) was met with a strong backlash, forcing ministers to gut the bill of its most substantial measures. Starmer acknowledged the process was flawed but insisted he remains committed to pragmatic welfare system reform.</p>

          <p>According to senior UN officials, criminal gangs now control an estimated 90% of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, and are expanding their influence into previously peaceful regions. The state's authority is rapidly diminishing, creating a power vacuum that gangs are filling with "parallel governance structures." This control has paralyzed legal commerce, leading to soaring prices for essential goods like food and fuel. The UN warns that without greater international intervention, a total collapse of the state's presence in the capital is a very real possibility, exacerbating the nation's severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Following Clayton Kershaw's 3,000th career strikeout, a Los Angeles Times columnist makes the case that he is the greatest pitcher in the history of the Dodgers franchise, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. The argument centers on Kershaw's remarkable longevity and endurance over 18 seasons, contrasting it with Koufax's brilliant but shorter five-year peak. While acknowledging Koufax's superior postseason record, the article points to Kershaw's larger body of work, including more wins, more strikeouts, and a better career ERA. The piece concludes that Kershaw's sustained excellence and professionalism have defined a golden era for the team.</p>

          <p>Amidst a contentious vote on a major bill with a razor-thin Republican majority, the possibility of a tie vote in the House of Representatives has become a relevant concern. According to official House rules, if a vote on any question results in a tie, the measure is considered lost and does not pass. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism to resolve an impasse. This procedural reality highlights the challenges of governing with a slim majority, where even a few defections can derail legislation.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a record-setting hydropower turbine with a single-unit capacity of 500 megawatts, the largest in the world. Developed by Harbin Electric Machinery Company, the 80-tonne turbine is set to be installed at the Datang Zala Hydropower Station on a tributary of the Nu River in Tibet. The component, described as the "heart" of the hydropower unit, is constructed from durable martensitic steel. This technological achievement is a key part of a major energy project in the region, with two of these powerful turbines planned for the station.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings is experiencing a significant boom, with fundraising volumes reaching their highest first-half level since 2021. New listing volumes surged to $14 billion, an eightfold increase from the previous year, positioning the city to potentially become the world's top listing destination. This revival is driven by a confluence of factors, including regulatory support from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on mainland exchanges, and U.S. delisting fears prompting Chinese firms to seek capital in Hong Kong. The influx of mainland investors has also provided ample market liquidity, further fueling the frenzy. (not investment advice)</p>

The damage to the planes, which were sprayed with paint, is estimated at £7 million.

Lauren Hersh of World Without Exploitation argued the acquittal on sexual trafficking charges shows a cultural misunderstanding of coercion and exploitation. Activists and accusers worry the verdict may deter future prosecutions of powerful individuals and chill the momentum of the MeToo movement. The article notes that while Combs's reputation is damaged, the legal result is seen by many as a failure of the justice system to fully address the alleged abuse.</p>

He defended the Medicaid changes as primarily focused on implementing work requirements for able-bodied adults.

U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president had exceeded his legal authority, stating that he cannot unilaterally "adopt an alternative immigration system" that supplants laws passed by Congress. The executive order, issued in January, had characterized the border situation as an "invasion."

The research found that for women under 55 who still have a uterus, this combination therapy increases risk, whereas using estrogen alone—typically for women who have had a hysterectomy—actually reduces the risk. This finding refines the understanding of hormone replacement therapy, which has evolved since a controversial early 2000s study. Experts emphasize that the therapy remains highly effective for menopausal symptoms and advise personalized consultation with a doctor.</p>

Political analysts suggest the trend reflects a move toward populism rather than conservatism, driven by economic concerns and a feeling that the Democratic party has failed the community. Some also point to a backlash from naturalized citizens against permissive border policies and a desire by some Latinos to distance themselves from anti-immigrant rhetoric.
