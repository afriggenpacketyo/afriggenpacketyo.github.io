          <h2>Trade War Could Trigger Retail Shortages, Experts Warn</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prolonged trade war with China could lead to retail shortages, according to retail CEOs who have warned President Trump of the potential consequences. The decline in manufacturing orders from China and plummeting freight vessel bookings are pushing the supply chain closer to a tipping point, with apparel, footwear, toys, and budget home goods being the most vulnerable categories. If high tariffs persist, U.S. consumers may face persistent shortages as Chinese suppliers focus on other markets, potentially disrupting the U.S. retail system that relies on speed and scale.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation replaced its federal lawyers in a lawsuit concerning New York City's congestion pricing program after accusing them of undermining the department's efforts to halt the toll. This action followed the accidental filing of a confidential memo questioning the department's legal strategy. The memo, written by the assistant U.S. attorneys, warned that the transportation secretary's rationale for ending the tolling plan was weak and likely to fail. The case has now been transferred to the Justice Department's civil division in Washington.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote, stating that Congress and the states have the power to regulate elections, not the President. Judge Kollar-Kotelly ruled that Trump's effort to reshape election processes exceeded his authority. She allowed the administration to enforce sections related to enforcing pre-existing laws, such as accessing voting databases to identify non-citizens and taking action against states not adopting Trump's mail-in ballot requirements. The judge noted that the Department of Justice offered little defense of the Presidentâ€™s order.</p>

          <p>Bonobos, primates known for their female-dominated societies, maintain their matriarchies through female coalitions, according to a recent study. Researchers tracked six bonobo communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo over 30 years, finding that female bonobos band together to attack or intimidate males who step out of line. Males who cower in the face of such conflicts lose social rank, while their female adversaries gain access to better food and mates for their sons. This behavior helps explain how female bonobos gain and sustain dominance over males.</p>

This could include the Palestinian Authority or a newly formed body, but Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected any role for the PA in Gaza. The announcement comes amid ongoing ceasefire negotiations led by Egypt and Qatar, with a proposal that includes a truce lasting five to seven years, the release of hostages, an end to the war, and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. However, experts remain skeptical about Hamas's willingness to disarm.</p>

          <p>Amazon and Nvidia executives stated that the construction of artificial intelligence data centers is not slowing down, despite concerns about potential pullbacks from tech companies. Amazon's VP of global data centers, Kevin Miller, emphasized continued strong demand and long-term growth. Nvidia's senior director of corporate sustainability, Josh Parker, echoed this sentiment, noting that compute and energy demand are only rising due to AI.

          <h2>Saying 'Thank You' to AI Chatbots Has a Cost, But Is It Worth It?</h2>

          <p>Adding polite phrases like "Please" and "Thank you" to chatbot prompts costs money and energy, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. While every request to a chatbot incurs a cost, additional words increase the server's energy consumption. Despite the expense, Altman suggested that the cost is "well spent," implying that there may be value in maintaining a polite interaction with artificial intelligence, even if it is not sentient.</p>
