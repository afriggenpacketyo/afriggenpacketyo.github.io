          <p>At least four people were killed and eight injured after a gunman drove his truck into a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, an Iraq War veteran, opened fire on congregants before setting the building ablaze. He was later killed in a shootout with police. The FBI is leading the investigation, treating it as an "act of targeted violence," and is working to determine a motive, including any potential connection to recent threats or the death of the church's president.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new partnership between Hertz and Amazon Autos will allow the rental car company to sell its used fleet directly to consumers through the e-commerce platform, potentially disrupting a key profit source for traditional car dealerships. Analysts note that Hertz, which resells hundreds of thousands of cars annually, can leverage Amazon's vast online marketplace to reach more buyers. The deal raises concerns for dealers, as rental companies can purchase vehicles at discounted bulk rates and sell them for less, a competitive advantage now amplified by Amazon's digital retail power.</p>

          <p>President Trump is meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House to advocate for a new U.S.-proposed plan aimed at ending the nearly two-year war in Gaza. The proposal reportedly includes a ceasefire, the release of remaining Israeli hostages by Hamas within 48 hours, and the establishment of an international coalition to oversee Gaza's reconstruction. This high-stakes meeting occurs as Trump, a staunch supporter of Netanyahu, expresses growing frustration with the prolonged conflict and its mounting death toll.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Patagonia, Argentina, have discovered the fossils of a new species of megaraptor, named Joaquinraptor, which lived approximately 70 million years ago. The partially recovered skeleton suggests the dinosaur was about 23 feet long and weighed over 2,000 pounds. A significant finding was a crocodile's arm bone found in the dinosaur's mouth, providing direct evidence of its diet. This discovery adds to the understanding of the predatory dinosaurs that roamed South America during the late Cretaceous Period, just before the mass extinction event.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to impose significant new tariffs, including a 100% duty on all foreign-made films and "substantial" tariffs on furniture not produced in the United States. In posts on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed these industries, particularly in California and North Carolina, have been "stolen" by other countries. The statements, which echo a previous threat against the film industry, aim to bolster domestic production, though specific details on implementation and scope were not provided.

          <p>As part of a broader corporate restructuring plan, Starbucks is closing nearly 20 of its stores in and around Boston, including the iconic location beneath the steaming kettle at Government Center. The company stated that the closures are driven by a variety of factors, including financial performance, lease expirations, and the inability to create the desired store environment. This move is part of a larger, billion-dollar turnaround strategy that also includes the elimination of 900 corporate positions to improve long-term operational performance.</p>

          <p>Immigration advocates report a surge in deportations of Southeast Asian refugees with past criminal records under the second Trump administration, creating a "ripple effect" of trauma for families. Many of those targeted, including Hmong and Laotian refugees, arrived in the U.S. as children and have since reformed, raised families, and become part of their communities. The forced removals, often of family breadwinners, are described as a betrayal of the U.S.'s duty to refugees, reigniting displacement trauma for a diaspora that originally fled war and persecution linked to U.S. foreign policy.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the early Premier League season suggests that each of the main title contenders—Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Chelsea—already appears to have significant weaknesses. Liverpool has shown defensive fragility, Arsenal continues to struggle with self-belief despite recent late wins, and Manchester City is still finding its form under a new tactical approach. Meanwhile, Chelsea seems heavily reliant on individual creativity and defensively shaky. While the season is young, the article posits that no single team has yet established itself as a clear and dominant frontrunner for the title.</p>

Reeves emphasized a commitment to fiscal responsibility, criticizing past Conservative policies and dismissing calls for abandoning spending constraints, framing her approach as one of necessary prudence.</p>

The European powers accused Iran of non-compliance with the accord, citing its continued uranium enrichment and lack of transparency.
