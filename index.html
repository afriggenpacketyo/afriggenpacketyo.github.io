          <p>Jose Mourinho has officially departed from his role as Fenerbahce manager, concluding a tenure of just over a year. His exit follows the Turkish club's recent elimination from the Champions League play-offs by Benfica, two days prior. During his single season, Mourinho guided Fenerbahce to a second-place league finish, a period frequently punctuated by controversy. This included a public dispute with rival club Galatasaray over alleged racist statements, which Mourinho vehemently denied and counter-sued for damages. He also faced a four-match ban, later reduced to two, for critical comments regarding refereeing standards in Turkey. The club has expressed gratitude for his contributions and extended best wishes for his future endeavors in football.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 04:15:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has sharply reduced its 2025 economic growth forecast from 3% to 1.4%, primarily attributing the downgrade to weaker expectations for pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk. The economy ministry cited a significant drop in Denmark's U.S. exports in early 2025, driven by inventory build-up and increased competition in the weight loss drug market, where Novo Nordisk's blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy are losing market share to generic medicines and rivals. U.S. tariffs and a statistical revision showing lower real GDP expansion from 2021-2024 also contributed to the adjustment. Despite this, the ministry maintains that the overall economy remains strong with high employment and low inflation, while revising its 2026 forecast upwards. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Office has instructed its contractor, Mitie, to withdraw job advertisements for roles teaching asylum seekers craft skills like balloon-craft and cake decorating at the Heathrow immigration removal centre. Home Office minister Seema Malhotra deemed these £31,585-per-year positions unnecessary, following strong criticism from Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp. Philp argued against "pouring taxpayers' money into perks" when the focus should be on deportations, calling the roles "indefensible." While a Mitie spokesperson stated the roles supported the physical and mental wellbeing of detained individuals and were part of contractual obligations, the government's move reflects ongoing political debate regarding the treatment of asylum seekers and public spending.</p>

The incident occurred as security forces attempted to disperse demonstrators protesting a range of issues, including a new, substantially high housing allowance for parliamentarians amidst rising living costs and mass layoffs. This tragic death sparked nationwide outrage, leading to further demonstrations and stone-throwing at police headquarters. Both President Prabowo Subianto and National Police Chief Listyo Sigit Prabowo issued public apologies, promised thorough investigations, and stressed that involved officers would be held accountable for the "excessive actions."</p>

Chelsea also held talks for Simons but are now pursuing Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho. Simons is set to join Joao Palhinha and Mohammed Kudus as new summer arrivals at Spurs, marking a significant acquisition for the North London club and a notable move in European football.</p>

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommended the vaccine in November 2023, with experts stating it will dramatically reduce cases and mitigate previous concerns about a potential increase in shingles.

Mainoo, who played the full 90 minutes in Wednesday's EFL Cup defeat but was an unused substitute in the opening Premier League games, is reportedly concerned about his limited Premier League game time. Head coach Ruben Amorim views Mainoo as competing directly with captain Bruno Fernandes for an advanced midfield role, a situation that has reportedly stalled contract extension negotiations. Mainoo's rapid emergence last season, which masked positional deficiencies, combined with recent form and injuries, has complicated his path to regular starts, leading to his current frustration.</p>

          <p>The UK government did not conduct its own independent analysis of the cost for the largest reorganization of English councils in decades, instead relying solely on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner had asserted that merging councils in 21 areas into single authorities would save "a significant amount of money," but the CCN has since revised its analysis. Their updated findings suggest the reorganization could yield no savings or even incur costs, particularly if proposals lead to multiple smaller unitary authorities. Critics argue that ministers' insistence on savings without independent verification is concerning, as the CCN warns such structures could create "hundreds of millions of new unsustainable costs" for local taxpayers, potentially straining already pressured services.</p>

The federal government, under the Trump administration, asserts that these policies create a hostile environment, endangering student safety, privacy, and dignity while denying equal educational opportunities.

          <p>Cambricon, a Shanghai-listed chip designer dubbed "China's little Nvidia," has issued a warning to investors about potential risks after its stock price surged an astonishing 533% in the past year. The company's shares nearly doubled in the last month alone, fueled by China's supportive policies for local artificial intelligence chips and a new AI model tailored for domestic chips. Cambricon cautioned that its stock price might be deviating from current fundamentals, posing substantial risks for investors. Furthermore, the company reminded investors that it remains subject to U.S. export restrictions, which create vulnerability to supply chain disruptions and could adversely affect its operating performance.

          <p>Former world number one Naomi Osaka has strongly condemned Jelena Ostapenko's comments to Taylor Townsend at the US Open, calling Ostapenko's remark that Townsend had "no class" and "no education" one of the worst things to say to a Black tennis player. The dispute arose after Townsend defeated Ostapenko, with Ostapenko alleging Townsend did not apologize for a net cord. While Townsend stated she did not perceive a racial undertone, she acknowledged the enduring stigma within the Black community regarding education, which is "the furthest thing from the truth." Ostapenko denied any racism in an Instagram post, but Osaka emphasized the "ill timing" and historical context of such comments in a predominantly white sport.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit signals a potential improvement in ties, despite a history of uneasy relations and border clashes. Both nations face U.S. tariff pressures, prompting a reluctant cooperation driven by economic necessity, as China seeks new markets amidst domestic slowdown and India aims to diversify supply chains. India, however, faces a widening trade deficit with China and harbors deep suspicions, exacerbated by China's close relationship with Pakistan. While the summit may foster common ground, experts doubt a long-lasting friendship, emphasizing that economic ties alone may not overcome entrenched geopolitical and historical disputes.</p>

          <p>Irish rap trio Kneecap is set to play a high-energy home gig in South Belfast, supporting Fontaines DC, after a year marked by political controversy and police investigations. The band, known for rapping in English and Irish and challenging the establishment, has faced significant scrutiny for pro-Palestinian messages and a remark about killing MPs, for which they later apologized, claiming it was taken out of context. One member, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, is currently on bail facing a terrorism charge related to allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag, which the band denies supporting. Despite these legal and public challenges, fans anticipate an intense atmosphere, valuing the group's message against the status quo and their unique musical style.</p>

          <p>A new police investigation has commenced into Berrow Wood School, where generations of children suffered abuse, following a fresh report against more than a dozen former staff members. Nine former teachers and workers from the reform school, which housed "maladjusted" boys from 1968 to 1991, have already been convicted of physical and sexual abuse, including a "campaign of sexual assault against children." Many survivors, like Chris Brosnan, who was known by a laundry number, describe enduring severe trauma and a lasting impact on their lives, with some turning to prostitution for survival. They seek accountability from the government, which recently paused a proposed redress scheme for child sexual abuse survivors, leaving many feeling insulted and unheard.</p>

          <p>Russia's state space agency, Roscosmos, is targeting a December test launch for its new Soyuz-5 rocket, despite facing significant funding shortages and international isolation since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The Soyuz-5, known as Irtysh and seen as a medium-class launch vehicle reincarnating the Ukraine-manufactured Zenit-2 rocket, is expected to become fully operational by 2028 and will be launched from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome. Roscosmos has lost billions in funding and severed ties with the European Space Agency, which previously supported Soyuz launches. However, the agency remains committed to advancing its space sector, aiming to demonstrate its continued capability in rocket development, a challenging feat as evidenced by other global space programs.</p>

This appointment comes amidst significant division within the CDC over vaccine policies, as Kennedy is a known vaccine skeptic. At least three senior CDC leaders have resigned, citing frustration over Kennedy's leadership and the "weaponizing of public health," raising widespread concerns among health experts and Senator Bernie Sanders.</p>

Gauff experienced an emotional unraveling during the first set, hitting seven double faults and crying on court, a struggle she attributed to the psychological toll of re-making her serve before a major tournament. Despite the difficulties, she managed to reset during a medical timeout, hitting practice serves, and found composure, ultimately dominating the second set with only one double fault. Gauff drew strength from supporters, including Simone Biles in the crowd, and believes overcoming this ordeal, which she described as feeling "the worst I've ever felt on the court," will make her a tougher competitor.</p>
