Deputies responded quickly to 911 calls and made contact with the shooter within five minutes; no law enforcement officers fired any weapons. The shooting took place both inside and outside the school building, with numerous students witnessing the event. School was canceled for several days, and counseling services were made available for students and families, with local officials expressing deep concern and support for the community.

          <p>Nathalie Tocci argues that the transatlantic relationship between Europe and the US is unlikely to return to its former state, even if Donald Trump were to disappear from the political landscape. She suggests that the relationship may devolve into transactions of convenience or a world of empires where the US, Russia, and China pursue their own interests. Tocci emphasizes that Europe's reactions to these emerging realities will determine the future of its relationship with the US. She urges European leaders to accept the changing dynamics and pursue strategic autonomy to avoid being marginalized. Optimism score is not included in this summary.</p>

          <p>China has invested nearly 450 billion yuan in a strategic mineral-exploration initiative over the past five years, resulting in significant discoveries of oil, gas, copper, lithium, and uranium. Chinese geologists have mapped the reserves, distribution, and utilization of 163 mineral types, discovering more than 500 large and medium-sized oil, gas, and mineral deposits. These efforts aim to dominate critical mineral supply chains and reduce reliance on imports amid geopolitical tensions and booming demand from new tech development. These findings support China's stable oil production and natural gas output. Optimism score is not included in this summary.</p>

The article emphasizes Kirk's role as an interpreter of politics, faith, and family for young conservatives, and his success in mobilizing young voters for Trump.

          <p>A recent report indicates that San Francisco's housing costs have returned to "normal" based on a mortgage payment-to-income ratio, reaching levels seen in July 2018. This return to normal is attributed to tech-driven wage growth outpacing home price increases. However, the findings do not indicate affordability, as San Francisco remains one of the most expensive cities in the US. The analysis shows that cities with high-earning tech workers are returning to a pre-pandemic equilibrium, but the trend does not reflect the reality for renters, with rents spiking due to the artificial intelligence boom.
