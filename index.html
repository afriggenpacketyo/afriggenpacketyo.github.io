          <p>The death of Kendy Howard, initially reported as a suicide by her husband Dan Howard, a former Idaho State Trooper, is being scrutinized by investigators. Kendy was found in a bathtub with a gunshot wound to the head, but several details at the scene raised suspicions, including broken glass, discarded clothing, and warm bathwater. Investigators found a running clothes dryer containing bath towels and mats, which was started about a minute before the 911 call.

The PAP won 87 out of 97 parliamentary seats, with the Workers Party holding on to the remaining 10. Wong's first election as prime minister was dominated by concerns about the cost of living, jobs, and economic growth. Despite these challenges, the PAP's victory signals a clear mandate for the government and is expected to bolster investor confidence. </p>

          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a shift towards a more loyalist and less inhibited administration. Unlike other potential candidates, Vance fully embraced the MAGA movement and showed a willingness to support Trump's agenda without reservation. This choice highlighted a move away from the coalition-style government of Trump's first term, towards a "royal court" where loyalty and obedience are prioritized above all else. The article suggests this change in structure has resulted in a more reckless and unconstrained presidency. </p>
