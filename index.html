            <p>Prison officers in the UK are requesting immediate access to electric stun guns to protect themselves while guarding dangerous jails. This demand follows an incident where Hashem Abedi, involved in the Manchester Arena bombing, attacked officers. The Prison Officers' Association is advocating for specially trained staff to have the ability to deploy tasers in response to life-threatening situations, as current equipment like batons and pepper spray are deemed insufficient. The Ministry of Justice has launched a full review of the incident, amidst calls for stricter rules for high-risk inmates and improved protective gear for frontline staff.</p>

            <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny for allegedly sharing sensitive details about a March attack on Houthis in Yemen via a second Signal group chat that included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. This follows a previous incident where Hegseth shared similar information in another Signal chat that mistakenly included a journalist. Critics argue that sharing operational information on unapproved channels could endanger troops, while the Pentagon dismisses the reports, stating that no classified information was shared. The incident has sparked investigations and calls for Hegseth's removal from office, raising concerns about his judgment and handling of sensitive military information.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>An Israeli military inquiry has attributed the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month to "professional failures," including an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders." The IDF claims its troops opened fire believing they faced a threat from enemy forces, alleging that six of the casualties were Hamas members. However, a spokeswoman for the Palestine Red Crescent Society disputes the report, arguing that it shifts responsibility to a personal error. The incident occurred in a "hostile and dangerous combat zone" with poor visibility, leading to the dismissal of a deputy commander and reprimand for another officer.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for China's Xiamen Airlines has been returned to Boeing's US production hub due to the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Trump raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, leading China to retaliate with a 125% tariff on US goods. The decision highlights the economic consequences of the trade war, as tariffs make it financially unviable for Chinese airlines to take delivery of new Boeing jets. Confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airline CEOs saying they would defer delivery of planes rather than pay duties.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has maintained its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, citing strong macro data that allows it to focus on stabilizing the yuan amid trade tensions with the US. The 1-year LPR remains at 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%, with the PBOC keeping these rates steady since October of last year. This decision aligns with expectations, as recent economic data showed better-than-expected growth in GDP, retail sales, and industrial output. The PBOC's move reflects a cautious approach, awaiting further data to assess the full impact of US tariffs before considering any policy adjustments.</p>

This follows reports that the US plans to pressure nations to curb trade with China in order to avoid new US tariffs. China's Commerce Ministry insists that appeasement will not bring peace and threatens reciprocal countermeasures against any nation acting against its interests. The warning underscores the escalating trade tensions between the US and China and the pressure on other countries to navigate their relationships with both economic powers.</p>

            <p>As the U.S. tightens controls on Nvidia's sales to China, domestic AI chipmakers like Huawei stand to benefit, according to semiconductor analysts. The Commerce Department has imposed new export license requirements for Nvidia's H20 GPUs, designed to comply with previous restrictions, potentially hindering China's access to advanced chips. Analysts suggest this creates an opportunity for local competitors like Huawei and Cambricon Technologies to grow and improve their solutions. While Huawei faces challenges in software maturity and accessing advanced chipmaking equipment, the company's Ascend series is gaining traction as a domestic alternative. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>American-style restaurants in Beijing, like Home Plate BBQ, are switching from US beef to Australian beef due to the US-China trade war. Beijing's retaliatory tariffs of 125% on top of existing 22% made American beef unaffordable. Home Plate BBQ is now sourcing beef from Australia and pork ribs from Canada. The experience highlights the impact of the trade war on businesses and consumers. The restaurant chain is trying to maintain the same taste and quality for its customers.</p>

Texas prosecutors declined to pursue the death penalty due to the wishes of the victims' relatives. Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level.</p>

            <p>Approximately 60,000 Americans are at risk of losing their rental assistance due to the Emergency Housing Vouchers program running out of funds. The program, launched in 2021, helps people fleeing homelessness and domestic violence. Funding is expected to be exhausted by the end of next year, potentially leading to a large-scale loss of rental assistance and subsequent evictions. Congress could decide to allocate additional funds, but the program's future remains uncertain. The loss of assistance would undo much progress people have made in rebuilding their lives.</p>
