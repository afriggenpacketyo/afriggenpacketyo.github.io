            <p>A court in Tunisia has sentenced several senior politicians, businessmen, and lawyers to lengthy prison terms on conspiracy and terrorism charges, with sentences reaching up to 66 years. The defendants, including leaders of the National Salvation Front, were accused of conspiring against state security and belonging to a terrorist group. Human rights groups have condemned the trial as an attempt to stifle dissent, while defense lawyers have described it as a farce. The sentences highlight a worrying decline in fundamental rights under President Kais Saied's government, which has been criticized for its authoritarian style.</p>

            <p>This article discusses the difficulties in holding the Trump administration accountable for defying court orders, particularly regarding immigration. Despite judges finding probable cause for contempt of court, the Executive Branch's control over enforcement mechanisms, including the Justice Department and US Marshals Service, poses a significant obstacle. The author explores potential remedies, such as impeachment, future prosecution of officials, and disbarment of involved lawyers, but acknowledges the limited impact these may have while Trump remains in office. The piece highlights the potential for a constitutional crisis if the Executive and Judicial branches continue to clash.</p>

            <p>This opinion piece criticizes the hypocrisy of politicians who celebrate women's suffrage while supporting legislation that could disproportionately disenfranchise women. The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (SAVE Act), requiring specific documentation for voting, is highlighted as a measure that could negatively impact women due to name changes after marriage or divorce. The author contrasts this with the Women's Commemorative Coin Act, which honored suffrage activists, questioning the motives of politicians who appear to support women's rights while simultaneously undermining them.</p>

            <p>Following a devastating fire, Altadena residents are questioning whether the town's unincorporated status hindered the emergency response, particularly regarding evacuation alerts. While surrounding cities had multiple avenues for communication and dedicated resources, many Altadena residents felt left in the dark. The lack of a local city government and dedicated resources is cited as a potential disadvantage, though county officials defend their support for the community. The incident has reignited concerns about governance and resource allocation in unincorporated areas, prompting discussions about potential solutions, including cityhood or improved emergency preparedness.</p>

            <p>American consumers face higher chocolate prices this Easter due to soaring cocoa costs caused by climate-related crises in West Africa and the impact of Trump's tariffs on imports. The rising cost of cocoa has already led to price increases and reduced profits for chocolate producers like Hershey. Economists predict that Trump's tariffs will further exacerbate the situation, as shifting manufacturing to the US is not feasible for chocolate companies due to the tropical climate required for cacao plants. This combination of factors creates an unstable environment, particularly for smaller chocolate businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China's beach resorts, particularly in Sanya, are experiencing a surge in Russian tourists, revitalizing the local travel sector after the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of Russian visitors has increased dramatically, becoming the top source of foreign guests in local hotels. This upswing is attributed to a general recovery in Russian outbound tourism and China's relaxed visa policies aimed at attracting more foreign travelers, including visa-free entry for certain nationalities.</p>

            <h2>Supreme Court Halts Deportation of Venezuelans Under Wartime Law Amid Due Process Concerns</h2>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans detained under the Alien Enemies Act, citing concerns about due process. The act, previously used during wartime, allows the president to detain and deport citizens of "enemy" nations without standard legal procedures. The ACLU argued that the detainees were not given a chance to contest their case in court. The Supreme Court's intervention underscores ongoing legal challenges to the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies.</p>

            <p>This article provides an overview of the Trump administration's intensified deportation efforts, including controversial deportations to El Salvador's mega-prison and the invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. The article highlights the legal challenges to these policies, including a Supreme Court order to halt deportations of Venezuelans and concerns about due process violations. It also discusses agreements with other countries to accept deportees and the impact on unauthorized crossings at the southern border, while noting that some statistics indicate deportations under Trump are slightly behind those under Biden at the same time last year.</p>

            <p>The US bond market is under close observation due to unusual volatility sparked by trade tariffs. Investors, typically viewing government bonds as safe, began selling them off due to uncertainty about the tariffs' impact on the US economy, leading to a sharp rise in interest rates. This situation, drawing comparisons to Liz Truss's mini-Budget in the UK, has prompted concerns about potential economic consequences for ordinary Americans and businesses, ultimately influencing President Trump to pause higher tariffs.

            <p>This opinion piece argues that Donald Trump is modeling his immigration policies after the repressive state of El Salvador under President Nayib Bukele, using fear and authoritarian tactics to justify crackdowns on immigrants. The author points to the increasing cooperation between the US and El Salvador, with Trump outsourcing deportation efforts to Bukele's regime. The article warns that Trump's actions are eroding the rule of law and creating a climate of fear, potentially leading to a lasting authoritarian shift in US immigration policy.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelan men in immigration custody, after lawyers argued they were at imminent risk of removal without the judicial review previously mandated by the justices. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said dozens of Venezuelan men held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Bluebonnet detention center in Texas were given notices indicating they were classified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang and would be deported under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). The order is the latest example of how the country’s courts are challenging the Trump administration’s overhaul of the immigration system.</p>
