          <p>A shooting and fire at a Michigan church during Sunday services resulted in four deaths, including the shooter, and left eight others injured, with two in critical condition. Authorities confirmed all 100 attendees are accounted for, and the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence, with the suspect identified as Thomas Jacob Sanford, an Iraq war veteran. Governor Gretchen Whitmer ordered U.S. and Michigan flags to be lowered to half-staff to honor victims, who ranged from 6 to 78 years old. First responders and churchgoers were praised for their immediate, heroic actions during the harrowing event, which has deeply impacted the community.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a major Category 3 storm, is expected to bring life-threatening surf and rip current conditions to the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda this week. The storm rapidly strengthened over the weekend to Category 5 before weakening, with its center forecast to pass west and north of Bermuda. Forecasters warn of significant swells affecting the Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda.

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is projected to strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday morning, moving away from the southeastern U.S. but approaching Bermuda by Wednesday. The ninth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Imelda's swells, combined with those from Hurricane Humberto, are expected to create life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast. Rainfall of 1-4 inches is anticipated across parts of Florida and the Carolinas, while eastern Cuba experienced landslides leading to one death. Authorities are closely monitoring the storm's progression and potential impacts.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have unveiled a new peace plan for Gaza, calling for an immediate end to military operations. The proposal includes Hamas releasing 20 living Israeli hostages and the remains of over two dozen dead, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. The plan stipulates no governance role for Hamas and leaves open the possibility of an eventual Palestinian state. While Netanyahu endorsed the 20-point proposal, Hamas officials are reviewing it, with initial indications suggesting concerns about Israeli withdrawal and safeguarding Palestinian interests.</p>

          <p>Thousands of British military personnel are launching legal action against 3M, alleging that faulty combat earplugs supplied between 2003 and 2015 caused life-changing injuries like tinnitus and deafness. This follows a $6 billion settlement by 3M in the U.S. for similar claims from 240,000 American service members. Veterans like Dave Watson describe significant impacts on their daily and family lives due to hearing loss, while 3M maintains its products were effective if used correctly and denies liability. The case highlights ongoing concerns about veteran health and corporate accountability for military equipment.</p>

          <p>Zhimin Qian, a Chinese national, has been convicted in the UK for her central role in a large-scale bitcoin money laundering operation, believed to be the world's largest cryptocurrency seizure at over £5 billion. Qian pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency, which stemmed from a scam that defrauded over 128,000 victims in China between 2014 and 2017. The seven-year investigation by the Metropolitan Police involved multiple jurisdictions, with Qian attempting to launder funds by buying property in the UK. This case underscores the increasing use of cryptocurrencies by organized criminals to obscure illicit assets.</p>

          <p>The Miami Dolphins achieved their first win of the season, defeating the New York Jets 27-21, but the victory was overshadowed by a probable season-ending knee injury to star receiver Tyreek Hill. Hill dislocated his left knee in the third quarter, an injury his coach confirmed would likely end his season. Despite Hill's upbeat demeanor, the loss of the prolific receiver is a major blow to the Dolphins. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa led Miami with two touchdowns, while the Jets struggled with turnovers and penalties in their fourth straight loss.</p>

          <p>This opinion article proposes that Hong Kong could become China's primary gateway to the United Nations, leveraging its unique status with English as an official language, common law system, and low corporate taxes. The author argues that positioning the UN's Asia headquarters in Hong Kong would aid the organization's reforms and reinforce Beijing's vision of global governance. This move could also support Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu's efforts to strengthen Hong Kong's international engagements, attracting global talent and capital.

          <p>Boeing is reportedly in the early phases of developing a new single-aisle airplane intended to eventually replace the 737 MAX, according to the Wall Street Journal. This initiative follows the 737 MAX's global grounding in 2019 after two fatal crashes, which led to significant profit losses and regulatory scrutiny. The company's CEO has met with Rolls-Royce to discuss new engines, and flight deck designs are underway, though final decisions are pending. This move signals Boeing's long-term strategy to address past issues and innovate its commercial aircraft offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Afghanistan is experiencing a nationwide internet blackout after the Taliban government severed fibre-optic internet connections, citing reasons of immorality. This shutdown has severely disrupted mobile internet, satellite TV, and international communications, impacting news agencies and flight operations from Kabul airport. The move is part of the Taliban's imposition of strict interpretations of Islamic Sharia law since seizing power in 2021. Business leaders have warned of serious economic repercussions, and the blackout raises significant concerns about access to information and human rights in the country.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily suspended the Trump administration's plan to eliminate 532 jobs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees Voice of America (VOA). The ruling prevents the job cuts, representing the majority of VOA's remaining staff, from taking effect, preserving the agency's operational status quo. The judge accused the administration of "concerning disrespect" towards the court and had previously ordered VOA programming restored to statutory levels. This legal battle highlights concerns about political interference in government-funded media and its mission to project American values globally.</p>

          <p>A BBC undercover investigation has revealed nurses and pharmacists in the UK are dangerously supplying Botox without proper checks, putting patients at risk. Researchers documented a nurse trading prescriptions via WhatsApp, a pharmacist coaching clients to falsify records, and a bogus doctor selling unlicensed Korean toxin for cash. These practices bypass medical rules requiring in-person consultations, increasing risks of complications like drooping eyelids or, in rare cases, respiratory failure. The findings highlight widespread unsafe and illegal activities within England's booming aesthetics market, prompting concern from regulatory bodies and calls for reform.</p>

While NMIA will make Mumbai the first large Indian city with two airports, it faces challenges with last-mile connectivity and regulatory hurdles for achieving international hub status.

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of 200 Oregon National Guard members to Portland, authorized by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Attorney General Dan Rayfield argues that President Trump lacks authority to federalize the Guard for this purpose, citing local officials' capacity to manage public safety without federal interference. Trump asserted the troops are needed to protect "war ravaged Portland" and ICE facilities from "Antifa and other domestic terrorists."

          <p>California and several other Democratic-led states have sued the Trump administration, alleging it stripped them of hundreds of millions in federal security and disaster relief funding due to their "sanctuary" immigration policies. This lawsuit follows a recent ruling that barred the administration from conditioning similar grants on states rescinding such policies. Attorney General Rob Bonta criticized the funding cuts as an illegal attempt to coerce states into federal immigration enforcement. The states argue the funding, crucial for first responders and disaster preparedness, is being reallocated based on political alignment rather than objective risk assessments.</p>
