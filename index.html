          <p>The Trump administration is considering requesting the Supreme Court to immediately halt a federal court ruling that blocked many of President Trump's tariffs. This action follows criticism from top aides who have condemned the trade-court judges' decision to strike down the "reciprocal" tariffs, dealing a blow to Trump's trade agenda. The administration argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant presidents unbounded authority to impose such tariffs. The court's ruling invalidated dozens of country-specific tariffs imposed earlier in the year, leading to accusations of judicial overreach from White House officials.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts plans to grant a preliminary injunction to prevent the Trump administration from restricting Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. Judge Allison Burroughs extended a temporary restraining order that prohibits the administration from acting on its threat, as Harvard sues the Department of Homeland Security. The Trump administration is giving Harvard 30 days to contest its efforts to end foreign student enrollment, requiring the school to provide evidence rebutting the administration's actions. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, addressed the graduates, emphasizing their role as the hope of the institution.</p>

The $70 million renovation, supported by the Rockefeller family, showcases a collection inspired by Nelson Rockefeller's passion for Indigenous art and his son Michael's work as an anthropologist. Mary Rockefeller Morgan, Michael's twin sister, played a crucial role in preserving and displaying the family's collection, which includes artifacts collected by Michael during his expeditions to New Guinea. The wing aims to present Indigenous art as an integral component of global human creativity, featuring over 1,700 artifacts in a redesigned 40,000-square-foot space.</p>

Toone's father passed away shortly before the Women's Super League season began, leading her to play without fully processing her grief and losing her love for the game. The injury allowed her to step away from football, seek counseling, and spend time with her partner, enabling her to grieve and regain her passion for the sport.

These smaller systems face financial challenges in rebuilding, especially with reduced revenue due to customer displacement.

Swiss glaciers are severely impacted by climate change, having lost about 10% of their volume in recent years, with authorities declaring a local state of emergency and monitoring the situation closely.

Trump has suggested diverting funds from Harvard to support vocational training, reflecting a shifting perspective on alternative career pathways. The rising cost of college and increasing student loan debt have contributed to changing views about higher education. While college enrollment is still climbing, community colleges are seeing larger gains, driven by students choosing shorter-term credentials at a lower cost.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. trade court ruled President Trump's sweeping tariffs illegal, creating uncertainty for U.S. businesses and consumers. The ruling halted tariffs assessed on virtually every other country, but the Trump administration intends to appeal. Some tariffs remain in effect, including those on automotive, steel, aluminum imports, and China. Until the appeal is resolved, U.S. businesses face uncertainty, as they are responsible for paying the tariffs on imported goods. The ruling has lowered the effective tariff rate, but it is still higher than before the Trump administration, impacting inflation and the economy.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. federal court's block on President Trump's across-the-board tariffs, America's trading partners are reacting cautiously, despite the threat of tariffs on the European Union and other countries hanging in limbo. While stocks rose internationally, economists point out that Trump could pursue other legal avenues to enact tariffs, with the administration already planning an appeal. The court's decision provides only a fragile chance at reprieve for economies like Australia, Britain, Canada, the European Union, and India. The move has set off days of scrambling, as the United States tries to reinstate tariffs, leading to continued chaos in trade relations.</p>

Hoover, 74, built the Gangster Disciples into a nationwide street gang and was convicted on conspiracy, extortion, and drug charges in 1997.

          <p>Experts anticipate that home equity loan and HELOC rates will likely remain stable in June, despite a slight decline in inflation. The Federal Reserve's decision to keep the federal funds rate paused and ongoing economic uncertainty suggest that significant rate drops are unlikely. While HELOC rates have recently ticked up, both HELOC and home equity loan rates offer a lower-cost borrowing alternative compared to credit cards or personal loans. However, borrowers should be prepared for potential rate increases if inflation rises further and should carefully evaluate their ability to manage the total borrowing amount and monthly payments.

          <p>A Colombian asylum seeker named Victor, along with his sister Johanna, was detained by ICE after accidentally crossing the Peace Bridge into Canada. The incident, a common mistake due to GPS misdirection, resulted in Victor being held for three weeks while his asylum case was re-evaluated. The detention highlights the stricter immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, where a simple wrong turn can lead to severe consequences. Despite the initial setback, Victor was eventually released on bond, thanks to support from his community.</p>
