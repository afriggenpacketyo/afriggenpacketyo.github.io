          <p>A 66-year-old woman was arrested in Camden, north London, on suspicion of murdering a 69-year-old woman who was found stabbed in her home. Emergency services responded to a report of an unresponsive woman at a property where they discovered the victim, identified as Jennifer Abbott, also known as Sarah Steinberg. Abbott was last seen walking her dog on June 10 and was found fatally injured three days later, with a post-mortem examination revealing sharp force trauma as the cause of death. Detectives are focusing on a missing diamond-encrusted Rolex watch, potentially linked to the crime, and are appealing for information as the suspect remains in custody, with police increasing their presence in the area to conduct further inquiries. The neighbor of the victim stated that Abbott had confided in her that she was fearful living at her flat because of crime in the area.</p>

          <p>Federal ICE agents were denied entry to Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles amidst ongoing anti-immigration enforcement protests, which have been taking place since June 6. The agents, dressed in tactical gear, gathered near the stadium, but the Dodgers organization confirmed they were denied access to the grounds. The Dodgers had faced criticism for not speaking out about immigration raids in Los Angeles, and the incident occurred amid reports of ICE raids, including one near a Home Depot. President Trump has instructed ICE to do "all in their power" to oversee the largest mass deportation program in history, targeting cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. The Los Angeles City Council District 1 alerted the Los Angeles Police Department of the ICE staging near Dodger Stadium.</p>

          <p>Oil prices increased by approximately 3% following Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's order to escalate attacks on "strategic targets" in Iran, prompting investor concerns about potential U.S. involvement in the conflict. Brent crude rose to its highest settlement since January 22, while U.S. crude also experienced a significant increase. The escalation follows an Iranian missile strike on a hospital in Beersheba, leading to threats against Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. President Trump is considering a U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear program, with a decision expected within two weeks, as JPMorgan warns that regime change in Iran could substantially impact global oil prices.

          <p>Federal prosecutors in California have moved to dismiss charges against Jose Manuel Mojica, a Los Angeles protester who was accused of assaulting border patrol agents during an anti-ICE demonstration. Mojica, who said he was brutally attacked by law enforcement, was facing eight years in federal prison. US attorney Bill Essayli filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and charges were also dropped against another protester arrested at the same time. Civil rights advocates scrutinized the prosecutions, arguing that authorities misrepresented events and criminalized free speech. Mojica said he felt a huge relief and that the truth always comes out in the end.</p>

However, she stated that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit should not be part of the solution. Foxcroft mentioned she had been wrestling with whether to resign or remain in government to fight for changes from within, but ultimately felt that the desired changes would not be achieved.</p>

          <p>Reports of several Boeing 747s flying from China to Iran have raised concerns about potential Chinese assistance to Iran during its conflict with Israel. The flights, which began on June 14, traveled westward along northern China before disappearing from radar near Iran. Experts speculate the planes could be transporting cargo or personnel, although the nature of the flights remains unconfirmed. Some experts have cast doubt on the flights representing a nefarious connection between the two nations, including Atlantic Council fellow Tuvia Gering who posted on X that an aviation expert told him the flights are "nothing to write home about." Tensions between Iran and Israel have escalated, with the United States considering direct involvement.</p>

The GHF, backed by the U.S. and Israel, took over assistance operations after Israel sidelined the UN and other humanitarian organizations. The GHF has been controversial from the start, with its initial executive director resigning due to concerns about breaching humanitarian principles. The distribution system relies on armed private contractors and concentrates aid deliveries to a few fortified hubs, forcing hungry people to travel long distances through combat zones.</p>

Putin hailed Indonesia as one of Russia's "key partners" in the Asia Pacific, emphasizing mutually beneficial relations. The BRICS grouping, seen as a counter to Western-led forums, provides Putin with a diplomatic avenue amidst international isolation over the Ukraine invasion, as Russia has also proposed deepening military, security, trade and nuclear ties with Indonesia.</p>

          <p>A private jet that crashed in San Diego last month, killing all six on board, was flying too low before hitting power lines and crashing into a house, according to a preliminary NTSB report. The plane descended too low about three miles from the runway, dropping to 60 feet above ground level, and struck power lines approximately 90 feet high. The victims included rock drummer Daniel Williams and others, while eight people on the ground sustained minor injuries. The automated weather system and runway lights were not operating at the airport, and the pilot was aware of the system's outage.</p>

          <p>Pixar is facing difficulties in achieving box office success with original animated films, as audiences increasingly favor sequels and familiar content. The latest original movie, “Elio,” is projected to have a soft debut, reflecting a broader trend in the animation industry. Despite this, Pixar executives remain committed to telling original stories, which they view as essential for the industry's future. Disney and Pixar's previous original movie “Elemental” had a slow start but eventually grossed a solid worldwide amount, demonstrating the potential for original films to succeed through word-of-mouth and other revenue streams.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's sale in the US for another 90 days, marking the third such delay. The video-sharing app has faced scrutiny over its future due to a US law requiring a ban unless sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, over national security concerns. Trump signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of the law, with a new deadline set for September 17. TikTok expressed gratitude for Trump's support and continued collaboration with Vice President Vance's Office, as authorities in Beijing will likely need to approve any sale or partial sale of the app.</p>

A New York jury had ordered Trump to pay Carroll for defaming her in 2019 when he denied her accusation of sexual assault.

The new projection is partly due to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which boosted benefits for millions of retirees. Congress needs to act to protect and strengthen the trust funds, either by raising more revenue or cutting benefits. Some advocate for lifting the income cap to increase revenue, while others suggest raising the retirement age, which would effectively cut benefits. (not investment advice)</p>
