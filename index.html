          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the city continues to grapple with its long-term consequences. The storm, which caused $125 billion in damages and led to 1,400 deaths, exposed critical failures in the city's levee system and the federal government's disaster response. This article revisits the harrowing experiences of survivors and examines the warnings that went unheeded prior to the disaster. While significant investments have been made to strengthen flood protections, the city's incomplete recovery and reduced population serve as a stark reminder of the costliest hurricane in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>Chelsea FC has authorized Carney Chukwuemeka and Aaron Anselmino to travel to Germany to finalize their transfers to Borussia Dortmund. Chukwuemeka is set for a permanent move valued at approximately £24 million, while Anselmino will join on a season-long loan. These sales will push Chelsea's income from player departures this summer to over £270 million, helping the club comply with UEFA's financial regulations ahead of the Champions League. The club is also reportedly targeting Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons before the transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing a warm bank holiday weekend, with temperatures potentially reaching 30°C in the Midlands and Wales possibly setting a new late-August record. This warm spell has provided pleasant conditions for festivals and the Notting Hill Carnival. However, the weather is expected to shift dramatically by midweek as the remnants of Hurricane Erin bring unsettled, windy, and rainy conditions across the country. The Met Office forecasts that this more turbulent weather, including potential thunderstorms, will persist for the remainder of the week.</p>

          <p>Baltimore Orioles pitcher Cade Povich has publicly condemned a social media user who sent a message containing a threat of sexual violence against his wife following a recent game. Povich stated that criticism of his performance is acceptable, but targeting his family is an unacceptable violation that crosses a line. This incident follows a similar one involving Seattle Mariners pitcher Tayler Saucedo, whose girlfriend also received vile threats. The events highlight a growing concern within Major League Baseball regarding severe online harassment, which some players link to the rise of online sports betting.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the school year approaches, families are bracing for higher prices on supplies due to new tariffs implemented by the Trump administration, with a recent survey indicating 72% of parents expect costs to rise. The National Retail Federation estimates total back-to-school spending will reach a near-record $39.4 billion, as many supplies are imported. While some retailers have pledged to hold prices on key items, economists predict that companies will eventually pass the increased costs on to consumers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration and its allies are being accused of engaging in "lawfare" by using allegations of mortgage fraud to target political adversaries. The strategy, led by Federal Housing Finance Agency head Bill Pulte, has publicly targeted figures like New York Attorney General Letitia James, Senator Adam Schiff, and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Critics describe this selective application of the law as a tactic to intimidate opponents, drawing comparisons to the weaponization of legal systems in authoritarian regimes. The accusations against Cook are also seen as part of President Trump's broader campaign to exert political influence over the historically independent Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>A rapid escalation in partisan gerrymandering, initiated by President Trump's push in Texas and met with a swift counter-move by California Democrats, threatens to reshape American political power. This aggressive, mid-decade push to redraw congressional maps for partisan advantage marks a departure from established norms and could further entrench political divisions across the country. Experts worry this all-out war for power could disenfranchise minority voters and erode democratic principles, setting a dangerous new precedent. The actions in the nation's two most populous states reflect an era of political warfare unbound by previous standards of fairness.</p>

          <p>Former members of the California Citizens Redistricting Commission are expressing conflicting views on a new proposal to implement a partisan gerrymander of the state's congressional map. The move is intended to counteract a similar Republican-led effort in Texas, but it would discard the fair maps the independent commission painstakingly created. Some commissioners, while proud of their non-partisan work, see the gerrymander as a necessary "extraordinary measure" to protect national democracy in the current political climate. Others are ambivalent, questioning the high cost of a special election and the precedent of abandoning principles of fairness.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to decide on a case that could grant federal immigration agents broad authority to stop and question Latinos in Southern California based on "reasonable suspicion." The Trump administration is appealing a lower court's order that limited agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like ethnicity, speaking Spanish, or working in certain jobs. The administration argues that the high prevalence of undocumented immigrants in the area justifies a lower bar for suspicion. Immigrant rights advocates warn that a ruling in favor of the government would effectively sanction racial profiling and create a "dragnet" affecting millions of citizens and legal residents.</p>

A recent example is his move to eliminate mail-in voting, an idea reportedly reinforced by Russian President Vladimir Putin during their summit in Alaska. Critics argue that this approach makes him vulnerable to manipulation by foreign leaders and breaks with the presidential tradition of separating personal politics from international diplomacy. This conflation is also evident in his approach to trade, immigration, and his public criticisms of his predecessor, Joe Biden, in front of foreign dignitaries.</p>

          <p>Germany is set to build a national memorial in Berlin to honor the victims of the communist dictatorship that ruled East Germany from 1949 to 1989. The project, approved by parliament in 2019, is finally expected to receive funding, allowing a design competition to launch. Victims' associations have described the memorial as "long overdue," providing recognition for the suffering of hundreds of thousands who were imprisoned or killed for their opposition to the authoritarian regime. The site is intended not only as a place of remembrance but also as an educational hub to highlight the crucial differences between dictatorship and democracy.</p>

          <p>Argentina's national rugby team, the Pumas, achieved a landmark 29-23 victory over New Zealand, marking their first-ever home win against the All Blacks. In front of an ecstatic Buenos Aires crowd, Argentina capitalized on New Zealand's ill-discipline, which saw three players sent to the sin-bin. Tries from Juan Martin Gonzalez and Gonzalo Garcia, combined with crucial kicking from Santiago Carreras, sealed the historic win. This victory is the Pumas' fourth overall against the All Blacks in 41 test matches, breaking a home-field drought that dated back to their first official match in 1985.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened its new Wonsan Kalma coastal resort, a project central to Kim Jong Un's tourism ambitions, with Russian tourists among the first international visitors. A recent visitor described a tightly controlled experience, with constant accompaniment by guides and guards, and strict rules against interacting with locals or photographing certain areas. Despite the restrictions, she enjoyed the immaculate and nearly empty beaches of the resort, which was built near a missile testing site. The resort's construction has been criticized by human rights groups over allegations of forced labor and harsh working conditions for North Koreans.</p>

          <p>Famed boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. will stand trial in Mexico on allegations of ties to the Sinaloa Cartel and arms trafficking, with a court granting a three-month extension for further investigation. His lawyer has dismissed the claims as speculation. Chávez Jr. was arrested in Los Angeles in July for immigration violations before being deported to Mexico, where an arrest warrant was pending. The investigation stems from a 2019 U.S. complaint against the cartel and involves several associates of the criminal organization. If convicted, the boxer could face a prison sentence of four to eight years.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to overhaul the asylum appeals system in an effort to accelerate case processing and reduce the number of migrants housed in hotels. A new independent body staffed by adjudicators will be created to hear appeals more quickly than the current court system, where the average wait time is over a year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper acknowledged "unacceptable delays" in the appeals process, which currently has a backlog of 51,000 cases. The move comes amid increasing public and political pressure on the government to end its costly reliance on hotels for asylum seeker accommodation.</p>
