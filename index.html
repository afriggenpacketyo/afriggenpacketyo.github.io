          <p>Data from the first five months of the second Trump administration reveals that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests have surged by 120% compared to the same period under the previous administration. A CBS News analysis shows the majority of these 109,000 arrests were concentrated in southern and border states like Texas, Florida, and California. Experts attribute this geographic focus to factors like local law enforcement cooperation and the demographics of immigrant communities. The data also indicates that most individuals arrested were from Latin American and Caribbean countries, aligning with broader immigration trends.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Study Reveals Potatoes Evolved from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 21:07:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered that the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through an ancient hybridization event. A study published in the journal Cell explains that this interbreeding combined a crucial gene from the ancient tomato with genetics from a non-tuber-producing Chilean species. This genetic combination was necessary for the potato to develop its characteristic starch-rich tubers. The finding solves a long-standing puzzle about the starchy vegetable's origins and demonstrates how hybridization can lead to the emergence of new species with novel traits.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News investigation has exposed China's ongoing practice of buying sanctioned Iranian oil by utilizing a "dark fleet" of tankers in international waters. These ships engage in clandestine ship-to-ship oil transfers, often with their identification transponders turned off to evade U.S. sanctions. The trade, which primarily occurs off the coast of Malaysia, is a significant source of revenue for Iran, potentially funding its nuclear program. Despite increased U.S. sanctions, this illicit activity is reportedly increasing, as China does not recognize the unilateral U.S. measures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed an executive order raising tariffs on a range of Canadian goods from 25% to 35%, escalating trade tensions between the two nations. The White House officially cited Canada's perceived inaction on cross-border fentanyl trafficking as the reason for the hike. However, President Trump also linked the decision to Canada's recent recognition of a Palestinian state. This move places Canada in a difficult economic position, as approximately 75% of its total exports are sent to the United States, and officials had warned of potential counter-levies.

          <p>London's Heathrow Airport has unveiled a £49 billion proposal for a major expansion, including the construction of a third runway and a new terminal. The airport's CEO argues the project is urgently needed to address capacity issues and would be privately financed, boosting the UK economy. The plan is supported by business groups and the government, who see it as vital for global connectivity and trade. However, it faces strong opposition from environmental organizations, local residents, and London's mayor due to concerns about increased noise, air pollution, and climate impacts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reports indicate that Taiwan is facing demands from Washington to commit to a substantial investment package, potentially between $300-400 billion, to avoid a looming 32% U.S. tariff. This move is seen as an effort by the U.S. to secure concessions similar to those made by Japan and South Korea, which qualified them for a lower 15% tariff rate. The potential investment, equivalent to four years of Taiwan's central government budget, has sparked anxiety on the island. Analysts suggest this pressure may be part of a broader U.S. strategy to manage regional tensions while negotiating trade with Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is considering a special election this November to ask voters to approve new congressional maps, a move aimed at countering President Trump's efforts to redraw districts in Republican-controlled states. Newsom framed the potential gerrymandering of California as a direct response to what he calls a plan to "rig the game" ahead of the midterm elections. Under his proposal, the legislature would create new maps, which voters would then approve to be in effect until 2030. He argued the cost of such an election is "priceless" for preserving democracy.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Make Minor Moves at a Quiet MLB Trade Deadline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 19:30:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a relatively quiet trade deadline, opting for minor additions rather than the blockbuster deals made by their National League rivals. The team addressed its needs by acquiring veteran reliever Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call, without giving up significant prospect capital. The front office expressed confidence in its current roster, arguing it is strong enough to contend for another World Series. This conservative approach contrasts with aggressive moves by competitors like the San Diego Padres and New York Mets, who significantly bolstered their teams for the season's final stretch.</p>

          <h2>FICO CEO Defends Credit Score Pricing Amid Criticism from Federal Regulator</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, Fair Isaac (FICO) CEO Will Lansing defended his company's pricing structure against criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Lansing argued that the cost of a FICO score, at $4.95 for a mortgage, is a very small part of closing costs and is not a barrier to homeownership. His comments follow the FHFA head's sharp critique and a new policy allowing lenders to use a rival score from VantageScore. Lansing maintained that FICO's model is superior and the industry standard, raising safety and soundness concerns about the FHFA's decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant, has postponed its planned closure by 45 days due to a massive outpouring of community support. Since announcing its last day of service, the restaurant has seen hours-long lines of customers wanting a final meal, leading to a dramatic jump in sales. Owner Cedd Moses struck a deal with the landlord to extend service while he actively seeks a new buyer who will respect the landmark's history. While grateful for the surge, Moses noted the business model remains challenging and it is unlikely Cole's will remain open indefinitely.</p>

          <p>After an 18-month endeavor to forge a career in American football, Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has announced he is leaving the NFL to return to rugby union. The 24-year-old had spells with the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars through the International Player Pathway program but never played in a regular-season game. In a social media post, Rees-Zammit called his time in the NFL a great experience but stated it was time to come home and do what he does best. Before his departure, he had earned 32 caps for the Wales national rugby team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After months of negotiations and threats, the Trump administration has established a new global trade landscape, imposing tariffs on numerous countries while securing deals with others. This approach has avoided the immediate financial panic of earlier announcements but has fundamentally shifted global trade dynamics, creating a new normal of higher import duties for goods entering the U.S. While the White House claims victory, analysts note the long-term repercussions are unclear. The new regime could raise prices for U.S. consumers and prompt long-time allies to form new economic alliances, potentially undermining America's central role in global trade.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Colombia's government has reported a significant 43% increase in deforestation in 2024 compared to the previous year, reversing a recent downward trend. The Amazon rainforest was the most affected area, accounting for over 65% of the total 113,608 hectares of forest destroyed. Authorities attribute the spike to factors including land-grabbing for cattle ranching, illegal construction, the cultivation of illicit crops like coca, and wildfires intensified by climate change. Despite the sharp increase, the overall deforestation level remains below the 2021 baseline, though the reversal has raised significant environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>Following design software company Figma's massively successful IPO, four major venture capital firms are holding a collective stake valued at approximately $24 billion. The company's stock soared 250% on its first day of trading, closing with a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion. This outcome is a significant boon for the tech IPO market, which has been sluggish for several years. The successful debut is particularly notable as Figma's planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was previously blocked by regulators, a turn of events that has now proven highly lucrative for its early investors.
