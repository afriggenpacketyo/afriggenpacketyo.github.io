          <h2>Singapore's Economy Shows Unexpected Growth in Second Quarter</h2>

          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, surpassing expert forecasts and accelerating from the previous quarter's growth. The manufacturing sector was the primary driver of this expansion, growing by 5.5%. Despite the positive results, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution for the second half of 2025, citing significant global economic uncertainty, particularly regarding U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank had previously loosened monetary policy due to downside risks, but low inflation figures could support further rate cuts.</p>

          <p>Renewed sectarian clashes between Bedouin Sunni tribes and the Druze community in Sweida, southern Syria, have resulted in at least 37 deaths and approximately 50 injuries. The violence, reportedly triggered by a series of kidnappings, marks a significant escalation in a long-running feud between the two groups. This unrest occurs as the new post-Assad government struggles to maintain security and protect minority rights in the ethnically diverse nation. The fighting has disrupted daily life, forcing the closure of a major highway and the postponement of school exams in the region.</p>

          <p>Australia is deepening its strategic partnership with the Philippines through expanded maritime cooperation, including vessel donations, training, and an increased investment of A$11.5 million from 2025 to 2029. This move is part of a broader effort by Australia to navigate its complex geopolitical landscape, balancing its significant trade relationship with China against the need for regional security alliances. Analysts note that as the two nations approach 80 years of diplomatic relations, they are mutually motivated to enhance their partnership. This reflects a strategic alignment in response to regional tensions and a shared interest in maritime security.</p>

          <p>A significant shift is occurring in the academic priorities of Chinese students, with a strong preference for technology and engineering-focused university majors. Fields like information technology and vehicle engineering are now top choices, supplanting previously popular subjects like international trade and urban planning. This trend is heavily influenced by China's state-driven push to bolster its technological capabilities amid intensified competition with the United States. The government's strategic focus on tech advancement is funneling a new generation of students into disciplines deemed critical for the nation's future industrial development.</p>

          <p>Prosecutions for fare evasion on the London Underground have climbed to their highest level in six years, with Transport for London (TfL) taking legal action against 3,691 individuals in 2024-25. While prosecutions on the London Overground decreased, penalty notices on that service hit a record high. TfL describes fare evasion as a crime that deprives the transport system of vital investment, stating it lost an estimated 3.4% of fares across all services. The agency is expanding its enforcement teams to combat the issue and aims to reduce the evasion rate significantly by 2030.</p>

This tradition, which began on July 14, 1795, constitutes the longest such sequence of handwritten meteorological data in the UK and Ireland. Unlike modern automated stations, observers in Armagh continue to manually record daily measurements, providing a unique and invaluable climate record. The data chronicles major weather events over centuries, including the infamous "Night of the Big Wind" in 1839, and has contributed to the development of meteorological science, such as the invention of the cup anemometer.</p>

This strategy aims to expedite military aid by moving equipment from closer European nations, with those countries then purchasing replacements from the U.S. The meeting comes as the Trump administration also considers new sanctions to cripple Russia's oil industry and potentially authorize new funding for Ukraine from seized Russian assets. The moves signal a potential turning point in U.S. strategy to support Ukraine's defense against the ongoing Russian invasion.</p>

While Orban has maintained power for years by targeting liberal values and identifying voter fears, Magyar's center-right movement is gaining traction.

Farmers in Chihuahua, Mexico, argue they cannot give what they don't have, as local reservoirs are at critically low levels.

          <p>Italy's Jannik Sinner has won his first Wimbledon men's singles title, defeating two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a hard-fought final. The 23-year-old world number one recovered after losing the first set to win the match three sets to one. The victory marks a significant moment for Sinner, who became the first Italian singles champion at the prestigious tournament. The final was a highly anticipated rematch of the recent French Open final, where Alcaraz had triumphed. Sinner's win continues the recent Grand Slam dominance shared between himself and Alcaraz, who have won the last seven major titles combined.</p>

          <p>A 69-year-old woman was attacked by a black bear near Comstock, Wisconsin, but was able to call 911 for help. She was subsequently transported to a local hospital, though her current condition has not been released. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR), along with local law enforcement, responded to the scene and found a cub in a nearby tree. Efforts to track and capture the adult bear, which will be euthanized for assessment, are ongoing with several traps set in the area. The DNR reminds the public that bears are common in the area and are typically shy but can become defensive.</p>

The report, released by the Homeland Security Committee, cited a lack of structured communication as the most significant factor, noting that critical information about the shooter was not relayed to Trump's detail in time. It also found organizational mistakes, such as an obstructed view for a countersniper team, and alleged that the agency had denied resources to the detail.

          <p>The revamped FIFA Club World Cup, which concluded with Chelsea's victory over PSG, is being hailed as a major financial and political success for FIFA and its president, Gianni Infantino. The tournament generated over $2 billion in revenue, with Infantino praising the close support from U.S. President Donald Trump, who attended the final. However, the event has drawn criticism from figures like Jürgen Klopp for increasing player workload, an issue exacerbated by extreme heat during some matches. Despite these concerns, FIFA announced new player welfare measures, and the event's conclusion was framed by Infantino as the start of a "golden era."</p>

          <p>In an address, Jim Cramer argued that investors must separate their personal politics from their investment decisions, particularly regarding President Donald Trump. He suggested that despite reasons to dislike Trump, his presidency has coincided with a resilient bull market driven by individual investors, not institutions. Cramer posits that a combination of factors, including the deflationary impact of AI, a pro-business regulatory environment at the agency level, and business-friendly tax changes, are creating a positive environment for stocks. He concludes that while one may dislike the president's methods, the economic and technological forces at play are undeniably bullish for the market. (not investment advice)</p>

The album follows his tour cancellation, split from manager Scooter Braun, and the birth of his first child.
