            <p>A federal judge has ordered the Department of Justice to provide daily updates on its efforts to secure the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from an El Salvador prison. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported due to an administrative error, and the Supreme Court upheld the judge's order to facilitate his return. The judge expressed frustration when the DOJ lawyer couldn't provide Garcia's current location or the steps being taken to bring him back. This legal battle highlights the complexities and potential errors within the U.S. immigration system.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A glitch in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection system is delaying the collection of tariffs on freight shipments, including those from China. The glitch affects the entry code used by U.S. shippers to exempt freight from tariffs, causing confusion and uncertainty for businesses. Customs is advising importers to file cargo release forms separately from financial papers until the issue is resolved, meaning tariffs are not currently being collected. This adds to the existing anxiety among businesses regarding the Trump administration's tariff policies and raises questions about Customs' ability to handle the rapid pace of tariff changes.</p>

            <p>Mortgage rates have surged, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage climbing to 7.1%, the highest since mid-February. This increase is attributed to rising bond yields following President Trump's new tariffs. Despite a cooler-than-expected inflation report, bonds continued to sell off, impacting mortgage rates. Consumer sentiment has also declined, with expectations for inflation rising to the highest level since 1981. This development occurs during the crucial spring housing market, potentially weakening housing activity. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Stephen Miran, a top economic advisor to President Trump, hinted at the possibility of establishing a new global economic order beyond higher tariffs. Miran suggests reforming the international economic system, including potentially devaluing the dollar or compensating the United States for its special role. Some believe this is a primary motivation for Trump's aggressive tariff policy, aiming to strengthen the U.S. position in negotiations for a grand bargain. However, economists debate whether the dollar's reserve currency status is a privilege or a burden.</p>

            <p>General Motors is reducing production of its all-electric BrightDrop delivery vans at its CAMI assembly plant in Ontario, Canada. The plant will be idled for roughly 20 weeks, resulting in the elimination of 500 jobs. GM cited market demand as the reason for the adjustment, stating that it is not related to President Donald Trump's tariffs. The plant will be reduced from two shifts to one shift after the idling period, and battery pack assembly will also be down for several weeks.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump, the oldest US president ever elected at 78, had his first annual medical checkup Friday since returning to power. The examination puts focus on his fitness, which he has repeatedly boasted about while mocking his predecessor, Joe Biden, as unfit. Trump's personal and White House doctors have made outlandish claims about his health in the past. The White House said Trump's physician would give a readout of the physical and provide the full report.</p>

            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield has climbed to its highest level since February 13, driven by trade moves by President Donald Trump causing investors to sell U.S. assets. The move marks a reversal as investors traditionally turn to U.S. debt during turbulent times. The White House is closely monitoring the bond market, with officials acknowledging the market's influence on trade policy decisions. The surge in yields has sparked concerns for the White House, which previously emphasized its focus on low financing costs.</p>

            <p>The Justice Department told a federal judge that it is unable to provide information about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis requested the information after the Supreme Court reaffirmed her directive for the federal government to “facilitate” his release. The Justice Department cited the need to review the Supreme Court's order and argued that foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines. Abrego Garcia's lawyers accused the Trump administration of delaying and flouting court orders.</p>

            <p>An essay discusses how contemporary novels explore questions about identity and the self, particularly for women. The piece references Katie Kitamura's 'Audition' and books from Rachel Cusk, Jenny Offill and Ottessa Moshfegh to demonstrate how writers are imagining women’s lives without the demands of partners and children. The piece argues that although identities are defined by relationships, everyone still has a singular core. The essay also suggests that accessing this core requires carving out time for pursuits that are personal and solitary.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's strategy of using unpredictability and tariffs as negotiating tools is backfiring, causing damage to the U.S. economy and its global reputation. Investors are fleeing U.S. bonds, driving up interest rates and increasing the risk of a financial crisis. While Trump may be aiming for “big, beautiful deals,” his actions are creating chaos and uncertainty, eroding confidence in the U.S. as a stable and reliable economic partner. His willingness to embrace risk and disregard institutional guardrails is exacerbating the situation.</p>

The CDC is advising travelers to certain areas to get a second or early dose of the measles vaccine.
