          <p>Elijah Heacock, a teenager, tragically died by suicide after being blackmailed with an A.I.-generated nude photo of himself. His parents, Shannon Heacock and John Burnett, are now fighting to raise awareness about sextortion scams, which have seen a dramatic rise, with over 500,000 reports targeting minors in the last year alone. Scammers are using increasingly sophisticated methods, including A.I., to create explicit images and blackmail victims. Organizations like Thorn are developing solutions, and laws like the "Take It Down" Act aim to combat the spread of such images online. </p>

          <p>Karla Flores, a young woman experiencing double vision, was diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, but an MRI revealed a second tumor on her spine. Dr. Mohamed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center developed a novel surgical plan to remove the spinal tumor through her eye socket, a technique he called the "third nostril" approach. The procedure, involving facial plastic surgeon Dr. Kalpesh T. Vakharia and head and neck surgeon Dr. Andrea Hebert, took 20 hours and successfully removed the tumor without leaving external scars. Flores is now recovering and cancer-free, and Labib hopes the technique can be used for other difficult-to-reach tumors.</p>

          <p>Promising mRNA HIV-vaccine candidates have encountered a setback as some participants in clinical trials developed rashes and chronic hives. This has slowed down research efforts as scientists investigate the cause, with the Trump administration's anti-vaccine stance and funding cuts further complicating the situation. Despite the challenges, researchers remain hopeful that a solution can be found, potentially through tweaking the vaccine recipe or combining mRNA with other technologies. The situation highlights the delicate balance between minimizing side effects and generating an effective immune response to combat HIV.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Angela Duckworth suggests that instead of banning AI, educators should teach students how to use it effectively. Duckworth recommends that students use AI to explore concepts, ask follow-up questions, and understand how chatbots reach their conclusions. Billionaire Mark Cuban echoes this sentiment, stating that schools need to adapt to AI's availability and teach students how to ask the right questions. Research indicates that students who use AI to assist with tasks like writing cover letters produce stronger work, provided they critically review the AI's output. </p>

If behind on savings, strategies like delaying retirement, downsizing, and living frugally can help catch up.

          <p>Lyft is under pressure from activist investor Engine Capital to undergo a strategic review, improve capital allocation, and eliminate its dual-class share structure. Despite operational and financial improvements under CEO David Risher, Lyft's share price has decreased, partly due to its duopoly with Uber and suboptimal capital allocation. Engine Capital suggests a strategic acquisition could help Lyft scale and diversify, with potential acquirers including DoorDash and automotive companies. The company has increased its share repurchase authorization to $750 million, but more aggressive repurchases are needed to counter dilution. (not investment advice)</p>

Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) is collecting DNA from individuals, regardless of criminal accusations, and adding it to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (Codis). The practice has led to a massive expansion of genetic surveillance, with over 133,000 migrant teens and children, some as young as four, having their DNA collected.

          <p>The Atlantic argues that the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise initially thrived due to its lack of strict continuity and consistent lore, allowing directors to imprint their unique styles on each film. Early installments, particularly those directed by Brian De Palma and John Woo, showcased bold authorial visions and challenged genre conventions. Later films, helmed by J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird, further demonstrated the franchise's adaptability through tonal experimentation. The author contrasts this approach with the current trend of cinematic universes and interconnected storylines, suggesting that the newer films suffer from a rigid adherence to franchise building.</p>
