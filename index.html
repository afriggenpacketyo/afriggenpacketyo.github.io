          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court panel has sentenced former president Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after convicting him on multiple counts related to an attempted coup. The charges stem from his efforts to illegally remain in power following his 2022 electoral defeat to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The conviction has deepened political divisions within Brazil, with Bolsonaro's lawyers vowing to appeal the decision to the full 11-justice court. Bolsonaro, who remains a powerful political figure, is the first former Brazilian president to be convicted of attempting a coup.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the fatal shooting of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, members of the U.S. Congress are scaling back outdoor events and rethinking security protocols due to rising concerns about political violence. Several lawmakers from both parties have postponed rallies or moved press conferences indoors out of an abundance of caution. The incident has shaken Capitol Hill, with politicians expressing fear for their safety and acknowledging that the nature of public engagement may need to change in the current high-threat environment. The suspect in Kirk's killing, who reportedly fired from a rooftop, remains at large.</p>

          <p>Daniel Biss, the Democratic mayor of Evanston, Illinois, and a congressional candidate, has publicly defended his actions to impede federal immigration enforcement operations in his city. Amid a DHS enforcement surge in the Chicago area, Biss revealed he ordered the city's license plate reader cameras to be turned off to prevent data sharing with federal agencies. He framed his actions as a necessary step to protect residents from what he described as potential attacks by ICE personnel. Biss's stance highlights the ongoing conflict between local sanctuary policies and federal immigration law.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby publicly predicted that budget carrier Spirit Airlines is on a path to go out of business, stating that its discount model is no longer sustainable. Kirby's comments come after Spirit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in a year, struggling with weak demand and high operational costs. He criticized the ultra-low-cost model for relying on fees and creating a negative customer experience. Spirit Airlines has recently cut numerous destinations as it faces increased competition from other carriers in the challenging airline industry.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate President Trump at a Florida golf course, forfeited his right to continue his opening statement after the judge cut him off for irrelevant and rambling remarks. Representing himself, Routh spoke about Adolf Hitler and global conflicts instead of addressing the charges against him. Prosecutors allege that Routh meticulously planned the attack and was thwarted by a Secret Service agent who spotted him in the bushes before he could fire. The trial proceeds as concerns over political violence grow following other recent attacks.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from a bipartisan chorus of current and former U.S. presidents and prominent political figures. President Trump, who was close to Kirk, blamed the killing on rhetoric from the "radical left," while figures like former Presidents Biden, Obama, and Bush called the act of violence reprehensible and out of place in a democracy. The reactions highlight a rare moment of unity in denouncing political violence, although the article also notes that partisan tensions flared on the House floor during an attempt to honor Kirk.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike targeting Hamas officials in Doha, Qatar, has severely shaken the long-standing security arrangements between the U.S. and its Persian Gulf allies. The attack, which occurred near a major U.S. airbase, has led Gulf leaders to question the effectiveness of the American security umbrella they have relied on for decades. Qatari officials expressed outrage, noting they had hosted the Hamas office at Washington's request. The incident has created a united front among Gulf states and threatens to undermine U.S. efforts to build a regional coalition against Iran.</p>

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk at an open-air event at Utah Valley University has prompted a close examination of the security protocols that were in place. Experts note that securing outdoor venues is inherently difficult, as standard measures like bag checks and metal detectors are often not feasible. While six local police officers and Kirk's private security team were on site, the suspect was able to fire from a rooftop, exploiting a vulnerability common to such events. The attack underscores the significant challenges in protecting public figures in open, accessible spaces.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian software engineer at Amazon has been suspended with pay after he posted messages on internal Slack channels protesting the company's work with the Israeli government. The engineer, Ahmed Shahrour, criticized Amazon's involvement in Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint cloud computing contract with Google to provide AI and data infrastructure to Israel. This incident reflects a growing trend of activism among tech workers at major companies who are publicly opposing their employers' business dealings with the Israeli military amid the conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The U.S. inflation rate rose to 2.9% in August, creating renewed uncertainty for investors ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates. In this economic climate, the article suggests that investing in gold could be a sensible strategy to hedge against the eroding purchasing power of the dollar. Gold historically tends to maintain or increase its value during inflationary periods, offering a potential safe-haven asset to protect a portion of one's portfolio. However, it is recommended to limit such an allocation to 5-10% of total investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During the first round of the BMW PGA Championship, English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced a bizarre incident that ultimately aided his performance. After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes, witnesses reported seeing two individuals run off with his ball just before play was suspended for weather. When play resumed, the situation allowed him to take a penalty drop rather than play his more difficult provisional ball. Fitzpatrick believes the unusual event saved him at least one shot, contributing to his six-under-par round.</p>

The DOJ is seeking a jury trial, monetary damages, and a court order to force Uber to modify its policies.

          <p>The conviction of former President Jair Bolsonaro for attempting a coup represents a historic turning point for Brazil's young democracy. For the first time, a former leader has been held criminally responsible for trying to subvert an election, a verdict seen by critics as essential for setting a precedent against future anti-democratic actions. The trial, which was live-streamed and captivated the nation, has also exacerbated the country's deep political polarization. While the ruling is a victory for democratic institutions, Bolsonaro's ultimate punishment is still uncertain pending appeals and potential political maneuvers for amnesty.</p>
