          <p>Mexico's Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero announced that an abandoned ranch in Teuchitl√°n, near Guadalajara, was used by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel for training and recruitment. This statement follows claims that the ranch was an "extermination camp" for missing relatives. Gertz clarified that while bone fragments were found, there is no definitive evidence of human cremations at the site, countering previous reports. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities working to identify the bone fragments and investigate possible "narco-ranches" in the area, after volunteers searching for missing relatives initially discovered the site.</p>

          <p>President Trump celebrated his 100th day in office by highlighting his administration's tariff policies, framing them as a cornerstone of his economic agenda to end the "era of economic surrender." Despite emphasizing tariffs in a Michigan speech, official White House and Treasury Department releases focused on broader economic indicators like job growth and investment. Trump justified tariffs on China as a means to curb job theft, though China has denied ongoing trade negotiations. The president also eased the impact of auto tariffs to aid manufacturers relocating supply chains, indicating some flexibility in his trade policies.</p>

          <p>Australia's first-quarter inflation held steady at 2.4%, a four-year low, slightly above Reuters' expectations. The most significant price increases were in housing, education, and food, offset by declines in recreation, culture, and household goods. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has room to cut rates from 4.1%, following a peak of 7.8% in late 2022. Amidst an upcoming election, trimmed mean inflation rose 0.7% quarter-on-quarter and 2.9% annually, influencing potential rate cuts.</p>

FBI directors are required to use government aircraft for security reasons but must reimburse the government for personal flights. The inquiry follows reports of Patel's travel patterns, including flights to Las Vegas and Nashville, prompting calls for investigation into potential misuse of taxpayer dollars.</p>

          <p>President Trump has eased the impact of his new 25% tariffs on the auto industry, allowing automakers to claim reimbursements for relocating supply chains over the next two years. This temporary relief aims to assist American and foreign automakers producing vehicles in the U.S. Automakers can offset a percentage of the suggested retail price, with the offset arrangement stopping after two years. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested a tariff deal with India is near, signaling potential progress in trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Economists warn that President Trump's proposed reciprocal tariffs could halt billions in trade, disrupt global supply chains, and push the U.S. economy into a recession. Despite Trump's claims that tariffs will benefit the U.S., experts argue they are politically motivated and will primarily burden working- and middle-class Americans. Uncertainty surrounding the tariffs has already caused market volatility and disruptions in shipping. Experts suggest that countries may circumvent U.S. markets over time, undermining Trump's goals of onshoring production and securing better trade deals.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has begun prosecuting migrants for entering a newly declared military buffer zone along the border with Mexico. At least 28 migrants were charged in federal court in Las Cruces, New Mexico, for crossing into the militarized zone. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the zone is the start of a plan to extend the buffer along the border, treating it as a military base. The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico expressed concerns about the militarization of borderlands communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release congressionally approved grant money to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a news organization providing independent reporting in countries with limited press freedom. Judge Royce C. Lamberth criticized the administration's attempts to withhold funds and impose new conditions on the grant agreement, which would have allowed Trump officials to control the outlet's board and programming. The judge defended the judiciary's nonpartisan nature and emphasized that Congress had ordained the funds for the news organization.</p>

Chinese leaders hope the new law will boost morale as the economy relies more on domestic dynamism amid a trade war with the US.

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders walking back some tariffs for carmakers, removing levies that Ford, General Motors, and others complained would raise production costs and squeeze profits. The changes modify tariffs so carmakers paying a 25% tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, such as those on steel and aluminum. Carmakers will also qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of imported components, phased out over two years. Despite the concessions, analysts warn that administration policies will still add thousands of dollars to car prices.</p>
