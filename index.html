        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trading in shares of Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings was suspended after Canadian firm Alimentation Couche-Tard officially withdrew its $47 billion acquisition offer. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the bid. The Canadian convenience store operator had previously increased its offer to approximately $18.19 per share, but stated it could not proceed without genuine cooperation from the Japanese company. This development follows Seven & i's rejection of earlier bids, which it claimed significantly undervalued the company and its assets.</p>

The deceased was a 61-year-old man, and the victims included a child as young as seven. According to police, injuries ranged from burns to being knocked unconscious, with all survivors transported to local hospitals for treatment. This incident marks at least the third time in the past month that people have been struck by lightning in the tri-state area, highlighting the dangers of recent severe weather patterns.</p>

          <p>A recent federal raid on a Nebraska meat processing facility, which resulted in the arrest of over 70 employees, has highlighted significant flaws in the government's E-Verify system. The business owner, Gary Rohwer, believed he was compliant with the law by using the system, which is designed to confirm employment eligibility. However, experts state the system primarily vets documents rather than people, making it susceptible to identity theft and easy to fool. A Homeland Security official described the business as a victim in a criminal investigation targeting identity theft, not civil immigration enforcement, underscoring the system's ineffectiveness.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. Sources indicate she was given a memo stating her dismissal was pursuant to the president's powers under Article 2 of the Constitution. Comey was a notable prosecutor who helped lead the cases against Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and more recently, the prosecution of Sean "Diddy" Combs. Her father, James Comey, was famously terminated as FBI director by President Trump in 2017, adding a layer of political context to her dismissal.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly rebuked President Trump for federalizing the state's National Guard troops in response to anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles, urging the president to "grow up." Newsom described the deployment as a costly and theatrical display of strength, accusing Trump of using service members as political pawns. He is demanding the return of control over the troops to the state, arguing they are needed for wildfire control and counter-narcotics operations. A White House spokesperson responded by criticizing Newsom's policies and defending the president's actions as necessary for community safety.</p>

          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula was canceled after a powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast. The quake, which occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, initially triggered a more severe tsunami warning, prompting evacuations in coastal towns like Seward. Authorities later downgraded the alert to an advisory, as officials determined that the shallow depth of the earthquake meant large, widespread waves were not expected. While the quake was felt across the region and followed by multiple aftershocks, no major damage or inundation was reported, bringing relief to the area.</p>

          <p>The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at preventing thousands of veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure, addressing a gap left by the VA's abrupt termination of a previous assistance program. The new legislation will allow veterans who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments to move the missed payments to the end of their loan term. This makes their loan current and allows them to resume regular payments, providing a stable alternative to foreclosure or unaffordable loan modifications. The measure, which now awaits the president's signature, has been praised by veterans' groups and the mortgage industry as a critical fix.</p>

          <p>President Trump reportedly asked a group of House Republicans if he should fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with many in the room voicing approval. The president later confirmed the conversation, stating he discussed the "concept of firing him" but considers himself more conservative on the matter. The discussion highlights Trump's escalating dissatisfaction with Powell over the Fed's interest rate policy, which he deems too restrictive. This move raises legal questions, as federal law permits a Fed chair's removal only "for cause," and such an action could severely destabilize financial markets and undermine the central bank's traditional independence.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has sued the Trump administration, targeting the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA for unlawfully terminating a key disaster mitigation program. The lawsuit argues that the executive branch overstepped its authority by shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a decision the states contend rests with Congress. The BRIC program provided crucial federal funding for projects like stormwater control and elevating buildings in flood-prone areas. The states claim its termination jeopardizes projects years in development and leaves communities more vulnerable to natural disasters, seeking an injunction to block the reallocation of the funds.</p>

The drop was worse than economists' expectations and was driven by significant decreases in shipments to key partners, with exports to the U.S. falling 11.4%. This economic pressure comes as Japan faces a 25% "reciprocal tariff" from the U.S. set to begin in August, with no trade deal breakthrough in sight. The crucial automobile sector has been hit hard, with exports to the U.S. plummeting by 26.7%, threatening the stability of Japan's export-reliant economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A package of cryptocurrency regulation bills has stalled in the House for a second day due to opposition from a bloc of conservative Republicans. The legislative stalemate highlights deep divisions within the Republican party on how to approach digital asset regulation, undermining what had been billed as "Crypto Week." Despite last-minute negotiations and an intervention from President Trump to rally support, new opposition emerged from lawmakers who disagreed with changes made to appease the original holdouts. The impasse raises serious doubts about whether Congress can pass any meaningful crypto legislation in the near future, creating continued uncertainty for the industry.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama have publicly addressed and humorously dismissed persistent rumors about their marriage being in trouble. Appearing together on a podcast, the couple joked about the speculation, which had been fueled by Barack Obama attending several high-profile events alone. Michelle Obama clarified that at this stage in her life, she feels free to make her own decisions about her schedule. She reaffirmed the strength of their relationship, stating there has never been a moment she considered leaving her husband, putting a united and public end to the unfounded rumors.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that he had spoken with Coca-Cola and that the company agreed to start using real cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup in its drinks sold in the U.S. However, Coca-Cola has not confirmed this change, issuing a vague statement that appreciated the president's enthusiasm and promised details on new offerings soon. While Coke sold in many other countries already uses cane sugar, a switch in the U.S. could negatively impact American corn farmers. The Corn Refiners Association immediately criticized the potential move, warning it would cost U.S. jobs and increase foreign sugar imports.</p>

          <p>The Antonov company has provided details about a massive An-124 cargo jet's recent flight out of Kyiv, which had caused a stir as it flew through restricted airspace. The aircraft, which had been undergoing a four-year modernization, flew from a repair facility in Kyiv to the company's new headquarters in Leipzig, Germany. The work to replace Russian-made components with Ukrainian and Western ones continued even during the war. The successful flight of the refurbished jet, emblazoned with the phrase "Be Brave Like Irpin," is being hailed as a symbol of Ukrainian resilience and manufacturing prowess amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling more than 694,000 Bronco Sport and Escape SUVs because of a defect that could cause a fuel injector to crack and leak fuel into the engine compartment, increasing the risk of a fire. The recall affects certain 2021-2024 Bronco Sport and 2020-2022 Escape models equipped with 1.5L engines. As an interim safety measure, Ford dealers will provide a free software update to detect a leak, reduce engine power, and lower engine temperatures if a crack occurs.

          <p>A recent report from Vanguard provides insights into the average American's retirement savings, showing how balances vary by age and income. The article uses this data to emphasize the importance of consistent contributions and leveraging employer-sponsored benefits. A key strategy highlighted is contributing enough to receive the full employer match, as a vast majority of plans offer this feature. The article illustrates how even small increases in contributions to meet the match threshold can result in substantially larger retirement nest eggs over a long-term investment horizon, potentially adding hundreds of thousands of dollars to final savings.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the economic principle that tariffs are effectively a tax paid by consumers in the importing country. Since the Trump administration implemented broad tariffs on goods from most of the world, a key question has been when and how American consumers would feel the financial impact. The piece explains that while the tariff rates have fluctuated, they have remained high on nearly all imported goods, leading to increased costs for businesses. These costs are often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for everyday products, meaning many Americans are likely already paying for the trade policy.</p>

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed confidence that the agreement would end the "horrifying situation" quickly. In response, Syria's foreign ministry welcomed the U.S. and Arabian efforts to resolve the crisis peacefully, and Syrian troops have reportedly begun withdrawing from Suweida city.</p>

In 2022, a spreadsheet with personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had sought relocation was accidentally leaked, putting them at risk from the Taliban. To mitigate the damage, the government secretly established the Afghanistan Response Route (ARR) to evacuate those affected without informing them of the breach. To date, around 900 people and their families have been relocated through the scheme, which has cost £400m so far. The full details were suppressed by a super-injunction until a recent court ruling made them public.</p>

          <p>A group of Liberal Democrat MPs, including party leader Sir Ed Davey, have asked the UK's culture secretary to intervene after the Crystal Palace football club was demoted from the Europa League. The demotion was a result of breaching UEFA's multi-club ownership rules, as owner John Textor also holds a majority stake in French club Lyon, who also qualified for the competition. The MPs called the punishment "disgraceful" and "disproportionately punitive," arguing it raises serious questions about the fairness and transparency of football governance. The club missed a deadline to restructure its ownership to comply with the rules.</p>

After years of fanning the flames of conspiracy, Trump's recent dismissal of the story as a "hoax" has caused a backlash among his base, who he conditioned to distrust official narratives. The story's power lies in its blend of known facts and genuine mystery, capturing the interest of a wide audience beyond the political fringe. The administration's handling of the situation, including a reversal on releasing a supposed "client list," has only fueled more suspicion and chaos.</p>

This change will empower German authorities to investigate and disrupt smuggling operations, particularly targeting warehouses used to store small boats intended for dangerous Channel crossings.

          <p>An attempt by Nebraska lawmakers to repeal a state law that bans people with drug convictions from receiving federal food assistance has narrowly failed. The ban is a legacy of the "war on drugs" era, and Nebraska remains one of the few states that still enforces this lifetime prohibition on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for this population. Proponents of repealing the ban argue that it creates a significant barrier to successful reentry into society for former offenders, hindering their ability to find stability and avoid recidivism. The failure to pass the reform means the restrictive policy will remain in place.</p>
