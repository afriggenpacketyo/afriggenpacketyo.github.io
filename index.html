          <p>Intense storms brought flash flooding to the U.S. Northeast, severely impacting over 50 million people and causing major disruptions to New York City's transportation system. Floodwaters were seen rushing into subway stations, and major highways like the Cross Bronx Expressway were blocked. In response to the dangerous conditions and heavy rainfall, which reached up to four inches per hour in some areas, New Jersey's governor declared a state of emergency. The National Weather Service issued life-threatening flood warnings for multiple cities, urging residents to stay indoors and avoid travel.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding economists' predictions and easing pressure on the government for immediate large-scale stimulus. Despite the strong GDP figure, other indicators point to underlying fragility, including a slowdown in retail sales growth and a deepening slump in real estate investment. Industrial output, however, showed robust expansion. While the government's 5% annual growth target appears achievable, economists remain cautious, citing insufficient domestic demand and external uncertainties from trade tensions with the U.S. as significant headwinds.

          <p>A joint report from the World Health Organization and UNICEF has revealed that over 14 million children globally were entirely unvaccinated in 2024. The report highlights that childhood vaccination rates in Europe and Central Asia have either stagnated or declined. UN officials attribute this alarming trend to the spread of misinformation and significant cuts to international aid, which have created widening coverage gaps. This situation leaves millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases, a reality that UNICEF's chief described as a concern for everyone.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it expects to resume selling its H20 AI chips to China, stating that the U.S. government has provided assurances that the necessary licenses will be granted. The sales of these chips, specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls, had been halted in April. This development follows a preliminary trade agreement between Washington and Beijing and increased lobbying by Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, who argued that restrictions were harming American tech leadership. Huang also recently met with President Trump to discuss the administration's goals for job creation and AI leadership.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, Senator Josh Hawley is formally urging DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to declassify all related documents. Hawley's letter emphasizes the need for transparency to preserve public trust, citing what he describes as stonewalling from the Biden-era Secret Service and DHS. The request follows a report from Hawley detailing security lapses and whistleblower allegations of incompetence that allowed the shooter to get a clear shot. Hawley is seeking a complete inventory of materials and a timeline for their public release.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed that nearly 500 metric tons of high-energy biscuits, enough to feed 1.5 million children for a week, be incinerated instead of sent to Afghanistan and Pakistan. The emergency food, purchased for approximately $800,000, is set to expire after repeated requests to ship it were reportedly ignored by new political leadership at USAID. This action comes amid a broader halt of U.S. foreign assistance, and the destruction will cost taxpayers an additional $130,000.

          <p>A group of prominent UK landowners, including wealthy families and charities, has initiated a High Court challenge against the government's 2024 Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act. They argue that the legislation, which aims to make it cheaper and easier for leaseholders to extend leases or buy freeholds, violates their property rights under the European Convention of Human Rights. The claimants contend the law could cause them hundreds of millions in losses and impact their charitable activities. Meanwhile, leaseholders worry the legal battle will stall much-needed reforms, leaving them trapped in unfair agreements.</p>

          <p>The BBC's annual salary report fails to provide a complete picture of its top talent's earnings, as many high-profile stars are not included on the public list. This is because the disclosure requirement only applies to individuals directly employed by the BBC, not those paid through its commercial arm, BBC Studios, or other independent production companies. Consequently, the earnings of stars from popular shows like 'The Traitors,' 'Strictly Come Dancing,' and 'The Apprentice' remain private. This system allows BBC Studios to compete commercially without revealing its talent costs, but it obscures the full extent of spending on top personalities.</p>

          <p>Former Major League Baseball pitcher Daniel Serafini has been found guilty of first-degree murder for the 2021 shooting death of his father-in-law, Robert Gary Spohr. Prosecutors argued the attack was financially motivated, stemming from a dispute over a ranch renovation project. Serafini was also convicted of the attempted murder of Spohr's wife, who survived the attack but later died by suicide. Security footage showed a hooded figure entering the home hours before the attack, and a second defendant pleaded guilty to being an accessory. Serafini now faces a potential life sentence in prison.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record number of shipping containers in June, an 8% increase over the previous year, as businesses rushed to import goods ahead of President Trump's tariff deadlines. Port officials described this as a "tariff whipsaw effect," with volumes surging after a significant slowdown in May. Despite the historic month, executives warned that this is not a traditional peak season surge and expect a sharp drop in cargo volume from August onward if new tariffs are implemented. Importers noted that the escalating trade taxes have already substantially increased their shipping costs. (not investment advice)</p>
