          <p>China states its military activities are in full compliance with international law following a near miss involving a Chinese military aircraft and a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force patrol plane over international waters. Japan has expressed serious concerns to China about the incident, emphasizing the potential for a collision and urging preventative measures to avoid recurrence. The incident involved a Chinese J-15 warplane from the aircraft carrier Shandong, which approached within 45 meters of the Japanese MSDF P-3C patrol plane, raising alarms about flight safety in the region. Japan conveyed its concerns through diplomatic and defense channels, underscoring the need for continued communication at various levels. The situation has prompted heightened vigilance from Japan regarding increased Chinese military activity in the Pacific. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles is under curfew for a second night following nearly a week of unrest sparked by US immigration raids, with multiple arrests made for curfew violations and other offenses. The protests were triggered by President Donald Trump's immigration policies, which Mayor Karen Bass described as provoking fear and panic among residents. The deployment of 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines aims to quell the unrest, with some National Guard troops authorized to detain individuals until police arrive. The escalating situation has led to a political clash between the federal government and state officials, with accusations of power grabs and assaults on democracy. </p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals how ticket touts made millions by exploiting loopholes and allegedly receiving assistance from staff at major ticketing companies. Prolific touts like Peter Hunter and Maria Chenery-Woods used fraudulent practices to bypass ticket restrictions and resell them at inflated prices on resale sites. Former staff at Ticketmaster-owned resale sites claim they worked closely with touts, offering financial incentives and developing software to facilitate bulk ticket sales. While Ticketmaster denies involvement in illegal activities, the investigation raises concerns about potential collusion between ticketing companies and touts before the company shut down its resale sites in 2018. </p>

          <p>Marines are expected to join the National Guard in Los Angeles within 48 hours to support efforts to manage ongoing protests. Approximately 2,800 service members, including 2,100 National Guard troops and 700 Marines, have been deployed to the region. The Marines have received training in de-escalation and crowd control, and will operate under Task Force 51 to protect federal personnel and property. While they can detain individuals in specific circumstances, they are required to transfer custody to civilian law enforcement personnel, emphasizing their role in protection rather than law enforcement. </p>

          <p>Lady Diana Brittan, the widow of former Home Secretary Lord Leon Brittan, has criticized the decision to drop an investigation into the officer who led an inquiry into false sexual assault claims against her late husband. She expressed that the misconduct proceedings against Met Police officer Steve Rodhouse being dropped has undermined her trust in the Met and the police watchdog. Lord Brittan was falsely accused of being part of a paedophile ring, and the investigation into these claims cost the police Â£2.5m. Lady Brittan feels her husband's legacy has been permanently tarnished, despite his name being cleared after his death. </p>
