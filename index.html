            <p>The Department of Justice and the U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of 45,000 pounds of cocaine, valued at over $500 million, in Port Everglades, Florida. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the bust saved lives and protected the public, linking the shipments to the CJNG and Sinaloa cartels. The Coast Guard utilized drones, aircraft, and ships in the operation, which resulted in the arrest of 11 individuals. FBI Director Kash Patel vowed to dismantle the cartels' operations with a new DOJ leadership approach, highlighting interagency collaboration involving the Coast Guard, Department of Defense, and DOJ assets.</p>

            <h2>Trump Tariffs May Lead to Freight Abandonment at Ports</h2>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Businesses are concerned that President Trump's new tariffs, reaching the highest rates in a century, could result in freight being abandoned at ports as companies struggle to pay import duties. Rick Muskat, president of Deer Stags, estimates his tariff costs will increase significantly, impacting his ability to pay suppliers and potentially raising consumer prices. Supply chain consultant Joseph Esteves notes a trend of shippers looking to reject freight due to insufficient working capital. While goods already en route will not face the new tariffs immediately, the long-term impact on manufacturing supply chains remains a significant concern, with some companies hoping for a change in administration to rescind the tariffs.

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>President Trump's trade policies are driven by a belief that trade deficits represent a 'loss' for the U.S., leading him to impose tariffs on countries with which the U.S. has a deficit. This approach has been criticized by economists who argue that it ignores the benefits of international trade and specialization. Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariff levels were determined by the size of the trade deficit with each country, disproportionately impacting manufacturing hubs like Vietnam. Critics also point out that the policy overlooks the U.S.'s advantage in service exports and creates uncertainty for businesses, potentially hindering investment in domestic manufacturing.</p>

            <p>President Trump is pressing House Republicans to back the Senate-approved budget plan, which is crucial for extending his tax cuts set to expire this year, despite opposition from some GOP members who favor deeper spending cuts. At a fundraiser, Trump urged Republicans to "close your eyes and get there," emphasizing the importance of unity within the party to enact his agenda. The Senate-adopted plan sets relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts but allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending, while also relying on a budget scoring method that does not count the cost of extending the Trump tax cuts as new spending. Fiscal hawks have criticized the Senate-backed plan, calling the levels currently outlined in the resolution "anemic".</p>

The new government has already outlined plans for increased defense spending and infrastructure investment, a notable shift in the CDU's fiscal stance.

            <p>President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on foreign nations, particularly China, threaten to significantly increase the price of Apple iPhones. The White House's decision to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. could raise the price of an iPhone 16 Pro Max by hundreds of dollars. Analyst Dan Ives warns of a "category 5 price storm" for personal electronics, and if Apple were to move production to the U.S., the cost of an iPhone could skyrocket to $3,500. While Apple is exploring manufacturing more iPhones in India to reduce reliance on China, the tariffs are poised to impact consumer prices and potentially disrupt the electronics market.</p>

            <p>President Trump's implementation of reciprocal tariffs on approximately 90 nations has heightened concerns about a global trade war and its potential impact on economic growth. The tariffs, intended to address trade deficits, range from a baseline 10% to as high as 104% on Chinese goods. Economists warn that these tariffs could reignite inflation and prompt retaliatory measures from trade partners, potentially leading to serious recessions. China and the European Union have already announced retaliatory tariffs on American products, escalating trade tensions and increasing uncertainty in the global market. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A coalition of California nonprofits and labor groups is calling for an investigation into OpenAI's plans to restructure as a for-profit company. The petition, sent to the state attorney general, raises concerns about the protection of charitable assets and accuses OpenAI of prioritizing profits for investors and employees. Nonprofit leaders draw parallels to the transition of nonprofit healthcare providers to for-profits in the 1990s. The coalition argues that the transition from a non-profit to for-profit structure would greatly jeopardize the initial goal of the company to develop AI for the benefit of humanity.</p>

            <p>Since President Trump's inauguration, there has been a spike in anti-protest bills across the U.S., seeking to expand criminal punishments for peaceful protests, especially those related to the war in Gaza and the climate crisis. Numerous bills have been introduced in state legislatures and at the federal level, some carrying harsh prison sentences and fines for protesters. Critics warn that these measures threaten to erode First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and assembly. The proliferation of these laws is seen as a response to recent social movements and a broader effort to suppress dissent.</p>

The White House's decision to put additional restrictions on hold came after Nvidia promised new U.S. investments in AI data centers. Despite pressure from lawmakers to impose stricter curbs on cutting-edge technology, the administration's decision is seen as a victory for China, which relies on imports of Nvidia chips to support its AI development.</p>

            <p>Larry Elliott argues that Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 104% tariff on Chinese imports into the US represents a genuine trade war, distinct from past, less consequential trade disputes. Elliott contends that this new protectionist era signals the end of hyper-liberal globalization, leading to slower growth, higher inflation, and a potential global recession. Trump's actions are seen as a challenge to China's economic and geopolitical strength, similar to Reagan's military spending during the Cold War. However, Elliott suggests that Trump's strategy also reflects a response to a policy vacuum left by the left's inability to address the failings of hyper-liberalism.</p>
