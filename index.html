State-run company Codelco has halted all operations at the world's largest underground copper mine as about 100 rescuers work to reach the missing men.

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has stated that she no longer identifies as Nigerian, despite her ancestry and having grown up there. In a podcast interview, she explained that while she is Nigerian by ancestry, her identity is British, as most of her life has been in the UK. Badenoch, who was born in the UK, returned at age 16 due to Nigeria's deteriorating political and economic situation. She also mentioned that her early experiences in Nigeria shaped her dislike of socialism and that she has not experienced meaningful racial prejudice in the UK.</p>

The conflict had resulted in at least 43 deaths and displaced over 300,000 people. This follows previous Nobel nominations for Trump from Israel and Pakistan for his diplomatic interventions.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of Climate suggests a connection between decadal solar cycle activity and a pattern of increased summer rainfall in northern China. Researchers found that changes in the sun's magnetic cycle influence the positioning of the monsoon rain belt over the country. This phenomenon contributes to a "south drought and north flooding" pattern observed in recent years. The findings could be crucial for improving long-term climate predictions and flood season preparedness in the region.</p>

          <p>William Beach, the former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner who served under President Trump, has strongly condemned the firing of his successor, Erika McEntarfer. Beach called the dismissal "totally groundless" and warned that it "sets a dangerous precedent" that undermines the credibility of vital federal economic statistics. In a statement, he urged Congress to investigate the matter and warned that politicizing economic data could destroy public trust. Trump defended his decision, stating he needs "people we can trust" in such roles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was expected to attend a major fundraiser for a pro-Trump super PAC, according to sources. The event took place just one day after President Trump publicly sent letters to Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies demanding they lower drug prices in the U.S. to match rates in other countries. The apparent contradiction highlights the complex relationship between the administration and the pharmaceutical industry. Bourla has previously engaged with Trump, notably during the "Operation Warp Speed" COVID-19 vaccine initiative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board hearing has shed light on the fatal midair collision between a regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., which killed 67 people. Key revelations include that the helicopter's altimeter may have been inaccurate, a known issue that was not considered alarming. Investigators also heard that air traffic controllers at the busy airport were under pressure to "make it work," sometimes pushing safety limits. Furthermore, it was revealed that FAA staff had previously raised concerns about the helicopter's flight path, but no action was taken.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are warning of a significant seasonal rise in stingray-related injuries, with daily incidents jumping from an average of one to as many as 15. Officials attribute the increase to calm, warm waters drawing the stingrays closer to shore, combined with hot weather bringing more people to the beach. A specific area near the San Gabriel River, known as "ray bay," is a particular hotspot. To avoid being stung, beachgoers are advised to shuffle their feet in the sand to alert the camouflaged fish of their presence.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages after finding the company partially liable for a 2019 crash involving a car on Autopilot, which resulted in one death and serious injuries. The plaintiffs' lawyers successfully argued that Tesla's driver-assistance system should have prevented the collision, which occurred while the driver was admittedly distracted by his phone. Tesla has vowed to appeal the verdict, calling it "wrong" and arguing that the driver was solely to blame, a stance that could set a precedent for future litigation involving autonomous driving technology.</p>

          <p>An internal analysis by the Trump administration's own Environmental Protection Agency reveals that its plan to roll back greenhouse gas regulations will likely lead to higher gasoline prices. This contradicts the administration's public claims of saving consumers money. The data, cited from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, shows that disincentivizing electric and fuel-efficient vehicles will increase overall demand for gasoline, thus raising prices for all drivers. The analysis also projected the loss of nearly half a million jobs by 2035 as a result of the policy change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order increasing tariffs on imports is expected to raise consumer prices and create prolonged uncertainty for businesses, according to trade experts. With the U.S. effective tariff rate now at its highest in decades, a nonpartisan analysis suggests the average American household could face over $2,000 in additional annual costs. Economists warn that prices for goods like cars, clothing, and furniture are likely to rise as businesses can no longer absorb the increased costs. The tariffs are also expected to reduce product choices for consumers as supply chains are disrupted. (not investment advice)</p>
