          <p>President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, visited a controversial Israeli-backed aid distribution site in Gaza to assess the humanitarian situation. The visit has been criticized as a "media stunt" by some Gazans and humanitarian groups, who point to deadly shootings reported near these sites and argue the aid provided is insufficient to address widespread starvation. The UN has warned of a man-made famine, while a former US officer alleged witnessing indiscriminate force against civilians at the aid points. The visit comes as ceasefire talks remain stalled.</p>

          <p>Actor Gary Busey, 81, has pleaded guilty to one count of criminal sexual misconduct for inappropriately touching a woman at a 2022 horror film convention in New Jersey.

As part of a plea deal, prosecutors dismissed three other charges related to accusations from multiple women at the same event.

The launch, which was delayed by one day due to weather, is carrying a four-person international crew consisting of two NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut. This mission is notable as it includes astronauts who were previously scheduled to fly on Boeing's troubled Starliner, now reassigned to the SpaceX flight. The crew is expected to dock with the station after a 16-hour journey.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly prepared to abandon its effort to sign striker Alexander Isak after Newcastle United rejected an opening bid of £110 million. Newcastle values the 25-year-old Swedish international at approximately £150 million and maintains he is not for sale, despite the player's interest in a move. Isak, who is currently training separately from the Newcastle squad due to a minor injury, has become a key target for Liverpool's manager Arne Slot. The situation leaves the potential high-profile transfer in a state of uncertainty for the summer window.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Department of Energy, intended to justify rolling back major environmental regulations, has been widely condemned by climate scientists as a "farce" filled with misinformation. The report was released to support a proposal to undo the 2009 "endangerment finding," which underpins the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases. Critics state the report cherry-picks data, relies on debunked talking points, and was not peer-reviewed, contrasting it sharply with consensus-based international assessments. The administration's move is seen as part of a broader agenda to promote fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>As extreme heat becomes more common, personal neck cooling fans are growing in popularity, but their actual effectiveness is debatable. These devices work by blowing air across the neck and face, which can enhance the body's natural cooling process of sweat evaporation. However, experts note that in high humidity, this process is less effective, and the fans only cool a small surface area. While they can make a person feel cooler due to the high number of thermal receptors in the face, they may not significantly lower core body temperature, potentially creating a false sense of security.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, annuities offer a guaranteed retirement income stream, but making a smart purchase requires understanding key rules. Financial experts suggest keeping total annual fees below 1% and avoiding deferred annuities unless you can wait at least a decade for the investment to mature. It is also advised to first use guaranteed income to cover essential expenses and to limit your total retirement portfolio allocation in annuities to no more than 25% to maintain diversification. These principles can help retirees avoid common pitfalls and secure a more stable financial future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis of July Jobs Report Shows Gains Concentrated in Healthcare and Social Assistance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A closer look at the weak July jobs report reveals that nearly all net job growth came from the health care and social assistance sectors, which added a combined 73,300 positions. With total nonfarm payrolls growing by only 73,000, the rest of the economy was effectively stagnant or shrinking. Sectors like professional and business services, manufacturing, and government all shed jobs. This heavy reliance on a single sector for growth indicates a broader cooling trend in the labor market and raises concerns about the overall health of the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks fell significantly on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 700 points, as investors reacted to negative economic news. A weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which showed the addition of only 73,000 jobs and major downward revisions for prior months, signaled a hiring slowdown. Market sentiment was further dampened by the Trump administration's announcement of new tariffs on over 60 countries. The combination of a stagnating labor market and escalating trade tensions has increased investor expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy has died in Mount Airy, Maryland, after being swept into a storm drain pipe during heavy rainfall and flooding that drenched the U.S. East Coast.

Bystanders attempted a rescue but were unable to free him against the strong water pressure until after the rain subsided, but it was too late. The incident occurred as severe storms caused widespread flooding, power outages, and travel disruptions across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions.</p>

          <p>Following a weak jobs report, President Donald Trump escalated his public attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, whom he called a "stubborn MORON." In a series of social media posts, Trump demanded an immediate and substantial cut in interest rates. He further suggested that if Powell refuses, the Fed's board should override him, a move that would defy the central bank's long-standing political independence. The attacks come as the administration faces questions about its economic policies and prepares to implement a new wave of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The English Football League is reportedly growing concerned about Sheffield Wednesday's ability to fulfill its fixtures this season due to a severe financial crisis. Under owner Dejphon Chansiri, the club has repeatedly failed to pay player and staff wages on time, leading multiple first-team players to terminate their contracts. With a squad of only 14 players, an embargo on new transfers, and the recent departure of its manager, the club's future in the Championship is in serious jeopardy. Players have been left uninformed about the situation, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the historic club.</p>

          <p>New federal data from the CDC reveals that vaccination rates among U.S. kindergarteners for required vaccines like MMR and polio decreased during the 2024-2025 school year.

This decline in coverage has pushed rates below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity in many areas, increasing the risk of outbreaks of preventable diseases.
