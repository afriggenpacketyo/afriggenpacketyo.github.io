          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 07:02:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is debating whether to discontinue the use of 1 and 2-cent euro coins, following the lead of other European nations. The National Cash Forum, supported by the Bundesbank, suggests that the costs and environmental impact of minting and handling these coins outweigh their necessity. A rounding rule would apply to cash payments, adjusting the total bill to the nearest 5 cents, while electronic payments would remain precise. While Germans traditionally favor cash, a Eurobarometer survey indicates that over 60% of eurozone respondents support eliminating the smallest coins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research suggests that creatine, a popular weightlifting supplement, may be an effective treatment for depression. A recent study in India showed that participants receiving creatine alongside talk therapy experienced greater improvement in their depression symptoms compared to those receiving a placebo. Creatine aids in brain energy metabolism, and prior studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in supplementing traditional depression treatments. This affordable and accessible supplement could offer a valuable option for individuals with limited access to mental health care.</p>

          <p>Sethuraman Panchanathan resigned from his position as head of the National Science Foundation after President Trump cut over 400 active research awards and proposed halving the agency's budget. This action is part of a broader trend where the Trump administration has been targeting the American scientific enterprise, slashing or freezing budgets at various key institutions such as the National Institutes of Health and NASA. The administration's actions have led to confusion and concern, given the importance of scientific research for containing disease, competing with China, and attracting skilled immigrants.</p>

          <p>A group of Nepali-speaking Bhutanese individuals, deported from the US after years of resettlement, are facing statelessness as both Nepal and Bhutan refuse to grant them citizenship. The deportations occurred under President Trump's crackdown on migrants, with the deportees being sent to Bhutan, who then transported them to the India-Nepal border. Nepal has detained some of these individuals for illegal entry, creating a complex situation where they are caught between countries. The US is facing calls to clarify the terms of these deportations, as the deportees were originally refugees expelled from Bhutan in the 1990s.</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge ruled that Bryan Kohberger, charged with the murders of four University of Idaho students, could face the death penalty despite his autism diagnosis. The defense argued that his autism spectrum disorder reduces his culpability and that executing someone with autism would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. However, the judge agreed with prosecutors who argued that only an intellectual disability precludes the death penalty. The judge also ruled that jurors can hear much of the 911 call made by surviving roommates and see text messages they sent around the time of the killings.</p>

          <p>US federal prosecutors have filed a formal notice seeking the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Prosecutors argue Mangione killed Thompson to amplify an ideological message and incite resistance against the health insurance industry. Mangione's lawyer has called the decision to seek the death penalty "barbaric," arguing that the government is defending a broken and immoral healthcare industry. Investigators claim Mangione was motivated by anger towards US health insurance companies and intended to incite violence.</p>

A critical report also accuses the government and regulators of mismanaging risk and investment in the water sector, leading to higher consumer bills and a lack of accountability.</p>

          <p>An independent reanalysis casts doubt on the recent claim of detecting life-associated gases in the atmosphere of planet K2-18b. The new analysis suggests there's too much noise in the data to draw definitive conclusions about the presence of specific gas molecules. This highlights the importance of robust, model-independent detections when claiming biosignatures on distant planets.</p>
