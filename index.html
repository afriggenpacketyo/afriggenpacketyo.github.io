          <p>Thousands gathered in Tehran for a state funeral honoring dozens of senior military officials, including generals from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who were killed in a series of Israeli strikes over 12 days. The ceremony was attended by high-ranking government figures, including President Masoud Pezeshkian, and occurred amidst a fragile ceasefire between the two nations. The strikes were part of Israel's stated effort to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and the event highlights the severe recent escalation in regional tensions.</p>

          <p>While excavating in Lima, Peru, utility workers unexpectedly discovered a well-preserved mummy estimated to be 1,000 years old, predating the Inca Empire. The remains, found just 20 inches underground, are believed to belong to a woman from the Chancay culture and were notable for still having intact dark brown hair. Archaeologists noted that such discoveries are not uncommon in Lima, a city with hundreds of archaeological sites, due to the region's dry desert climate which naturally mummifies remains.</p>

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed imposing international trade restrictions on all eel species, a move that faces strong opposition from Japan. The proposal, submitted under the Washington Convention on endangered species, would require export permits and proof of legal capture for species like the Japanese eel. If adopted, the new regulations would take effect in June 2027, significantly impacting the global eel market and conservation efforts for the endangered fish.</p>
