          <p>Hurricane Erick, the fifth named storm of the Eastern Pacific hurricane season, has intensified into a Category 3 hurricane as it moves toward Mexico. The National Hurricane Center forecasts landfall in the western portion of Oaxaca or the eastern portion of Guerrero early Thursday morning, bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall, and dangerous storm surge. Erick is expected to produce 8 to 12 inches of rain, potentially causing life-threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in steep terrain, with Acapulco, previously devastated by Hurricane Otis, also at risk. Dangerous storm surges are expected to create coastal flooding accompanied by large and destructive waves.</p>

This marks their first trip to the city since Emperor Naruhito's accession in 2019, following visits by his grandfather and parents, who showed deep concern for the survivors.

          <p>The Buss family has reportedly agreed to sell a controlling interest in the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, CEO of Guggenheim Partners, valuing the franchise at $10 billion, making it the most valuable sports franchise globally. Jeanie Buss will retain the title of governor, representing the team in league matters, while Walter, also owner of the L.A. Dodgers and other sports entities, will assume majority ownership. Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers in 1979 for $67.5 million, transforming it into a globally recognized sports franchise with 11 NBA titles since the acquisition, and the Dodgers have also entered a number of high-dollar deals under Walter's tenure.</p>

          <p>Chinese ambassador Xie Feng urged the U.S. to "look at the whole picture" regarding tariffs, arguing that they are "still unreasonably high" and hinder a balanced trade relationship. Speaking at the US-China Business Council, Xie stated that the U.S. goods deficit would not shrink while export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms persist. He emphasized China's willingness to buy more from America but noted restrictions on competitive U.S. products like semiconductors limit potential trade. The U.S. agreed earlier in the month to ease some restrictions in exchange for increased exports of critical minerals from China.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers announced their plans to assist immigrant communities impacted by recent federal immigration raids in the city. This announcement marks the team's first public statement regarding the unrest, which had led to increasing calls for the team to address the situation. Manager Dave Roberts expressed hope that the team could be a positive distraction, while utilityman Kiké Hernández voiced his opposition to the treatment of the community. The Dodgers became embroiled in controversy when a singer sang a Spanish version of the national anthem at a game as a protest against the raids.</p>

          <p>Astrophysicists have discovered that the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), is spinning almost as fast as its maximum rotation rate. Using a new method developed with high-throughput computing and neural networks, researchers analyzed Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data to determine the black hole's properties. The study also revealed that Sgr A*'s rotational axis points towards Earth and that its magnetic field behaves differently than predicted by theory. The findings, detailed in three papers, may lead to a better understanding of black hole physics and the general theory of relativity.</p>

          <p>With increasing U.S. tariffs, businesses are resorting to "tariff engineering," legally modifying products to fit into lower-tariff categories. This involves altering materials, dimensions, or compositions to justify different harmonized system codes. Customs lawyer John Foote notes there is nothing illegal about strategic design choices that result in different tariff classifications and duty rates. Examples include bundling steel and aluminum elements, using cotton instead of synthetic materials, or adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins. This practice allows companies to reduce their duty liability by cleverly navigating the U.S. tariff classification system.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. CEO Eiji Hashimoto stated that U.S. Steel is of growing strategic importance due to higher U.S. tariffs on steel products, which are likely to remain in place. Hashimoto believes that Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel should benefit the U.S. economy, but trade levies alone will not revive its manufacturing sector. Nippon Steel finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary after securing a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, committing to invest around $11 billion by 2028 and maintain the company's headquarters in Pittsburgh.</p>
