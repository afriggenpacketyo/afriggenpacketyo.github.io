          <p>Federal authorities have arrested over 30 individuals, including Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier, in a major investigation into sports rigging and illegal gambling operations tied to La Cosa Nostra. The charges stem from two separate cases: one involving a sophisticated, rigged poker scheme that allegedly stole millions, and another concerning an insider sports-betting conspiracy. The NBA has placed both Billups and Rozier on immediate leave, stating it takes the allegations with the utmost seriousness while cooperating with the investigation. This widespread criminal enterprise has been described by the FBI as one of the most brazen sports corruption schemes in recent history.</p>

          <p>The British government has rejected calls to allocate parliamentary time for a debate on Prince Andrew's royal titles and his taxpayer-funded residence, Royal Lodge. This decision effectively halts a legislative effort to strip him of his dukedom, which was proposed following renewed scrutiny of his connections to Jeffrey Epstein. Downing Street stated that the Royal Family would not want to detract from other important state issues. Despite this, a key parliamentary committee chairman has indicated plans to seek more information about the lease arrangements for Royal Lodge next year.</p>

          <p>The UK government's national inquiry into child sexual exploitation by grooming gangs is facing turmoil, with some survivors demanding the resignation of Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips. Four members of the survivors' panel have quit, accusing Phillips of breaking their trust, and will only rejoin if she is removed from her post. However, a second group of survivors has written to the Prime Minister expressing their continued support for Phillips, highlighting her commitment and impartiality. The government has affirmed its determination to keep her in the role, emphasizing the need for consistency while it searches for a new inquiry chair.</p>

The White House asserted that Zhao was a victim of political prosecution by the Biden administration in its "war on cryptocurrency." Zhao served a four-month prison sentence as part of a multi-billion-dollar settlement with the Justice Department in 2023, which also saw him step down as CEO. The pardon statement declared that the "Biden administration's war on crypto is over," signaling a significant policy shift.</p>

He argued that if Dallas makes the playoffs and wins a game, it will vindicate Jones's strategy of building the team around his quarterback.

          <p>One year after catastrophic floods killed over 230 people in Spain's Valencia region, authorities have found the body of one of the last remaining missing persons. DNA analysis confirmed the remains belonged to a 56-year-old man who was swept away by the floodwaters on October 29 of last year. His body was discovered 19 miles from where he disappeared. The discovery comes as the country prepares to mark the first anniversary of its deadliest flood disaster in decades, which prompted serious questions about the effectiveness of emergency response systems.</p>

          <h2>Essay Argues Conservative Movement on College Campuses is Fueled by Desire for Open Debate</h2>

          <p>A recent Stanford graduate argues in an essay that the real political energy on college campuses today can be found on the right, driven by a rejection of the stifling, offense-averse culture of the left. The author recounts their own journey from progressive to conservative, drawn to campus conservative groups as one of the few places where vigorous debate and intellectual disagreement were encouraged. The article suggests that the appeal of conservatism for many students is less about specific ideologies like Trumpism and more about a hunger for open discourse. This has led to growing interest in conservative student organizations at elite universities.</p>

          <p>Climate scientists are monitoring a severe marine heatwave, known as "the blob," in the north-western and central Pacific Ocean, which could have significant weather implications for North America. In August, temperatures in the northern Pacific were 2.5°C above preindustrial levels. This spike in ocean temperature could lead to more thunderstorms, increased flooding in the Pacific Northwest, and potentially more severe winter weather in the eastern parts of the continent. Experts note that these heatwaves have become more frequent and intense over the last decade, posing risks to marine ecosystems and altering weather patterns.</p>

          <p>A teacher of Axel Rudakubana, the teenager who killed three young girls in Southport, told a public inquiry that she had a "visceral sense of dread" he would use a knife and felt abandoned by other agencies when she sought help. Joanne Hodson, now head teacher at the specialist school Rudakubana attended, described him as the "most unusual" pupil of her career, noting he showed no remorse after being expelled from a previous school for bringing a knife. She testified that her significant concerns about the risk he posed were met with resistance, leaving her school feeling like they were "left holding the baby."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it is quadrupling the tariff-rate quota for beef imported from Argentina to 80,000 metric tons, a move intended to lower record-high U.S. beef prices. This allows Argentina to ship more beef to the United States at a lower duty rate. The decision has angered American cattle ranchers, who argue that increased imports threaten their industry and that the government should be supporting domestic producers instead. The White House maintains it is balancing the need for economic relief for consumers with new support programs for U.S. ranchers.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. government shutdown, active-duty military service members are required to continue performing their duties but will not receive their pay until a funding deal is reached. While a 2019 law ensures all federal employees eventually receive back pay, military pay is not guaranteed without separate legislation, which has not yet passed. Essential civilian defense personnel will also continue to work without pay, while others are furloughed. Financial institutions that serve the military community, such as Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA, are planning to offer no-interest loans to help affected members manage their finances.</p>

          <p>The 74 million Americans who receive Social Security will continue to get their monthly checks during the government shutdown, as the program is covered by mandatory spending that does not require annual approval.

According to the agency's contingency plan, tasks such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and issuing replacement Medicare cards may be halted. The shutdown could also potentially delay the announcement of the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), which is scheduled for mid-October.</p>

The USDA is expected to halt the issuance of new loans entirely. Additionally, homebuyers in flood zones may experience complications, as the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program cannot sell new or renewal policies during a shutdown, potentially delaying closings.</p>

The administration argues that the government should benefit from the success of companies that receive public funds. This potential investment highlights the growing view of quantum computing as a strategically critical technology in the global competition with China. (not investment advice)</p>
