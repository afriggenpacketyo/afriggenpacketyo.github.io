          <p>A 66-year-old woman, Nancy Pexton, has been charged with the murder of Jennifer Abbott, 69, who was found fatally stabbed in her Camden home. Abbott was discovered by her niece and neighbors with tape across her mouth. The Metropolitan Police are investigating whether the murder is linked to a missing diamond-encrusted Rolex watch believed to have been stolen from Abbott's residence, adding a layer of intrigue to the case. Pexton is scheduled to appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court, as authorities piece together the events leading to Abbott's death.</p>

          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a 14% increase following the announcement of a 1.35 billion euro capital raise, backed by the French state and other investors. This capital increase, along with debt refinancing, will support Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. French President Emmanuel Macron emphasized that strengthening Eutelsat's position ensures France's strategic independence and paves the way for Europe's.

The drone, showcased on CCTV 7, features tiny wings and legs, making it suitable for information reconnaissance and special missions.

          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant drop in May, with sales volumes falling by 2.7%, the largest monthly decline since December 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was primarily attributed to a "dismal" performance by supermarkets, which saw reduced sales of alcohol and tobacco as households cut back on spending. Separate figures revealed that government borrowing rose last month, reaching the second-highest level for May since 1993. Despite the recent decline, sales volumes in the three months leading up to May were still up by 0.8% compared to the previous three months.</p>

          <p>AI-generated avatars in China are demonstrating their potential as effective influencers, as evidenced by a recent livestreaming event. Chinese influencer Luo Yonghao and his co-host Xiao Mu used interactive digital avatars based on Baidu's generative AI model to engage with viewers in real-time. The session generated 55 million yuan ($7.65 million) in sales, surpassing Luo's previous livestreaming attempt. The avatars were created using Baidu's AI model, which learned from years of videos to replicate their jokes and style.</p>
