          <p>China's National Defence Ministry has announced that it will hold the "Joint Sea 2025" naval exercise with Russia in August near Vladivostok. Following the drill, some forces will participate in a sixth joint maritime patrol in the Pacific. A ministry spokesperson stated the exercise is part of a planned annual cooperation, is not targeted at any third party, and is unrelated to the current global situation. This announcement coincides with a large-scale U.S.-led military exercise currently underway in the same region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami alerts and evacuations across the Pacific, including in Japan, Hawaii, and the U.S. West Coast. While some areas experienced minor flooding and waves up to 16 feet, major damage and casualties were largely avoided, leading to the downgrading of most warnings to advisories. The powerful quake also appeared to trigger a volcanic eruption on the Kamchatka Peninsula, highlighting the region's intense seismic and volcanic activity.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee voted to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. This decision came despite public pressure from President Trump for rate cuts and was marked by a rare dissent from two Fed governors who favored easing policy. The committee cited elevated economic uncertainty and persistent inflation as key factors, adjusting its assessment of economic growth from "solid" to "moderated" in the first half of the year.

The case, which has remained unsolved for over three decades, hinges on a male DNA profile found at the scene that did not match the initial suspects. Although a promising lead in 2017 with a public database hit turned out to be a false match after more advanced testing, investigators remain optimistic.

          <p>Workers at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, a former nuclear weapons component facility, discovered a radioactive wasp nest during routine monitoring. The nest, found near tanks holding liquid nuclear waste, had radiation levels ten times higher than federal regulations permit. Officials stated there is no danger to the public, as the contamination is likely from residual legacy sources within the secure site and not a new leak. The nest was safely removed and disposed of as radioactive waste, though a watchdog group has called for more information.</p>

          <p>This article outlines the criteria for Americans seeking credit card debt forgiveness as household balances reach record highs. Qualification typically depends on demonstrating genuine financial hardship, such as job loss or major medical expenses, and carrying a significant amount of unsecured debt, often over $7,500. Borrowers who have already fallen behind on payments may have more leverage in negotiations, as creditors prefer a partial settlement to a total loss from bankruptcy. For those who don't qualify, options like credit counseling and debt consolidation are also explored. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A deep-sea voyage has discovered extensive communities of tubeworms and mollusks flourishing at depths over 31,000 feet in the Pacific Ocean's hadal trenches. These extreme environments, characterized by crushing pressure and no sunlight, were previously thought to support only microbial life. Researchers believe these larger creatures survive through chemosynthesis, a process where microbes convert chemical compounds from the seafloor into energy, forming a food web independent of sunlight. The findings challenge existing models of life at extreme limits and suggest such ecosystems may be more common than previously thought.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to maintain its benchmark interest rate has a direct impact on the financial products Americans use daily. Because the Fed held rates steady, variable rates on credit cards will remain near record highs, and rates for auto loans and home equity lines of credit will also stay elevated. Conversely, savers will continue to benefit, as high-yield savings accounts are still offering returns above the rate of inflation. Experts note that mortgage rates, while not directly tied to the Fed's rate, have also remained high due to broader economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The January 29 crash resulted in the deaths of all 64 passengers on the plane and three crew members on the helicopter.
