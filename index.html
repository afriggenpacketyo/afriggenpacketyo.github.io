          <h2>Trump Administration Pauses Social Security Benefit Cuts Over Student Loan Defaults</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This policy change provides older borrowers with more time to become current on their loans and avoid reduced benefit checks. The administration cited its commitment to protecting Social Security recipients, who often rely on fixed incomes, as the reason for the pause. More than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers age 62 and older are in default and likely receiving Social Security benefits. </p>
